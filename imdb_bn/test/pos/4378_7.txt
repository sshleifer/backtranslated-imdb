I can not say that I've enjoyed many things like "Big Lebowski" or "Arizona Rising" and felt somewhat unexpected, but "and brother" is a enjoyable movie that sounds like a good smile and a twinkle of twins, a twisted sense of creativity. The DVD version has the feature, and I learned that the Coenas are very easy to guide their strategies. That surprised me! Of course, this movie is not the best example (and I'm just saying this compared to this) and it was not an Oscar worthy (many believe that it was looted), but it depends on the appeal. <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed the previous work of Coen, I have never seen the fan of the old Western wing or "Hazar's Dukes" or any other content in TN. I guess why I do not feel enthusiastic to test this film, it's turning around the people of the south. For those who are reading this from the South, I do not want to insult any of you! I'm sure people think the same way when you see movies in urban areas like "A Bronx Tale". When you live in your whole life, it is difficult to get used to these types of movies. But for all apologies, I found the letters are fun and quirky. I think John Tarturo fully accented, and I was surprised to see how he spoke in real life. Team Blake Nelson was good. Of course, George Clooney - who I guess is not the best of words of despair, judging by the decision to work with a conversation coach and the idea of ​​"The Perfect Storm" to evolve the accent of New England - Naturally the miscast and continuous pronunciation Struggle with Although its performance was good, though. You can also spot the coon regularly like Holly Hunter (short but sweet role) and John Goodman (also for a short time on the screen, but it stole every minute). <br /> <br /> Although I usually dig the country music, I liked the title song "Constant Sorrow A Man". The DVD contains music videos for that song. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found the movie as entertaining and original, but in the past you have no face-quality features in the face you have seen. This is a slow effort, but a good one. I still recommend you check it out. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
