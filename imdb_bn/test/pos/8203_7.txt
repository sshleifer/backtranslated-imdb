When "The Net" is first advertised, the ads seem ridiculous. Then, I saw it, it was actually quite good. Angela Bennett (Sandra Bullock) spent the time working on a computer and could never know her neighbor. Then, through a series of events, his identity is removed by a cabal of shadowy people, and he can not prove that he exists. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the movie are taken a little bit; If you watched the movie, you probably know which parts. Despite this, a good look at what has been the existence of the Internet on vague people. I recommend it.
