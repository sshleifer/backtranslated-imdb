I provide location services in Berkeley Square in London every Sunday. David Niven never enjoyed the role of the gentleman, perfectly to be his last. Fake Krugerrands loaded a trunk (thrown for film ..) When we stormed down a storm drain we had a moment of panic. <br /> <br /> Imagine that the great crew dug all the ends to open the last drain. If you love London and love you will love this comedy romp - also starts Richard Jordan who is sadly dead from the brain tumor. A good film, great crew, superb casting. See crowded scenes or extra games for current streets. Car Lot and Yan's retail businesses were shot in west London, in the entire shopping parade, Chiswick and US used cars were overnight, the car is still there as a store. A restaurant suddenly turned into a funeral parlor. If you see the list see the film it's an effort! Through the Sally Harrison, the bank's receptionist was married to David Tony Curtis. <br /> <br /> In April 2007, I thought I would add some additional comments to the location: <br /> <br /> Pub: Just off Berkeley Square Elk Samar's Cottage : Car Lights along the road to Eivens beside the Tikenham Film Studio: The location of all shops along the Cheswick High Street and on the street side. Workshop (Formatting Armored Van) Factors Factor Reverse Factor Brewery Gel (see workshop above) Telephone box to see LC Samar's Cottage (It is a wooden studio prop box used in many films, only in the light of Gound level, looking for cable and looking for wooden holes, door. Room Holwells near the Olympia Cemetery - Cheswick - the common land boundary Outside the grave, interior, ceiling, void and strong rooms: Twinkham studios <br /> <br /> And ever to join David Nivene with the gentleman, the joke and crew, extra and so ...... will be mixed in the Convert Hotel Join the crew for coffee!
