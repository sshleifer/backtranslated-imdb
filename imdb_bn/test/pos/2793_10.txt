I love this picture (I do not know why in England, called Pat Lakes - what a junk, and totally irrelevant name!) I spent eight months in Barcelona for living with other foreigners, not as a student of Erasmus, so I felt it was the same. It brings back great memories of fun with all the friends made from different countries, and the city itself. I really want to see the follow-up 'Les Pipes Russes' (Russian dolls), I guess it will not be released here? My brother saw it in France and said that the deficiency was not good, but the same cast was (Brother of Windy definitely got married). Does anyone know anything about this picture? And whether it can be released?
