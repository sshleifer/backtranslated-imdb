When Boris (Alexy Bottlove) closes for fighting against Germany, his favorite Veronica (Tatiana Samozlova) is married to his guardian cousin Mark (Alexander Cheverin) after a moment of weakness at the moment of his parents killed in an air. Raid on Moscow Through the various trials and betrayals, the word or letter of Barisal from Barisal will wait, until he expects how long it will take, and hope that he will return to him. <br /> <br /> The strong part of the filmmaking is performed by simply doing incredible photographic work by cinemagist Sergei Urouski. There are several nicely produced, some scenes in moving shots where the camera follows Veronica via the camera, tossing each other through the crowd of loved ones, pushing through the crowd of the crowd, Baris tells goodbye .. and can not reach him even if we look at Boris fate in a shock Saw it Shortly after the Vayronika expedition, Veronica stood on the staircase of the rubble and identified the scene where Mark had taken radioactive action in Veronica, because another air attack was going out of the building, just like the windscreen and the dazzling inner light are just two examples where Sergiy Urrucchi is always ready to make pictures Look at his talents in fixed images II. But, without the grief and pain of the story about how war can attract a couple's fate forever, this movie can not hold the beauty of the scene alone. Together, however, we're going through a wonderful movie ... a hunting masterpiece from the Soviet Union after Stalin's last breath. I just feel honored to see such a great film.
