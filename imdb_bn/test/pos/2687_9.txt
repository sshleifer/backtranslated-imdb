For the past ten years or so, the whole world is flooded with so-called Sitikamas (in fact the reasons for this title are rarely due), the King of Queens is a very real, unique and wonderful fun alternative. This is a Deliverman's daily life and his wife who works as a Attorney Assistant in Queens Manhattan, New York. Carry's father Arthur, a photo book extrovert, who was portrayed by superbly Jerry Steiler and stole shows of all those times he was present. Other important people are their best friends Deccan and Kelly, a married couple and their other friends who are spouses who are still around 30 years and still with their mother. This show is so unique and funny, that all the single characters seem so real and caring disciplined, the rhetoric attitude of the good nature of the bug, the opposite of a little vague optimism. And with Arthur, it makes its obscure sense and habit. He often gets into trouble and Doug and Carrie have to pull him from the mud. Even in my opinion, if the quality of the show is slightly reduced in the last year, it is still one of the best sitcoms. It takes a while to get the characters and be related to them, but after the end, you get some unused smiles from it. Although I think with Arthur one day I can not live one day in the living room, I still love him on this show. Watch and have fun, I got it 10 out of 9.
