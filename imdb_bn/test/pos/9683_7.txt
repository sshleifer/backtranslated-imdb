Despite the obvious structural harmony with The Simpsons - Loud Fat Baba, Housewife Maam, 3 children, a pet, usually colonial house, Family Guy is actually effective and steadily opposite of The Simpsons. Its main position from the first season is the warm (but sometimes too much) use of cutaway gags. Some nail hitting on the head (bit spy-snanneling Hilarious in Rena Perlman and Danny Davito Business Season 5), others are becoming less successful, transformed. And they may be annoying, especially when they do not advance the story line. (Jesus' bit is completely illogical and insulting) <br /> <br /> Chemistry between Stevey and Brian Griffin lends himself to pure comedy Gold, so that Chris and Meg are simply driven to play the role of compulsory thirteen. However, feature film Stew Griffin: The Antoild Story, MindinBingli is awesome. <br /> <br /> With a tedious comparison to Barcelona Simpsons, Seth McFarlen's outlook with family gaming is actually different - it's much more politically incorrect and surprising, much more intelligent. <br /> <br /> John Curriculus criticizes the famous singer for "extremely low" graphic quality from the point of view of cartoonist Rain and Stimp. I do not think it looks bad, but some precision details and accuracy are quite successful. <br /> <br /> Great series to give everyone a big bowl of chips. Rabbit dressing and ass joke.
