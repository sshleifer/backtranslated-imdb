Uzumaki has a very unique story and I will not look at spirals in the same way again. Really germic tingling is not horrible, this film has a dark morose, acid trip it seems to be. In some part time, did it just make me or see you visualized in Virtualux? Camera shots are interesting and movies let your imagination run wild. The malicious supernatural feeling of this movie attracts you as the title suggests. The acting is doing well and the city setting seems to be wrong at the beginning itself. <br /> <br /> It can take a few philosophies to drown. A great triple movie.
