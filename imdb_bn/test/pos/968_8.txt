Big Fat Lea is a great watch for children of all ages, even for adults. I had a great time to watch this movie and recommend it to kids aged 10 or under. Laughter never ends and brave plot too good! Frankie Munie is funny and Martin Wolf Sunny! Overall, there is a nicely made movie and just a great time to enjoy the kids.
