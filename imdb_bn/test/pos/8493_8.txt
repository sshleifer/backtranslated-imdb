Let's get an error from the top right - the film should have been more. Ray Charles is an impressive, captivating person who took a complex, challenging life. There was no way to fit it all - even touching it all - in a standard length movie The makers of this movie are pretty (and I'm definitely quite bothered) to combine a movie that was unable to tell the whole story, yet it was able to present a representation of a man and his music. Ray's powers throughout the film were clear and her weaknesses were not intensified, but sugar coated. We could have played for the lasting hours of his life after 1980, but I think that the film should be respected and when it finally allows fixing some things hanging up, then the balance was as good as I guess. <br /> <br /> For the big question now: What is the criteria for an Oscar? Wife and I have seen numerous films in our years, but we immediately agreed that we never saw the same performance of Jamie Fox. The line between the actor and the character was not blurred - rather it is completely invisible. We had heard most of the campaign before watching the film, but it was dishonest. Fox Ray Ray Charles You have not seen the film with the feeling that you did a great job to portray Fox to Ray Charles - you saw that you believe you saw Ray Charles. I do not know what else to do. We were completely blown away. I will admit that we have not seen all other performances for the Oscars this year, but it is not really a matter of fact. Foxx took it to a complete nuther level, the one we have never seen before and doubts that we could see again. I have seen any movie that I have ever seen that a person has become completely partner and firmly depicted. We salute you, Mr. Fox. We understand that the Oscars award will have to do far more than performance, but whether you win or not, we want to let you know that you have done a job that is in a class and should be proud of your extraordinary achievement <br /> <br /> PS music was naturally great. I commented to my wife that if I had a moment in the history of the song, then I would have been a witness, what would it be (in Kansas City, was not it?) What would I say? The film has done a great job with it - well I could stay there!
