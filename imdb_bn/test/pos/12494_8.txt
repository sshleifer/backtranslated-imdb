And I love it !!! Wanderer will pick up a religious audience and when it is canceled, the DVD sales will go to the roof. This is a very interesting show in its own way. This is a parody of children's shows, as if St. Our puppet characters are a yellow animal with Hello, which is our host. Clarence is a blue incognito which is in its own segment where she goes out on the street. A strange dog like that thing that he refers to himself in the third person. Wordsworth is the smartphone whose brain always shows. Then there are newscaster and pink dolls. This is a very funny show, not really as nasty as you'd expect, but more situations They take the 7-year-old on the road, tell them what they will say and do not understand them that they do not understand. Those of my favorite are Clarence's videos, especially when someone does not want to shoot. I liked the TV fanhouse, which was the same show, but it's still a very interesting event that I hope will continue next year. <br /> <br /> My rating *** *** *** *** *. 30 minutes. TV MA
