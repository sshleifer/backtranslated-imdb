You will not review James Bond movies, you will evaluate them, fill their hopes that they fulfill their expectations. There are some things that can be expected, even if the demand for a bond movie and every effort is distributed or not. So, here are ten elements that make a bond film bond film. And sometimes it will never say that it is not technically part of the official bond film, but only the only presence of Shane Cheney, who came back in 2007, is more than just a member of the series. However, here are the rates given on the scale of 1 to 10: <br /> Title: Never say: There is no apparent link in the true story of the clever title, but it is a playback reference diamond once again coming back again and again to play O7. Canaanite oath! Whatever, it's an interesting title. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Pre-credit Teaser: Probably trying to avoid any obvious parallel in Bond's official EON series, there is no teaser; The opening scenes are shown on the back of the credit. And even that's frustrating: another "oh-no, the bond has died" fakeout 4 points. <br /> <br /> Opening credit: 007 does not attempt to jazz credits with graphics or split screen or fun camera angle other than the small screen. 1 point. <br /> <br /> The theme song: Michael Legert wrote and "Never Say Never Again", a song written by Lani Hall, will make a particularly enjoyable part of a long elevator journey. As a bond theme, it's okay. 6 points <br /> <br /> "Bond, James Bond": A well-liked creator, this film shows with Connery back as a bond again after a decade, with the story starting with 007, that the bond / connery still Work up till Happily, Conny further proves himself ready for bondage. Although he is playing a little more slowly, wearing a little more sophistication and wearing a little more explicit work clothes, but it seems he is not returning to any step. Above all, it turns out as one of Connery's best, and most relaxed characters. 9 points. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the best picture of bonds, female characters were not given too much; They are essentially available as the necessary props for bond usage. The future Oscar winner Kim Basing has been given a lot of flexibility to create the character of Domino Petachia, and the film benefits from it. She does a great job - and she is not bad to look at. 8 points. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . At one time Jesus painted-transformed villain, Max Fone Saido was not given much to play the role, but the presence of Silky. But he is featured on the amazing performance of Closse Maria Brandouier Maximilian Lerago. After a string of bandwind villains, it is so refreshing for brandwire that is fine, nevertheless both color is evil. Ruthless, without ruthless cartoons, without camping; His Lorgo Arrique Goldfinger is right in the middle of the bond's best villains. 10 points <br /> <br /> Bond Baddies: Fatima Blash! Can i say Especially after playing with all the bold style of the Queen of Excellence, Barber's Carrara shows the mix of intimate, self-impressive temples and pure psychological madness through this film. Many types of bonds have crossed the path with fatales, most of whom were so easily disposed that they existed more as a fascinating eye candy than characters. But for some dramatic or such fierce determination, it shows the courage to display such a fireplace. His impossible death is even spectacular, even by Bondian values. 10 points <br /> <br /> The movie plot: As a remake of Thunderball, the film seems to have happened somewhat - that: nuclear missiles have been stolen and the main real estate will go to Cowboy The countries of the world do not pay the release of multi-cajillion dollars. But at least producer Kevin McClory felt lucky to be forced to rebuild an event of the weakest bond. By comparison, Thunderball out of these efforts water out. And despite the absence of many Bondian trademarks, the film has achieved its own success. 9 points. <br /> <br /> Production value: The film starts with an uncomfortable style, such as trying to be more than a TV movie. But like the story progresses, the film gets the feeling of speed and purpose, it creates a higher courage. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Bonus points: There are some strange changes that set this bond film apart from the official series. Miss Manpani rarely admits; Activated by Edward Fox, "M" is a stylish old being that has not paid tribute to "double os", which will play the part of Judy Dunk later; And the "question" has suddenly a cockney accent and bond with all friends-friendly. And Nostalgia has a strange idea throughout the film, such as replacing Bond's Asterin-Martin with a vintage packard and a tango dance number that is cleverly inserted into the story. And in the end, a big rescue horseback, respect for the riders of the Lost Ark, which was dedicated to bond movies itself. 5 points. <br /> <br /> Never say mixed mixing bag. In the really important areas, it's more like thanks to Hero Connie, Villain Branduir, Killer Career and daughter-in-law, more than anything else. But the devil has details; Open credits, theme songs, and seemingly unexpected, the film lacks due to their absence. It comes off as a wrong bond film; A very good option, but an alternative then. <br /> <br /> Bond-o-meter rating: 100 to 78 points.
