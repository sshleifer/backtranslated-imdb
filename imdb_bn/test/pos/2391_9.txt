I found the movie very interesting. I enjoyed the film really was great in the actors. It was entertainment. Benny uncle wondered, he was real in his character. The last one took a wonderful turn. I would recommend it to you. Eddie Moors girlfriend reminded me of a nail-sharp sharp calf. I like young girls acting very confidently in movies. Beni reminded me of a friend who truly grew up in Brooklyn. I like the scene where he used to switch the utensil sauce because it is how many people cook it. I actually saw the movie two times and learned another time.
