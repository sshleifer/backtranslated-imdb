Mike Nichols's "Charlie Wilson War" set in the 1980s, describes the story of how the title character (directed by Tom Hendes) was conducted in a secret battle with rocky riders, by supporting the Afghan army. Of course, we know how good it has been in a long time but thanks, the film does not focus on the unexpected effects. <br /> <br /> Cast Studied, Tom Hendes and Julia, the most bank star of Hollywood, Roberts. As a bonus, you have found the versatile Phillip Semur Hoffman as a characteristic memorable supporting role, for which he received an Oscar void nomination. I'm not a fan of Roberts but Hendes is always reliable. However, I can not buy anything from a drug user as a woman, even though the real Charlie Wilson feels very liked as Hans. Apart from the big three, there are no comments from eminent names such as Emmy Adams. <br /> <br /> The story is compelling and inspired by a fine script of Harun Sorsin. The oral interplay in the main characters is full and memorable lines full chalk. In the beginning of the war, the subsequent incidents are not ignored, although Wilson's respective booking scenes probably seem to me that it may be extremely sincere to acquire an intelligent feeling. Completely, Nicholas's instruction works like a worker and praises the script's performances. <br /> <br /> This is a film that Charlie Wilson likes himself, has errors, but nevertheless neutral choice. Of course, the recommendation for fans for the three stars and those who are looking for an engaging political drama with an impressive heartfelt feeling.
