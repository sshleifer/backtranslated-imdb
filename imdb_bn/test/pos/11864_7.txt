OK. That's the thing to figure out. I have read the opinions of other viewers - some are spoiling the film and some say it's the most fun, dark, blackest comedy so far. Tarantino's Huff, etc. OK, right. But guess what? It's still an enjoyable and, finally, funny pictures. No bright, no trash. Liv Tyler gives a great performance and you absolutely can not close her eyes. She is a woman with very strong decoration ideas ... Matt Dillon, a very intrinsic and unused actor, sometimes surprising. He always scruff and manages to stride that fine line, and he pulls off beautiful humor. Ditto John Goodman (though religious overton, probably funny in script, does not really work). Paul Reiser is very good --- he's better than on TV. <br /> <br /> Generally helpless Michael Douglas is great in this role. For her coif, see the film, well. In this and "Wonder Boys," you have actually reminded that Douglas could work. In the movie you will laugh at the part. OK, not just stomach-smile, but of course I-amused- I-very-attracted category. If you expect the other to be "pop fiction" then forget it. But if you want a bit of hip and concert, this is a good choice.
