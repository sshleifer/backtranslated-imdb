I watched love love jones for thirty times. This is one of the rare movies that describes a love story about African-American citizens. The dialogue was literally written, and delivered with honesty. It was very nice to see a movie where the line of the story was centered on young professional African-Americans. This is virtually an untapped market. Love Jones was visually drunk as well. Lorenz Tate and Nea Long will bring chemistry past and present love memories. The feeling of the film jazz and blues, and the splash of kahlua and boutskat with a warm warmth feeds the sensitivity of hot chocolate. If you do not guess, I like it!
