I saw this preview show a preview today and it was fantastic. It portrays things that affect the high school students. <br /> <br /> I am surprised by the feeling of the movie and sad and grateful that there will be an opportunity to raise awareness about this topic about the audience (rape, rape, suicide and depression). <br /> <<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br <br /> <br /> <br />
