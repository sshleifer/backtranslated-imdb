"One Dark Knight" is the head of the low-budget version of the 1980s. Filled with retro puns, dresses and scenery, "ODN" visitors easily transport during the time, when the horror films were just ... Awful! <br /> <br /> Nothing is so intense that you do not understand above, the film tells you a dark fable of what happened when you mess with the dead. Well-screeched roles have been stable and starred Tom McLaughlin as a fine director, who revels in that period and believes in what he's presenting. No "who did it?" And at the end of a big packet. It is thrown straight and straight from the front and end to the spice, adding more than 80 humor to your face. I can give it "8" because only special effects are shorter at the end of the film, but there is at least no CGI ... The film is suitable for new fans in the horrible genre of 1980, or anyone who wants to be alive again, the classic horror is a fun night.
