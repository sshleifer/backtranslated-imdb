Directed and played by Rupar Haor, the short film was based on a short story by Dutch writer Harry Marlish. <br /> <br /> You will see a lifetime within 10 minutes of the length of the film 'Harry' unveils his longtime attraction with his young room room. After many years of returning to the city, he rented in the same room. <br /> <br /> Textures are pronounced in the story of this story using black and white pictures. Harry's voice is drawing you into his world. <br /> <br /> The subtle, tough performance of rugby air and 2 non-speech characters. Wonderful soundtrack by Dutch musician Diazack <br /> <br /> It's hard to see this moment as it is available in the 2 "L-Infiedel" bonus track of DVD region. But because of "The Hit Hit" in the re-released DVD - another tight, but very different performance from the air! <br /> <br /> See this picture if you can!
