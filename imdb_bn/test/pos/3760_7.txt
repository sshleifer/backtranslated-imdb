Mark Blankfield (from late late night TV show "Friday") Daniel Jakeel, who plays a light-hearted surgeon, who discovered a powder that makes him a drug-crazy party animal. Of course this was not his intention, he had high hopes, but he went with the flow. It's actually a fairly stupid movie, but it's pretty fun. Of course, a good doctor realizes what she once did, she is ashamed, but she is not doing it again and is running as an insane sexual machine with hair dazzling hair and gold chain through the hands of Hollywood. There are a few sub-groups, like Jakeel's motherhood, who is the daughter of Chief Doctor of Ari Lady of Caffeining and Pane, from the employer of the prison. And Tim Thomson is a "real" part as a plastic surgeon and a taste for men and a wealthy old man, whose condition is a parody of Houdes Hughes and who is going to enrich many people with a complete set organ. Replacement with testicles,. Yes, humorous and stupid, and overall, the whole thing is fairly futile, but if you're not on the wettest speed of garter, then you probably like it. Now DVD is available, for the first time! Subhash! 10 out of 7
