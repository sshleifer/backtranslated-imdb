This is a movie, it has all the basic elements of its genre. It wants to make you cry, it lets you laugh, it bothers you, it makes you angry. <br /> <br /> The story is fortunate not to have any diseases or medicines, but common trends in gay have themed movies these days, but it focuses on social interactions between letters that may not be considered to be high school elite. The game and the side can be a bit more sophisticated, but on the other hand it is a different kind, because it really shows the traits of the characters, which they feel. If for this purpose, then it is an extraordinary work and definitely a feat, especially for such a youth director. <br /> <br /> This is actually a good story that gives you a little inside, how it can be a fat girl and accept it yourself.
