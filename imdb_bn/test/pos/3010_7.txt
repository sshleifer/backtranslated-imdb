Start this one nicely Photography and audio I've experienced quite a good year (OK, month). It is surprising to use 'warm' and 'cold' colors especially in single sequences. Also, Jennifer Lopez whispered most of her lines, it's an idea itself, but I'm not sure what she wants to do with Singh. <br /> <br /> Now for neutrality. The screenplay was horrific. The part of Lopez is irrelevant or totally worthless. He looked at himself and the movie starring only the movie star. Three beds just looked very obvious. Carl's baptism was psychologically very underlined to encourage the purpose of working under Carl 'Curl'. And so <br /> <br /> <br /> However, the movie was a great way to show where the movie came from. How are the most talented directors of India showing today?
