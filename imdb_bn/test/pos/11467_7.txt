Early in the 1960s, the biography of gangster such as A Mober's portrait, Mad Dog College and King of Twilight Twang. Although made inexpensive, the film has a lot of power and is particularly good acting by Eric Roberts and Frank Stallone. Theresa Russell may seem very attractive as a mother, but she has some very good moments. There are two action scenes in surveillance: a shoot out in a hotel, and a machine gun fight in the center of the barracks and FBI between the streets. Both sequences are done nicely, and compared to other low-bidgate gangster junk like Dealing and Copon, this film is bright.
