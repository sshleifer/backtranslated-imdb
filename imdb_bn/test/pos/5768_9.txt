I saw this when it first came out, and it was found to be a work of some talent; But I must admit that I was clear in the minority at the time. <br /> <br /> For me, the progressive lunches of the owners of the guest house Paradiso just gets better and better throughout the film, the most ridiculous. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The fine joke has to be hidden, but they are usually flattened fast by a comedy frying pan. Rick Maill and Ad Edmunds are fantastic, and corpse, uncertain guests are also nice.
