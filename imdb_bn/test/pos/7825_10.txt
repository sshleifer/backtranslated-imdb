It's not something about me when people are complaining about something usually ... so it's about falling for a gay man straight woman. First of all ... it's a true story, so you can not say it is not trustworthy. It's a second written by a gay man. So the whole thing against Gays about this is just simple foolhardy. Personally I think it's the best love story I've ever seen. And I'm very gay. I think this shows that real love is not just about personality and is not sexual. And it does not have anything to do with gay, straight or other hobbies. Perhaps in Europe we also see more TVs, it is deeper and you can think American TV more ... Plus we are not afraid to show anything specific. <br /> <br /> If you want something funny with one of England's finest (Leslie Sharp) and you want to see a decent credible love story for you without it too much sap. I know I love it
