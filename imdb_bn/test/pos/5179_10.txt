Seeing Gary Busey in a G rating film was a first and a wonderful one. I do not know much about the director, but he probably knows how to spend a few dollars and get the most from them. Where did Jillian Clare come from? My kids love him! Christopher Atkins thought that only one thing was the Blue Legoon. Disney needs to see these pictures and work them out. The wife thinks she is very intelligent. I liked what he did with his character. She seems so real What we liked most was the message sent to this film. Greed sucks and trust, win love and family! This is the first budget DVD that we bought so that it contains a lot of content. Producers made this one for kids and kids liked it. They liked music and all the extra in DVD. The director is not likely to be with family films, but I hope he does this - because he really knows how kids, animals and stars like Gary Bushi get the most. The dog was fantastic and the work of Gary Bushy, like a dog, was even funny. We did not have much to like about this one. It's hard to find a family movie without all the strange humor, and Cugli was a delightful surprise.
