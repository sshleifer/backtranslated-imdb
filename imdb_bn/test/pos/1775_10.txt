I like this movie, this is the best pirate-movie I've seen (stupid Errol-Flin-stuff and Caribbean pirates forgotten). This movie is a wonderful melancholic. I compare the "Johnny Guitar" side of the sea (but 3 years ago), two women fight for a man, where crazy love can be. <br /> <br /> The hero's character (anti-) heroine, Anne Providence, superb, acting without compromising like a child, lost her search for a female identity in a real human world alone. He is a very funny film-hero, not a funny victim, because in this series his partner does not woke up most of the time, he battles for the poor and good people, and only fools kill Spanish or British soldiers - or good governors, but he is a ship captive (film Watch it at the beginning) Kill all the poor prisoners of war, he is primitive (he can not even read), he is frustrated and he is a vintage Get talk about, as a consequence, he lost all his friends, his desires, and he is wearing clothes most of the film. This image shows a pirate "hero" as a bit (!) Bit (or "he" in this case, but there a woman "Annie" Becknier, Anne Boni) can be cruel reality. <br /> <br /> The picture is very short and the story is told in an exciting way. Of course, in the current time of a 1950s film, there is no exciting effect for the viewer (ships swimming in the swimming pool very clearly), but this real drama about love (murder), belief, betrayal, revenge, hatred and sacrifice is crazy. Perhaps Anne is also believed to be a person betrayed by Judas Iscariot and a friend (French Loreous) like Christ, from Nazareth to Jesus; After the frustration of the friend, he is sentenced to death (eg Judas); Giving forgiveness on this matter (such as Judas, who committed suicide according to the Gospel of Matthew); And ultimately dedicates himself to rescue the beloved enemy (like Jesus). However, if you are not interested in these philosophical questions of blame and blame, the film takes several (cheaper) steps, which bring the beating of the sword and the burning (plastic) ships for at least two and a half hours.
