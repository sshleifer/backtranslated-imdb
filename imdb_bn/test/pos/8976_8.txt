One of the best movies of the year, Tom Hanks, this amazing, and highly relevant historical event (dramatized current events) in the historic comedy-drama around Afghanistan / Soviet Fiasco, is like a star like Congressman Charlie Wilson. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan killed hundreds of people. Why should anyone care? People are dying, is not it? No, because of the United States being involved in Charlie Wilson, the Afghans were afraid that they entered Pakistan and started illegally coming to Pakistan, which resulted in the closure of Pakistani President Mohamed Ziaul Haq. Charlie Wilson, a fun and strong American spy for the sixth rich women and religious curiosity of Texas, Joan Herring (Julia Roberts) and CIA's Gust Avocabacos (Philipp Semur Hoffman), to try to solve this situation, gathered together to help the Afghans. In the Soviet war, air strikes will try to attack their land with high technology weapons. <br /> <br /> While Oscar is not outstanding for the best picture, Charlie Wilson War is probably the best. Many political films of the year Academy Award winner Mike Nicholls gives strong direction as expected, and Emmy Award winner Haroon Sorkin (Sports Night, The West Wing) offers a remarkable playlist that almost creeps in comedy and drama. Great for the best part of acting as well. Tom Hans is trapped on a warm island on his 2000 Oscar nominated turn, FedEx activist 'Cast Away', giving his best and most enjoyable performance. Hanks wins a thin character like Wilson and his trademark attraction leads him to the desired person. Amy Adams and Ned Batty are always reliable, but the real stand-out performance of the film is Philip Semur Hoffman. Huffman, the lead actor in today's film industry, played a minor role in his career and stood around him. Hoffman has discouraged you in his first scenario where he was shouting in his basement before violently breaking his master. The only disappointing actress has made the Hollywood starlet Julia Roberts unusually disappointed. On his way through another film, Roberts' rich and rich Texas oil woman's leading screenplay hits all the wrong notes, and it's annoying most of the time. In the 97th minute, the film is small and sweet, and it can not pull it to say something, but for a very short period of time it can be dragged. <br /> <br />, 'Charlie Wilson War' is not a perfect movie in any way , But it's certainly a look. Grade: B +
