I really enjoyed this film. I am not usually fairy tales or believe, but this picture has attracted my attention. <br /> <br /> I saw this photo at the UK Channel Hallmark ... which usually shows the new sticky movie ... but then Snow came along with the queen ... and I was loving it! I've really admired Bridget Phunda in this movie ... She played the queen of snow brightly and glamorously. <br /> <br /> I will not explain the story that other people have already done, so <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, if you want to see a fun fairy tale ... this picture Buy ... But if you want to buy it and you're in the UK, you might have a hard time. I bought it from South Korea brand New (course English version).
