This is the story of Ramon Samadoro, a sailor who fell into the sea crash in his twentieth century and was fighting for his right to end his war with the Spanish government. This story is a trailer trail created for Television Meltdram, and this is the only way to do this through sound and sound performance and they both come to frustration. Matteo Gil and Amenabr written in such a way that the audience is not directed to be blind towards the end of the death but the process is encouraged to create their own mind and it is a great stroke, it is not a movie pro but a film on behalf of the final illusion of our time is LIBERTY. There are a lot of ways to relax, such as the Chamber when Samedro comes home to a wheelchair to cancel the beliefs, but in most cases it is in the valley of turmoil, even when you feel that you think his father is safe, at the same time the highest of the whole film There was no concept with the running line. This is an impressive experience, especially when Samprerro is roaming the streets and everyone around him tries to surprise his life, even those who help him to die, more than life seems to be full? But when you strip a man to his dream ?? The film has been created exclusively close-ups which bring clustrophobic feeling that makes viewers more sympathetic with Sampdro. This is a huge challenge for the actors who will have to create their entire performance with their eyes and not say the eyes to the eye. Birdmember was not nominated for his second Oscar, probably for Eastwood, but in my opinion he was the only one who could have jammy fox shade. This role reminded me of The Great Gregory Pack in The Kill Mockingbird, where the action was watched smoothly and I think that Bardem has reached the position where acting and what the reality is completely unclear. I never liked her first job, but she had become an international star before Aldodovar's live flush, before being nominated for a Roll, Los Lunas El Sole, The Cancer Apster and Oscar, and although he and the band came from the same Almodovar. It's interesting to see how different the backgrounds have taken and how Bertem has become a real reference for Spanish movies all over the world. A golden world, 14th Goa, jury award, Venice and possibly Oscar, with the permission from Chorus Boas, took Amenab directly, co-written, edited and kept the music in high drama, dragged it ?? Now what about some science fiction? Whose life is it? ****
