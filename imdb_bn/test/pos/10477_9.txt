This movie is almost unknown, but it's very good. In the Danish city alone, two old sisters live far away in remembrance of the young man, because of the harsh old education they had to reject their happiness. Then, living in a highly respected intensity, Babet, who had been flying from Paris, was scared of war. After some time, when he came, he would be able to start the goodness and love he had received. A good lottery award follows the best rules of the French Gastronomy, to organize a great banquet. All the neighborhoods are invited (all fanatically puritans). They accept, but they do not show any trace of any joy or enjoyment, because it will be a sin. However, they are seduced by the seductive power of delicious food to eat, by the sensuality of the French Gastronomy. The end of the banquet felt a lot, though quietly, happiness. Love is heard in people. The miracle of human kindness increased due to the pleasure of the senses. The movie is amazingly good, but it's not all for taste. Most of the movies, nothing happens, everyone is so calm and so peaceful, that in a few minutes you can only see the lives of the residents of the city. However, the film has evolved, it has become more valuable, when Babbet won the Lotteries Award (after 30 minutes), the show is starting. With a perfect guide of the author, how Babbet prepares the banquet, how he mixes all the elements with the most wonderful one (love), all said in a calm delicious way, with a perfect knowledge of photography and acting. Then, as seen through the banquet, how the mood of all voters changes due to food, how to be seen with only the first shots, how wonderful it is with each other's influential illustrated scenes. In addition, the technique is also excellent with color and photography, almost every scene in the film is like a picture, so there involved work involved. If you are able to enjoy the good movie and realize that sometimes the way you say something is more important than what you have said, it is your movie. If you love good food and love good gastronomy, you might be surprised because most of the feelings in the movie are known to you. Deserve an Oscar complete It is the only problem of frustration when setting up the story, however, I can forgive it (I hope everyone too)
