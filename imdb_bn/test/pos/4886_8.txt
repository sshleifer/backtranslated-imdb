I've seen five episodes of the show before, (I'm seeing it again in BBC Two) I really did not have much experience in the league, but as a new bird and a huge fan of British comedians, I would say this film is fun. Brian and Geoff were a great comedy experience on the big screen. Some of the things on the screen which make the head elevate (it will come as a surprise) and fight all kinds of great killings with random medieval style. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < One of my only frustrations with the movie was to cry out Geoff, "Now I've got this gun", even once (though it's a build up in a part of the film.) The film is overall overall. It is very memorable for movies like "Brian Life", Pythonos and everyone else to use the word. Tube and Edward's faces are welcome, but Father Lajaru's line "Hello Davies" will push me more than anything else by saying. (Lajoru is probably probably my favorite Vashi character and after Tibbas and Edward.) It ends with most mood, the character is being killed, and I can not expect it to be a vicious move to the last screen of the league. Referring to the possibility of another series or film with Gatis, I am very excited now. This is a movie that I will watch again, partly due to the end of the projector, excluding 10 minutes or more of the film, but basically it is inventive and colorful. I'm not really annoyed if the TV series is not as good, because I like it. <br /> <br /> If you do not see the League, you will love it, but Dave knows what you think about people who create these things. Tibbas or Edward can keep it, it's a local film, for local people, and a valuable thing in it. <br /> <br /> **** ***** (4/5)
