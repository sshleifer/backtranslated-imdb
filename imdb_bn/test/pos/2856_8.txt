Betty Sizmor (Rene Zellgiger) as her way to escape from husband and dull life soap opera saved life through a "cause of love" After a shocking incident involving two hit man (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), Bati suddenly travels to LA and believes that she is ready to marry the main character (Gregg Kieron) of the show. <br /> <br /> Nurse Betty is a rare thing that is an all-star cast and a lesser known film with at least Rome-less conspiracy that is surprised at its amazing script and acting spots. Indeed, such a plot R questions a question, but it's OK. This threatening incident sent to the outskirts of Betty is a much more graphic than a light, humorous comedy that takes a look at something like a different movie, but at the same time it must be convinced of the transformation of Baty. <br /> <br /> We go with Betty on her journey, director Neil La Boot has done some amazing magic that makes the movie unique and your bug is wrong on the standard comedy. An example of this would be Beta's first meeting with her fur. He poured his heart to him and he plays along, he thinks he is auditioning for the part of the show. Even though we are aware of the ridiculous nature of Bati's rangngists, he does, like he speaks, listens to the music, gives the mental aspect of the audience, the Betie. We often believe in what he says, yet we understand that his heart has broken. Other filmmakers will try to shout the laughing of the situation by shaking every ounce of comedy out of sight, lobbying for its main character and dealing with her sincere sympathy and understanding. <br /> <br /> Witmanly priceless, excellent scripts in the hit man directed by Freeman and Rock, doling out the cute lines after the cute lines for them. Freeman is always always nice, like his own character, he falls in love with himself slowly and with his own ideals of Betey, even in real sense he does not know what he or she has done. Barn showed the Aaron Akhart again in the ungrateful husband's ungrateful role and he is almost unknown. Here is another revelation Kinnear, whose soap star screenplay is not overcooked too much. As soon as possible, the celebrity has a tendency to bastard clich√© and oppose Kanai, despite being a soap star instead of a poisonous but restrained spontaneity. <br /> <br /> Soap opera has realized that it is very good, it could almost be there. LaBute and this one along and hit the nail head with a good thing. If soap opera was very ridiculous, a large part of the film did not work. Friends for "Cinema of the Lives" have shown that this movie has been a mistake. Stresses in detail in detail, because the style and feeling of soap operas becomes more and more bloody in the wireless reality, when it is in line with the oddly curious views. The scene of the set seems to be real, since the atmosphere opposes some of the films created in such a way, why are you wondering why those who do this for the living can not get it right. <br /> <br />'s definitive solution to the final law, being a predictable tad, is completely satisfactory as a whole. Lavytty was shy after operating this wonderful movie, the mainstream called for The Wicker Man's Unreal Remake, a wonderful example of a man's content to his life. Unfortunately, no one can free him from all liability. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen a nurse Betty you can discover it. If you do, it's worth a visit again. Infectious nurses have a charm of nurses, even if even after a lot of thoughts may not leave you. Yet a hidden gem.
