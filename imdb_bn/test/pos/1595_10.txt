If all the movies are destroyed and only one can be saved then Venice will have to die. It is a monument of movie history Gradually, it is very annoying and it becomes very clear to publish its point (An elderly young boy who discovers beauty and gets mentally destroyed first), what should be praised for our movie. 30 years ago a 'Venezuelan' death was executed and in the early twentieth century it was portrayed for some time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Life was slow compared to today. People were supposed to behave in a certain way, concealing their true emotions from them. Director Viccanti and Dark Bogdar, lead actor, acting actor, actor Von Ascobek, successfully succeeded by referring to how he discovered the romantic interest of a boy at a young age. For a man like Von Aschenbach, in his time, this condition will come with a very strong shock. We are in his internal struggle, mostly in front of Bogra, against the beautiful backdrop of Venice and with the most wonderful music composed by Gustav Mahel. <br /> <br /> This movie is slowly, it can not be denied. Fights to keep a special effect, driving or pinning the viewers in their seats. There is no distorted sex scene; The interaction between man and boys is limited to the channels stolen away from the extreme smile. <br /> <br /> So basically, nothing happens in this movie? If you do not want to hurt your senses like a base drum. If you want to play like a ventilation string in romantic concert, then it's a movie.
