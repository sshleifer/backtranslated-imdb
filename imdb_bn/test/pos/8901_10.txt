After another campaign in an empty village, the chief of Viking Timundhau misinterpreted the interpretation of the cryptograph of his mentor, saying that "the wanderers of the fears" and believe that the fear is to fly villagers. To learn how to fly and make illogical fighters, they decided to challenge the champion by the fear of Gaul. Meanwhile, Jistfarix of Vitalastasticx, a man was sent from Parisia to Gulisch village and sent to the Estricht and Obelix to train the young man. He was kidnapped by the cryptograph of the cryptographer, who heard the conversation with the cowardly Justafrix in Ollaf, Asteris and Obelix. While returning to Viking village, Jästerfers joins Mom of Timmahf's daughter, and they love each other. But the Macawavelian and ambitious cryptograf plans to get her son Olaf married to Abba and become stronger. Finally, Estrichs realized that it is not the wings that gives wings, it is love. <br /> <br /> When I was a teenager, Esters was my favorite comic book and I read all the stories of Goscinny and Woodrow. This feature film shows all the original elements and comics in a delicious and wonderful animation of comics. Justforkix and Romantic Abba's Romance are delightful and delightful in situations involving Asterix and Obelix. My vote ten <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Astérix e os Vikings" ("Asterrix and Vikings")
