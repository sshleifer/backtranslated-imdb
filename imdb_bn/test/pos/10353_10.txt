Completely annoying and cheap bawdy humor. I love it !!! It's the most horrific and completely awesome movie except Nicholas Reid, who plays comedy with Jasser in a helpless court. But as it may be, I laugh at many times and had to hand me over to filmmakers, it was either inciting or not in any way. Rape, war, zombies, vomiting victims of their rape What other movies have this? Not for quoices, but with a pizza, a bong and beer pack of six packs you made it, if you have an iron iron stomach and have a humorous idea like me.
