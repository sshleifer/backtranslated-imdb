Michael Jackson is the greatest singer of all time and the best dancer of all time and the film proves this. It's brilliant to watch and pretty dancing. When Michael walks around a Verbubal, look at the first part of your seat. And when Vincent adds fear to the rap of the price, all the zombies are a growing to their graves. If you like it, then I recommend you to buy 'Michael Michael Jackson's Thriller Making', after which it has a picture created. Michael shows the incredible performance of 'Billy Jean', which he did on the first television channel Chandvala. See it
