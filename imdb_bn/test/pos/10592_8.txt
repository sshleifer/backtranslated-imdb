I personally found the film to be great. I had pre-order for it a month and I got the mail it saw it twice a day, and from a lot of time .. yes, time delay may be a bit, but the rest of the movie is clearly compensated for it. All aperture casts were still right for each part of the cast. The plot itself is just ... violent! There is no other way to describe it. Whoever makes a movie about someone got f **! ??? Left, who's that Genius Just talent Two thumbs up I will be honored to work with him anytime anytime.
