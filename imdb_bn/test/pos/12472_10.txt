Greystoke without the doubt of the best Tarzan movie I've ever seen. Christopher Lambert illustrated a very credible man trying to return to the world of mankind as well as the fantastic Ian Holm. Jungle and Afghans are very excited to release John in the jungle. Lambert creates jungle sounds for romantic interest, and there are some memorable scenes in the scene where he witnesses his father's death. Tarzan feeling for the world is better developed and you really feel for him. <br /> <br /> is a nice and intimate film.
