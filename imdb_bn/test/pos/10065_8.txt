When this film was made in the 50's or 60's, critics and fans alike liked it. I myself, enjoyed the film from the beginning to the end. This is not a timeless piece, and is not good for years, but it is enjoyable to see it. Mrs Richie is acting for acting? Not the best of the planet - but it adds to the film's unique snapstick comedy-desire, and shows the sense of curiosity timing Madonna (often included). Madonna starred Niki Finn, who was a criminal, the crime she committed was not made for him. Gryphin Dune suddenly starred the future groom / doll, whom he was sent from prison to the bus station, where a series of unfortunate incidents happened. (And there's * one, folks!) Give the film a shot. You may be pleasantly surprised how it really fun.
