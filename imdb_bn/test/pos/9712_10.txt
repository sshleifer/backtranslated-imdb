Do you expect it to be okay? And it's good enough that those who wanted to see it could keep it happy. <br /> <br /> This is not a film that won Academy Awards. But it takes Jacques TV show and what the original movie has done successfully, and it turns a gimmick. It's fun, more brutal, and more hateful than the original. And I like it every minute. <br /> <br /> The original had some notorious stunts, and at least one stunt would remember that this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, unless you hear Jackas
