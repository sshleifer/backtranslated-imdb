At first glance, a film like NorthFork, a city was flooded in 1955, and a group of 6 letters sent to evacuate the rest of the city, it could be just a general movie. As soon as we take care of a sick child soon after taking care of an avid landowner, we can set up for our easy story, which we can easily position. However, when this movie is presented for the first time, then you are a spectacular open-ended cinematography and a scene involving a church which does not have a wall open on the pastures of the hills with beautiful pastures and beautiful scenery. It soon becomes clear that after this scene and the role of some people in the cities, this is not a common film and no common story, it is very special and unique. <br /> <br /> At first glance things are not as clear, but visitors are also seeing that the painters and the landscape are stunning, and soon the letters residing in this extinct region are amazing words in the luxurious area. Can you draw near this quirky film, or you're just waiting to sit there for a while. <br /> <br /> Photos are deep spiritual and dream-like dreams, it's a slow and methodical approach that I am sure, will encourage some viewers, but if you are patient with it and see the big picture, then the film can be a witness. <br /> <br />
