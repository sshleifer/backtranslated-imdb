This is an amazingly well-illustrated initial adaptation of Eugene O'Neil. Its main flaw is a static camera, and as a result, it comes mostly like a pledge, it is a sad because it is a good piece of primitive moviemaking, at which time the term has all the technical problems, and as a result most of the movies were their creator's purpose. Whether it was experimental. Garbo is mysterious and croissant in his silent films, and his entry is still classic. Her voice is curious deep, almost boyish, which only enhances her already seductively brilliant personality. As his boyfriend, Charles Baker correctly virile, - He was definitely born craggy - and a perfect counterpart of divine Garbo. His Irish brood is not bad at all, and he always thinks of a natural man on the ocean like O'Neill, in his independent, brooding nature. As Garbo's (too) confused parents, George Marion seems really from another time. His mouth and voice are open, inhuman, without utterly stupid - which have disappeared from the earth. Marie Dresler also O'Neill things in swing. Closing his eyes speaks his empty expression and volume of intensity, because he sometimes plays his musical character like a woman on the border of psychosis. Poet license, perhaps, not in this script, but we can forgive Miss Dassler's extras; He is not very good at it. The story ends with the speed of the next item, which is independent from the resolution, which is not the author's cup of tea; And those who prefer to finish their movies beautifully, they will be frustrated by the absence of real surprise. In Ana Christie, we'll call ambivalance, or anxiety neuroscience, our country, sea space, storm and fog, the wide range of panoramic and unexpected uncertainty. Instead of analyzing this mood, the authors present it simply and wisely, such as weather, land, ocean, and people speak each other differently and speak to each other and talk to each other.
