I like this movie! When I saw this movie on TV in my childhood, it became frightened by me. Probably because Mancuin gave me the cripps. Joseini Jones (Molly) is an excellent actress. He's the expression of his face, especially his eyes, in awesome play. Chuck cones Good like slouchane. I was happy to see him in such a different role. The other actors of this movie are very good! Tania Roberts (Beckie) and Robin Sherwood (Aileen) are great actresses and I can see their future films, especially Joclin Jones! <br /> <br /> So if you like scary movies but are tired of the same old stuff, check out this movie!
