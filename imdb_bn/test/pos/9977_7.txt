When I saw the first movie advertised, I think it is going to be another Disney movie which goes directly to the video. I finally got around and rented it. I thought it would be bad because I could not see Shia any other role than the recently canceled show "Even Stevens". I was ready to turn it off when I turned it on from annoying in about 10 minutes. It started a bit slowly and I did not understand the beginning because the years did not understand, then they later told that I thought about it. All and all I thought it was a good movie and I would recommend it. The slope was top notch and although I'm not a fan of golf it easily kept my attention with a good plot.
