What can I say about the series, new limitations ... Hmmm .... just this is the only one in the best TV series together !! All your age actors, actors are a little familiar and forget about that time. Everyone plays their part in perfect perfection! There are always some moral stories in these shows that are mostly true (if not all the time) are true! You can think that whose voice is dubbed on credit and at the beginning and the end, he thinks how he is saying! These shows not only have a big story line, they also throw you in them, your mind gets racing and pumping your blood. The original outer limit was a black and white on the right of 60, winning these winners I have never seen! It was fun to see the new twilight zone with Forrest Whitaker, but the new out lights are where it is! If you do not see: I request you to check out these episodes, and you'll see exactly what you understand! Long live the new live !!!!!!!!!!!
