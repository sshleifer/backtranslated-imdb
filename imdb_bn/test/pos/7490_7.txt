It is so similar to movies like Pulp Fiction or Reserve DOSGS, which it is impossible to think that the Tarantino films were not the source of the thirtendo's inspiration. But it's not bad for a low-cost B-series movie. The plot about gangsters is captivating and fun and it is a dark humor and subtraction we can find in a PULP FICTION. The resources were not confirmed before long but the film is well-produced. Good acting I enjoyed the scene when the girl was teasing the doctor at the sofa ... it was hot and fun at the same time! Soundtrack is very nice I could not hear many songs, but I could hear. I score it 7/10.
