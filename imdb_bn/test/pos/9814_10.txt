However, for kids to try to build a plane from junk, it's a simple matter to imagine. These two very young people who have very active imagination and they are based on the misuse of their parents from their parents, they must rely on those fantasies to come out of reality. For parents, the director liked that the director did not show his face. That seems to him more giant. If you see his face, then that character becomes a person and this is not a "monster", who makes these two innocent children terrorists childhood. Only focus on the misconceptions of its misuse and concentrating on abuse scenes, children become the main focus of the film. There is no end to this picture, but it will be similar to father's story to his children. It has embellitions. It's a fine American classic.
