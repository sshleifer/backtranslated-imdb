This movie is one of the most fun I see in the year. A movie that relates not to depression or death after death and funeral. Christopher Walken provided the most comedy in this charming romance and I could not breathe a laugh very hard. <br /> <br /> I've seen a preview of this movie, and when it's over, the audience is not appreciated, but happy. I'm telling all my friends to come to the United States. I certainly see it again in the theater and planning to buy DVD as it is available.
