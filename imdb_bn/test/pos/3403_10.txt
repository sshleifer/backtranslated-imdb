I absolutely adore this movie as a child and are still not as an adult. That's even an understatement to say. On Christmas holidays, my sister, brother and I saw one day in our grandfather's house. They were to tap it from TV. Our parents were happy that it held us for one night but they thought we'd be tired of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. is not it! We became mesmerized. They could not have unglued us if they tried. It became a cherished annual heritage. We like everything about it: time, romance, battle scenes, villains etc. <br /> <br /> Can we hate Monoco Bent with his constant sir? Classic! Moreover, who can be wildly excited when Justin closes the balcony?! What a winning moment! My heart always had a special place for me, both for Ory and Madeline. They were so romantic. Alone theme songs can get me a little trap. This movie is going on incredibly and I wanted to pick someone up to the end. It's urgent !!
