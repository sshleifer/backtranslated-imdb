For the first time I saw this picture, I was young. I was ten years old when I was released but because my family did not go to the movie theater, I saw it on the network TV. I think watching it alone ?? And then cry. This reaction was the only response to second film (Rocky was the first) and not much later than that. Why can not I say right; Larry "Rain" Morphy and Rocky Balbo or anyone else was not worthy of a win. I appreciate the debate, not for what he did, but the way he did his time. Stupid He did not need a stopwatch or freedom to get the honor. She ran because she ran. He needs no other reason. I have a rule today that, when I saw this movie in late television (only to be the most viewed in it), I must see what to do next morning. Thankfully, I do not like Shawkank Redemption or other favorites, so I'm still sleeping too much and I will never be tired of a man's unexpected prisons and personal victory story.
