My partner and I have never heard of this movie and decided to give a title of choice to the title from a list of movies without knowing the single thing about it. As it opened and released as cast, we thought, how bad could it be? - Cathy Betts, Jonathan Price, Rupert Everett, Lin Redgrave, Dan Accra, and more. As the story goes through, we get more excited about our selection, and soon the film lifts our lifespan. This is not a "cool" movie, but it is one of the rare movies which is a big combination of memorable characters, "strangers than truthful words", which I could not help but love it. Some of my marvelous stories were not "suspending my unbelief" on the elements because the makers of the filmmakers were so warmly impressed that they still manage to make fun of everyone involved. IMDB says it is a consolation movie and I would not be surprised if it became a classical classic.
