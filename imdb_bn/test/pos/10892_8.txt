There is not much that comes in "Goldeneye" as well as a story about a story-worthy and suspicious work-level level. When it came out, it was the greatest sport ever, and it is still strong today. <br /> <br /> I acknowledge that this game will become boring after a few months of playing and after two years I started playing again, again I returned to its best, almost the way I played it again. <br /> <br /> There are 20 level of work-level, which is probably the most popular James Bond game. Probably the most unforgettable tank level, which was probably the most explosive video game sequence at the time. And the use of Q gadgets as well as first-person shooting is that fans of James Bond are always going to die for use. <br /> <br /> Really, as a James Bond fan, I look for the true James Bond experience aspects which are now showing PS2 games. So this game has some great steps and usable gadgets, but I'm expecting something even in 1997 even back. Even I did not ask the game that this game was not in Q or M or Manipini or M6. While watching movies, Bond interacts with these characters on at least a few movies, but they are not seen anywhere in this game. And voice conversations have made the game more vivid than they have harmful text conversations using. They had the technology. They just did not use it. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most annoying feature of this game is that it follows the story of the film correctly in any way and on the other hand it is inappropriate. For example, there are two layers of two levels where you have to protect or save the drama, although in movies, she can take care of herself. There are some unnecessary levels of bottle level where you have to disable some bombs (which are not in the movie), which adds nothing to the story. Even you have some levels to rescue the level atheist, but at the beginning of the next level he was caught again. How? <br /> <br /> Oh well. Even those little things can not really be this game. And when I like new games, then you will not forget this bond's experience. <br /> <br /> Out of 10, 8 out of 10
