"The story of two sisters" is one of the most recent movies I have seen. Eventually there is no real supernatural element, despite being expected throughout a film. The story seems to be about two sisters, who, after some absence, after returning to his father's house (after the issue of having a mental resonance) is forced to deal with only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bipartisan when the mood moves towards the childhood, and they He says, then he makes special meals for another time. But some appearances are still unknown. Later, it is known that a younger sister is dead, and the heart of her older sister is only the one who can not save her, and her parents, who was cruel enough to die. The movie is not published on the specific subject of the strange family, but it certainly makes the audience amazed and confuses a confusion about it. Certainly not lightweight; See who you really want to think about what you saw. It's a hell of a puzzler.
