This movie was really good writing and was very entertaining. It was very well played. Luke Parry did a very believable job. (As she always does) If you look for an event movie you should be at the top of the list to see it. There is a mix of comedy, drama, and action. You can feel the feeling at the literal congratulations point. I was very impressed by this movie. Special effects have been very good. The whole movie was very believable. This movie is my favorite one. North America could collapse and stop an explosion by destroying Jack and his team in North America. It was a very cool and creative concept. I like this movie and I know you will be too.
