A little more than a 11-minute musical diversion (this is billed properly as "Tabloid Musical"), although every Sunday is one of the most famous and valuable documents in the history of the film, because it gives priceless attention to the growing competition of the two. The most talented and favorite singer of the screen: Dina Durbin and Judy Garland. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This claim is not entirely correct, coming for a renewed renewal. After being produced on Sunday every July in July 1936, Dana Durbin's contract with MGM was abolished and its agreement with Universal was signed one month earlier in June 1936. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Is allowed to do, which does not work in a new movie studio. Durbin's first car, three smart girls, was still not ready to start filming, MGM chose to use its option and officially returned to the Universal at the time, reflecting this unique short story on Durban MGM Lot. Cowgirl hopeful, Judy Garland <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This garland has a lot more earlier than professional experience / training (which was present in many previous short films), why every day Every Sunday can often feel that Judy Garland, Garland on Dana Darin, speaks more and sings a true song ("America"), when Durbu popular classical art songs, Luigi Arredi By "Il Bashir" has to offer. Definitely, it will create a perfect idea that MGM will want to support the other side of the competition from the competing studio to the players of another's own contract. Ironically, the character of Garland is even more actively active in this world of small girls Durbin and emotional "little miss fixt" screen personality, universal, which she will soon be the first superstar in the world with her first car, three smart girls. The world will be called the "Teen Idol", when Garland's more passive "Wistful Wallflower" teenage painting Mickey Rooney and his frequent collaborative partner ranata (jaigelda jiaiaraela) supporting the role of up-to-the lana Turner. Until its fifteenth MGM feature in 1944, for me and my cheek (which was its first fully "adult" role), Gerland was the only top title and "real attraction" immediately after six years ago. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Before its MGM rival. The screen's evidence strongly suggests that for the foreclosures, it was very quick to understand the full potential of the astronauts compared to MGM with MGM, and it is significant that Garland has achieved MGM through superstar billing. To be invited to plant his footprints in the grounds of the Chinese Theater in Grammen's Grammy, specially written cars for displaying his talent and appeal, to earn his "respectful" Oscar for his talent recognition, Prior to his gift, Dana Darbin loved MGM Contemporary < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bar concert run), Garland "Let's Pon on a show," Music in the brain, Mickey Rooney and darabinera 100 m. D. A girl. Unlike Garland's next Babbas film, the short story never takes the incredible story seriously, and as a result, its' eleven minutes of flying time flies. <br /> <br /> Of course, every Sunday true magic is already significant in the performance of Durbin and Garland talents / screen presents at the very beginning of their legendary crews. Even in this first phase, both girls also have outstanding screen presence, and they are completely natural and irrelevant in their presentation just like the singer and actress. The garland closes the screen with a lively, because it literally closes the song from "America". As the socks across the numbers with the proper hand gesture, Judy seems to literally chew on the words of the song because she shows her face and the bug in her intense interest to show how she can make her face. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, "Il Bacio," Durbin's presentation is much more demure and subdued. Although it is perfectly suited for its "classical" selection, Wart's distribution of Durbin's Ardettei is much more than the traditional "stand" n gai rather than the physical emotional celebration of Garland. However, even though "small deco" though with its own eyes, shiny smiles and uneducated delivery itself Without doing anything to attract attention, he easily holds the screen with "jazz baby" jodi and is in short time Their delightful dueting of "America." The producer also expressed more sorrow that the producer Joe Pastekova was not able to realize his dream of adding a darbine and garland to the movie (because Universal refused "to give the number one property" out of Durbin). br>> <br /> <br /> Two extraordinary and completely unique genius is a value of stranger talent Nov. documents. If you get a chance to see this one!
