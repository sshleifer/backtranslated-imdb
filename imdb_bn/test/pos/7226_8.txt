Other than Troma who can take classic tragedy and nowadays standard it can change around ???? Nobody ... In my opinion, Leonardo Di Capri also consumed one milk. Truman and Juliet have a specific stretch from the original Shakespeare tragedy, but it holds up well. Her sick, demented, rolled, but still insane fun and full. In most part it follows true Romeo and Juliet's story, but many tromba components are added. Kimen will give a great performance as Tromso. Acting is tough and the stories are great. Many have seen these movies, not only Coffman Tromas, but they are all what they distribute. Sure troma movie has an acquired taste, but you will see something like this. It is the creation of renegade film at its best.
