Without a doubt, a great round-the-clock show shows that if it is shown today, it will attract a huge following. Bodyguards had only 6 episodes and trailers, but it was also able to get more series to make it more dynamic. Very talented and versatile Shawn Pertway and Dynamic Lewis Lomber, it's really featured with the preferences of the prospects, the swine and theft money. The lines of the story have been based on diplomatic security services and with great filming and storyline and scene positions, it stands to some of the slowing down by other TV production companies. I do not think it is shown on the ground TV such as Sky or Freeview, it seems ashamed to show today's shame. Sure it's a great visitor to find visitors. So I hope one day people of Carlton TV's DVD, Cheers, Nick decide to release it.
