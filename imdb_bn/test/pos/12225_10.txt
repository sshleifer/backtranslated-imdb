I love this show. It's really unique. I was under the impression going to have more season. In the context of Series 2, I recently saw the series 1 again to refresh it after I started Part 2. Now after watching this I was excited and excited, so I came to the site to watch the schedule for continuation. I was really looking forward to seeing more of this series as I have seen plans for the second series are really frustrated. I think they really dropped this one ball. There was plenty of storyline left to build and unauthorized questions. I am now a very unhappy outlook and I hope they will review their decision and take away the story left where it is.
