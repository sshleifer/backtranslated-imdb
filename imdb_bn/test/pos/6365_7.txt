Many do not think Dan Acrood is funny. This movie is otherwise proven. Icoded this laugh is to give a one-writer the brightest. The only major problem with this is that, from the character of income taxoid, and yet to prove her fraud, she wasted a lot of time around jumping from a follow-up doctor. Doctor Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfas) like "What about the badboy?" The scene where Los Angeles is trying to get back is stupid, incredible, and unfunny. The other that these views are really interesting in the movie, especially the first half.
