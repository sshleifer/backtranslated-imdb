It is not denied. Saifai hard on TV. There are many problems that style comes with it. Good budget, hard writing, requires decent acting. Probably the budget and script writing sections where I think the maximum attempts have failed. So is "Surface" successful? Not entirely, but the maximum ones. <br /> <br /> As I can see, a good science-and-leisure show really does not need to do many CGI work, but it needs a tonne. What is the need to create a greater sense of life? The feeling that there is more than the eyes, the desire to make me weird and try to try and determine how it will end. Add puzzle pieces and sometimes "Ah!" Saying <br /> <br /> <br /> "Surface" had two errors. Firstly, its original foundation was not as exciting as soon as the story (or bold) I did not expect at the beginning. There is also a lot of time for TV-feeling. All the way from the quality of Crawfiz CGI (which is terrible to dread) in the acting department. It sometimes feels too little family-oriented that it sometimes takes the edge and becomes almost cutesy. But apart from this error it is an enjoyable show. Maybe there does not appear as spectacular as some of the other spectacular ones. But it guides me to be interested in the whole season, and it also provides some nice cliffhanger to the collections as well. The end for me is not that interesting. I did not like the show until I finished listening, the story was unsettled. This is especially unfortunate because the show seems to have been canceled after the first season (<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The series is the best actor, best production standard and above all the most difficult text. It's not HBO-quality, but it's good for it.
