I looked at another comment posted here, where the author discussed the annoying way of using this corpse's body of teenagers. Disgusting this statement probably makes them all the most annoying, no wonder how the character of Crespen Glover (Lenny) is done. He is happy to kill another friend of the murderer of one of his friends. Because Lenny did not like this person, rather he was excited about his death because it allowed him to do something. This poor boy has become bored in life, and is filled inside, because a murderer friend is excited because it gives him something to do.
