Jim Henson's The Muppate Movie is a charming, fun and bright film that can be obtained and enjoyed by adults and kids. I think this is my favorite childhood film because it combines great characters, great stories and great intellect that it is awesome. In order to follow the Hollywood dream of his audiogy across the United States, this plot makes Kemeritti a frog (dolls and voices by Henson). On the way, he is Fajji Beer, The Great Gunzo (my favorite), Miss Piggy, Rolf and Dr. Tooth and electrical damage <br /> <br /> There are so many good things in this movie that I can not say. But it's memorable and every time I think of dolls or muppets, I'll think about this picture. See Cymos from Mel Brooks, Dom Dulius, Paul Williams, Madeline Kane, Bob Hope, Richard Pierre, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen (and Charlie McCarthy), Elliott Gould, Carroll Kane and Great Orson Wales. Excellent and spectacular, one of the best of 70's. One ++,
