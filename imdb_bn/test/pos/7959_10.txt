Christmas is a perfect movie in August. A flawless movie about all the errors of humanity. On the outside it might be like a movie about death, but it's actually a movie of life. I can only recommend this movie enough. And do not be afraid, dear readers, this is not a boring movie. As it has been said, it is a movie about the brightness of life coach under the inspiration of death. You laugh You will cry You must understand life is fragile and short. And to see how you can better understand the valuable life. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (Visit www.nixflix.com for details. Review this movie and other foreign movies)
