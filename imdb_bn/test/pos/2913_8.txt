The King is worth the tomb buried! (OK, probably not that valuable, but if you can afford to down the victim). I think someone has not commented on this movie for years and I hope a new post will spark some new comments. This is a movie that I just reminded of snippets from childhood and only recently seen when I was tired of waiting to respect Fox's own past and that I was hunting for Korean DVDs (in English, but with unreasonable Korean subtitles). I will not go through a description of another long plot - saying that if I see it properly in the first widescreen format I will leave the app in film and film opportunity. Matt paintings are still kept, and the castle set is really breathtaking. But this is a small scale detail that lays the depth and prosperity of this film, which shows a glimpse of the Egyptian poverty as well as the lives of its nobility. The markets, hollels, docks, inhalation rooms, and barns are as fascinating as Pharaoh's throne rooms. Although errors are large enough (especially in the inheritance of the dynasty), the details are detailed in detail in detail in most Hollywood movies. Apparently, it is not without its flaws - Inwardly extrinsically outwardly outgoing and colorful. Nevertheless, it is a film that should be submitted for large-scale disorder. Tired? Part, absolutely. Overacted? Underacted? Yes, both - although 'different' may be a more appropriate description. Long? Not at all. I want them to spend more time with Xihu's experience with the House of Daughters and the Hittites, and with less time than his 'romance' with Nef. Historically wrong? Yes, that was too, but Shakespeare was so. Nobody chastises him for him. I appreciate the historical accuracy of the next person, but eventually it should be remembered that the movie theater, not the lessons of history.
