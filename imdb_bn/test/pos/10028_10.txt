After working with director Mikal Cartidge, after 7 films (Robin Hood's adventures were their best credits), Iral Flein was tired of his autocratic way and decided to work with the great Raou Wallace. This is a happy thing for reunion cinematography. The first and the best film together with them to bury them with their boots. Raoul Wallace illustrates General George Armstrong Castor (Errol Flin) from his debut in West Point, in a civil war and finally in the Battle of Little Big Horn. It is true that the picture shows a very brave portrait of the cast, but it is not important. What is important, we are transmitted with passion and greatness carried by the letters. California's Joe, who played "Gariouenen" with the song "Queen's Own Butler", starring Sharp Sharp, a good actor, Arthur Kennedy? This epic and sad freso remains.
