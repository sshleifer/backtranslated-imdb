"No Gun Gunn Play" (1967), Enzo G. Spaghetti, by Spaghetti Westerns, especially Lyon, is a very good pastiche operated by Castalli. The first half is superb, which opens directly with "Forward to Few Dollars for More", with the look of the Colonel Douglas Montemara and El Indo scenes with Monoco walking in a ghost town and then known as Beauty Hunter "The Stranger", a great gunfight (Especially the train-looting scenes), fast and furious move and Gilbert Rowland, George Hilton and (who is well-behaved Do not feel that they are managed badly) bairansa Ed. But then, when the film reaches half way, Hilton and Bayer√©s have a jockey box office. This is not very funny, and it's the weakest part of the film, but it throws up what you saw in a new light. You understand that the whole thing is a scandal of Spaghetti Western Conventions and in the backyard, the first half worked so well that you completely missed this inconsistency completely. What follows now is a clear parody, even some acrobatic jumping around Brian that he predicts seventy circus Westerns. The end, the complete transmission of "The Good, the Bad and the Kugali" climax is done very well, on the other hand it can be very stupid. So, a fantastic fun spaghetti Western, that's not very seriously. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Spaghetti Westerns.
