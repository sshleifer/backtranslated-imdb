Lemuel Golfer (Ted Danson) is a doctor who has left the pregnant wife Mary (Mary Steinberg) in the absence of the sea. Eight years later, he wandered about and apparently crazy - the land of Little Lilippatias, Giant Brobdinggas, the floating island of Lukutu of Intellectuals and Hunanhans, intelligent, ridiculed his courage in the role of horses about a horse. To deal with Yahoos - A nation of exotic people - in other other courage. The remarkable Dr. that is not designed on Lemuel's wife. Bates (James Fox) is detained in a psychological organization in Glover, and Lemuel, Mary, and son Thomas (Tom Sturridge) have to find ways to prove their intimacy. <br /> <br /> A great adaptation of Jonathan Swift's satirical novel, this image is an excellent adaptation on so many levels: Stories, Scepter, Character, Visual Scenes, Bright Cast. It was just a treat for watching and it was almost surprising that it was a made-for-TV movie. <br /> <br /> This image resounds the Swift's naughty satire ridicule to the captain of British times, but still resonates today. Wise Brobdings and Houyhnhnms are almost virtually impossible to understand about the perfect person who understands it is proud of Gulliver's vices and corruption in his society, such as pride. Gliwista is determined to distinguish itself from Yahoo, perhaps the best, by describing how they choose their leaders, they ridicule ridicule. ("They seem to be the worst among them, go to war (" We're just going to fight for just the best reason - as they are weaker than us, or we want all their land ") etc. The events involved in Laputa are also effectively implemented - the intellectuals So it is covered in their special field that they have no time for anything else, and really enjoys a little common sense. The addition of the book greatly enhances the story - Dr. Beats is a truly remarkable character, and when he gives a lecture to investigate the alleged complaint of the gun, it is clear that he is describing his own mistakes. <br /> <The picture is beautiful, and using fairly credible CGI effects Which illustrates the diversity of novels with great effect. The size contrast is a very good one To be carried out and described in the story all over the world believe in their own way. Cinematography (especially in the shelters), and costumes are brightly done. Lemuyelera memories that the current edit a machine can be weird, but it works very well. <br /> <br /> Cast is really amazing; A genius who is a British and American genius. Ted Danson has made excellent, multi-level performance, such as Gloulever, which effectively alienated his strange surroundings with his wonderful environment, effectively affecting his transformation from its end to his rational, intellectual personality, when he reappears. The most well-known for his work at City Come, Danson shows that he is more than Sam Malone with this wonderful Syriac-comic performance. Mary Steinberg is as effective as her wife, and James Fox is absolutely distorted as Bates. The rest cast is mostly made of cayos, most memorable with Peter O'Waul, Omar Sharif, Warwick Davis, Christian Scott Thomas, Geraldine Chaplin, Alfred Woodward, Edward Fox and Sir John Gilgood - but even the smallest parts have played very well. <br /> <br /> The book is not 100% trustworthy, but a victory for stories and images of "Galway's Travels". It does not have to be missed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
