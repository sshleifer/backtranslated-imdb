This is a wonderful movie and I want them to keep people in the DVD for purchasing people. It's hard to try to catch on TV all the time. You do not know when one of the stations will make it air. Would anyone say to me that a file company makes it so that I can write to them and see if they can publish it to the public? Yesterday I was caught only one and a half hours and it was only once last year. My sister and I are looking for all the shops that sell all the videos at all. John Denver is a great singer and great actor and plot line. They show a number of old films and I think it's great but they have a lot of what they did not get out and I think if we can contact the producers and make our requests, we can find some of them to find the DVD.
