I laugh off my ass for an hour. I had no idea who was Dan Phenty. Why did not you hear about Dan Finnt? She is violent and her backup singer. They create all these female songs that we never want to hear new experiences. They blow this song away. This was Bravo last night. Why is this Dan the man "very famous"? Great voice! Burning Church! He blew me away with this show! I read on the internet that he was once a member of "Stump", I guess he is not the one he can not do. I watched "Stump" a few years ago in UCLA theater and the people were amazing. This show was completed by Dreamwork last night! Does Spielberg do this? Why do they star this Dan Finnerty in a movie? At the end of this show, while every time the camera's audience was standing, everyone was in it, singing or singing. The whole show had this amazing power. My only complaint was that it was no longer, but looking back, when you see how tough these people have been, I guess it's impossible for a person to work with such pride for more than an hour. People I like this show!
