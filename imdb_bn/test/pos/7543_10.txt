There are other movies about the concerns of boarding school and students and staff, but the "Bells of the trinity" tower above them! Plot has been abridged by other posters, so I will not cover the same ground. I just want to say that it's shameful to end up in the DVD, but in a format that can not be used in the US! :-( <br /> <br /> Enjoy co-workers in New Zealand and Australia! And if anyone can read it then there is no tension in this case, please help with the encoding in Zone 1 to get it released on DVD! When possible will be notified via email (I will not say "if") it will be released from the United States DVD? Thanks!
