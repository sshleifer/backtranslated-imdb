Soul Calibu has always been my favorite fight game series. And SCIII series is one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The graphics are very well done. There is a lot of improvement on the sticky plurality of the Sol Edge / Sol Blade. There are facial expressions in the face of the characters, the hair flows in the wind and even they are full of glow. <br /> <br /> Sol Cali has always been known for his attractive plot and characters, and there is no exception to SCIII. Each character has detailed his / her background story and done well. My favorite character is Chia Jiangghua. She is cute, she is funny and she is a strong female character. Yes, I know that he is wearing a pink and a boyfriend (he has finished protecting BTW), but he seems more than that. Like all other characters, Jianghua has their personality flaws and compromises, so no character is perfect, even good boys are not. <br /> <br /> The music is nicely protected for a series of games. It's not a tick (vampire series) and it's not a word like the soundtrack of old school porn movie (Martial Combat). Characters have their own themes and the theme is completed in conjunction with the culture of that particular part of the world. I do not think there is a song on this soundtrack that I do not like. <br /> <br /> Another great thing about this game is to create your own anime-like character (create a soul). If you want her could make her look as cute or sexy or even ugly as she is. However, if you find a letter customization you want, remember to take notes or else you do not remember how you created that letter. I think that myself is very addicted to KAs. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think Sull Calibu is my best number one series. It has everything I ask. What else i want
