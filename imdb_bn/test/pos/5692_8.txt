"Black Water" is one of the most painstaking films ever seen. The story moves quickly because it follows three tourists (all great actors) on a tour with a boy tour guide in a small boat. After dropping anchor in the remote areas of the swimming pool, they entered into the water with a huge amount of water. <br /> <br /> Hesselli, they can handle it in a nearby tree near three because they understand that a crocodile attacked them. Over the next two days, they try to escape the evil eye of narcotics, and they do not seem to want to go away. The movie just drags a little bit, but what can you expect from the setting and the limited budget? It is much better than "privval" and other recent crocodiles / water hunter thrillers. Taut heavy, and give three leads to awesome performance. Really cool, the claustrophobic fear in my movie hit a deep sound. Apparently based on facts.
