(spoilers?) <br /> <br /> I heard some gripe about special effects. But that should be frustrating from the movie. This movie is a mysterious film. And it's that very good. So from that standpoint, this movie is the stone. Frank rock Enjoy one plastic heart content. So no complaints for this movie. Until you can see the English box, which is the total first. This creates confusion, it's a B movie. <br /> <br /> I have a complaint that DVD's music video. Who can not sing this song I want to know. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Repeatable: 5/10
