I recently hired "The Sinisa Syndrome" because I read that it was a movie that inspired ABC to "dere deaf". "Syndrome", though, is more of a thriller than a play. The film is quite political, but I firmly agree with his message - nuclear power, though very effective, it is very dangerous for ordinary use. The risk is simply too much. Hopefully, people who are in charge of the real nuclear plants are more responsible and moral than the illustrators in the film. However, the real life of the real disaster on three miles island was released only after a few months of publication. (In fairness, perhaps in that case there was more incompetence than corruption.) <br /> <br /> "Syndrome" is not critical of the nuclear energy, but similar to the modern press "network", only more serious. Being a print journalist, I am quite familiar with how I see the media. But it was a little afraid to see that even 70's TV news has already been sold. When Jane Fondara's character allows his boss to give real news instead of the lungs, he is advised not to try to change him, because "in the study" people like a beautiful girl who does not have a hard hair. <Br/> <br /> Whatever the movie makes it memorable, however, this is the incredible mystery created in the final third. During this time, the audience is always scared for the life of the heroes, whether they have thrown the danger or the potential chaos of nuclear plants is coming from danger. And the last scene - I would not give it up - but it would guess you. <br /> <br /> In a final note, I feel that this movie has got a unique feel to watch a movie like a TV movie compared to a true theater film. However, the rental tape that I was seeing was old and the TV screens were not formatted to fit, which are today like videos and DVDs.
