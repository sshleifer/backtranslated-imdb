I know very well the thirsty in Chen-yuk Park, but it takes enough time for two hours to spend two hours with Tai-Zu (Ok-vin Kim) that anyone can tolerate for such a time. Sang-Hyeon (Kang-Ho song) A priest who wants to work as a volunteer for experimental research to attack himself with a specific virus related to severe injections. Instead of legally die, Haiyan became a vampire, always hungry blood for living blood lets him prevent a contagious disease that brings back the symptoms of flat-lines he started with. (Obstruction / rash, and vomiting of blood in the body). ). Damp, as it is known in the vampire style, it has caused abusive death when it exposed the hind for a long time. Heine's sick childhood friend Kan-wu (Ha-Qun Shin) wife seeks with Tee-Zu. Te-Zu was received by Mrs. Rae (Hem-cuke Kim), which was considered as a puppy and is often used as livestock. So-Zu is unfortunate and starts an intense relationship with Heine, soon after killing him, he believes that he is the victim of abuse. To cancel her priesthood, Hain Dives proceeded in relation to Ti-Zu, soon enough participants willing to kill a beggar. This incident, which contributed to T-Woo (.. using a lake, between the lake, both of them began to burial under the sea, Tai-wi re-sponsored Kang-Bho while trying to re-enter) Hunt both , As Kang-wao is becoming "absent" (Hain released him, where police can not find his body). Soon Mr Roy was a stroke (.. However, one finger and his ability to blink his eyes increasingly contributing to his story, which is more aware of the progress of the story), and Haiyan-Ai-joo gives a special birthday present. Vampirism So doing, Hine has created a giant. Hei-Zu acknowledged (though a slip of the tongue) that, in fact, Kong-Wai never hurt him, and soon after being thirsty for blood, he realized that the killing would not be moral or mentally disturbed for the supply. There is a hand in hand, to overcome this type of mental injury to the hayain society will have to take frustrating measures. <br /> <br /> I would say that thirsty is one of the best horror films. It has been seen since 2009. It accepts a systematic approach to the park and we are taking a dark road with Haiyan and Tai-Zu, because they do terrible things with positive work from their illogical union. Hyen's love causes innocent people to die (.. which ends once the end is converted into intimate love), and if he does not like painful, then it will end. We see their heads inside their souls, and it is not always beautiful. It can be quite tedious with them for two hours .. But, for the appreciative behavior of the director, a fifty pieces are sliced ​​into pieces and how the wrong people can be given the power of vampirezarm. Hein, instead of opening it as a happy soul, accepts "hell" for Tae-joo so that anyone can see thirsty as a unique love story, but not exactly as good. <br /> <br /> Violence, while there is a tendency to move away from the park's highly graphic details, there is probably enough sadism involved in doing a little bit of stomach. In a very short time, the path of violence can have permanent effects. The sexual environment between Hyon and Tai-Juo can be quite hot and loving even when it is irrational and morally reprehensible. Film, I think, still a complicated test of affection should be attached to an object (passion).
