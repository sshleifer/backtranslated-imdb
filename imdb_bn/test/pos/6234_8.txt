Slash films can start 30 to 35 years before this movie, but believe me among the pearls that it will hold for longer after you set up on TV. Especially if you are easily afraid of a person but this is a movie for you that you have no stomach to fill it out. Even after many years the movie has lost its common and thriller. <br /> <br /> There is no blood, but the thrill will definitely freeze your spine. The film starts from the beginning and it ends up at the same pace. BGM nervous cracking and I think these days were copies of many Indian films. Dear King? No wonder ... why I wanted to see it and it did not give me up. "Do not Stop the Lamp" ... Coz you can not find Enrique but sitting behind you can be a sunny doll! Beware <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
