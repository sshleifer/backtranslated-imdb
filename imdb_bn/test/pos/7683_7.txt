I'm waiting 30 years to see this picture. I play the soundtrack album as a teenager and through my 20s. Recently, I located a reasonably valuable DVR and I saw it this morning. It was on the widescreen, maybe 70mm print, stereo, the colors were quite good, very few fading, certainly not the remastor, but I'm very happy with this clean copy. <br /> <br /> for the movie now. It's really great I do not have to say great it's great scene though. Maybe Premingma might not have been the right director for him, but I would say that. The central part of the film for me was the scene of the heroine. Wonderfully managed by Premminger. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, acting scenes are better than musical scenes, or the order of musical instruments is bad. definitely no. They lack ... though some Perhaps it has no close ups and very little medium shots. It was almost like watching a film production in a stage production. Probably think that lover is going after. At the end it can not be the right choice, but it goes away. It's far from a devastating movie. <br /> <br /> It is said that everyone does not love the singers of the suittrea. I always have They are perfect for this photo. I love the singer's voice. The actor is superb for the most part of the sinking lip. I just wish the song had walked more imaginatively. Sportin 'life is not worth the number two, but close numbers feel even intimate. They just think ... away Still, you can not deny the power of music. And at the end, that comes through loud and clear. Again, Prumming's work was trying to get out of the way she was working with the incredible music. I believe he had the right idea, but perhaps it was far too far from that direction. <br /> <br /> acting is horrible. Top Kudo works great brock Peters and performs a song of the Crown Party. She is the absolute lot. We just want him to leave the poor base alone, and he does not. As proud, arrogant and nasty, he is the classic revivalist of Sammy Davis Junior's Life of Life, and is a very characteristic of it and its very characteristic. Well, Davis plays the best movie. The poor base can not manage just two bad men. I am glad that Hermes gave Pan Davis a Dance Dance Number. <br /> <br /> Dandris and Potírea were not impressed due to being in the film, really sweet together. I do not know about chemistry ... between Dandिज and Peter, there was more chemistry between Dondrijas and Peters. Still, it works fine for Dorothy and Sydney. Even <br /> <br />, I think they should be proud of both of these pictures they work on. They both managed to bring multiple tear to my eyes. Their properties are very 3D and trustworthy. Porgy of Sydney Poitier, however, seems to find the place in almost catfish rows. I could not remember that he was at Mr. Brethet "Sir with Love", very educated and disciplined and spoken, had fallen into difficult times. Perhaps he did not like my first choice for Porsche, but hey, he was a huge star at that time, why not? Dorothy's base was perfect as its Carmen Jones, in fact this time was even more weaker. Carmen was probably a dazzling part to do his job. <br /> <br /> In fact, a very good movie, two sticks less than what I would say to the classic. It's not just the ultimate classic grade. Still, there is no reason why the world's Gershwin estate decides to keep this beautiful movie, even its faults are hidden from the public. Premingma may have some strange choices as a director, but the film is nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed for anyone involved in it. What is this and worse than that of the movie, which is embarrassing on DVD and today's theater. Porgy and Bess are not one of them.
