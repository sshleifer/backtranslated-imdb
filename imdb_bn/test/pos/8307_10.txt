This movie I saw as a movie second movie. It is afraid of living shit from me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I still have the fond memories of this defective masterpiece of horror. Doug McClure and Peter Kushing the same movie! Great! Polypropylene substitute made monsters. Scary stuff. When you think of it as a rubber monster, it's horrible than a real monster. <br /> <br /> What a wonderful thing about this movie is the good score. Really a royal thing. <br /> <br /> There are lots of prehistoric titles here too. I'm glad
