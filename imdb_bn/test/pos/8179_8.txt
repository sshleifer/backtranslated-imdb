This movie is not meant to expect Marshall-Arts Agaganza. For historical accuracy, I let that matter be better informed. I was amazing at the performance. Gong Li was not disappointed as the wealthy and (primarily) trusted consonants of the King Kong. Fengyi showed a lot of flexibility in illustrating a ruler descending in the lunatic crazy. Instead he resorted to ranting resort, chose "Hannibal lecture" route. For me, the best performance was as SuperMouse Marquis from Jihan Wang. The character is very oily, but in a fine "Sir Hamfrey Appleby" - yes the minister is in such a way. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is the ideal feature of this film. Mecca and his men were excited about the storm scene in the palace. There are a number of wonderful war scenery. Therefore, this image is highly recommended on the big screen.
