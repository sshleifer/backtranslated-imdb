Brad Hardy, played by Joseph Mazzello as a child affected by AIDS and his new young neighbor, played a difficult radical for hard work by Brad Renfro, incredibly close to emotion and emotion. Although the story may seem a little distant (although these two boys try to find a doctor hundreds of miles away on the riverbed, which claims to be cured of AIDS), the emotion, actions and interactions of all involved characters are sadly closed in real life. Being a "big brother" at the same age as the film was released a few years later, I strongly recommend this picture that a child of AIDS was surprised at what happened in AIDS life. The beautiful aspect of Peter Horton creates perfect mood and setting for each scene and attracts visitors to various emotions influenced by friendship, illness, bias, and the ultimate partner of two friends, who fought hard to overcome the danger.
