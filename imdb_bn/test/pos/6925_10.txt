Although the plot of this film is a little bit away, it is only valuable for Michaels Kain and Gamble's performance. The next one really delivers the wonderful Dublin accent. Caine hams it up ... He's just playing what the character has to do. Recreational and fun, this easy watching an hour and a half.
