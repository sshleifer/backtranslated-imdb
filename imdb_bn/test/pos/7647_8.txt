This surprised me. <br /> <br /> I read a few reviews before, it's called a good B-grade movie and was ready for the worst. Through Halfway I suddenly realized that I was completely locked up and enjoyed it a lot. With the reach of remote control or any other object you were in a very awkward moment. Overall, this movie is not eligible for the B-grade tag. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < I hope these guys continue with big budgets and some studio backing.
