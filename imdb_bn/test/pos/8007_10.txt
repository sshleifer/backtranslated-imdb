And a perfect movie to watch during the holiday season during the season, which is a winter / Christmas atmosphere made for the city of Burton Gotham. Warner decided to release it as a summer movie, it's weird. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! A high-class family puts their mutant child under the sewage, a socially crowned dresses wear in leather as a gemstring gem, wearing a red dress like a solo secretary dresses and running a fix for the political office. And S & M and slavery are presented in a very distorted way. But Burton went with her. His visual style is the best in this film. <br /> <br /> This and Batman: Dead End is the only true live-action avatar of the comic-book character. Indeed, the animated series was the closest to the source material, but compared with Batman always and then compared to the non-nominal one, Batman Returns is the best of four. <br /> <br /> The bold and more violent first film, Gothic Pathos, has reached a new high. I was very interested in Michael Keaton like Bruce Wayne (do not start me even in George Clooney!), He showed the exact balance of strange lonar and calm crime warrior. As Michelle Pfieffer Catwoman (like many sexier and more 'realistic' cats), she wears that leather party better than Holly Berry. And Danny Davito was so strong as Penguin that his scenes became annoying to see. And Christopher Waken is brilliant like the fantastic Max. (If you think chip shake can be identified but it is none other than the small lefface / butterfinger). <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman's score is even better than the first time. Round. His strong and engaging themes are better than the next two Shumahan films. The film is a genre of Batman. Forget the sequels below and the animated series after this. Hopefully Christopher Nolan and Christian Bell will be able to get some honesty from live activation live action live with their movie next year. <br /> <br /> This DVD was one of Warner DVD's first released DVDs (about 7 years ago! !!) and there is no feature in it and case is a snapper. I like it like cheap up and hope for an SEO in the future.
