The last person who died the new year, is cursed to run the phantom carriage throughout the year, raising the souls of the dead. <br /> <br /> I saw this old silent Swedish horror movie from YouTube. , And decided to track the whole movie. It was valuable to find work, it was an absolutely amazing movie when it was created. It has a wonderful eerie atmosphere. Old-time horror movie makers really knew how to create the perfect atmosphere. Sadly, many filmmakers today do not understand how important the setting and atmosphere are, and go for the cheap shaking. Considering its date of visual effects production, excellent. If you can find a copy of it, I highly recommend giving it a watch. 9/10
