I agree with Andy, it's a good movie. The character of Kevin McKidd is credible all over the world. We are forced to hate him and then sympathize with him. Playing Roberts, who has a good seductive performance It is worry-free without worrying about stimulants and stimuli on production. Director Alison Paibel and author Andrea Gibbs credit Seeing a very suitable. The film's speed is okay, instead of bombs you with a documentary style, you've got enough interest in the subject. Very little soundtracks are used to go with the film, but it is not used to deliberately, to distract you from the story. Recommended.
