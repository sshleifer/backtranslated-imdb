Leno talks through its powdered line. This joke spoils, who you have not figured it for them. His show is held in a micro-size studio for one reason, or two reasons - small amounts will be extended and some want to see him. Letterman's set pole opposite - Ed Sullivan will be proud and the balcony will always be full. <br /> <br /> NBC, NBC firm, will never find it. All about the founding of David Stern's megalomanian enterprise. At least it seems to be a bit of CBS family. <br /> <br /> Leno drives cars or stamps, Letterman drives cars. The difference is informative. <br /> <br /> When I talked, I would ask other chats to email me if Leno _ver_ said something that was funny. I did not get a single email Letterman has fantastic time. He can reuse the most unreasonable joke of becoming one of the funiest things in this night's sleep. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Letterman has created other careers. Paul is now well-known and honored with his own musical rights. Even Paul's other band members get recognition and boosting career. Biff Henderson has become a name for America. Even the same block businesses like the Ed Sullivan Theater have increased. Has Leno ever made for anyone else? Personally, I'm glad Dave left and got Leno Curseon Gig. I have never seen the NBC show before and after that there was no reason. <br /> <br /> The top ten list is an American icon. So Letterman. Leno is an actress dream, nothing else.
