I think this movie will be one of the most popular and hearty movies of recent times. <br /> <br /> The film starts with suicide in school toilet. Who does not see it, then it goes back to the beginning of the day and we can get 6 letters and they are going through a lot of heavy things, but eventually one of them will commit suicide. <Br> <br /> I have tried to teach physical education in school for 8 years, and sometimes I have not seen in a movie what really is happening in the school's life. <br /> <br /> The picture is shot nicely, and sounds incredible. <br /> <br /> The end is so frustrating, and so what does not expect, something that will scoff me for tomorrow. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, in the picture. <br /> <br /> If you want, the film is shot in two separate modes. Firstly the smooth observation style where we are going through their plays, we can learn the letters of their school environment, but the stunning parts of the film are in the interview section, where we can learn the stories of letters and their deepest, darkest thoughts <br /> <br /> You are surprised , Who is going to be doing it (by suicide) and the drama, as you like, keep changing your mind, as much as It does not matter to the dam until it encounters you. Last five minutes I'm everywhere in my writing, but I saw it in the media screening of Australia, and I'm still a little disappointed. <br /> <br /> In recent years I saw one of Australia's best Australian films.
