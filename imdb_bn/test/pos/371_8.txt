I knew the scenes of this movie, and perhaps I can not miss a good sound film, especially from Sir Alfred Hitchcock, director of "Master of Suspense". Originally tennis champion Guy Henes (Fary Granger), Benoun Anthony (Robert Walker) met a surprising newborn baby on a train from Washington to New York. Bruno talks about a perfect murder, Guy hates his wife, and Bruno hates his father, so Bruno proposes to "kill" him. Guy obviously did not take him seriously, certainly Gaia's wife Mary Joaise Henes (Casey Rogers (Laura Eliot) is murdered in an entertainment park. Guy is certainly the main suspect, and Bruno reminds him of his "plan" and "jumps into it" And to give him more help to kill his father than death, investigating this murder and bruno romance his Niss has threatened the carrier, and Sen. Morton (North by Leo G. Carroll in North West), his relationship with Anna (Ruth Roman), Bruno has realized that Guy will not kill him, so to prove that he is guilty of crime for crime Decided, Gaia's monogrammom cigarette lighter in the recreational park. After her tennis game, Guy and Anna (who apparently found "kill") Who had participated in the Amusement Park competition to stop Bruno, and had control of their speed control carrozels, also as director Patricia Hitkak (Director's daughter) as Barbara Martin, as Mrs. Lorraine as Mrs. Anthony, Jonathan Helle as Mr. Anthony, Captain of Howard St. John's Police. Terly and John Brown as Professor Collins and Man cameo in a double bus carrying itakokera was boarding the train. Some interesting dialogue and character interaction, some good mystery moments, and of course endless carousel finishes, a good classic film. This was nominated for Best Picture Oscar. Sir Alfred Hittak had 75 number of 100 Most Pop Culture Icons, the film was 100, 100 in 100 years and 32 numbers in 100 thresens. very good!
