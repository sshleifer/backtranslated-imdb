Yes, I know my title sucks. I can not think of any other title. X] Ice is a bright first season episode. Very interesting ideas and well-played as well. My opinion of whole pest-things was really vague. I have never been a fan of insects, so all pest episodes are strange to me. X] However, go good and bad about this episode, <br /> <br /> Good: parasite thing. Wonder! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <33 <br /> <br /> It was good to keep another parasite in the ear. Although someone told me that he should have kept it in my ear ... I think the entire cabin will die. <br /> <br /> How bad dog survived so long? <Br /> <br /> Huffman did not get that black spots? Or maybe he did it, but nobody saw it ... <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Very good episode, especially for season 1.8 / 10
