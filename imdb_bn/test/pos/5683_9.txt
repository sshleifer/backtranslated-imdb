One of the best horror / suspense movies I've seen in a long time. Wow, seeing how good this movie was, it was surprising and surprising, sometimes it would be like a gem sponsor but rare I expected a lightly variable way to spark a popcorn giant and spend a late night but instead made a very well made and directed movie with great acting and made with passion and heart. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that lets you think of characters and what will happen to them, and it is illustrated like you and it really is happening. I compared some people to other reviews with "open water", but I disagree because I thought that open water was quite annoying and medium, although the film was opposite, although it was depicted in the same "realistic" style on the surface. <<br> <br /> Actors are unknown, at least to me, but they are all very effective and reveal the terrible intensity and terrible situation of reality. The story is well done and flows smoothly, the plot can be logical and anything that can happen, all the actions and thoughts of the letters are a person who thinks and think about it. Very credible and this makes the movie more realistic. <br /> <br /> I finally had tears in my eyes. I must say that I have little effect on this movie, how strong and emotional the film was and I was appropriately influenced by this great film director and actor.
