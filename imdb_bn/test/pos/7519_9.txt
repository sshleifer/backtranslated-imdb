If you like Paddy Buisvsky's "Network" you probably also like this black comedy, because it's another brilliant Chevysky script, a wonderful mockery of big city hospitals and a good car for geo. C Scott He or his hospital has ever seen a major burn out of the day on chaos in major hospitals. Her personal crisis is heading around and she is surrounded by her hospital, local residents are protesting against the hospital, and patients and doctors are dying at a dangerous rate, because thanks to the Bible inspired and killer Sabot. The modern, the theater declared itself "fool for Christ," "Parquet of the parrot", "Rage of the Lamb" and "the angel of the abomination", he heads the doctor, manages severe injections, and frees patients' identities. , Which results in the treatment and operation of the wrong people. <br /> <br /> This image makes you uncomfortable, such as serious errors (like no hope, not much, often not in one place), and at the same time make you laugh at the priceless portraiture. One Richard Dissert ("LA Law.") As Welbeck, a celebrity surgeon who spends a lot of time about his investment and public business stock, spent a lot more time than his patients, who suffered more severely than his huge apathy and negligence. Diana Rig is free-spirited, Diana Rigge, as Hippie-Is Barbara Drum, who seduces Medieval (Scott) helpless chief and tries to escape with him. Then the barbarous killer, who is Barbara's father and "works a lot" in the Indian reservation, where he lives with his daughter and even runs the clinic, but who gets mad by returning to the civilization. Far is the most powerful portrait of Scott's. Bak, who fooled the soul as a former boy's talent, failed the father and husband, the bright doctor and the acting administrator, who constantly dreamed of suicide but had to undergo his job demand. Scott's role of this claim is exceptional. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The protesters, local Riot people will take and kneel down to the hospital. Seeing a furious killer at work, a suspect Chihovski tells us to drive our crazy society to do this, as it has been said that he is a different person away from the city and the people. <br /> <br /> For some years like my own father, I had some idea about the chief administrator of the big hospital, his job demand and his responsibilities. This story makes Lynnpin the responsibility that surrounds the crisis of scooters. This is both a funny and scary film, until the significant demand of actor Chayevsky's script. This is a movie that I get when I see it.
