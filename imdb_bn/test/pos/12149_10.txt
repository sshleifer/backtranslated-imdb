The weird one should only be able to stumble into the "Classe Tous Risques" by chance; It should be in a "best movie-silent" list with IMDB. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is as good as ever! Knowing the circumstances of his terrible, subtle family, his extravagant face and brief dialogue increase excess weight. Belmando's tight-headed performance shows only an excellent actor - and he should have been. <br /> <br /> "Clash toss risque" is completely tiny, dry and cold, without Melville's artistic scenery, excellent face and fancy car. It almost fills the film-noor neo-reality. Some of Dabhos, hard words to keep their children in the privacy of their children, keep your neck down to the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The final sentence of the film - the last ten more of the doves, there is no sound of words - it turns harder in the stomach. <br /> <br /> The original jewel of the great crown of French film Nir.
