This is an event where the script behaves with viewers in a way that extends this story in just 90 minutes. The story started in 1969, where a young girl named Believer (Cameron Diaz) traveled Europe with her boyfriend Wolf (Christopher Exelston), but she died in mysterious circumstances. Then in 1976, Faith's sister Phoebe (Jordanian Brauer) decided to travel to Europe and tried to discover what had happened to her sister. In France, he saw Olof who is there and he wants to help him recover his steps taken by his sister and answer some questions. He is reluctant but decides to travel with him. Along with the incident, he filled up the gap in the incident and told Phobek that the belief had joined the Red Army, an extremist group involved in terrorism. Phoebe and Wolf are involved in a romance and this belief goes to Portugal where the complex died. Many of these things are wrong with this movie and it will be done with all the scripts. First, the romance between Wolf and Phoeb's is all wrong and nothing is for the story. It comes across as a complete lie and ring. It seems strange that Wolf joins romance with his deceased girlfriend sister. Secondly, Wolf knows what happened with faith, but in a short period of 15 minutes or more, leave the information in a little bit. Wolf spins every 15 minutes and says, "There is something I did not tell you"! Yes, thank you so much wolf! When Woolf spoke for the first time to speak in Phobate, the film ended in about 30 minutes. Another thing to bother me was that I do not think that this film was rebuilt in the 1960's. Diaz wear hippie dress but do not just ring the truth from time to time. I enjoy some things like authentic location where the image is shot. This is a very good looking film and scenery beautiful. Performance is all well by Bruce and Diaz. Apart from "Fast and the Furious", I have never really seen Bruce. But after watching his acting in this film, I was very impressed. He is very good here and I hope to come to his way of good roles. This script is very intelligent and the film does not come across as credible.
