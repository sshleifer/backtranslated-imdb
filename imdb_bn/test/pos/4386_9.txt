I have just seen all the movies of Coen brothers, and I would say it is one of their best films. It's better than "Big Lebowski" I will not dare, but it was very good in my own right. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was very fun and fun. I love all the characters, especially Team Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turur (Pete). <br /> <br /> I can not say anything about this movie, but this film is not all for everyone. It may be safe to choose if you like other coen brothers movies but you also like it. And if you like what you saw in the troll, but you think you would like this movie, but do not grab it. However, I hope you like it (D) I do the film as much as I do. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> - Chris
