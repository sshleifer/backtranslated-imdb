There are several books that have cited it as the oldest gay movie. I do not see this as gay as all that lesbian homosexual senses but then the world has its attraction that saw the dance in the world did not have to be the first movie musical. <br /> <br /> This comment has been commented long before the end of a gay critique. The film was quickly rejected as a fool and a test was done after drinking too much at night ... Well I have heard that story before. <br /> <br /> This picture is an oddity and if people want to consider its first lesbian movie it may be. Anders Ender died more than the sadness of 1912.
