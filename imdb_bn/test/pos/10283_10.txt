L'Appartement, I think, is a very purposeful HitachiCinema film. The plot was decorated with symbolism (ie, white and red rose) and the holes of plot, which neatly wrapped itself. The look was very parisian and you pulled around the story. I have seen it in London and do not regret it in the state's video
