With the unfortunate failure of the box office at the exact combination of star-director and content every year, the title of the super-expected red-hot big-budget headline can not be estimated. This year it was Superman Returns. In 1982, it was the Blade Runner. In 1957 it was Billy Wilder's Spirit of St. Louis, which was a movie - the top director, the big star, the real selling story of the American hero - except for the audience's expenditure on his expenses. Perhaps the public is still in high esteem for the anti-Semitism of Lucky Lindy and the achievement of Nazi Germany before the war (not that it is covered in the film, which eventually receives the mythological title with the advent of Paris). Maybe they thought that they knew the story, or it could only be a man stuck in a cockpit for two hours. Of course Wedders and co-authors Wandell Mess are aware of Lynberb's relatively unexpected flight dramatic error, changing the flightback structure of the main points of his life and the flight itself build-up. After the film was airborne, it found genuine drama in an attempt to navigate without being suspicious and suspicious, both trying to be awake and without proper equipment. <br /> <br /> It creates some horrific horrific ideas that are different from anything else. In the painting of the Wilander, it is related to the real feeling of the epic: Before the flight, the enemies flutter around the dark dawn in the storm like a violent storm. Even in general, muted and problem-prone Warner Claire even adds the film instead of isolating it from it. Along with the excellent use of the cinemusic, Franz Waxman has excellent scores: bright, agitated but extremely harmful fills, and impressively used to shine as part of the fabric of the film instead of musical music. The film can lose points for frustration, although in reality it is not true that it was the first race to fly the Atlantic. In fact, the third person in Linterberg who flew across the Atlantic, almost completely forgot Bright Alcock and Brown's Wonderful Flight eight years ago - but it still deserves an extraordinary period and engrossing adventure stories that are not available in success.
