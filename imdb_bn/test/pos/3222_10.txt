Obscure !!!!! I have every season in my Gilmore Girls and I think that the script is so smart I love it so much because it is not your average comedy show, but if you miss it, then it is not a break after a joke. Miss it And it's not like a soap opera drama because it does not use theatrical music, and the actors do not ever surprise that stupid Chess. I think Gilmour Girl is one of the best shows on her TV show of her time. It's fun because they are talking so fast you can laugh to go back for the first time and laugh at other jokes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The show is just amazing. I definitely recommend this to anyone who has a good time and wants to spend some time with family, this is definitely the show for them. The only sound that can describe Gilmour girls .... Classic !!!!!!
