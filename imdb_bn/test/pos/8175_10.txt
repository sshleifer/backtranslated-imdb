A very great movie <br /> <br /> A big love story Many of the sword fighting. Huge battle scene Heros and Villen True history <br /> <br /> There are very few Chinese history in the West. China founded Jachundi China. The country is actually named after him. Some people are familiar with the newly discovered Terra quota army. It is a historical epic, how he ended the United States and united China's period. He established a dynasty for only 14 years, but it was replaced immediately by the Han Dynasty, which permanently defined the Chinese civilization for ever. <br /> <br /> She was almost contemporary with the CCPO, Hanibal and Fabius on the west side of China (or as the king of Jangi, who was known before the establishment of the empire)). Parallel Roman world dominance (western and eastern world) was achieved without a single strong personality like China. It will not be for the second century of West Bengal before the earliest comparative western painting is made in the West. <br /> <br /> Chinese have been shown here very sympathetically, but they are sent to the brutal cruelty of the film. History only records the cruel, cruel part, but the sympathetic startup leaves the room for the development of genuine character through this long film. The fact that a famous story about a meeting with the killers can really be a two-thousand-year old event. Gong Lee is beautiful. He is the emotional root of the story. It makes for all the great movie making.
