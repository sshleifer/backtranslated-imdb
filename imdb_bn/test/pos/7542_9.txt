A fun British comedy for the girls' school in mid-1950s. Girls are all involved in seizure and harmful, bathtubs, smoking and gambling. Alastair Simm will play the role of a great drummer in the headmaster, as well as playing the Milicant's brother. A female police officer goes to school underwear to see what is happening. This picture is great, great sight gags and Alastair SIM is great. Just a classic Britsh comedy, not much fun and very cruse. Joan Sims North Sydney James, many acted in movies, played a small role, but the film is about women. It spawned 3 sequels and a recent rebuilt. See and enjoy where all started.
