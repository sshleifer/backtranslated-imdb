In the 1970's we saw the rise and fall of being known as the "BlackSpoliteration" film. The term is a reference to a broad catch instead of a genuine film. In short, a comedy, drama, adventure, Western or urban police and robbery shot-ups, which are so created and cast for mid-20th century big cities to appeal to black populations. Since it was looking at the inner-city black population, it could actually embrace a wide range of films. <br /> <br /> It seems that these films have shown interest especially to black Americans. It was born with the publication of 100 Easter Rifles (Marvin Schwartz Prade ./20th Century-Fox, 1969) of Easter Time. Among them, Cliveland Browns, Jim Brown's former Siracusia University All-American Footballer and several Times All-Pro Fullback, was a co-starring billing. For example, Rio Consches (1964), The Dirty Dozen (1967), (ICE Station Jibra (1968) * and others studio's "Soots" gym was a hot property. <br /> <br /> Now these 100 refreshes Mr. Brown To see, the Central Business District of the big cities of Easter Sunday brings a record number of black patrons. Why not start taking more pictures? This adventure epic and more black players and other types of stars In reality, we are seeing the way in the private detective films, comedies and all the heirs of police and robbers, on the way, we finally got some more family oriented, interesting films. The film's passengers were solar (1972), The Tech (1974), Conquer (1974) and in the end, Claudeine (1974). <br /> <br /> Claudeine, the story is universal as we have no scandal as "blackplight" Or find the simple category, and it can be easily accomplished as a human story.New descent, anywhere, and not just in the United States of America. <br /> <br /> This story is a single mother, Claudine ( Dean Carroll), struggled to keep a family together ".... two marriages and two marriage marriages. "A lot of tears from a set-up-up of Hartem Style. The problems that the everyday citizens of our country face are confronted and tested under ol sociology microscope. <br /> <br /> But we also consider Claudine's mental and physical needs as one Let's consider as a woman. "Male and female need a man's needs for a woman", and we accept this point. (The SEX we talk to Say, Schultz!) Clauden Private Scavner Garbage Man, Ruppert B. Marshall (James Earl Jones) meet with a very old, wide shoulder, type of athlete and they go on a date. <Br> <br /> with the Great Welfare State Couple Claudine's Welfare Case Worker, Miss Takayque (Elisa Lottie), intervened, walked around to meet this untoward man, who suddenly came from Claudine's family He is giving so much attention. <br /> <br /> After the humiliating experience with the Wellington Bureau auditing and "Cutting" bing, which would be ideal for the family, decided not to get married with the blessing of both elder brothers. Meanwhile, Claudine's eldest son is involved in some big things, but doing little with Black Activist Group. But with the help of Ruppert, he and they all come through it. <br /> <br /> It ends on a happy, enjoyable and hopeful note. We know that it may not be right ... "Never after happily!", Rather it will make everyone together! If there is a criticism that we must say that sometimes in a movie like this, a wrong idea spreads to a large part of urban blacks. And that, the true certified mysteries, which are white, do not need any kind of help, work, or any inconvenience. <br /> <br /> Well, guys, it's just not true! Note: * At one point, Jim Brown's career was a real hit as an ugly employee. She was even tauted as "... Black John Wayne". Note: ** The idea of ​​creating movies with all-black castes was not a new concept for all-black use. In the 1920's, '30 and 40 ', we saw the production of Nobel Johnson, Spencer Williams, Jr. and Rex Ingram. Note: *** It is "as time goes on", you know, Schultz, it's from Casablanca (Warner Brothers, 1942).
