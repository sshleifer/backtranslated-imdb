My personal opinion - One of the best "patriotic" best Steven Sigal films. <br /> <br /> I heard that it is the greatest of all time, it is not SS etc. I disagree. As a highly spiritual person, a great master seagal action movie established a good tradition. He always has a good background, great action, high professionalism and a clever message. This movie has it all in it. You have good shooting scenes, great aikido Although there is not much of it, it shows our peaceful side. This change in his making film proves his spiritual growth only (he does not kill Chislam's friend till the end). <br /> <br /> «Patriot» is one of the best films from the «filmmakers» point of view. See what I've seen recently. If you have great panoramic shots in Montana, we see real American nature and beautiful wildlife (among others - horses and flowers). Soundtrack deserve a few words. During this movie, I got a great opportunity to listen to classical American-cowboy-western music (though not country). The similar music was heard in «Back in the future Prt.3». SS's performance has been greatly improved from its last films. His role was unknown to him (in contrast to the police and commandos), but he did good work to play the retired doctor-government-government. His acting is believable and his line is good. <br /> <br /> I was really pleased with Cast. LQ Jones proves that life and death together walk the earth, Whitney Yellow Rob plays a beautiful and clever scientist, Camila Bell creates a great look as McClaren's daughter. Mr. Seagal gives many views of the controversial «Real American» heritage and militia squads, (he likes the constitution just fine, but the cruel bearded men have nothing to do with it). Also the Eastern-Western Medicine system and nature are well-known points raised. <br /> <br /> The Best of Seagull And his film career opened new horizons. <br /> <br />
