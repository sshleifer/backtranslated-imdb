"Show Mr. Shery on the joy and terror evening!" The special effects, the Chess line, its original 1978 film 'Nurses Sherry' started with Geoffrey Land like Peter Desmond, and ordered by Zill Jacobson as Silly Martyn by Al Edson <br /> <br /> This movie is a About the evil ancient soul, which is near a nurse in the hospital, then he starts killing the doctor. Acting was ok but there was some robotics acting. The story was good but the sex scenes were probably shown there more. The direction was bad and special effects seemed like drawing, the effects fooled someone. The death scene was pretty good but there was no idea about the director mixed sex scene, nudity, football players and more. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a good movie, but not the best. <br /> 10 out of 7
