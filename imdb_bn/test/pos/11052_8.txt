78 years ago ... Premier Announced Globe Talks of "Ant Christi"! The picture is running for 16 minutes and the audience reaches the curiosity: entering the Great Bar and getting through silence, through long-awaited relocation: a few seconds off its silent era, and finally Grey Garbo tells a historical line: "A whisky gimme, as well as ginger Alley and not stingy, baby! " "Ana Christie" (1930) This film by Clarence Brown presented a great silent star, Grey Garbo, in conversation. Nowadays, we can only imagine how serious it is for actors and actors. Many were forced to finish their career - we are rarely seen or seen in the present. And it was not a compromise that it was Clarence Brown who managed the first talk with Swedish beauty. Garbo believes in the film's production of two of his coolest silent productions, Fell and Devil (1926) and a female of affair (1928): Films that achieved destructive success at both the box office with Garbo. <br /> <br /> But that's true about 2008 and film, now it seems completely historic, minor importance. The question of today's audience is not like Garbo's voice, but after 78 years the film is still worth watching. In other words, if the film is standing in the examination, we all try to answer this question. <br /> <br /> <br /> When I recently saw this, I came to the conclusion that without some tiny technical aspects, including static cameras, "Anna Christie" is still very entertaining. This is, on the one hand, a wonderful story of life, a fact that the young girl faces (Eugene and "based on the game of blue"), and on the other hand, directing and acting an artistic expression of the real glory of the field. Let me analyze these two aspects in separate paragraphs. Contents: Chris Christferson (George F. Marianne), who lives a heavy mariner in Barry, a sailor. Filled with sadness, he comforted him with a letter from his daughter Anna (Garbo), whom he had not seen for 15 years. He said he will return to him. He began to change everything well, but forget that his daughter has no other child experience, but a 23-year-old woman, who received various things on a farm in Minnesota, where she lived and worked. Moreover, he forgets that he has the right to accept another kind of male love. In his life ... this brief presentation of the subject is not from the main tea perspective but Anna (her father, Chris), much longer than what we brought, you understand how it is universal. After all these years, no letter was removed from the whole of life. The case discussed here in 1930 is still meaningful and valid ... <br /> <br /> Performance There are not many characters in the film, but there are two roles which really play a role. Of course, Garrett Garbo did something extraordinary in the 15 year long event, the presence strongly marked the history of the strong movie (I have already discussed most of my comments on her movies). But here, Garbo is a little different. I confess that there are moments in this movie when I do not feel very comfortable with her role. It seems that his new experience happened with the words in English; However, its performance is always as genuine and unique. But everyone hopes from Garbo. The film's real surprise for the audience of 1930 and for us like Marie Dresler's Miley In the full picture of an alcoholic woman who shows life from the point of view of "hit the bottle", she expresses her facial expressions with excellent expression in her face. In his best moments include conversations with Asti Crisi, repeatedly with his hilarious discussion with Chris. The rest of the rest of the cast cast is not great yet (here the German version makes it). Specifically, Dresler, except Garbo, is absolutely neutral. <br /> <br /> If you ask me what I like about "Anna Christie" nowadays, then I'll tell you: this is a classic movie. However, there is one more thing that I have to mention at the end. It is humorous, wonderful knowing that the whole is noticeable. Although the subject matter is quite serious and "Anna Christie" does not carry the comedian spirit in any way (there was only Garbo's comedy nanocca), then you have moments to split your moments. For example, Anna and Matt's visitors to the hottest gardens, especially in the restaurant, where he instructed Milk to think about how perfect and innocent they are, beer for themselves and where suddenly Marthy joins the opportunity ... </ br> "Anna Christie" Classic buffs will look for a perfect movie and an obviously interested in the performance magnificence of at least interested in the reality. If you are annoyed with those modern stars, then find such movies and you will be happy. Your search is worth a lot! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mother Mary Dresler! Let's have a toast of the great things we've done in the movie! After all these years when wine is very much like wine and your spirits are separated from us ...
