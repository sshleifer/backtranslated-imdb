In the late 70's and early 80's, the film was re-used on TV late in the night, I always kept sitting in front of TV and watching it. Look at the beautiful Kate Jackson, the handsome Richard Long, "the great" Polly Bergen, whom I have never seen in this TV movie other than Romantic Tom Bosley, and another "great" that I have never seen outside of this movie, Celeste Holme. This is the cruise love love boat and greatness and the boy was so good to kill !! And whenever I look at it I will always kill that real killer. <br /> <br /> It is hoped that someone here is already criticizing the movie like it really is a big help for anyone. This is a great TV movie and worth watching each time. I can not say that I saw almost half of the movie this month. <br /> <br /> If you ever get a chance to watch it on TV, which is probably not, see it. At the end of the year, in the light of the publication of "The Girl Affordable" in the DVD, perhaps "David Cruise" has the hope of a DVD release.
