The theme of the controversial novel "Anne Death in Venice" is based on Thomas Price. But in the book, a writer of heroes, film director Lucino Vicenti who wrote the screenplay, transformed him into a composer. For example, author / musician, Gustav von Acechbach (Dirk Bogaard) was a burned artisan at the edge of mental fatigue. After a long and successful career now seek peace and peace in a less violent life. He decides to go on vacation in Venice, where he hopes to rejuvenate his dwindling ambition. However, while on the coast of the beautiful coastal coast, he draws the attention of a beautiful young teenage boy, Tadizio (B & B Andresen), who sees interest in him and immediately beats him. Although Gustav was inspired by the wonderful young man, he must find some personal time from the city's secret (NORRO RICHI) to deal with the invasive plague, which thinks the city is oppressed. Some of the film's dialogues, novels like the novel, and the artists are fine, as well as short clash. At the end Unlike the book, it prevents viewers from bizarre and imaginary fantasy flights. Their issue is not given to wings, substances or opportunities, and it is not for the concise of the book, but the film only allows the possibility of 'what will happen'. Nevertheless, anyone can sympathize with Hero and want to disable him a little bit, which is banned, irrelevant, but clearly criticizes the prairie. Great story and a bogard classic. ****
