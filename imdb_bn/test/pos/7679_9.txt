I saw the film in Austin publishing its original theater in Texas. Old Paramount Theater (I do not know whether it still exists.) All the six channels have gone out with the speaker around the properly connected wall. I was 15 years old when I fly. The concept of the word around was completely foreign to music and movies at the time. <br /> <br /> I remember at least three wonderful scenes where the surrounding word has a huge effect. (Even though my memories have gone wrong during the wrong time, please pardon me.) The first was the Camera through Catafish Row, which is alive with daily activity sites and words. For example, each one of you first saw, such as a blacksmith, then the camera kept them by their word, listening to the left side of the theater on the right-hand side. The second was a marching band that was first seen in front, then the camera was divided on the left and the right. The sound of every device does not just follow its own direction, it is also on your side, with you, and even when away from you, it also changes to the tambar. And if this is not enough, they are also responsible for Doppler effect for each device. The third scene was at the end of the movie because Pourgi is going to find catfish rows in search of the base in New York. As a rallying band, she passed the village with the same sound effect and almost half the custom member camera passed. The other half of Cast Castes sing with them and send off the waves and voices of Porti and their other friends. The responses of friends can be heard from the side and backwards. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < I think I remember something thrown from a rock or a peer and hearing it land in the water behind me. The little theater that was visible to the lucky theater-viewers near six channels - something that seems to be the only dome in the theater. <br /> <br /> I am in the theater for a few listeners. You could then do that. And I went back many more times before leaving the city. I did not see the movie again. It is literally BEGS for the recovery images of DVDs with the fidelity and surround sound. I hope somewhere I have saved somewhere. Please, the Gershwin family, let it be released before it gets better for other generations.
