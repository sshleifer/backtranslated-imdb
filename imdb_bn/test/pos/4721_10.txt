This film can be seen as possible as it focuses on human rights issues in Burma. When I first saw this movie in the mid-1990's, it completely changed my life. I knew very little about Aung San Suu Kyi or her democracy movement. It affected me so I wanted to know more about the situation. If you want to know more about any movie, its work is done properly. Patricia Arquette became desperate with her own life decision due to that personal tragedy as fantastic as the American lady and gets caught in the next clash. This is a powerful movie about a subject that is more prominent. In 1988, pro-democracy activists did not broadcast on television, and this film was not originally seen in the world. I request everyone to read these comments to take time to learn more about the current status of Burmese people. <br /> <br /> It's time to get rid of this movie from the DVD. Can anything be done?
