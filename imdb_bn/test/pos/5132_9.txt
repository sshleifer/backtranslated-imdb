Hut was horrible. The owl is stylish and the movie highlights an interesting environmental issue I did not exist. Florida is full of many fun characters and the film brings a great job to the screen. My children liked animals, especially animals, from snakes, from ants to ants. It's really a simple story, but at this age they will hear that one. When the children are young, they actually develop their intellectuals of values ​​and yes one of them can take care of our environment and all its creatures. I think it was great that the movies and even the animals move around in the house and how they spread the conversation with them for their help. It was really sweet and lasting to listen to my little girl about what my child wanted to save her bird. However, overall it was a really great time and I would suggest looking at some amusement and meaningful of the movie.
