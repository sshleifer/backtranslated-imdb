Beautiful, impressive, versatile, versatile and talented Irene Dunne is one of the greatest 5 or 6 actresses in the American movie. Over 21 years - in all his movies - he has enlightened the screen with a natural, yet interesting appearance. She is pure and human at once, and a charismatic, inspirational model. This role is impressive Irene Dunne, full of stones and wit and full of little misery. I love all his movies, and this picture was a fantastic new discovery for me while broadcasting TCM yesterday. I hope they can not wait for a few years. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Charles Coburn is the greatest character actor in American film. Verily, he often portrays the diversity of the same theme, but I'm not tired to see his soft hearty curmudgeons. Here is the perfect foil for his character Irene Dunne, and he is portrayed perfectly by Coburn. These films are absolutely fantastic in their contrasts. They will not miss a beat. In addition, they represent the central conflict of the film and the moral conflict of the husband of Irene Dunn, illustrated by Alexander Knox. <br /> <br /> I'm not familiar with Knox's work. He was recognized, but that was about all that. However, throwing with Dunne and Coburn, he holds his own. He provides a fine, nuanced performance. His character has an excellent purpose that becomes accessible to us by Nux's performance, and sometimes we have not been kept as sacred grill. He is great, but doubts and doubts in his ability to successfully complete OCS. His interaction with Dunne, always believing, too. Dunne supported without being syrupy becoming a martyr, and she responded kindly. Their scenes are very well done <br /> <br /> The image itself is not an illustrated snapshot of a moment and is depicted in any other film. I do not remember the topography of American film in the United States against World War II, but after the last war and on the establishment of post-war world. Not a normal WWII movie! That's itself interesting; It's intriguing and the message of the movie is essential. Unlike other commentators, I thought that the climatic lecture was right, but not great. It was very well distributed by Nox, but it was expected that it was not "hardly" written as a build-up. I have heard the speech of a good movie addressing very similar theme. It served its purpose. <br /> <br /> For me, the film's larger value, Dunes and Knox's cinematography were screenplay, it reflected the general OCS experience. Among the wives living in Palmetto Terrace, the sect of the communities seemed absolutely pure - such as the Playmate Terres itself, even though it was clearly set at a sound level. Incredibly short encounters between wives and their OCS husbands The OCS candidates had to learn hard work, difficult and complex elements to learn from them. Shawbie "base housing" - probably made early. Tired and dressed furniture Short period of constant and frustrating - for returning to base, for lessons reading, next to "catch trains on posts." The tenants are moving into the housing between their predecessors and heirs, they were going inside and out. Yes, I suspect it was a glimpse of a true WWII experience - some comedies dressed, but very original from its original point of view. I like it, and I highly recommend it.
