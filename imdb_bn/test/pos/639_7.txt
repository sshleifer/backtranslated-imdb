I had hoped for a slash in this movie, and the muted testimony influenced the film making style, it is much more than your average slash flick. Thrillers are a number that focuses on a certain disability - blindness is more common (dark terror, wait until darkness, cats stars mention the name of a boxing), but the effects of having a throttled silent lead like this are well illustrated, and indeed inseparable to the plot The part that the lead character can not tell is because often he's own Who gets out of dangerous situations, which could be someone else out. Our silent witness Billy Hughes, a make-up artist who works in producing a horror movie in a studio in Moscow. After an hour, she locked herself and after trying to call her sister for help, she disappointed her for the first time making illegal sexual fix, but soon became a snap movie! He tried to convince the authorities what he saw, but he saw that no one believes in his story ... <br /> <br /> Recently, the host has made headlines for making snacks in foreign countries, but this image was first and actually Does a good job It's not quite as nasty as Eli Roth's tears, but the Gotti is more effective, and humorous, mute witness is far enough serious and fun to see, due to its effectiveness and director Anthony Waller (who was directed to direct my favorite modern thrillers' The Gillette). The director must have a genius to run the suspicious thriller biking, because it is still not standing. The conspiracy was taken promptly and Walar introduced the continuous plot twists that would give a big help to the overall entertainment value of the film. Actor is not bad for B-Movie, young actors Marina Juddina, Fe Replay and Ivan Richards are providing better performance. The atmosphere is snowy and the Russian positions are quite overwhelming, which helps to maintain the atmosphere to restore the film. Above all, mute witness is a better movie than this, that you can expect. Plot is well flowing, and the atmosphere and excitement are spot.
