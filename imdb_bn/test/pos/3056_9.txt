The last film Lorel and Hardy were produced in the 1950s in Utipia, France. After the 1930s production of bad fame, both of them could be horrifying to this picture. Although eloquently it was their "vintage" comedy's value though I was pleasantly surprised. It is guardable, and the part is really fun! And of course the plot is the same value as you would expect. Some gags arise from their previous work, but when you consider this film to be the first of five years for the film of their last Hollywood film "The Bulfights", you will routinely execute the rituals as expected from these professionals. Some scenes are not much, but the price of this movie is some scenes, and, for example, absolutely invaluable. I especially enjoyed sleeping scenes. <br /> <br /> I feel sad at the end of the photo. Our heros are left on their own desert island. This is a metaphor for the truth of real life. Hollywood and the audience of that time occupied the islands in a desert monument, and in this film they became the last picture painted. He died seven years later and Stan died 15 years later. Stan adopted an offer presented in "It's a mad mad mad mad world" in 1963. How shy he was - a color film, which was passed just two years ago. But his health was probably not much. <br /> <br /> These guys are probably the greatest comedian of all time, and even though the film is far from their actual potential, yet it appeared in an honor last weekend to watch them, and touching their high talents' echos.
