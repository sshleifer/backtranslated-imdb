After my daughter was born in 1983, I needed to lose weight. I tried to practice for 20 minutes and I was blurry. I lost about 50 pounds. It was the biggest weight I ever lost in my life. I can not believe I forgot this event. You will be a blessing to exercise strictly on a cable channel and it includes 20 minute workout. I had this video ever made out of the best work ever made. I wish I could buy somewhere. Routines were easy to learn and you worked pretty well in sweat. They are very complex of workouts today and are very hard to learn. Do your best to get back to this video. I pray that those who see it and pray it will be a blessing.
