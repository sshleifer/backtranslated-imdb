Many times Stanwick is very happy in this war comedy, a sailor is invited to spend Christmas with the family of a popular magazine writer on his farm in Connecticut. The problem is that she has no husband, child or farm, she wrote in her column and she can not cook; His wonderful friend "Uncle" is offering his wonderful recipes for Felix, a Hungarian restaurant owner in New York City. <br /> <br /> Its tough publisher boss is more complicated by inviting himself for Christmas. A project has been planned early on, its staff is providing a real Connecticut firm in Fiasu, providing neighboring loan-taking children and when the publisher is not looking for a quick wedding plan. But when the beautiful young sailor arrives on Christmas the day before, the romantic complexity arises, because the supposed married writer is a nice man's navy and on the contrary, he is like a brick brick. This is an impressive comedy of a delightful, cordial cinema that has repeatedly helped Stevenieck to showcase his remarkable comedic talent, Sidney Greenestrite, Una O'Non, Szedakal, and many others, as an extraordinary character actor. A delightful tune to see a Christmas night dance at the Town Hall, and Stenny's unexpectedly sweet and feminine side is a wonderful surprise, for visitors who watched them as the most difficult, ironic femme femme fatale of women. There really is a wonderful film that stood the test during that time.
