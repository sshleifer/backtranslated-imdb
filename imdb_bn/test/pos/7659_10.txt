Beautifully illustrated, the mind extends the search of the culture of the jeep in their music context. Traveling across a continent, the gypsy faces amazing musical style in a diverse group of people. It's kind of misleading to describe this movie. It is beautifully described by music itself, brilliant tunes and subtitled songs tell a better story than a storyteller. See this picture.
