In the 1933 "x-lady" movie of 1933's Bet Dewis, I saw a movie that was much better than its star! Most Left Wrap "AT K", AKA "Utopia," A.A.A. "Robinson Cruswell," AKA "Espaid" has been for several years, Stan Laurel told these horror stories about his production. He seems to have suffered a stroke during filming, it was becoming almost as warm as death (with its first two shots, you would never guess that Laurel survived Hardy for eight years) and later diagnosed with diabetes (once he was diagnosed with diabetes Consistent with his diet, he restored himself for health), one can understand why the law Rail does not think that this movie was the most joyful experience of his life. Yes, it's flawed: Production shows, dubbing awful and Lorele and Hardy were too old to make energetic skeptics of their greatest films. But it's still funny, and Leo Jonan's story presents elements of political satire (sometimes liberal, sometimes communalist) hoping to see from socially conscious comedians such as Chaplin or Marx Brothers, but they will never see it from Lorel and Hardy. The film is eligible for credit to be different (although the Yaleing studio's classic "Passport to Pimcillo" loan was almost a year before) and Laurel and Hardy used to use it primarily for the comedy to be completely separated from something else. This is not a great movie, but it is better than eight patience for Fox and MGM in the early 1940's. In the late 1960s or in the early 1970s, only the technical superstition of the film, among the anti-established children-buyers of Marx Brothers 'Doc Soup', prevented it from attaining the rituals.
