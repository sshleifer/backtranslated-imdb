Time out time is somewhere in the middle of Johnny to Canon, in the "solid good" section. As a crime thriller, it is not terribly original or extraordinary and action scenes will not throw you away, but there is something else for it. It's a Johnny which after all the film, has it. <br /> <br /> <br /> She is managed by Lau Ching Waien, the HP Police decided to play a kinky cat and mouse game with a hostage negotiator Took it. The plot in that brief description That puts the proceedings that are attractive across the twists and rolling layer at the top. It sometimes gets too slow for its own interests but it does not get its best. However, just as Johnny Chuillah is going to manage the risk of a well-crafted crime (which is, almost twice as much to face it), he bursts into pieces and pieces, which are full of time out of running out of emotional experience, for good oily skeletons. Provides spirit and heart. <br /> <br /> The concept of synchronism and minimaism (Staple in his work) has a lot to do. Always fine, images take a long time to talk for themselves, and develops with slower shots, for example to overcome the score, it's all here. I'm talking about the picture of the highlights of a small love story and "heart" on a bus between Andy Lau and a girl. So easy yet so powerful. Duito for Lau and Lau Ching Wang's car scene and bowling-room showdown. <br /> <br /> Running out of time demands some good work to stop me. All the power and craftsmanship are down a notch but he may be very workmanlike or bland at the time. He is good, he is good, well. Pure brightness is even the isolated moment that is only good for their own, leaving a bittersweet aftertaste for the rest of the movie. I'm convinced that if he keeps his heart, he can really make a great movie. For example, this is one of his films that are flawless but enjoyable. Under the sticky HK style, it is a black humorous and heartwarming drama that makes it a compulsory film. Of course, observers are valuable.
