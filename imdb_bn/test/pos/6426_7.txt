Alice (Florida Balkan), a translator living in Italy, discovered that her memory was lost and could not remember the last few days. She begins to follow a trace of memory pieces, which leads her to the small town Garma. The people of the city think of recognizing him and he suspects that terrifying nightmares of astronauts have to do something about their own ammunia. <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting and well-plotted, but it is a bit of moving and arty slow for my taste. The plot takes some excellent twists and it's really hard to paint where it's titled. Florida Balkan is good at her role (but better than "Flavia the Heratic") and "star" child actor Nokletta Elmie always looks good. Klaus Kinski's role is very small. It's not a movie for dead-hard grape hand or addictive addiction, but it's still a very nice hour and half-mystery.
