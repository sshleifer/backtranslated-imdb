The best of comedy and low-budget comedy. This set of unique independent sketches of massive self-referential humor is a memorable one of the truly awkward kids in the hall. Prepare for some of the most random and readable lines, filled with ethnic slurs and terrible language. Sex toys included! <br /> <br /> There should be more comedy like today The sketch in a DVD will issue many views and reviews to appreciate some of the parts. If you enjoy the state and / or wet hot summer summer, be ready for some more glory. If you consider this also for young audiences, I would say that every child in the world should have this.
