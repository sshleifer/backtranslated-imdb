OK, maybe this movie is not a revolution. But it is a very good part of the entertainment, and it has something about Elvis Silverstone's "Cluthes" or Cameron Diaz's "Diversity of Liver Tyler" variety. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And well he even got everything even ... even in crime. Many offenses And he did not drop to help each lover who got this thing. In addition, some extra lover should not be remembered by her actual boyfriend. <br /> <br /> <br /> To be very domestic. So the character played here is actually the parody of cancer! <br /> <br /> I was alone in this movie. It was quite comfortable because I used to laugh loudly as much as I wanted - but it was also strange that no one is interested in this movie? <br /> <br /> I like myself too much. Acting was very nice, especially in the main actors where bright. There are plenty of wands, black types and good dialogue. <br /> <br /> This is a trash movie, and it is full of black humor. If you like this type of movie, try it!
