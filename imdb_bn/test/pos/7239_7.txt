It is very bizarre to bring William Shakespeare's tragic love story. <br /> <br /> The Qi family and the Caplet family hate each other for a long time, which often results in violence. Hate has something with a film company and in fact that everyone is very crazy. Tromso and Juliet, among the most fierce "star cross" lovers in the midst of all this madness, fall in love with each other at first sight and problems arise when they realize that there is no other in their family. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> But the infamous tromba spoiler film ends in the beginning. It creates a film that is not clearly for all the taste, but it is quite innovative. Tyrone (Tybalt in Shakespeare) has a special fun death scene. 7/10 <br /> <br /> There are many different edited and retained versions available. Everyone has all with violence, prejudice, drug use, and sex, a great dimension of oddity.
