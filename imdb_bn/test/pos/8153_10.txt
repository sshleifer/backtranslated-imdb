If your tissue has a box, a comfortable couch, a large bowl of popcorn and a social commitment on Friday night, this is definitely your movie! Its romantic, its hot and its challenging. For most of our gay people, religion is just one of the things we had kids and was probably looking at the changed boy and how beautiful he was! But in Lotter days, you see the struggles of being gay when your whole world is turning around the belief that it is totally opposed to homosexuals. The two main cast members were completely hot, but at the same time to keep your heart and give me 'almost' to weep (I have never cried in the movie!), Which I think was quite impressive for the B-grade film. I highly recommend this flick, you will smile, you will cry (unless you are mine) and you will definitely drool! I love so much buying DVDs for it in my collection. This is really the most beautiful movie indeed
