GZSZ Germany is the longest running daily soap and it is religion! I started to see it from the very first day and from the beginning I hesitated. There have been so many changes over the years, such as Hiko, Elk, Tina, Sasaki etc. old characters are left, and the new ones have appeared like Marie, Kai, Kora or the people. I would like to say that in 1995-2000 years I love JJSZ because today's show focuses more on small characters. My favorite character is Soja Wie because she was the most cautious person who was never in soap and she was one of the most interesting characters of the show. Tina Bardin was the first to be as beautiful as Sonaji, but Tokio became the sonaz rose, the character became even better.
