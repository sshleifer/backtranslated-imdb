To me, "Anatomy" of course I see one of the best movies. I do not think "Anatomy" is initially considered as a horror movie but a movie science is asked the question of ethics. If you watch it with it, it really turns out to be a good movie. The only annoying bit was the dubbing of awful voice for the English version. How are you listening to this Germanic German language for two hours? Talk to local English speakers or use subtitles instead!
