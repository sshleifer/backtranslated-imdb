There have been great comments about this movie and I would like to add my voice to praise. Yul Brynner has not been more strongly attractive. His Major was a romantic riveting. When your eyes do not leave the screen then This is his movie. This is not one of the customs, especially Dobo Kare and Anne Jackson. They were mostly actors at the stage, they brought many signals to their performance. For example, I've seen this movie at least 4 times, but for the first time when I encountered a Russian soldier I saw Germany's reaction. Although he was not threatening, yet his utter violent reaction came to me that he was in Germany after WWII and probably was gang raped by a red army. The possibility of finding deeper depth in the story, which can only be under the surface, wants me to see this fascinating movie again and again. Keep it on DVD.
