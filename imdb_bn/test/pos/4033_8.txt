OK, so this picture did not win an Oscar, but it's not a bad movie. Original "DOA" Undoubtedly a good movie, but that does not mean this picture is not bad. <br /> <br /> Movie star Dennis Quaid was one of his early roles, when he became the first real genius, "The Right Stuff" made him a star, and looks pretty beautiful as Meg Ryan, when he was still quite famous . <br /> <br /> This 1950 film is a "remake" different and the characters are very different. The plot is quite similar. A man (an English professor of Austin's Texas University at the time) is poisonous and why only 24 hours of him poisoned him and why. Meg Ryan is a young college student who tries to help him. Jane Cassemaker's wife, unwholesome wife, has acted in the following keys, but in severe activity; He stole all the scenes he stole. Daniel Stern (his first role before "Home Alone" was also a kayada co-worker). Charlotte Rampolping is a very subtle role. <br /> <br /> The whole shield is top notch; The film is stylish, a quick motion which ultimately keeps you guessing. <br /> <br /> I think it's a movie that is definitely worth seeing as a thriller and a modern version of a valuable movie.
