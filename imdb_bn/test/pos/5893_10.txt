Sometimes, but rarely, a movie tells a story so well that it almost becomes difficult. This movie has told several stories together that it is a movie that I did not see for the first time. It was very real ... and the characters were so strong that it became a personal struggle to watch. These three men and their families are facing their hardships, especially one, often hurting me very hard. Now, I've seen it completely without interruption, and I always realize what I suspect. This movie is a Best Composition. Everything from writing, acting, and even combining a few stories, even less bits get sticky, everything about this movie is exceptional. Seven Academy Awards? No wonder, it must have to deserve them.
