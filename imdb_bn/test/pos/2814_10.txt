Initially, the idea of ​​this event was just a joke and a joke for Stan Lee's entertainment. I do not expect much more than a lazy, animated version of Wireless with low production prices, which you like, like small pieces of adult swimsuit for short-term recreation, but can not take it very seriously. The boy was wrong! <br /> <br /> Streptilla has a better value than the same Marvel tones. Animation is very good and it seems that they took this series very seriously and made it a complete endeavor to create professional profession as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Humor is good, sexy, suggestive and sleazy side. It's very similar to the Simpsons style. You may encounter clichés and many expected humor but still its fun still. If this was running today, I would definitely see it regularly. Its wonderful to have a good toons ever made.
