If you want to watch the cruel, fierce movies of nudity, sex, drug addiction, alcohol, women and children rape, this film will be pleased with you. If you want to see a wife rightfully retaliating on her left side of the rich man, this film has it. You've already heard the wonderful music that's going on in raw emotion. It is astonishing that a final kiss in a story of violence, action and music can come at a moment, without an educational lecture, which transforms the film. Look for a final scene that is an unexpected proof of healing a wounded person. Perhaps we are wondering why we will enter into great arrogance that love can be located on the waist of the heart. Follow the rhythm where the pumping pounding is where love is pure.
