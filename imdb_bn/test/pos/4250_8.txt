"Putni Swape" is a unique, low-budget jewel from the late 1960's, probably missing it if it was not two things: Paul Thomas Anderson (who named Don Chaddell's character in "Boogie Knights", Buck Swape, After this movie's unnamed hero) and limited DVD release. Viewing "Patni Swape" means listening to hardcore punk rock: It can not gain much knowledge (at least for me it's not time to see it for the first time), but you have to respect her passion and the film. Unexpected rebel message I did not understand much about "Putini Swape", but I like it most. The more I think about the movie, the more it grows on me. <br /> <br /> This image was circulated as a parody of Madison Avenue in New York, which became known as the capital of the world's advertising during the 1960's. Generation X and Y members may lose this idea, but fortunately "Mad Men" are on TV that provide us with a missing piece of US history. What you need to know before watching this movie is that most of the advertising agencies were male, even more white organizations. <br /> <br /> Remembering this idea, the film is open with the advertising company board meeting. The members, especially white Putin Swoop, in addition to white (this is Anthal Johnson, Dick Gregory's unique rendition of this film), African-American Token on Board. Board members are so confident and surrendered that their chairman falls before them in front of them, their only concern is to be later chairman. In addition to removing the body from the boardroom, they started a paper ballot for the next chairman election. <br /> <br /> Putin is chosen by Swape Landslide, but other members do not think that Swap is worthy. It was an unfortunate effort to break the scope of another member of the voting board to become the elected Chairman of SWEP. After taking their plans back, Swaype took charge and "dipped the boat", shot one of the original members and recruited all the colored people in their place. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (for me) is very weird and hard to follow according to the plots. Even a plot could have been, even not. The whole idea of ​​the film seems to be a "what's" scenario, which results in the new "true and spirit inc." Strong must be unusual, but still succeed. The organization earns so much money that the members make a big glass case to keep cash for vague purposes. This can be because swipes do not believe in banks, although this point is not touched or explained in the film. It may be figurative in some ways, but who knows. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> I think some political joke is being made here, but I do not understand it. Filmmakers say that the president is a small, small part of America's life? Do they say that the latest elected officials (at times Nixon) were unnamed candidates? I do not know. But I think it's a mess, but the president playing the president has presented the future President Ronald Reagan as an interesting figure. It is interesting to make this connection 40 years after the film was created. <br /> <br /> Showing how this movie can benefit from how advertisers respond to new advertisements without advertising companies. Of course, advertising footage was a strange, fun appeal for its unusual creativity, but was it satisfied to buy this advert product? If so, how? The film indicates the idea that new advertising campaigns were successful through client interaction and calls from White House. However, it has been expressed to see the average people, that demographics have always been most profitable for advertisers. <br /> <br /> While the film's parody and political messages probably could not stand in favor of this test, this film still had a lot of unique attributes. Arnold Johnson had a magnetic X factor that greatly benefited him in this film. Swape's rough voice was actually director Robert Dowie, senior voice dubbed, sometimes weak, but fit in character for being authoritarian externally. He hired and fired random workers, but paid tribute to one of the employees to search for revolution and new ideas for advertising agency. <br /> <br /> The film's consistency was incredibly risky, especially since the film was written and directed by a white man (Robert Donnie, Senior). However, this film has been subjected to negative black stereotypes, which would later emerge and collapse of the Blackspleason genre. While some viewers may be off for a few viewers, it may be successful by inventing black-owned and managed businesses and risks. Many people can not accept positive messages from this movie, but I have decided. <br /> <br /> "Putin Swape" is an abandoned movie and Davy, Sir. (Despite his son's recent return) he has been recognized as a very qualified director. However, if you find a DVD of this movie then buy it and see it. It's on Netflix, Dieto. It is a film that can sometimes be confusing, but it is valuable for its glory, ambition, and its dissonance level by today's filmmakers.
