Tracy and Matt, Michelle and Sebastian: These couple couples who have been caught wildly by this addictive, crime, and Scholar's life are in this great and honest HBO documentary. They are petulants, charming, annoying, wonderful fools, and dedicated: Drugs and to each other. They are completely different: Matt is a working class boy who clearly expresses his arrogance, Prip School Dropout Tracy supports the couple with Western Union money from their father in the Finance School, who has created a wonderful sympathetic camio at the end of the film. Meanwhile, widow Michelle (whose husband dies at an OD's death) earns her daily bread as a nypd vice police, who wants to cut her off, an agreement to avoid jail time, and stop the sad colleague Sebastien. You would have pulled them into their story and the film would like to go for a long time. Unlike most of these types of documentaries, a codea does not provide updates about their progress (can Matt and Tressy really keep Brooklyn apartments? Will Mitchell return to Belvoi for more Detox? And can Sebastian be more kind?). As a result, the film seems incomplete, but that may be the point. Watching the essentials, until you are opposite to the shooting-up scene.
