De Gr√∏ne slagtere or The Green Butcher, it is said in English, it is a dark comedy about two people who work for a popular slaughter. They were annoyed with their boss criticism and decided to start a business of their own. Their store is expensive and it does not have electricity everywhere. And to make things worse, they do not have any customers (as their prediction of East Bengal). When people give them a visit to their shop, they challenge them to provide meat for a dinner party organized by them. <br /> <br /> An accidental accident occurred. During shutting down the shop, one of the slaughters locked the electrician in the fridgeing chamber. People die and serve two sets of neurotic electrons in the diner party instead of cutting the fillets from the thighs and instead of calling the police. This is an incredible success. Every person in the village wants to cut the incredible "chicken". After the surprise of his success, the Butcher wanted to kill more people, but he could sell like chickens. <br /> <br /> I assume that not everyone can enjoy cancer, especially because it is not shown with a lot of humor. Personally I like it a lot. It shows how far it is for some social acceptance and to get out of their isolation. It may be a little distant, but I'm sure you'll be surprised to see how people sometimes work in real life. <br /> <br /> I was also happy with the main issue as well. Performance and Humor. There are no reactions you can expect in such movies, it's all very cool and realistic (I think it's ideal for Scandinavian and Scandinavian films). The same for humor. I'm sure if I lived up to its opinion, or a lot of fretting, vomiting, ... as you often see in American movies, I did not like it. I like this movie and I give an 8/10.
