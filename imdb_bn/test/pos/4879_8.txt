This is a necessary program for any problem with naughty, crazy or annoying kids. This is not only the best practice documentary program, but also for tips, but for transitions. Quite striking Joe Joe Frost Supernanny, with fifteen years of nannying experience, she has a program where she shows a family where the kids are behaving very badly, very badly. Frost grandmother does not let kids win. Every episode has their kids who are crazy and very naughty, eg. Throwing things, continually swearing, relatives and parents and many other horrific experiences hit. But at the end of the show, the children of each episode are transformed from small monsters to the parent of the children (using Frost). It's just wonderful when the transformation is successful, Joe Frost is a wonderful supernatural. It was nominated for the National Television Award for the most popular program program (twice). This is the number 100 of the 100 best TV shows in 2004. Very good
