This show is really great. It's smart It's funny It's great acting and writing. This show is actually the fastest show I've seen. The dialogue is really fun and well-played. Loren Graham and Alexis Blayle have a great chemistry. You really believe they are mother and daughter This show really shows that the daughters of the mother and daughter do not have to be just moms and daughters, they may be good friends, but at the same time it shows that sometimes Leslie and Emilie are more difficult than mother and daughter. I only highly recommend this show. This is the coolest and definitely the best show in the air. Season 7 They Tuesday September 26, 2006, 8/7c New CW
