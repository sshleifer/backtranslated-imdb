The problem with other actors acting in the Durian Grayr Roll is that they are too old for the part (Harvard Hatfield, Helmut Burger, Josh DÃ¼hel, David Galagher, Ben Barnes) or without stilted in English elite ways. Durian is a permanent 19-year-old (or so), all Milky skin and honey'd lock, as described by Wild, so there is a range of challenges for maturity and for which there is an actor (ie, who can illustrate the supernatural, arrogance , And manipulativeness), but at the same time looks like someone from his late teens. And Peter Fit made it off with this excellent British TV adaptation. <br /> <br /> Gilgood like Healy Watan, although older than WILD, works wonders with her scene - Wild Efforts never said natural and disobedient. Especially, George Sanders was relatively weak in the 1945 edition (and his costume was not fit). Finally, Jeremy plays Bill Basil as the brain, and at the same time, the maximum of three gay, again a fitting explanation. In general, Dariyan does not have enough gay subtract in this movie without having to do homosexuals - he does everything for everything and is supposed to have not tried any drug or sexual distraction in 18 years, but it makes him more addictive. More than gay ones. He seems to have expressed anger over both the sex workers, as he has to do in the novel. <br /> <br /> Of course, this generation's budget was not very big, so everything seems to be of little level. Especially the brother's dispute with Durian's brother is suffering from the appearance of a clear scene. Also, Dorian's final shot (I think of a doll) looks like his white animal make up and sunny and the death of Basil's death is strange fun. (Also, as long as I think, Basil should have been killed on the table.) <br /> <br /> Finally, it is a very suitable orientation. I'm sure Wilde liked it. The only thing missing is the only thing. Not a sexual scene, but the harmful earth of perfume flowers, luxurious clothes and precious gems wild is not really searched here, for example, aesthetics are not completely absent. But like "I, Claudius", nice acting simply forgets these errors of production quality.
