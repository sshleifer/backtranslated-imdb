I just returned from watching this horror movie !! I can have a lot of relationship with this ... when my sister had to go to college, reminds me, we had to move out of the place, and my mother's adel works like August! The guys do not like this movie because they bring tears in your eyes. One of the best real life movies I've ever seen !! And Natalie Portman rules! 10/10
