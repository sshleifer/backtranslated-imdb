I consider myself a huge horror movie fan. One night I wanted to rent some new horror movies for fun. Then, I hired Milo. I was so surprised by this movie. It is afraid of hell from me. It's not something I can say often. Normally Halloween is just scared to me. <br /> <br /> Two friends saw this with me, and went away with a boring feeling. A good feeling, if you ask me, after watching a horror movie. If you are unregistered, then what is the point? <br /> <br /> This movie was original. It does not follow the usual guidelines of a horror movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is worth renting though.
