So wonderful is this picture captures the lives of gaming. I laughed so much while watching this. The film is about a gaming group that has a hard time with a campaign that comes with their drowning master. The film escapes from the real world and the gaming world when they carry out the campaign, it shows the gaming world as their character, and when they are not playing, they come back to the real world. The campaign is based on a module based on Dungan Master, Lodge. The problem can not end the lodge's module because the characters can not finish the campaign. They are more for role instead of slaughter and looting. Lodge wants to run a campaign that they never did before. They decide to bring some extra help so that they can bring it, wait for it, the girl can play. Lodge also makes an NPC, a non-player character, a Pallidin, who can not play or make mistakes. So what does the film do and how do I want to spoil a movie, I will not say again. This movie may not be a big budget movie, acting may not be Oscar worthy but be sure to see if you are in gaming or ornaments and dragones. They had a lot of fun for making this film and it shows that I'm constantly going for fun with a film problem or for a low budget movie, it's not just fun. I enjoy some fun stick comedy which I enjoy and some great good writing in my opinion. So if you want a fun movie try it.
