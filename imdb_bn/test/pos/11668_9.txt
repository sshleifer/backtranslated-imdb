Team Robbins did an efficient job to manage this film. I say this because he avoid the convention and the clich√©. He has played Susan Sarandan (who won an Oscar for his role) and Shan Pen. Even more amazing, Robins is not patronized. He is just telling stories and giving viewers the game on the minds of the event. This is effective because it is one of the most controversial issues of our time, in order to create its own opinion on the death of viewers, in any way, without being unfairly exploited it. I can not recommend this picture enough, 9/10.
