I am very happy when I read this comment as I check out. I'm sure this picture is cool. And you probably do not know that story specifically Mr. Writing for Brodsky was written. The person you can see is his and his ideal attitude - to prevent living and death. He was a great actor and we are very lucky that we have made such a beautiful movie during his life. You could lucky see them at least one of them. Enjoy.
