It's a tough movie coming to the United States, but if you find it - and you're interested in the life and music of Percy Allardie Granger, you're doing a treatment. It is quite historically correct. Richard Roxburgh's Ginger looks amazingly like Gringer at this time. Emily Woof Karen Holten is somewhat beautiful than the original Karen, but it was a mistake I was happy to discover !! I think that really hurt me, but how well Roxborough granter's disrespectful personality was kept. Barbara Haresi's Rose was a treasure. Even if he thinks that he is younger than Rose, how much better he has done with Rose's passion than Percy. It's a simple film to recommend. (I should remember that when he saw "Passion" there was no special affair for my wife, Gringer and her music, but she was completely influenced by the film.
