This film was my first acquaintance with Chris Cooper's talent. I was deeply impressed with the character played. I knew when I saw this picture that more talent will come from the actor. He plays a union captain, who is farming in East Kentucky as well as some listed men. They took place on the "Sisak" woman's farm, whose husband chose to go to the Confederation. <br /> <br /> Eastern Kentucky screenplay, and its importantly divided feelings during the war are so accurate. If you are looking for a war film with many blood and throat, it will not be. If you discover the drama that people's psychology, war, and philosophically, in the war, it is the best study of how divided loyalty has been interacted with the people of border state during the American Civil War.
