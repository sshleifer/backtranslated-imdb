I really enjoyed watching this movie! Only a few parts were slow, but it was only setting the mood and building up the action. I was very educated in this movie, it taught me more about my Croatian tradition. I learned more about Louise Arbor, and I can say that I have a lot of influence on him. Time Magazine In April 2004, among the 100 influential people in the world, known as Louis Arbor. I like this movie (of course) like historical movies. This movie was very dramatic, but still the truth of the events of the former Yugoslavia. Louise Arbor is a brave hero, and I'm glad they made a movie of his honor. When you watch movies, I hope you like it.
