When I was young my grandmother took me to see this movie. And I fell in love with it. I love Dorothy Dandridge very much and want to be like him. I fell in love with Sydney Poitier. Pearl Bailey smiles me And Sammy Davis Junior was just as spectacular as Spin Life. The music is just taking breath. When I was my first son and the movie came on TV I saw him, and till date he has not forgotten this movie. He liked it I always remember Porgy and Bess. It's a special place for my heart now and now. I really want them to recover this movie, because it was one of the greatest films of all time, with "Black Cast".
