* Be cautious of potential spinners. <br /> <br /> A friend told me to test this series, and I'm glad I accepted his words for him. <br /> <br /> I read the summary DVD cover and I was immediately plotting. The main hero of the Muslim? No way, it's a first! It is about an FBI agent who is under the deep wave of possible sleeper cells in LA; And to get this - he is a practicing Muslim. I was a little skeptical at first, half hoping that some heroes or opponents should probably expect more playful drills than fools, unwanted and intelligent holliers ... let's face it, many shows were guilty. <Br> <br /> But then I saw the first three episodes, and I thought: OK, it's good. Not until the four episodes ("Scholar") I was good and really impressed. I want to praise the great writers and actors, superb acting. I just love how these characters complicate each - they do not straight guys the guys / bad guys on the cardboard cutout straight. Michael Ealy gives an excellent and credible performance as Muslim FBI agent Darwyn Al Saeed, as well as treading the fine line between being a good Muslim and a man with errors. Odid Fehr has given an interesting depth to his character Farik - the Far East does not believe in the Middle Eastern stereotype, but because of its belief in realism and not seeing himself as a ritual, a man is willing to do any extreme steps to verify his justification. Beliefs He is very impressive and authoritative. But I would say that this is the performance of Alex Nassik, which clearly "Scholar" left an impression in me. The screenplay of the psychological struggle of his character was amazing - he broke down in a softly spoken words of a Muslim scholar that he came back in an immune way because it is the only acceptable way in God's eyes and the provocation of faith in the other side of the fairytale. <Br /> <br /> I want to see more such shows, and do not want to see some ridiculous high-octane one-man show series. It's tricky and open mind.
