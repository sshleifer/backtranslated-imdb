This image has been expressed calmly on other side of the globe, perhaps in English too. Hope no one can understand a word, whatever the film does not understand anything! Haahaa! Call me a brown, but I think it's one of the best movies ever. Why would I come to that conclusion ?? As it is about hijacking horror movies of my national past and praying for it every minute! Once I became a fan of Master Science Theater 3000, I had no doubt that they would find it anywhere and use it. Thick sure! The version they achieved was also using some weird protocol footage (apparently, they were ashamed to use footage from their own movies!) From the image of "Cave Dwellers". I can not recommend buying this movie. Instead, I highly recommend getting the MST3K version. It is found anywhere MST3K DVD is sold, do not miss!
