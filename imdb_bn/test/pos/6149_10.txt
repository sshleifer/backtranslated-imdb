I agree with imdb.com Synopsis that this is about a guy who prepares to marry a bisexual marriage. We are more about self-motivated and our parents - we should "end up" when we grow up. Linda McCorman liked the poem, "They dropped you because the childhood has been read." Much more like a poem describing this movie. We take it for years, and we experience the mistakes and mistakes we make and experience, and eventually love it (I'm not trying to be hyper-sensitive or schemopie) and live with a special person.
