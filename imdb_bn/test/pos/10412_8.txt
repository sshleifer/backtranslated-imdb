I think Chilar has lifted this series and how it is looking for this generation is great. In particular, the film has made such a long way to produce special effects, and because they were able to see the archive show for one, they would not have existed, they would certainly be able to see progress in comparison. Monitor neither lame nor spectacular but it is also entertaining. It takes creative lines of storyline that comes with them and every generation seems to be its own horror series. This special series was not horrific on Friday, like the 13th, series, or the adventures of Freddie's nightmare ... this is one thing that the whole family can see and still laugh and fear at the same time. I'm happy with Chile Channel showing them on their line-up, I've been caught in episodes growing up.
