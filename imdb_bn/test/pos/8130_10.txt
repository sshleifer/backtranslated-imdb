The lack of US distribution is the biggest tragedy around this thoroughly delightful movie. I was fortunate to see this movie in the Boston International Festival of Women, and highly recommended to get a chance to see it. Polite acting, and thoughtful scripts and talented and fun everyday tricks to combine all the great aspects of this film!
