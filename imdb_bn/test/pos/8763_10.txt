It is difficult to push the devastating beauty of the words into words, even after a while I still can not understand myself, after a second hour after my second visit. First of all, it must be said that I have seen mostly the impossible and helpless hunting scenes in the production of a movie or television in traffic. Acting is extraordinary, especially as a British minister of Bill Paterson, her heroin-addicted daughter and help with risky Pakistan on drug problems. Another plot line describes these drug issues at a land level in Pakistan and is moving towards interaction with a successful opiate pop farmer and successful heroin runner. The third principal story is going on for the trial of importers of Hamburger and his wife and two German detectives. It suddenly turns out to be an intriguing conflict in Hollywood movies, the correlation between these stories seems normal. This is a larger achievement that spreads to three countries and half a dozen major characters can become very attentive, they can be more attentive and vivid. It is devastating - shameless and brutal but never indifferent. In short, the rare work of traffic film that deals with challenging issues with disrespectful condolences and transparency.
