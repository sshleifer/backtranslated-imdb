This painful and angry movie is not only in war, but against all war. Do not care what war it is. It may be my most emotionally involved experience with Angmerman Bergman's work. There is no direction to the two main characters of this influential drama, which does not hate a point of formal formality like Bergman's naturalness, but generally shows people and their lives, and Bergman has already proved that he practices a person's reaction to a movie <br /> <br /> Its top drawer's regular Leaves Olman and Max von Sedo are a non- But a married couple fools who was once a singer yantarinakaranamulaka orestra.

Clear personalities of the character of Olman and Von Saido have been dropped into the fallen world of war because they have been accused of being "sympathetic", but they do not give any information about the picture shot on the forward house forward of Bergman's little house. When it is set, who are on both sides and what they are fighting for.
