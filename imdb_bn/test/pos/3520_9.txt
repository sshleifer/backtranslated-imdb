Before the Donation Day of the Slasher film in the golden days. Backup Slashher mostly starts with movies like Friday 13th, Burning, and Madman. Donkeys are generally a step ahead of the backslash slashher flick. Cinematography gorgeous The acting is top notch. Movie heroine is not your ideal 'final girl'. <br /> <br /> Constance is a 'wooden girl', but when it comes to survival, it is a step back. As long as he and his lover come to save lives, there is a basic idea of ​​survival survival. It is a fine infection which gradually monitors the secrecy of the final girls - as well as their survival alongside them. <br /> <br> It's perfect for everyone, not for everyone, but for a slash fan. Killer (s) is very boring - it's almost a game that can kill and kill someone who crosses their territory. The end scene is a bit off the keymer. For the first time visitors, it may be a little disappointing. I'd recommend this to anyone who is a fan of backwoods slasher. Even non-slash fans will like something about it. The setting is eerie and makes one feel uncomfortable. Death sequences are not particularly poor, but I'm not sure that the film needs gore. See it!
