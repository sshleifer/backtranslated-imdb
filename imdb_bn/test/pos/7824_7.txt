Sometimes, you're late in the night, got bored from your mind, and want some light and flexible romantic comedy that does not make you feel confused. And this is the movie that fits the right billing. Of course, this plot was thrown from just outside the 1930s .... This article was wonderful as the legendary poem of the Hallmark Greeting Card Company, and one-dimensional characters were played by a Cast to move from Central Castings - but it was CUTE, and Exactly what i need last night <br /> <br /> There are chemistry together with Lorraine Holly and Costas Mandilar - I like it "look around" and after 10 years I'm still happy to be happy. 41 years ago Costas Mandilora is perhaps one of the most beautiful men in favor of screen grace. 80 years ago Oli Rudi Valentino cut this bucket. RRROWRR! Bonus points to vote for those funny people who are on roller scale on the exhibition about cartoon lady. I always had something outside the Hipburn-Grant comedy. <br /> <br /> Some people might say that this movie has ever broken into the biggest pieces, and probably I have to agree - but come! It's on the Hallmark channel. What are you expecting Just come back, relax, eat some sesame seeds, and look down sweet little movies and jeanfandel bottles with two nice people. Believe me, you'll love Samlatz and much more, and then you can swim in the chocolate sea to sleep in the Costas Mandilar swimming, which gives you four feeding petite with a small chocolate icing. YUMMO! (PS. Now my petite is at risk for four people. Thanks, Hallmark!) <br /> <br /> I really want this evil girl to be thrown with Rachel Ray, and maybe the food will be broken as Alton Brown instead Van Dyk crazy diner announcer with beard. Trembling fear! <br /> <br /> This is my nightmare. But hey, check out "just dessert".
