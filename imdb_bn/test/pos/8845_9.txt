This is my first John Carpenter film, I certainly was very impressed by Thing. Since the beginning, the picture attracts you and never tends. The film's special effects and models keep up to date so far. Apart from Kurt Russell, I was not familiar with a cast member, but they were all exceptional in fear, insanity, and frustration of survival. The Universal DVD scene is an attractive addition to the additional back. Strongly recommend, 9/10.
