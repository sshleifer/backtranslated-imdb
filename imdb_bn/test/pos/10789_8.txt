Perhaps one of his less known movies, it is also one of the main reasons for Salvador's lack of expression. It's <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is important, and a lot about free speech and how much it should be free, and you can easily say that it started life like a stage game. Know what you've got before sitting down to see it and you'll be fine. <br /> <br /> There is not much to the actor, as she stole most photos of Bogosia, she wrote and given angry licenses, I could not close her eyes and was a part of the attraction of many of the audience; Those who hated those people who missed something did not stop. <br /> <br /> Not everybody, but very good drama and overall a very good movie.
