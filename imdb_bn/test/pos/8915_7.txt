Why can I give this 1974 porn movie 7 points? Because I saw it. And I found it pleasing! Aliens, their strange spaceship, their strange helmet ... my God, that was a sight. And these desperate lactating women need sperm from the earth. <br /> <br /> and where do they look? High Bavaria, Germany And from which the main fun comes: In Europe (and German speaking countries), Bavaria is seen as a traditional and backward region. And then the actress is so helpless with the alien lady. Well, there are films about how to deal with women like "American Pie" series. <br /> <br /> But what this film has achieved is the fact, funny curiosity. Wondering how you constantly come up with these crackpot ideas. But it was 1974, and 35 years back back met one with a nostalgia. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> This is definitely a comedy, not a porn flickr.
