I saw this movie as part of the Midnight Madness in the Senate. Set in 18th century England, this plot covered Arthur Blake's life for the first time as an apprentice burglar in his final confession of his death sentence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <br /> <br /> The first thing to threaten you about this movie is how accurately they were able to catch the horror of the time of the hammer, the environment set many fog laden cemeteries, rowdy scenes and excellent sets / costume designs. <br /> <br /> I was hoping to emphasize the most horrors for "The Dead the Dead" for a movie? Do not blame me for some shocking moments and gore, but the tone is very ridiculous, which is managed by the situation and through their dialogue. The closest comparison of the two Leeds (Larry Feissenden and Dominican Monghan) to the classic English comedy, the only Phulus and Horse, The Two Runees and Morecam and the Interaction Character Interview. <br /> <br /> Acting firm and many of the others have taken the film out of the role of Ron Perlin and the familiar faces at the familiar Angus script. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> And you can leave a smile on your face.
