At first I must admit, I was worried about Farsus. The opening segment was not very strong, and I started thinking about what was going on. However, once it is associated with the wonderful intelligence in Henson's territories with unique and chronic characters, and the compulsory story makes an excellent part of science fiction. This story is by John Crichton (played by Ben Broder) a scientist who has created a spaceship and theory that depends on the sling shot propulsion. However, during his first test, his cork was confronted by an unknown magnetic field and he was driven into unknown galaxies, where he himself was captured (Starship Moya) and peacekeepers (human law enforcement). He has literally draged the prisoners into the ship, and after most twists and turns, he has joined the prisoners (Ka d'Argo, a lakko warrior; Pau Jhan, a Delwian cleric; Rigel XVI, a appointed ruler and Arin Sun, a peacekeeper who joins the reluctant crew Have done). Excellent special effect, medium make-up, and with dolls and robots that exceed Henson's standard of perfection; As well as a very well written story, and character driven plot, FarScape shows to be a fantastically original, creative, and clever science fiction series.
