The author of acclaimed films of the Driving Lesson, Mrs. Brown and Charlotte Gray, Jeremy Brock Academy Award nominated Jolie Walters and Laura Linna and Rupkin Grin's Harry Potter series performed a hearty drama. The beautiful portrait tells the story of Ben Marshal (Roopert Grint) to a seventeen year old boy, captured in the heart of his religious neurotic mother Laura (Laura Linnni). After the school ended, she agreed to work with retired actress EVA Walton (Julie Walters) a clever, free spirit and "heavy bottle". The couple started amazing adventures from camping and had easy conversations about life around walking around the block. Parents, along with each other as well as challenging each other, both of them have built a beautiful bond that revolutionizes their lives. <br /> <br /> Comedic elements are shameless and precise, especially from British veteran Julie Walters. . For the first time, Brock uses its unique style to create a notorious and loving nature that the director might dream of. The guide comes naturally to the brakes, because they create stunning illustrations of surface breaks and drop the listener in excessive amount of worship. Even the composer Clive Carroll and John Rennerburn's fine score were not a problem to generate the broke. <br /> <br /> Laura Linna is always making her mark in the film as "Laura". Horse and sympathetic mother is sometimes helpless and we have entered into that personality with Linnaea on her helmet. The complexity of his character could not be portrayed by somebody more foolishly. Rupert Grint stopped from "Ron Wesley" and tried something new. Its performance is more responsive than loquacious but Grint has a child's performance that gives us brand new and the visitors enjoy it. But Oscar is coming from nominated actress Julie Walters, who gave her life "EV". Although the role is definitely as a leading, Walter's supporting department fairs well where I believe he can only accept prizes. "Ely" is a mix of "Clementine Cruzinski" and "Mrs. Laura Henderson" with her free spirit and loving personality. I hope his role will not be noticed in this award season. <br /> <br /> Driving lessons are not "outside the world" experience but a delicate, enjoyable audience that can come back and learn a little bit of life, love, and friendships are coming in the form of the most beautiful colors and shapes. <br /> <br /> Grade: *** / ****
