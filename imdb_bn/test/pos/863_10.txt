When I first saw Stella at the comedy center, I thought, "God, it's awesome!" But I like Wet Hot American Summer. So I did not understand anything. There was nothing left for me, but there was more Dildos than any other comedy troupe to find out the stella shorts I heard. When I was able to find them, only my doodi expectations were met, but I've probably seen most comedy scenes that I have seen over the years. The 20th Century little movie set kept me under my feet and kept it on the edge of my seat. For the first time I saw them, I did not smile my ass, but when I saw them repeatedly, I suffered a lot. It was really a shame the cable television limitations for the comedy Central Stella series. It will be fired much better on HBO or Showtime. Their fun can not be limited by brand sensor or popular culture. Although it was in HBO, I'm sure the "public" voted for it less or less in a season, but it still looks fantastic. I do not even need to say I'm in love with Stella and all members of it. Check out his site with all the small films of Stella fan David Wain. They are equally as enjoyable as Stella itself. So my tad exceeded Michael Shelter, Michael Yan Black and David Wain for the incredible comedy made by Stella. I hope to see more of the future troupe.
