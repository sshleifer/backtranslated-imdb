After considering James Earl Jones's name in this title, it has been caught recently. It was better than I expected. Of course it is old - made in the mid-70's / 70's, but it's actually a decent drama. It runs 90 minutes or longer and shows good performance of James Earl Jones and Dyanon Carroll. This plot is commonly used but it is said from the point of view of the single black woman in the welfare, who has 6 children and is trying to deal with the problems she is facing. It creates an interesting scene .... The script that is too sensitive or exaggerated - it's like looking at a past fruit. All 70's are out of abundance in style. Even though the cookie type ... probably did better without theater.
