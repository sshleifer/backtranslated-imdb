After many years, after many years, I again saw this beautiful love story, thinking, about half a century later, reacted to a movie that many girls crying and crying, when I was just trying to understand a male child, a woman in a small town in Brazil , <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At this time, I took my attention towards the film, that is Dr. Hen Suein (Jennifer Jones) Journalist Mark Eliot (William Holden) as a Eurasian specially cleared his policy. Indeed, he constantly emphasizes this in their relationship, he is repeating that he intends to assume his love for him and carry it "frankly", but there is a condition that he is not betraying his Chinese side. It seems to the audience that Suuen is trying to establish subtle restraint between the two unstable and the opposite aspects of his culture, because they try to increase their conflicts in the least failure in their efforts to control them. <br /> <br /> So, the attitude of Sueen always leaves the poor alioth ?? A determined, brave and extremely real man ?? Concerned and confused, without knowing how important it is to give his word. For him, for whom love is simple and straightforward, the situation is clear: If we love each other, then we create a couple and start life together immediately. "Not so fast", does he think, verbally and non-verbally, to answer him all the time. <br /> <br /> In fact, the Chinese part of Suyun will not allow him to do such a level theory. And, since he is running and strengthening these vital capabilities in the two worlds within him, he often signs to him that a particular feature of Chinese culture is deeply embedded in his mind, such as the constant "disorganization" of a spiritual or non-physical world invisible creature By the real world Suuen has always warned Eliot that life is dangerous and is not a cause for concrete threat (as British excellence of colonialism or Japanese aggression), but how dangerous life is because of cruel and harmful threats. Other mysterious and mythical people on gods and poor, terrible and weaker people <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because of this, the mothers must wear their costume clothes for their valued men. So that they do not go away by the jealous gods; Everyone should be ready to shout aloud to send the clouds so that they can avoid the sight of their moon; Farmers are advised that they will shout aloud, "rice is bad! Rice is bad!" Protecting their crops from stealing by deities; And, at a funeral, it is recommended that the family of the deceased be separated from the screen by the screen so that the god does not take good care of their sadness and flexibility. In another language, in the other language, suyayne introduces us to a culture that has a supernatural existence, such as an annoying goddess instead of malignin and poisonous goddess, is always at the end of negative interactions with the worst of daily life. <br /> <br /> This story took place in Hong Kong in 1949, it should be clear that China was almost half feudal society, but the country that came from Elliott was still not influenced by tremendous capitalism. , Introduced in the United States after the first oil shock in 1973, took responsibility for the whole world. Therefore, at least in one aspect, both aspects of Suian's Eurasian personality are still far more innocent than them. <br /> <br /> There have been many history in those days. To China, the main thing is that, after the various stages of communist rule, the country has finally reached in the last two decades, the situation of very aggressive economy is more accurately described as state capitalism. And, what happened with the old spirituality that in 1949 Suuen was so excited in Hong Kong, and behind it, did the Eliot printed under the mountain trees behind the hospital? It's gone, it's gone! In short, if that story happened today, then Eliot will not be forced to go to China to offer Suuen in the third round and the whole family's presence. Indeed, both men are now impossible to each other, their vast behaviorism, the business of speaking naturally!
