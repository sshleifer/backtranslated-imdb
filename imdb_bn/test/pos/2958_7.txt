This second full-length Lone Ranger feature does not measure up to the classic of 1956, but it's a great clip with a lot of rough and timble action, in a good clip. Ranger shows a mysterious murder series that has a cruel pattern with victims of the killing of innocent Indians with peaceful Indians. More assassinations and violence are usually associated with Lone Ranger's courage and the film is involved in racial consolidation, whose comments are spread across screenplay. Using the rigid camouflage, he can only piece together a well-organized piece and bring out the external band and bring it to trial. Client Moore and J. Silverwell have played in a colorful presentation that shows the advantage of the old Tuxedon desert and the Cactus country. The music score is good but the familiar William Tale Overture theme has been kept aside by the lively voice, but the lack of beauty and beauty of the traditional theme of Rangers.
