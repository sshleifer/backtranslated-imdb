I was junior in high school when hit "big" on the school, but just two years later, it was fortunate to watch in midnight movie houses in NYC. <br /> <br /> The first part of the flush is the so-called "trilogy" of movies, as well as the characteristics of Joe Dalesendro, which are the objects of will. It carries the name "Warhol", but Paul Morris's work is even more. Originally, the story concerns itself with the exploitation of one-day surroundings of street intelligent male hostlers (Joe Dalecendro's acting). Joe is young, beautiful, and a little naive ... but he directs his wife to take Bacon to her house, because the reasons should not be fully explained for the film's appreciation. <br /> <br /> Special note film buffs that this film (along with quarterly remaining two), there was no script, every second. Warhol's superstars have been given only a premiere ... and the views and actions the viewers have seen are quite natural (even humorous or non-sensitive at times). But it does all the work ... "Rolling Stone" in its review mentioned that the film was "Midnight Cowboy", better than a single movie of the same year, more polished than Hollywood (an Academy Award winner for the best film). The big name is the talent (I also admire the film equally) ... but FLESH, being correction, was more wrenching and realistic in some way without the need of complex sub-plot and any "cause de Celebre", or for any reason <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie has made a profit of more than $ 3 million dollars and was especially an absolute sensation in the German market (which, surprisingly, seemed to be the "senses of the film" The version of "Post-editing ... see the note below." <br /> <br /> Curiosity, the film is very "cut and paste" with "pops". "Clicks", "Flash", and Conversation literally cut the mid-sentence. Warhol / Morris is a true fact that it is a superstar's "Day of Life", snippets for your radioactive tendencies, it is almost as nearly as it is around. 8 hours of sleeping than the previous Warhol, and 20+ hours is much better than the statue of freedom as a movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As the first of "triangle" it responds to the invitation of a young, wished male icon, homosexual, later sought, please her family. Then the next movies will show with a different set of "different character" values. (See "trash" and "heat")
