I went to the movies watching Claudein and liked it along with each cast and soundtrack. Diahann Carroll was not better than this role. We saw Mrs. Carroll sticking to her face, saw her naked, smoked a cigarette, drank beer and she cursed. Whenever this movie is shown on TV and finally I'll call my friends to see it. From the very beginning of the film, thanks to Soundtrack gladdis night and pips. We have seen a black woman struggling to raise her children, dealing with teenage pregnancy and after living daily, she learned that she is having problems with a person who is wearing herself. Eventually this movie was made with DVD and good quality.
