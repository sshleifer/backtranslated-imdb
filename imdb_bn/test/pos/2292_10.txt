I agree with the above man, it's very funny I understand it all, but my friends do not get it. After going to Japan and staying there you will see a different movie. When I met my girlfriend father in his house in Kanaga I felt the same as Jack, swear. Fear, but it was all good at the end of the day, so I gave this movie 10 10. <br /> <br /> I saw it at least 30 times, it took me to see the plane flying in Japan next month. A good thing is that good game ball scene. I think like there again. If you are interested in Japan and Baseball, it must be seen. Very bad they do not have a signal. Does anyone know that where the scenes of the temple are found and the way of walking with the roof, Hiroko argues with ???? Need to know so I can win an argumrnt with Japanese ex-wife with me. Thank you
