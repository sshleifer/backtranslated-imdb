I wonder how many Minirie Cooper automobiles have been sold for this movie? It can not help but makes this small car sales more attractive, which is featured in this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a very entertaining, hash and Chase movie. It features Mark Wahlberg, Charles Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green and Jason Stotham's "Cool" Cast Feature. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie does not overdo violence, has a pretty intelligent script (with a few brief exceptions). Attractive character features and are nicely guaranteed. It is impossible and fun to see the game of cat and mouse between Norton and Theron characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " "How many times have this happened since the day? It's for you, Hollywood is twisted. Here, one of the criminals (Nurnan) stole and killed the leader of the gang and father (Donald Switterland), so he is the worst of the bunch and the film villain. Theron's character is usually in Hollywood's extended-feminist mode, which allows women to do everything (including driving) than a man. A third tiny irritation, a smoth of Seth Green, a smart-ass attitude that we have to go with because it is hip and cool. <br /> <br /> Despite these obstacles, it is a very entertaining movie and it does not fall prey to prejudice or sex ... and yes, that small car is quiet. I talked to those who watched this movie, they enjoyed it.
