Werner Herzog again explores the mentality of a man. In "Little Dieter ...", we've seen a bright, bright man who survived the hunger and strange views of the Bevariar war, went to the United States and fulfilled his dreams of fulfilling his dream. War, food, death, survival, hanging, air, head coming ... how an American is born. Herzag again sees the craziness as the plane of existence, and Herogenic describes herself as a description of the psychological journey of this German tour itself, which is becoming an American who is flying a war in the late 20th century, where technology, pilgrimage and the end of rubbish are finished. The spoons are mixed with the constant optimism in a person redefined in American cannons. What always confronts us with our madness, brightness and its own extra, social and personal face-to-face with Harejgog. We are laughing and cringe and these people are surprised. Where are these people but America?
