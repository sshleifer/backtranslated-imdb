I think this short TV series was absolutely amazing and gave a deep and clear explanation about everything on the screen at the given time. This was by far David David Attenborough at his best. I personally thought it's one of the best documentaries in the past decade. It is definitely worth the money! <br /> <br /> I get some interesting and interesting parts of deep birds and deep water. It was impossible to discover that the 'Blue Planets' team has discovered the lives of more than 10 new waters! <br /> <br /> <br /> This documentary Atamboro lived almost certainly to its high reputation. <br /> <br /> This was an excellent composition and would always be considered as one of the best modern documentaries <br /> <br /> <br /> Many congratulations to the 'Blue Planets' team.
