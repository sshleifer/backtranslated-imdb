This movie offers the best experience available for movie-gear. This is not an enjoyable movie, but it can never perceive the true and emotional touch to touch the human mind. It is open to the way on how a person thinks, and afterwards the person will change forever. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this picture in the class, and after watching it I had to skip the next class and had to walk on the campus to reset my body and mind. I felt awful and, somewhat unreal, as I did not exist. Just a few months later I was telling one of my friends about Shame, "Oh, did you see it when you saw it and then got compromised and used to talk strange about me?" I did not remember the day I was walking or talking to someone, I was surprised. <br /> <br /> This is a simple story of couple in the war on the terms of the plot. There is more damage than the death of the dead and in the end ... there is no word to complete the image that Bergman created. This is a terrific dream that awakens you, and changes your own reality forever. See these pictures.
