I like this movie. I was not really sure about it before I started to see it, but I enjoyed it. It was a girl (Meridith Monroe), whose mother did not want to change her mind. She met the city for a love football game with a boy (Reilly Smith) and met. This is a good movie. I hope that it will be back or on the video.
