When I knew that Walter would never enjoy another set. When I was 30 years old I saw this sweet, respectful and unforgettable romantic movie. I like it from the first scene and finally till the end. Art Carney was his natural ability; Glendano met with Stephanie Walters step; And Richard Benjamin provided witty voices for the reason he did so well. Even so, many actors we all knew about, their natural brightness. There are a few lines of film that my SEO and I have used throughout the year, but I will not say anything about them here. I'm sure you know that I'm talking about any two. Just get this movie. Make some popcorns, grab your sketch (if he is hungry like me, for which I am grateful) and enjoy this romantic comedy from 70's. You do not have to be frustrated. However, I have a feeling that I am promoting the song here because anyone who loves Walter will already own it. I'm very happy that the DVD is now over.
