The last picture critics, Gene Siselle said that it shows how easy it is to make a movie. He took this day as humiliation, although he praised it. Although I do not always agree with Gene Siskel, I agree with her here. A brilliant example of how Love Jones should be a love story: Realistic Reality with Real Character <br /> <br /> The story is about Darius Lahl (Lorraine Tate) and Nina (Nia Long). Larrenz Tate and Nea Long are just a couple more beautiful couple. These two actually have chemistry together. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm laughing as a friend of Washington Darius's close friend Seawon and when I see him in the movie. He is a great actor, whose career is down in the industry and they are destroyed by the kids' games. You can believe that he had a little bit of vulgarity in his granny's Anatmety but nobody knows better than believing a "official story" from believing in how fruitful works are. At any rate <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You love these people because they are not credible and portrayed as gangsters and tramps. A porn stereotype can not be found here. Contrast that with retro romance movies. Properly. With the love of Black Cinema you can acquire a copy of this movie.
