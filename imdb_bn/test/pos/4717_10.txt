It's a great movie in various ways ... Perhaps it is most important that it represents Aung San Suu Kyi and the Western audience of the remarkable, tragic story of her struggle for freedom and democracy. Wonderful acting, fantastic cinematography, exciting step and mystery: "There is everything out of color" I have seen this movie several times in the last ten years and each time it makes me more meaningful Not everyone will like it (hence less ratings in IMDB), but this is not the Hollywood Hollywood mobile phone; Instead, it challenges the viewers on different levels. I have not seen it without endowing sobbing and promise to save a more meaningful life.
