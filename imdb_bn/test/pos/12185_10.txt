Okay ... the first anna rice book fans. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Although they completely changed the story <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie ... I've never seen the best vampire movie ... and the atheist is completely in it. It has been depicted .... maybe not his features ... but I do not think anyone might find it better ... as he speaks ... Kiye left, his arrogance, his pride ... ... and the love of fame, love shamelessly portrayed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It has everything ... and Goth music ... like a yoga ... conversation ... beautiful ... and catching ... even though it is a vampire movie .. you will find yourself smiling ... Chori At the witches ... and you will find yourself in sympathy with the vampires .. <br /> <br /> Overall ... one of my favic movies ... !! 10/10
