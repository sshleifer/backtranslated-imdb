The reader is a very good job and very sweet short. Each element of the piece helps eliciting a pure mental response to the script. Well played, directed, shot and written. I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting, I could not even read. The performance stand as a delicate sense of acting played in a well written script response. The actress was nice at work and was not an indication that their work slipped into purely emotional. Less is much better in this case. This film is a prime example of how low budget treatments benefit actors and filmmakers.
