Mel Brooks is a great writer, director and actor, but he can get a clinker in a while. Its origins are often associated with one character often after the other. Your Career Elves is charming and talented, but she can not do a comedy. His expressions on the camera show that he can not believe the script's antagonism. Richard Lewis shows a lot of disturbing and confusing work and is stuck in Amy Yasbek's high-school acting mode. Dave Chappell shows maggings and hammings for the camera in the cool comedy range, and Mark Blankfield gets trapped in the role of most blind people, but he still manages to showcase the comedy range. Eric Allen Krummer does not have much to do, but some of his scenes are bound. Roger Rees, Tracy Olman, Megan Cavanho and Brooks have a great role to play. Tom Deloise has made a fun change to use the appearance of Clint Eastwood as a mafia don, but some humorous people are stolen in other mail's other movies, even though some jokes are not very funny.
