A dark knight from the early 80's is a highly neglected and short-film film that seems to deserve viewers, which I can never think of and it's a shameful shame. I compared this movie with others who have got big names over the years, especially Fantasam, Hell Knight and Masonic. This is a lot different than them and I can not see a comparison without the tombs, which is similar to the one in the fantasy, but not enough to actually compare. I'm sure how I slipped one without this greater recognition. Maybe it's all about marketing, I do not know. Perhaps a remake can breathe new life, as long as Rayma's life is out of her life. I am not too big for a lot of remakes these days, but I think they work well with lesser known movies. (Except for the awesome Gahst Ship Remikke, which is not the fire, except for the opening scene, the crack of the Mudvane is not burning, shit). So if a dark knight falls in the right hand of a rimak, I think it will go to many people and look at the original. I know that if I do not see a movie that is remaking before, then I do it. So something smaller than Remake, I'm afraid, I will not bring this picture back to life again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The strange setting. Fairly good acting. Very good story Artificial What do you want from the horror movie of 80? That's what ... nudity and gore? Okay sorry No nudity or pride in this film, but still great! 10 out of a solid 8 Enjoy.
