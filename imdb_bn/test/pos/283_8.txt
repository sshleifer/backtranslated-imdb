In the '60s / 70's', David Jason is famous for his many supporting roles like television comedy 'Do not adjust your set!', 'Harak It's Barker' and 'Doctor' series. In 1974, Richard Leeing and Bernard McKenna wrote his first major role in London Weekend Television 'The Top Secret Life of Edgar Briggs'. <br /> <br /> <br /> Edgar Briggs is a secret agent 'SIS' ('secret intelligence service'). He actually tried to do his job well but always seems to mess things up. Although surprisingly enough, he has always been successful in reaching the bottom of the case concerning his colleagues - 'Buchanan' (Michael Steinton), 'Spencer' (Mark Eden) and 'Kathy' (Lovely Elizabeth Council). Which gives answers to all the 'Commander' (Noyle Coleman). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> 'AV! ', A saint has patience and stands by his intelligent, intelligent (but well-established) husband, no matter. <br /> <br /> 'Some Mothers Du' AV 'and' The Billed Man ',' TTLOHB 'were completely surrounded by slippers. Each episode saw Jason decorate his flat when a high window saw stunts as slumming or a ladder falling from the top to the top. It's really 'custard pie' stuff in the mouth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Edgar Briggs was not a big hit, due to bad schedules from the ITV. Shame it as a shame and enjoyable show, served well by casting its star and fine. The leading people do not seem to enjoy the experience of the show. David Jason gave this event a repetition of the screen because he felt that his performance was unremarkable. Imagine, David Jason, who played 'Dale Boy', 'Inspector Frost' and 'Pop Larkin', was different from playing a brigade but he had no acting. Most actors turned bridges into a funny character but Jason's performance made Briges a credible, realistic person. Strange, but unimaginable. <br /> <br /> Jason's next car was 'Lucky Faller', where he played Mummy's son Sherry Memestead. It failed to rate too much. His lucky break was A.T. V.V. 'A Sharp Intake of Breath', in which he played the walking disaster area 'Peter Barnes' for the four series of 1977-1981. So, although not outstanding, 'Briggs' is a simple and suitable watch. Beautiful 'James Bond' style theme tunes, too!
