But today is quite a date. This film was created without the certification of the Auto-Priming Approval Letter. It was very brave and risky because he lost his investment and future. <br /> <br /> This picture is not true for a great book and, unfortunately, Hollywoodis. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was never a fan playing Frankie machine, surprising in his performance. Someone forgets that Frank is up there, the level of reality he seems to be taking on the role of Jonesing drug addiction. <br /> <br /> Kim Nova, absolutely fantastic and talented, is not frustrated by it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wife, ineligible to despair. He swings from melodramatic to boring and is too high. An amazing performance. <br /> <br /> Stunning, inexpensive settings are frustrating, such as the firm holes of the air will blow up the whole sticky painted cardboard across the horizon. <br /> <br /> <br /> Every nuwan of the script (for example: when the Louis Frankie drawers Should be underscores on high decibel level). <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 Sinatra really deserves his Oscar nomination. Worth watching.
