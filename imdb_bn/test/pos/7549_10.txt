Writing, acting, filing and directing - all the top notchs. I hate to admit it, but I actually shouted at one point (when Dracula was talking to a lame man). The end of an emotional roller coaster from the start really. The ship's harbors provided the perfect setting for this story and the actors really made my fear alive. And coolio as a vampire .... very nice! <br /> <br /> and believe me .... as great as the big movie was ... the end you will run away! I know that for some reason this image gets crack on this site, but I know that no one has seen the end. Bright!
