After completing a summer retreads and frustration, Nurses Betty breathes a breath of fresh air. The film has never been like any other I have ever seen. Director Neil La Buelet proves that he is more boring pictures of men and women and how they lead to sexual relationships (the previous two films were great in the company of men and almost your friends and neighbors). Queen Zilzgar best performs her performer, Betrayer Betty, who saw the brutal death of her assassin husband (La Boot chief Haroon Akhart) and lost in a fabulous world. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock kill his husband and now he plays Hitman during his trial. This film is Freeman and Geljager actually parallel characters. Handsome and humble at Zelger Soup opera Dave falls in love with Ravelle, making Freeman Betty ideal. Nurse Betty is a great film, full of life, humorous, love and graphic violence. My grade: 10/10.
