I went to see the idea that this would be a great return to a great comedy and Robin Williams, but when I saw it, I realized I was lying to the bees because of advertisers because it is more dramatic than comedians, though it has a little good smile. I think I was watching two movies. There was a fun romp with Robin Williams that should have been completely basin for the movie, but you can also get a techno thriller movie with political fingers in the middle. I do not really know how to classify this film. But I can tell you it was good and I hope as much as I hope, I smile, but at least Williams is back in the right direction. See this but it does not know all before comedy and a bit intense.
