<br /> <br /> Emilio Estevez takes an amazing drama homefrench and turns it into a compelling movie. <br /> <br /> There is a very strong cast in the war house - all are digging deep into their characters. Here's the top note acting! <br /> <br /> The credit director will go to Emilio Estevez. The visual convergence between past and present was very smooth. Sound effects during the battle scene became cool and effectively added to the tension. <br /> <br /> Remove all the Vietnamese elements from the story, and still remaining interesting and bad wrestling with interesting characters will be left in full range of family dynamics. (A viewer may look at this point more clearly with the thought of "discovering old pictures" from the beginning to the beginning). <br /> <br /> As a movie, I got the fight for being more straight and point-points than the fourth floor of July. A good effort - about 10. <br /> <br />
