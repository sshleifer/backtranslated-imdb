Kevin Kline offers a brilliant comic counter in comedy in and out in 1997. Claire Howard Braket, a small town history teacher who is sitting down to see Academy Awards this year because her alumni (Matt Dillon) is a nominated candidate. He was nominated for acting in a movie where he played a gay soldier, and when he won, Howard, in his speech, thanked Howard for his motivation for motivating him. Now this floor is Howard, because he is the source of this as why people say on international television. Howard can also be married (near Jon Cusack, Oscar nominated), so he has no idea that Dylan Cameron found out on Drake that he had gone and watched himself defend himself against everyone in the school, but in the Oscars, Cameron said that nobody was crying terribly. There is a group of Howard's birthday party, where he has been given Birthday gifts such as Eintail's soundtrack, and repeatedly explains why his guests have been asked to make Strenesand his Fannie Lady. His parents (Wilford Breamley, Debbie Reynolds) are frustrated but have promised to support their son, even if he is gay. He also received an interview from the city reporter (Tom Selek) who wants to make an article about him because he is also gay. The moment that Selle's clean-up lips will take a big kiss, it's classic. But among these little things, Howarda is actually raising questions about his sexuality and he is actually thinking of a lesbian ... much to the anxiety and frustration of his fog couscous, which is beyond confusion. She left a bar where her wedding gown and stood in the middle of the street screaming about the lack of straight men in the world, a classic. But what I like about this movie is that the Kine fully investes in the role and is not afraid to see stupid or gay. Here's an extraordinary scene, perhaps most famous from the movie, where he bought a record, how to beat and how the man in the record can dance and a disco tune. Memory will survive if served) and the narrator of the record says no matter what you do, do not dance, but Howard does not help himself, and he ends up shaking his pebbles in all the rooms. It is hysterically funny and Kline plays it with sincerity and gusto. The film is pro or anti-gay ... It's just a shiny and fun character study about a person who is trying to fix it. Wonderful Movies.
