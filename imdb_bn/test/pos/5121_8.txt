This movie is not a great movie, but your family, especially 10-15-15, is a good film to watch for children. This movie has good topics of discussion such as bula, environment, and work to fix things. Jimmy Buffet's music was a plus, and the scenery was wonderful ... the young actors were nice, and this is a movie I would expect to see in the family channel or the Hallmark channel. Without a few words in the dialogue, a middle school may start a discussion in the classroom. Hope this will be shown in Drive-In this summer so that more people can see it. It was well followed by Karl Haysen's book and it was fun to see him in a low performance.
