"Peach Black" was a complete shock to me when I first saw it in 2000. In the previous years, I was frustrated by the repeated Saifai films (former Starships Tropper) and it seemed that the movie would not be different. But simply put it: This movie is a good way ... let me freaked out. I was surprised that I was scared of darkness until I saw this movie; When I was my child, I would bury my fear of my subconscious and it deserves to be right there. <br /> <br /> Alien animals have embraced my spine; There is a diverse but brilliant and creative imagination to come up with something impressive and diverse to the person (s) they designed. <br /> <br /> I was fascinated by how the authors highlighted each major character's history and showed their mistakes and the forces without much confusion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At first you think of him as a cool cute villain but at some brief moments, you can see some human beings beside his animal. But as soon as you discover it, he works some maliciously devious. He certainly keeps you guessing until the very end. I do not know whether he should be despised or appreciated ... He must be the character of love / hatred. <br /> <br /> John Holler is a perfect example of a character that puts a good forward but shows the real purpose of greed, and what he wants to live for. John's knee makes him terrible as a rick to hit the button and learn the exact words to speak. <br /> <br /> Fry (Radha Mitchell) is a character who has published Johnson so well, looking at himself. The first ass before considering the results. But to whom he is revered for that he quickly feels faults in his ways and tries hardly to satisfy him, even while endangering his life, others remove human society and drive the dark hills. <br /> <br /> Jack (Raina Griffith) just wanted to get a hero and was out of the whole team in search of the hero of the first Raidik; In child's eyes, bad dense clouds are better seen. I thought that Jack kept his hands on his head while looking at the rick. You know what they say: Imitation is the best form of chic <br /> <br /> Imam (Keith David) like Jack is able to look good in a temple. He uses philosophy to carry him through the hard work he gets and when he permits time, he reasonably loses his loss and then sows the soldiers. Although most of the characters did not play as well as they did, they still worked for the courage to stay alive. <br /> <br /> The cast for this movie was positive. Each actors shined their role brilliantly and their talents nicely blend into the screen. <br /> <br /> This movie was a small budget but the director's leadership and the actor's acting role allowed the movie to be created and used by the viewers instead of letting them do all the work for them. This movie is a definite Sci-Fi classic. Check it out and judge for yourself (with an open mind). It will be well worth it.
