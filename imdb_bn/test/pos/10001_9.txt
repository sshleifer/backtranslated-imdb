As a recreational golf with some knowledge of sports history, I was pleased with Disney's sensibilities on the subject of golf classes in the early twentieth century. Harry Warden spent the war against his own childhood, the childhood could not break his glass ceiling, which prevented him from adopting the equivalent of the English golf community. Likewise, the young Wimit goes through his own class struggle, just as an eater in the eyes of upper-level Americans who are trying to stand up to his position. <br /> <br /> I like what I like best, however, how the theme of the class is unfolded in the parents' character of Ummah. His father is a working dragon who sees the value of hard work but is afraid of higher class; But his mother recognizes the talents and desires of his son and encourages him to encourage his dream to compete with them. Finally, golf scenes are well-photographed. Although this course used in the movie is not the actual site of the historical tournament, little independence adopted by Disney is not cut off from the beauty of the film. There is a small Disney moment in the pool table; Otherwise, visitors do not actually think Disney. In the end, some Disney is not created as "miracle", but only human history may be written.
