I played 98 'or 99' for the first time when I was with my friends. I thought the game was really cool and it liked. <br /> <br /> The game is simple. In one player mode, you go around James Bond and complete the mission in various locations like an Arctic Animal Field or City. There was one with my favorite tank. In two player modes, you and a friend choose from any of your characters and leave everything with the fight. You are in the area, find corridors and weapons to help you. Hand guns work from rifles near lasers and even your fists. <br /> <br /> Again, two modes with the player, many places to go, and some to unlock. I make this game really fun, but very suspicious. Because, you never know where your opponent is, and it's wonderful to see them behind where you are going. <br /> <br /> This game is **** (1/2) big or ***** very good! Play it for a while!
