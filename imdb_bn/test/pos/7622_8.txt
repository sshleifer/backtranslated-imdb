This is a good kind of movie. It seems that they used the Teronosaurus Rex, like a bright balloon like Godzilla, returned within exactly 60-70 days, the scientist got enough information. On all kinds of dinosaurs. Scientists are still making dinosaurs at that time, so I think this film was based on the Tieranosaurus Rex movement in the 60s-70s. Even a part where a giant rock, fired by someone in Tieranosaurus Rex, damages the Tinososaurus Rex, and it becomes hard for a short time. In the end, Tirenosaurus Rex went back to search for food. There are some mistakes in the film, like a rifle, how a rifle can kill the Tieranosaurus Rex, when it can be 1000-5,000 stronger than us. If this movie is going to create a remake, then I recommend it to be better and excited, because an old film seems to be lucky if it is rebuilt.
