This is a horror film of my choice, second to 'Poltartist' I saw 'One Dark Knight' while coming to theaters in theaters in theaters in 1983. <br /> <br /> I was born in 1963, so there is a love for my 80's horror movie, they have a small date and the dialog is not well written. I think the main thing was that the phenomenon of 'psychological vampireism' was not resolved (at least, at that time my knowledge) and that is a very real incident. <br /> <br /> I do not care if Adam West is in it (nothing against him, his supporter's role was not memorable), but he thought that Meg Tilly was well-casted. As a surveillance surveillance expert on Ramm's authority, the world's Donald Hutton (from "Brainstorm" and "Come to Mars") tragically ignored. As a gay guy, I was paying more attention to David Mason Daniels, Meg Tilly's unfortunate but gorgeous boyfriend He is now selling real estate in Texas. <br /> <br /> I felt the film 'realistic' in two ways: Rayamar, who was discovered to kill 6 girls in his guesthouse apartment, was a funeral which was apparent in the presence, which was not only a mysterious, a fan , But a killer. You know, these types of fanfare are burnt without. Secondly, if the body was going to be teleconnectically mobile, then they would draw their legs. Filmmakers can walk, walk, walk, and exercise for the outside surgery, but choose what is trustworthy. Glory! From the eyes of Raman, in his 'throne coffin' (like he is supervising the rule of the dead) radioactive electricity discharge, has thrown an exaggerated magenta in the tomb which will be with you for many years! If you've ever gone to a burial even on a sunny day, you will notice that they have their own Rosetta light caused by stained glass windows. Do not start me spy silence. Even Ramara looked like someone who could pass like a wonderful, distorted old man. The score was kind and memorable, and I did not keep kicked myself for getting it in the cassette when it first came out. The track is shooting where it is supposed to be. I especially like the carefully designed features of each corpse: the bride, the badly disfigured child is still the first person to greet her opening ceremony of 'Teddy Bear', grandmother, long thin black guy and half face-to-face World War II, and green-eyed 'Bonesera' cycle. . Even the bodies may be good actors, I think. I was disappointed with the only thing, the hand that came out of one flash and could not joke Julie's lover, if the body first kept her stomach and legs, why? It looked very early too soon. <br /> <br /> This film has started, Rumer's face (till the last quarter of the film, which is not like a birthday present), her daughter's flash runway. We then look at her to grab her body in her bedroom apartment, where we see her teletetic craftsmanship tested by the wall of her phishing dishes. The rest of the people, like Sister's group, 'Sisters Group', put Zoom in the final effort by spending night inside the tomb, but later it is made for the open horror of openness. The sound of the movie is not bloody in any sense. The most important part when Rama's daughter uses a compact mirror to bring her strength back, then the bubble melts. I've always felt that power like a rum could never die and a signal could be valuable. I can see it now: one dark night second: turning around in the grave. But let's face it - the film is standing alone. I heard that this movie had another title, but the original fits. <br /> <br /> A remix must be in vain. But if there were to be one, then I would write good conversations and instead of listening to it in the tape recorder, instead of hearing about the capabilities of Ramarama in Lamarama, we would like to see some scenes. This information is about age, something good that DVDs will be well documented. More bodies! Why only Rumar energy can spread in the graveyard when raising more in the tomb? Let's just say that I will be disappointed with a person to clean the mess at the end of climax; That's too much to be shown. I think initially a relative should be acting as a relative to recognize one among the bodies. With the effect of Caesar floating some wonderful scenes floating with the ceiling, the wall will be closed! Say <br /> <br />, 'a dark night', but all of it is there. So see at least once in your life or death!
