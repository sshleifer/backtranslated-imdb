A 17-year-old 17-year-old boy's sweet, entertaining story, controlled by a prominent religious mother, and withdrew his father, and found himself out of his work with retired, wonderful and unfortunate actresses. Very well played, especially by Julie Walter Rupert Green plays a key role in teen age, showing that his talent is longer than the Harry Potter series. Laura Linnie plays with her brutally tough mother without a hint of release, so she does not have any room to choose from. But the film is a very entertaining film, which makes the Britishers better in style of Pepper and Calendar Girls.
