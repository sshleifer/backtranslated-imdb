Vanaja is a film of superlatives. Mamta is an excellent blend of an impressive jewelery, a wonderful production and a pre-production with potential Rajneesh, a scenic journey from rural South India through a 15 year old scene. A beautiful backdrop of songs and animals, which are made of traditional and modern, perfectly mixed, and gorgeous colors and flavors. What a great achievement for a debut director !! The cast was completely dead. I hope India will come with such a lot of pictures. This film will remain as one of my top favorites for my whole life. 9/10
