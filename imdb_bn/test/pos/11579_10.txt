One of my friends asked: "Does not anyone want to be enthusiastic to like this movie? Is it a mistake of most queens to end their life?" Interesting questions. <br /> <br /> As far as I can see (if I am wrong, correct it), there are only a quarter that wanted to end his life inside the sea. Ramon Samadoro thinks that the film is also good. That's what he wants to die. It's fighting for his rights to decide his death. He says for himself and not other quadriplegics. Although its pioneering work, according to one's view, down the road may prove to be beneficial or harmful to the quadruped, its primary purpose is personal. But this movie (in my opinion, anyway) is that our visitors force us to ask the question that my friend is so short. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I struggled to meet with this exasperating concept; Why do you want to die? Ramon is so unconditionally love, care and sacrifice by the people around him, why would he frustrantly look at his harmful decision? Then, at the time of my second visit, Ramon and the lawyer entered into my consciousness of a shared thought between the lady. It threw a statement of observation: "... total dependence comes the cost of close proximity." Most people wish for such an intimacy. Of course, depending on how much we value these "needs" depends on the person. <br /> <br /> As a person with a family preferential sensitivity, I expressed strong feelings with the careers of this film. Why can not Javier consider the sacrifice and love of his family and friends? Is he blind? I do not think so. Therefore, the miracle of the sea is an insightful illustration of a human war war. What should we do when we face a guardian of affection, but love one's helplessness, whose quiet, conscious and reasonable purpose for death is revealed? Careful and against his or her will, is a living love of a holy gesture? Does it show the value of our love? Or does it just allow our selfish fear to frighten the fear of unrest? With so much understanding to the carers, their illegal charges are not sacrificial work by submitting themselves to dependency on others to live? Miracle or not, how much "dignity" is a person's value? Living with dignity (or dying) is a privilege or a right? If we really care and love a person, should we respect the last decision of our lives (like death)? A tide of movie questions, which can answer, I have no place to provide. <br /> <br /> With the intent of determining our ability to live smartly or intellectually, we run the risk of neglecting the gray ocean, which affects the people most closely, caring and caring for them. So trying to present their fine but complex relationships with them in the ocean. Finally, this image understands one thing; That "sacrifice" nature is not unilateral. In this war of war, we should try to not win the argument, but to observe it continuously and hope that the "strong" party is to sacrifice it. <br /> <br /> A cosmic film in the ocean. It's my eyes open thing I do not want to see. And for that, I'm grateful.
