I love it Others have revealed the spoilers, but I do not. It's an unusual courtroom, actually kind of weird, but I went along completely. Camilo was a tough part of the firm; Maybe some people hate it. But I think Sienna was excellent and her acting skills were able to overcome the whole part - drug or ridiculous. I know why I'm not interested in frustration like James Franco, but I got married anyway. I liked him as an actor and he did a horrible job. She has nothing to be ashamed of. Has been a movie with similar setup. "Ghost" I just loved Siena Miller and went with the written situation in the script. I am underrated with his great acting talent, and hopefully it becomes more recognizable by the public. I thought actors played their parts very well, and hopefully more people will see the movie. I highly recommend it. I was surprised that almost 10 copies of my local block booster store were available. I definitely plan to buy it
