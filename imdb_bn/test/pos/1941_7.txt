I think this is a beautiful movie, but one thing makes it very interesting to me. It is obviously obvious once you look for it: the main characters of this movie are the inspiration for Simpsons Bulls. Lane Zimbabo, John Kearney, and Tony Dolph. There is also an episode of The Simpsons where Zimbo uses the line "I put him in a stick with a stick" line. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Carnine has a headache, unharmed, but bigger, stupid. Tony-dolph connection is quite clear with long, partial hair cut and even the second layer level.
