This year's horror movie is extreme. "House of Max" is the most horrific movie I've ever seen. This version really keeps Vincent Price version of shame movie. I just know a little about the young cast of the movie. Paris Hilton occasionally boring; Do you think the pain is more seductive than ever before. At least, she did not try to copy her notoriety. Well, if he likes doing terrible things, he is better than "wheel of Fortune." He Hands Hands! And there was no joke in where "wax house" was built. The house was made of wax, and the victims were able to get there from there before their friends waxed like them. Those two pairs and Vincent (perverted pair) are the riches from the water. Except Vincent, parents raised them. And I think they became equally warped. How to pick another peak one would be strange, but not as bad as the other two. Another story of that book. I think he had to follow his heart, other peculiar people who turned Ambrose into a "trap" for the unhappy victims. This movie meets "The Rocky Harr Picture Show" like "The Phantom of Opera". This movie is one of the most horrific in 2005! 5 out of 4 ratings
