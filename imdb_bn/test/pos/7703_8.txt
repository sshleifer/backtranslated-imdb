The most drunk, depressed, still open docs. I've seen it in a while. There are no descriptions or stories that there are no "third eye" type cameras after almost two couples from New York's heroin addictors through Singapore. Seeing their needle in public toilets when shot on the floor in the public washroom ... Sometimes it is a bit more and you just have to stop going for the respiratory. <br /> <br /> Anyone who can now look at the recovery of alcohol / drug additions when they are thirsty - it shows you what you are going to do! After seeing this, it is surprising how anyone can start with this drug. <br /> <br /> There was a follow-up to tell the only thing to this person. Judging from what is shown in the doc., There is no hope for any of them. They mention that they want to get better and leave, but it seems that their habit is the only exit from the way of death. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not for all visitors. I see myself showing a car accident - I could not stop it after I started watching it. I had to keep an eye on a dark / minded view of what I want inside the life of this addiction.
