Well, I would say, this movie is probably the most fun movie I've seen throughout the year. And I just do not mean that a good way. This is probably the most kind of movie I've seen a while, and still makes it so ridiculous. You can say that these people are actually trying to work, unfortunately for them, they are not doing such a good thing, it seems really interesting to distribute a line that is even considered as a serious tone. Aaron Carter actually plays a character like himself in real life, and he still feels that the character is completely realistic and not all realistic. This movie is one of the movies where the serious word is supposed to be really fun and all the things supposed to be funny are just so stupid and stupid that laugh because you know how much they are trying. This movie is so bad, it's actually good. If you are in the mood for a good smile I will definitely recommend it.
