Angela (Sandra Bullock) is a computer expert but shy and somewhat frustrating, she does all her work from her condo border. A colleague with a vacation in Mexico sends a computer disc with annoying information on her. Angela agreed to meet with her colleague but she died in a plane crash mysteriously. Although Angela is taken to Mexico, she needs a disc. She is sunning on the beach, Jack makes her overtures (an awesome looking Gentleman named Jeremy Northam). He read for them and the two boats ended up in a boat at Kozumel. However, Jack Disk works for secret information generators and he comes out to get it. Even after Angela escaped from her back and returned to the United States, Jack made some difficult. He changed Angela's identity to every computer across the country, making him lose his condoms, his bank account, everything. Angela, no computer, can beat Jack in his own game? There are so many resources in this very exciting movie. First of all, Bullock and Northam are two very nice, interesting actors and their presence immediately adds coupons. The script is very clever and sure about the power of computer and its relevance to today's world. The costumes, sets, production and aspects of the film are quite surprising. And, despite how it sounds, Angela did an exciting job of running the run to defeat her enemy. If you love the thriller without unnecessary bloodshed or violence, it's a great choice. It twists and turns with great frequency distribution, the audience entertainment is a very good evening "net" possible.
