I like "Flash Gordon" as a child and brings back such delightful memories at watching the series again on DVD. Each 15 minute episode of our hero Flash, great Dale Ardenen and Cruel Dr on the planet of Monte. There is a feature of the appearance of Zarkov, Flash has survived death from every house: The Shark Man has almost drowned, he faces the monster of the fire. Terror of terror, and he is a serious danger to the static cell! <br /> <br /> Letters are still funny: Barber Crabby is a delicate and beautiful Del Arden hero of heroes and genius Rogers. Prince Aara still plots to steal the flash for himself, King of Bhutan has a growing smile and angel wings, and the world's emperor Ming ruthless Ming, still giving evil eyes and cripps to everyone. <br /> <br /> This serial probably will not interest children today with the effect of his hockey - oh, that spaceship! - But for those who love it for the first time, it's a fun bit of nostalgia for it. The actors play it directly and do not play kids down. I appreciate reading the readings of young viewers who had quite a big word among them which synopses the chapter. <br /> <br /> I'm glad this DVD came out. It's great fun to review this classic science-fiber series.
