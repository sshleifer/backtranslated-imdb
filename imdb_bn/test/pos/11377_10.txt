This movie has it all in it. Excellent writing and guidance by Great Actor, Good Conversation, Drama, Comedy, and Paul Thomas Anderson. I have seen this picture several times and each time I enjoyed it more. It's not old, it's consistently entertaining and stimulating. Easily Burt Reynolds has the best role, and he does a great job. John C. Rally and Don Cheadle also give excellent comedic performances. There is no weak element in this picture.
