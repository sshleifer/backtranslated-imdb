Every high praise sounds in the short ways before the height of this movie. The real example of how this movie should be a psychological horror film. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < But after the second viewing you will start adding pieces together and then you will know how the movie can be awesome. <br /> <br /> A word of advice from Slash Flickr from this movie. This is not your stupid ass teenager's slash film, where you simply switch your brain and sit in front of the screen only to see big B ** BS and lots of blood. <br /> <br /> If you want to enhance the psychological fear factor of this film and watch it exclusively with a solitary home theater system that supports Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1ch, you have a joke on any acute condition except a sick friend friend Leaked. And do not forget to switch off light. <br /> <br /> My point in different directions: - <br /> <br /> Directions = 9/10 acting = 8/10 atmosphere = 10/10 word effect = 9/10 <br /> <br / > Total = 9/10
