Above all, the whole script is most impressive, which is a real documentary added to the great confusion we are seeing. Secondly, actors rented by Watkins are purposely elected to represent their real political alliances and backgrounds. Illustrated hippies are actual hippies, government officials (but not necessarily a government), at least really hearty conservatives in the system, and most of the police are actually police policemen. The interactions of these actors eventually result in a violent headline given by Watkins to provide text freedom, while Watkins believes himself that a Cast member was actually shot. (We call him "cut! Cut!" In the background.) <br /> <br /> American critics were quite rigorous in their reviews, although it is actually a report that it is the "most invasive" film. Have ever seen This era of America is not as unexpected as expressing this oppressive communist-like mentality. This pseudo-documentary clearly requires an open mind, even though you are looking for deeply accurate painting of the 60th culture but it will be a film to watch.
