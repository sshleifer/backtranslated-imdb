This movie is some of the best shoes I have seen in film or on stage. Actors perform skill and vitality with each other, which can not be achieved by means of editing. <br /> <br /> "Love Jones" is a good story, time period. But it's a great example of urban, middle-income, often African-American sets that are not often seen.
