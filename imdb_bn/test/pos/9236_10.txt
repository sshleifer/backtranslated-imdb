After watching "Treason of Texas Tale" you feel a new hatred for the nature of Hollywood animals. All the interviews and conversations involved with the project have common ideas of humor and rebellion, which spread to the backgrounds, social categories and even geography. Undoubtedly the commitment of the whole product to this project and the love of the real movie story and its creator, the complete creation of vacuum, its hard work can be blamed. The scale of people involved in "Waldoar Hawaiian Holiday" was amazing to me, in no budget, no glory was produced. There was no trailer or craft service, no facility, and yet everyone is involved in stuck there. If this project does not come, then Antivyu Productions has established their foundation to become a serious, honest company that is never going down and it does not accept or sell and makes a movie for money. I'd like to go through a guerrilla process to get an LA director shot. This is not true true life of CG and green screen. People can enjoy feeding their entertaining spoons with cool sensuous sensors, but there is a large group that will share the opinions and insights of filmmakers who still make films for the love of ingredients. Or love to tell stories, or DVD sales or at the box office. I like this documentary, and I hope the IFC will take it up and wind it up, perhaps more than one person will pick up the camera and agree to film some real life so that we can see even a temporary understanding of the audience that everyone is the same everywhere, and any There can be any true storytelling in place.
