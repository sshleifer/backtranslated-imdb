I'm not a big music video fan. I think music video takes a personal feel about a special song .. no song. In other words, creative thinking goes out of the window. Similarly, the individual feelings about the MJ task aside. This was the best music video ever. Only surprising. It was a movie. Yes people were it. Bright! You were outstanding performers, awesome dancers, and extraordinary singers. This was spectacular. A beautiful young lady just dating a man's line of intrigue, but he was a man or something sinister. Vincent Price did his thing in adding songs and videos. MJM, said enough about that. This song was on the video, for Jaguar cars. Line top, PERFECTO What was even better than that, we got the original MJ without thousands of Fifilifts. Although surprising enough, nearby makeup and costume were to go around. People visit Youtube. Take 14 minutes. Watch out for yourself and yourself what this special video industry really is a wonderful job.
