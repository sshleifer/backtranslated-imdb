This is an excellent example of what the image could be an independent film. The director makes an excellent job to ride the line between mental and physical violence. But in the end, he thinks so many indie-film forgets - he tells a good story. When I saw this movie, I was wondering how Hollywood movies have become really the most horrific and the biggest budget in Mundana. <br /> <br /> Especially notable, the leadership of the film - George Cordova is a very strong performance. Kadova is an impressive, cruel, fantastical, terrible, and lazy Sob. Playing, a curious thug (on the top of crime crime), but he is so fond of that he gives you full-time entertainment. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that these people are part of the New Wave of Latino filmmakers in Los Angeles - which is known as La Nueva Obr√†, or something like that. In any case, this image makes you look forward to seeing more of their work. <br /> <br />
