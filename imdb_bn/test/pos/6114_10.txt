Well, I can safely say I'm the man, Wang. And I do not throw. I laughed And laugh If this movie discourages you, there is something wrong with you. But this movie is incredible. I bought it four days ago, and saw it five times already. Animal cruelty gets my heart, but it is not long enough to be guilty. The movie is frustrating, hateful and obscene. Acting awesome What do you want from a movie? I am a rusty hard-cultured film modest. Pink Flamingos awesome. It makes Rocky Horror, as someone says, looks like Teletubbies.
