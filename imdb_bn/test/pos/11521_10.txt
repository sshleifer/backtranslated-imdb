I must say that this movie had a great cast, location, music and camera work. Cameron Diaz was great, he had a very exciting roll, was very excited, when Jordanian Bruce had a serious roll but still retained it. Jordan's very nostalgic for me, he reminds me of a female classmate! In this film, did I really have to choose exactly what camera cameras and locations were. The story is very gifted writing. It's a must see. One of the mysterious films must see this, I will give you all the guarantees that will keep them in your seats at the end.
