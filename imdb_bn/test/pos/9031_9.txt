It's a very bad Iameracing story and the "Dent-In-Intruder" movie wants to deny Faulkner's and Clarence Brown's intentions. I think it is difficult to tolerate any Southern of the burden of racism and I understand that. But the film is not particularly about racism, ridiculous and wrong. Yes (in the case above to borrow your usage) iameracing, there are many places where black and white people in the south get along quite well. But the black people who were and sometimes have been forced to live still, denying that their conditions and injustices were tolerated is not astonishing. Sometimes black and white people got along with real affection and understanding. Sometimes the blacks 'knew their place' as long as it was. The point of making Juan Hern√°ndez character (film and print) is not a bit of fork, warm and vague, but the fact that the group is wrong and not only for itself and human rights is not just for everyone regardless of whether we like it or not. Special person or not <br /> <br /> It would do good to deny the existence of racism and to stop denying the harm to all the trap Americans. The truth is that black people (among others), as a rule, are not exceptions, do not take advantage of the justice system as fairly White. Isolation, disparity and lynching historical facts. People like imaging may claim that these claims are not considered extensively, and would probably like to expel their ancestors and heroes from any connection with this behavior. The ancestors of the Eyesesinging (if any) do not participate in any horrific racist acts that beat the history of this country and I do not expect it to be a wonderful thing. It is a great congratulations for them, but in reality, the fact is that it does not delete what others have done. Even if the blacks (and other areas, in other areas, do not forget about the draft riots in the civil war) even terrible things even just one-third, just one-third, does it make them less scary? Ten killings of ten children, ten hanging ten women have hundreds of less horrific incidents than sexual harassment? <br /> <br /> Imising our "Shoulder Burning" chip on our shoulders before showing "Intruder on the forehead", I ask you, what happened to civil rights activists' killings? Why should you forget that? Forgiveness? may be. But to prevent them from repeating, they can not be forgotten or corrected in small incidents. The racism displayed in "Dirt Entrant" is very deliberately displayed. It has to make a point. <br /> <br /> At the historic level of the cinematic, it is ridiculous for the eumersing to leave the ethnic angle. Before the 1960s, any film-starring filmmaker knows that black actors / characters / extra are deliberately cast. To judge from our movie history; War is always fought by middle-aged white men; There was no black man in the Old West; A major city was possible to walk on a street and did not face a black person; There was no black hospital orderly, taxi driver, clerk, sales worker etc. The nations were not a role until the nation was a cause. If Falcuner (and Brown) wanted to tell the story of an easy murder, he probably did not make the character of Hernandez black. <br /> <br /> Racism is the current imaging. Perhaps for various reasons I'm sure, we both do not want to do this, but do that. We want them to do things that they want to be, but they can not help but it still does not make them.
