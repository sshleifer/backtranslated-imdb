I freely admit I did not see the original movie, but I read this game, so there are some backgrounds with my "background". If you break a restored old classic, this movie is smart, malicious, fresh and funny. Yes, casting decisions may seem odd, but they work. <br /> <br /> I'm not a strong feminist, and I was not bothered at the middle of the film - despite what other women said. This is not a movie for men to see (so please, ladies, do not drag your boys to see it with you, it's just cruel); Women get jokes, situations, and relationships. <br /> <br /> I was deeply surprised at the depth of his character, Antti Benning ... he did an excellent job. Debra Messing was adorable, and Candice Bergen was fantastic. I was less influenced by Mag Ryan ... He brought emotion to the table, but in his comedic it was less powerful. All female cast is strong, and it certainly is a sunny humor. I've enjoyed this movie perfectly, and fully desire to see it again with my mother. Women will understand.
