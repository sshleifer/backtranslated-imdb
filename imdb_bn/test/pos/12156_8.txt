"More", most likely, most notable for the beautiful soundtrack written by Rosa Floyd in 1969. It was not a superstar yet. In fact, they created an album with film music, a fan can not miss it! <br /> <br /> But German-French director Barbet Schoder's first film: This is a civilized film. When it is released, censorship cuts across different scenes of sex and drugs everywhere. This is clearly one of the first films to practice the theme of drug slavery. <br /> <br /> A German boy travels to Paris and fills an American girl: they fall in love. Together they search for the sun and exoticism. But it is a very high love: she introduces him into medicine. <br /> <br /> Today's Sixth Drugs Campaigns were not like today, there was not much information. On the contrary, there was a spiritual experience in taking millions of drugs into drugs ... so it is astonishing to watch a movie that is a wonderful heroin experience. <br /> <br /> The picture is simple, not all pornographic and a "movie-verité" style shot. Actor Mimsy Farmer and Claus Grünberg are very confident. "More" is a document ending in the late sixties-and there is a document ending the illusion of Hippies.
