This version of "Lost Harijan" was not only great music and beautiful scenery, but some stunning mountain photography is even better than that. Some years ago a special edition laser disc was released which added more than 30 minutes of deleted content, additional music and lots of bonus content. So why not DVD ?! Sometimes the studio is hard to find. Of course, Peter Finch, Leigh Olman, George Kennedy and Sally Kellyman may have a much better role to play, but what movie do you want in the well-played or protected pipe? Songs and dances Bobby Van is very funny, Michael York can hear the sound of a good tragedy villain and Sir John Gilgood being silent, but he really does very well on the screen. Trust me, you have to check this movie - if you can find it!
