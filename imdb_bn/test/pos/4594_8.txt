"Ideasie" Michael is the latest movie from the "Office Space" judge, and it must follow the theme similar to that movie, how it actually sticks to the stereotype and how intercession can overcome the danger ... talking relatively. It is a story about Joe Bauer (Luke Liss Wilson), which is the most common man in existence. Joe, and Rita (Maya Rudolph), a prostitute, has become the subject of testing for the military project of the Hydration Chamber. They stayed for one year, but due to lack of supervision, Joe and Rita forgot and accidentally got 500 years in the future. Here's the scary part: This picture explains, in a very realistic and logical way, how the entire population of 2505 became upset. With no natural enemies, the evolution of human species does not support the fastest, intelligent and strongest people for the progress of the genes ... Only those who breed the most. Unfortunately, people who are rabbit-sucking, those who breed like rabbit will be trailer trash idiots. This enormous reproduction of stupid people has adverse effects on social growth and now faces two Juan and Rita planets, two intelligent people. If this helps, imagine the whole population as a hybrid of red, jokes, colos and hobbies. Seeing this supper Dostopia, Joe wanted to know, and from that time Rita tried to track the time machine to see if she could return, and it is basically the whole plot. <br /> <br /> But how long can I sound it, taller than this movie you can fathom. Nuuns are everywhere and anyone today can see the signs of warning turning wonder in the evil-thinking daily life difference and turning it into the "Ididocracy" showdown train wreck (warning signs, if you see). The film has some really remarkable showcasing some of the realistic obstacles on a painful. I do not want to give anything and do not want to spoil the joke for you, but just say that it's pretty thorough. I can see that some would say that this is just a lot of toilet humor, but it seems impossible, it has a purpose; <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is unfortunately, scheduled to visit the same fate as "Office Space" as the previous one. Nobody can see it in the theater, but after its coming to the video everyone will be proud to discover this great / funny movie. My only complaint for the film is that the flow of the story is sometimes broken so that they can do about how Hitachiker-Guide-to-The Galaxy type exposition can happen, but it is a necessary evil and is well implemented here. Better than the average social commentary recorded in good character, funny joke, and a mean humorous sample. Final note: We want to see if our young man wants to be a gang-beijer, acting redneck / gateway trash and proud of it ... If you are educated and volunteer, how can we see how our country is idle in idiocy For the sake of God, watch this movie
