I have now seen this movie on cable twice. For the first time I saw it, in my dreams. The sketters we see are those boys who followed the skateboarder magazine page back to the age of 70. This is what we're trying to get when copying and skating. I was surprised that a movie was finally created which gives a correct account of how it happened. Although I'm about 40 years old now and I'm a pretty passionate person with all the problems of life; This picture did a great job of taking me back. Back to the empty pond, the backside of the backyard is half-high and the road travels Cherry Hill NJ. I really doubt this movie and appreciate it, you will have to live in it. Otherwise, it will not affect me as it is mine. But for those of you (and who you know), who lived it, you know exactly what I'm talking about! At any event, I do not care who you are, if you get a chance to watch this movie ... it! I thank Dugtunes Z-Age for the memories of my young man and thanks for the help of this movie! Work well!
