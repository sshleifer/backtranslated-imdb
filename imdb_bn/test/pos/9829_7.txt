The late Sydney Pollack comes from a big up love story about human nature, pain, emotions and betrayal. Police Sergeant Dutch Van Dan Brock (Harrison Ford) is devastated when his beloved wife is killed in an air crash, he is more disturbed about his relationship with Chandler (Christian Scott Thomas), a famous Congress woman. He showed him and saw that he did not know or had no idea. They started mutual friendships between each other and began to express a sad case (which can be seen as a cure for both of them). Do the memories of the dead and pressure from their respective work make them different and do more harm than good or can they escape from the past? Well, you have to see and find random hounds. Playing with a great cast and playing well.
