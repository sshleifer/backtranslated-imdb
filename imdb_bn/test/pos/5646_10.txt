For the first time in my first Ichikwawa and the first film of his war which I saw, it is very easy to find. In the first scenario, the nominal hero Tamura is told that he can not walk with his unit, to whom he returned to the hospital. Is he probably TB? But he is not sick enough to be hospitalized. But his old unit will not take him back; His CO gives him a grenade, and tells him that if you really feel hopeless to blow up? What is this honorable thing? <br /> <br /> Philippines, 1945, and the situation looks really hopeless, for PFC Tamura and everyone else. Nobi is an Odyssey through the Hell, or rather Hels ?? Dead forest, dead rocky plain, dead and dying Japanese soldiers are just hoping for the end through peace or death. The film of Inchikoya has been photographed in the wonderful B & W Scope, highlighting both the migration and the journey towards their destruction, and both of them show how they are small and naked, due to lack of hills and forests? This little thing of humanity will soon end, the world seems to be saying, but I will live and rarely notice it. <br /> <br /> <br /> Tamura again goes back to the hospital, but (not surprisingly), and is trying to stay alive the rest of the people, the human being, and the dangers Get out of He does not manage very well in any account, he is gradually hungry and, eventually, performs some roughly annoying work. Finally he hooked up with two other frustrated men, who lost their unit, or survived their unit, and got accustomed to cancer? And faced other armed men in his weak condition, he sees that the only way to be alive is to break all of his beliefs <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I I saw that like a war film, brutal, inconsistent and intense. There is a sunny and tender moment, but they are transient and do not get trapped in the memories such as a mountaineer, who actually urges you to feed his flesh ?? The black trick rotated with the thump ragged shoes for a fall comrade good skin for her ?? Deterioration that humanity will endure survival ?? The fact that it is no war, all the war, all mankind until we continue this way. A best composition that I do not watch again for a long, long time Beautiful stereo collections are seen through the DVD.
