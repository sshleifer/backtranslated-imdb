Just a great soundtrack. Really enjoyable music Outstanding cast, great lead performance. Not looking. <br /> <br /> does not really explain what happened nearby. You feel that the integration is blamed or the adjoining area is separated by the departure of the main character. <br /> <br /> This film is well researched and well-equipped. I particularly enjoyed some of the minor characters like Jeffrey Wright. <br /> <br /> Cutting at the first row helps reveal a vivid, engaging and wished experience that creates music, food, drinks, dance, gambling and sex in the nightclub spots.
