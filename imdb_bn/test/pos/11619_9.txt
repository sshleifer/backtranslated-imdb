First off - this film will not be for everyone. There are extreme graphic violence scenes and "boring" images that will only stop potential potential visitors from their nature. Clearly from the reviews of this board - SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY has divided those who viewed it. I have been in a lot of different reasons due to it due to it. I think it was a very ambitious (and quite efficiently drawn ...) commitment for a group of 18/19 years without any budget or little experience. I think every aspect of the film - direction, acting (though the performance of the character is more than the stage or free form performance due to the nature of the film ...) production, FX, score / sound design - I have seen that the budget of these kids is much better than many movies Exceed and experience ten times. I genuinely did not have this effect with the evil artwork of Nacho Cedar's "Art-house" style ... <br /> <br /> First stop - I do not understand and all the graphical content of this picture - but I went to it While not knowing it was a direct-narrative film, I was not disappointed with how it played. SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY 4 Smaller vignettes that revolve around all types of right brain left / left brain brain / anger / psychology versus moderation / compassion / "naturalism" theory. Very briefly provide an overview of each "section": <br /> <br /> Ovarian Abbey is basically just a nude girl who has her eyesight cut in her stomach. I'm sure it's something symbolic - I do not think I was paying too much attention at that time and it hurts very fast. <br /> <br /> The next "episode" - Human Laura - A scary, fearful, real story of a man who loves and disturbs his pregnant sister, which enhances her growing psychology that the surprise conclusion of the special chapter. Human Luv is the best of my book cluster, and probably comes down to your skin. Talking to the dead-pan increases the increasing tension as you know there is going to be a terrible event - but you're not sure what you're sure. Do yourself good and if you are interested in seeing this movie - do not do too much research on it. Come on with an open mind and iron stomach and I think you will be especially pleased with this special episode. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Apparently an "arty" interpretation is something that is affecting the earth or in rape. Not bad, but it's a little shorter and I miss the point on it ... <br /> <br /> And Right Brain / Martieddom Religion and Religious Hypocrisy and Humorous Lewis There are some "Hardest" pictures / messages with full features ... <br /> <br /> There is nothing to write about the Ovalian Yaleb, mainly for a very short time, but it makes a fit set of madness to come ... and the rebirth is also small and most thoughtful. Not too burden, but the human larvae (especially) and proper bryan / martodoms are so distant walls and they can make well. Other parts. I think the main reason that I liked it most is that it is very nicely done as "threatening", "boring", "violent" and "excessive" and you could say it was a real labor - love from those involved. Nothing about the movie is cheap or running and although not fully defined as it is, it is unsecured - and that book is a few of my books. Not every "weird art house" that should be praised for its "fundamentals" of an out-of-date plot, but the subconscious crucible is a movie that I think I will see in a few more times in the future. The other explains what I gain from it. Again, this movie is not for everyone - with very extreme scenes of ghor, murder, rape, brutality, miracles ... etc. The film will have to shock the viewers to harsh surveillance. I would say it worked for me, and I am anxiously awaiting Hussein / Sirada cooperation which will be followed in the next verdict. Check if it has stomach - 9.5 / 10
