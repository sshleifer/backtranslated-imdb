I'm finally watching El Podrinio, which I can see is an incredible film, and many works are good director of Damian Chapa, but I must admit that I love her best performance. <br /> <br /> I also saw the scenes edited by some women in the name of the king, she has to go back to school and know how to edit. <br /> <br /> But the film El Podino is a pure 10 action epic. Why is it that most people keep movies together, which makes you wonder? I am very happy to become a great director for being a great actor. <br /> <br /> I am a man who loves to see the artist. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
