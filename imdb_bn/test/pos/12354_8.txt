Sheba Baby is always the most underrated because it has a PG rating instead of the usual R rating that gets a Grier movie. Ph.H. means that Palm does not want to top it, though he is on top of any other movie. It's hobby, more exciting than more action. It takes a lot of time, but the thriller starts at the screen. Trying to get Dad's father like Dollyme d'Urville Martin is difficult, but he's not. He gave a wage war against Martin and Cronids against his gang. The best scene is that I'm still smiling about my car with a stupid pump. I thought it would be stupid due to the poker rating, but I was wrong to replace it with sex violence and that could be just as good in blackspotation film!
