Had a mood for a French film and saw it at Blockbuster. What turned out to be a little gem! I'm not sure how to miss this all year Gregory Derangere, but he's pretty fantastic. Such innocence and grace! I love her face and she walks the way. Isabella Adjani was ridiculous - reminded me of Nicole Kidman's top performance in Moulin Rouge. That same look 20 years ago ... is really awesome. Gerard Depardieu did not hold nearly as well, but his performance continued to be amazed. She is perfect in this movie. Probably would buy this one, I enjoyed it a lot. If you want to see another great French movie, rent Joyweek Knoyel. Stunning
