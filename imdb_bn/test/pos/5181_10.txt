I just saw the movie tonight and I found it bright. It does not have special effects that hit your mind and it's not violent or bloody, no terrorist or aliens, but it's brilliant. It's just beautiful, beautiful, sweet and it brings me a completely different time, which is a very easy time, where people can take the time to walk on the streets and look at the ocean. I thought it was nice and I recommend it Nick was a great character and his friendship with Harry was one of the movie's highlights. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but I believe that everyone should see it, most of the time when they feel, or when they want to share something nice with their friends.
