This DVD has been received from Accent Ranges, a label that specializes in art house flicks, they release a range of eraverbler and Bergman's tears range. <br /> <br /> The thing that related me to the amazing title of Alex Freien. This is a perfect film that breathes through perfection and vision, which takes us into the heart of Mr. Joe's heart, with his head, outlook and madness filled with voices. It is set in Grayden Redneck Australia, this film does not despise or appreciates a person such as Australian movie. That means our films are full of people with "loving rogues" or "heart of gold" etc. <br /> <br /> Not in this picture. Stanley Kubrick's soul grows up here, it is not shameless, but it is particularly embarrassing, romantic stroke and a mood that is brass when it is not wearable. <br /> <br /> Small Quebec ... transfer shows defective - front credits are cut, they are not fit frames. <br /> <br /> Also, a small film is corrupted, it closes half way.
