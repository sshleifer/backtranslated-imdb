I like the catcher in judgment, it will be my favorite book. JD Salinger, author of Catcher, has the right to this book and it has been designed so that a person can not make a movie about it with his permission. <br /> <br /> with "Single Kingdom of the Leland". "A lot of money and depth in the passion is a beautiful movie but it reminds me of many catchers, almost a lot of catcher reminds me." Lillon's stories were similar to the story of Lillon in New York and its literature, and people like Leland And the emotions are similar to Holden, they are both simple and true to themselves Acting don cheadle and Kevin spacy credit. Great editing, all read together altogether, and together with the story. Buy one or at least suggest as a rental. Good movies <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The thing that can pull in some points, but it's made for a long time, give time and appreciate a good movie.
