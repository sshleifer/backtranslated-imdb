Playing Ray Charles in Jamie Fox did incredible work. I like this movie because every occasion is a flashback scene and then the current movie will be there. When Charles was young, he became blind and his mother did not have him baby. She was a strong woman, who could not make her blind because she was blind. He forced her to do something on her own and really forced her to become a great musician in her life. His mother sent him to school. Then when Ray Charles became a man, he could stand up for himself and take care of himself, but the drug, sex and betrayal fell. When I'm discouraged about anything, I can think of this movie and it will inspire me.
