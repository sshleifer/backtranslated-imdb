Volunteer from a small town is a doctor and a priest for a medical examination which turns him into a vampire and dedicated priest. <br /> <br /> Physical and emotional change leads to his childhood friend, who is tired of his human life and tired of his relationship with his wife. <br /> <br /> Once the priests became deep in despair and atrocities. As he gets worse, he struggles to maintain his humanity ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Main protagonist created a canvas to open a canvas to work more than really question . The priest primarily makes himself better, but when he meets the disgruntled wife of his friends, the senses are established in his body. <br /> <br /> This picture makes it intensely loving that when the couple firstly approve, they experience some of the experiences they have never done before, the banned emotions, which make the situation more sensual. <br /> <br /> Chan-ek added some necessary humor to the film, but it was realized only in the final third. Movie We see that the daughter has lifted her mother in the chair in front of everyone, and when she realizes her power, she keeps the chair down and continues. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> CGI is fine and pretty, and jumping from the scenery building to the building with them is so beautiful, you could see the ballet. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This day is missing. It's violent, but from the director's question, I do not expect anything else. <br /> <br /> Really an interesting story with great storytelling and beautiful cinematography
