This flick was captured as a five-five dollar contract from the local video store, and it was the most amazing surprise. It is a collection of four related stories created by four children, a car broke and someone is waiting to pick them. They talk to each other to kill these stories and sometimes wake up with light and funny words, which comes together with Henry-Esque, which makes me happy. A real discovery Blood (and lots of it), breasts and animals, rather than nicely keeps them out ... Junkyard Barrett's value of admission alone. This one is the keeper - Jim Bob says it checks out. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully enough, "Pumpkinhead" was one of our five choices and IMDB recommended that anyone who likes "Campfire Tales" As soon as I sit and follow to get a chance to see that one. Joyeux Samhain!
