RKO Radio Pictures made a real classic in 1947 and even the best pictures were directed to Academy Award nominated. Acting, scripts, continuity, and cetera, all are just about perfect; And the story worth 82 minutes is worth the visitor. Although the film kills soft-petals, the real life story hunt a Jew instead of homosexuals, but most visitors will see the victim as a Jewish homosexual - this kind of camouflage will never work, perhaps its purpose was not. <br /> <br /> I know some details, but for fun In 1947 there was no all-night movie house in Washington DC - and if I wish Robert Mitchell and his flock did not show up. There was no bar where no GI could take a beautiful blonde. Nobody! If Robert Ryan wanted to read the latest killings, he would buy the Daily News! The Times-Herald, Star in the Evening, and Of course the Washington Post does not know anything. But this little thing is nothing away from this classic. <br /> <br /> The movie gets much benefit from the complete lack of music score without credit. I just saw it in a few pictures. On the negative side, since 1995, it comes with the introduction of a TMC, where some generous Blob about "ready" for the public in 1947. Blah, blah, blah! This fool has no business to judge his betters. I want to say that in the year 1947 the former GI - the great generation - was far more intelligent - and was better priced than some commentators, film historians, or other wise speakers in 1995.
