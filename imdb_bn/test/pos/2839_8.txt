Nurse Betty was one of the most creative movies that were explicitly released. It was fun, but it was a lot touching moment. Jellygear, Freeman, Rock, Kinnar, and the rest cast their incredibly strange characters seem to be real. The story is so enjoyable to take such a twist and watch it incredibly. If you are sick of recent formula films, look for the nurses betty to do something completely different. Watch this movie in the theater or rent it at least!
