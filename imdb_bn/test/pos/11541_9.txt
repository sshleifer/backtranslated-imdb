I will make it clear to you as much as possible to keep you unaware of the inheritance of Bill Hicks. He was the greatest stand-up comedian in the world, often in my opinion, the greatest greatest person of all time (his stad-up statue was the great Richard Prior, with which he fought the habit of practice). His death was rarely seen in popular media in 1994, Cart Cobain came just a few weeks after his suicide. His tragic death at the young age surrounds any feelings of injustice, which must have been deliberately ignored during his life. But the harsh truth is clear like the day: nobody has claimed his brain claim. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To achieve prosperity from the stone - Lam film and morally powered sitcoms, which are made to hold - but are rich No - the lives of an unknown audience. It's all that's against Bill Hicks His speech was always a rolling tone for the people to think together, to verify the authorities to get together, to be united as a nation. <br /> <br /> Since then, his application has continued to grow. After much less light air, his star will burn for a long time. Once you have expressed its bright, intelligent, but finally sympathetic output, you will be rich and rewarded. <br /> <br /> People were tender to quote Dylan: You must be honest to live outside the law, he said. Bill Hicks was honest, then he was fun of them all.
