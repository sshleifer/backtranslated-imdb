"Tesses", "Open Your Eyes" and "Others" were proofs of Amenhob's talent and skill as filmmakers, but (my modest opinion) their efforts to outrank the audience were faulty movies, always a turn cheap thrills, twists and densities and resonance Activated, many many screws. For everyone, the lucky Amenaber has chosen a subject for his new film, which does not allow surprises, focuses on letters and focuses on their emotional bonding. <br /> <br /> The result is a small miracle of a photo, nicely written, photographs, scores, acting and directed. Everybody involved in this movie lensing on the superficiality of Aguaresareb's superhuman camera, behind the camera and in front of the camera, from the wonderful cast (Bardem fascinating, but Mabel River, Sales Bugula, Clara Segura and Lola Dinas give the film an amazing truth). <br /> <br /> This image influences many relevant topics and emotions, it addresses heart and mind with equal power and gives a final punch that accompanies you after a credit roll. It is a brilliantly executed film that will not only stand as a landmark in Spanish cinema, but it will surely be amazing when it opens in foreign countries (Sony Classics has given it a record $ 6 million for distribution) Do not be surprised that it is managed to get Oscars ... Amenabar Not stopped ... <br /> <br /> <br /> Buen Trabz, Alexandros!
