Shakespeare is a very modest retelling of the game (and much more about it than the forbidden Planet). Cassavetes always have a joy to see, and even more Gena Rowlands share the spotlight. His acceptance of Prospero's role is appropriate for all the intelligent expressions he has gone to the story. Especially when it moves towards a scene, while showing his troubled wife and her boyfriend in the speedboat, she got a storm (consistent with soundtrack with a suitable selection from Stormu Magnificent "Go"). This film is only a moment of moments where the line between reality and fantasy gets nimble and the viewer feels that magic is more likely than one credibility. Raul has done better with Julia, Vosrao Gassman and Molly Ringwald, and it becomes a great treat for the film to take place behind your eyes.
