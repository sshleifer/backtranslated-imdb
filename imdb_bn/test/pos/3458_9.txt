An incredible movie that is so open with imperfection that is usually afraid of people. It showed how hard the mind is to be reduced than the brain and how hard it is to test what is happening to the people who are being disabled for others. <br /> <br /> Love, friendship, fear, frustration, joy, humor and many other things were so well captured. 2 main characters act very well by 2 active body actors and invite your smile, tears, anxiety, joy and frustration. <br /> <br /> I am worried about this picture's interest and shocking mix that it is too much a game for sympathy or just to stay on negative. But it was the story of two well-prepared friends. <br /> <br /> I like it.
