At the age of 40, I saw this movie returning to the theater's path when I was young and I was always finished. There is nothing like the first impression but in some movies they are seen every time they are always a treat. Some just resonates with them. It is one of those movies and I agree with other critics that Frat Lange has directed more western. I always like Randolph Scott and Robert Young to add it. Actually, Robert Young considers his favorite movie, if I only give the name, then do not do it easy. That film is on the Northwest Passage. This led me to Kenneth Roberts's historical novels. Similarly western union led me to read Jane Gray's novel, in which case it became one of the rare cases where I liked the film rather than the novel. Gray's novel is not a bad one; I just liked the movie story well. Which novel is a novel similar to the novel? This is a completely different story, one of the biggest exit from the book I saw is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can not add more to other reviews Do not wait that I agree with many of them. I, too, wish it would be releasing DVD. "What happened to Randolph Scott is the best for me."
