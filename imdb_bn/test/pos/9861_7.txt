All right, if you decide the movie is now in a day, it will not fit well. If you have seen FI now and everything is pretty cheese (I agree) but there were not 80 movies (Giligan, WonderWoman, SO). But those born from the 70's or earlier also have the status of their rituals. When reaching the EverTime plane, the Tattoo Tower ring will roam and its accent "The Planet of the Planet of the Planet" will shout and you will think what each one likes. People born in the mid-80s Hippers do not understand because you've seen it now. This is not Harry Potter, Jurassic Park Computer Animation FX. It was only at a stage where you could almost probably see a wire attached to a person who wanted to fly. But in our time it was a fun island.
