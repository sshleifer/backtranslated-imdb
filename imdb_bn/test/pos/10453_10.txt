This review spoilers! Despite some seemingly impossible scenes, including measuring their penises in boys' competition in PEs and with some compulsive thirteen-in-the-go-crazy vignettes, the film highlights the painful essence of high schools in such a way that some teen movies have never been completed. It only lives in the nature of friendship not only by three friends, Gary, Dave, Rick not only by smoking, drinking, but by the appearance of adolescents, because these three friends test their loyalty. This photo is a snapshot when the childhood ends. For the shy romantic gary, when he first saw the beautiful Karen, he fell in love. Gary's awakening passion has grown up on the screen, and he proves his love for her by hanging on her lover. This love of Karen signals Gary's innocence, because bonds with his best friends will be tested and broken on the story. Confident women people, Rick, high school people, we all secretly wish to: Handsome, calm, and always fools of beautiful girls, the folly Rick turns out to be a cad, but you remember that his character is only 17 years old. He makes panics and a bad decision. From Rick's perspective, the story is also about combining one of his dreams, a bad breakup, and then the end. Looking at Rick's face like Gary, Kieren kisses Rickshaw, she shows that she understands her best friend and she loves the same woman. As in the real life, you do not bow because your friend has an unfamiliar love. The tragedy of this photo. Rick is not a villain, and through continuous films, he reminds Gary and Dave that they are his best friends. Gary's animated quality of performance, but the heart of the story. Lawrence Monson is a beautiful damnation. She is eating everything right, the right place in her heart, and she is loved by Karen. However, eventually Karen Gary was not moved by the devotion and kindness. Karen represents all the people in the world who do not even return, who are vacuuming their own arrogance and they can not feel emotional harm and panic on others. This picture is brutal in its statements on love and friendship, but that makes it unique in what teen movies. It stops being a comedy and becomes a frustrating romantic movie, though it falls into a sad conclusion. Anyone who has found her dream girl and does not win her, must understand. Hearty crushes of high school are each bit as real as adult emotional strains, and this film reminds you of it in the bold stroke. The final opposite of Gary, as he would move away with an inspired locket, was a bit of a buggy movie. One thinks, after watching this, it is really made of two movies. The first part is a silly teen sex movie, and once the story begins, it is a strong influence drama. A horror movie. It should be noted that the Soundtrack was prominent in the selection of many rising stars, including Police, The Car, Devo, Ongo Boingo, The Pleimsouls, The Waiters, Glamor Spears, and Phil Simmur.
