The concept of marital fidelity displayed in the film seems old nowadays, but it is the loyalty of the main characters that make this story so sensitive. This idea makes them confident and they can not be like them, talking to their respective husbands. <br /> <br /> In this movie Tony Ling said love is just happen. It does not need to explain how it will happen, it just does. It happened even if they wanted to go to level of their husbands. Fidelity, social rhythm, and all of the time coming into the final against this plot. Just enough in love. <br /> <br /> I was unfortunate to sit beside a young couple (I still have a whole lot of conversations snippets from across the globe, unexpected feelings of lost love and missed opportunity). Their overall inability to digest crazy and deep emotions has given me the idea that such a movie as well as other Wang Car Wai's works have been destroyed by the local audience.
