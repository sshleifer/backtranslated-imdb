This was my first giant note movie that I saw and I said I was frustrated. I do not usually remember cow, but it's not even poor, it's a real slaughterhouse. It may be impossible to see some scenes for you and I mean really hateful. Apart from these aspects, the main ideas published here and the dialog are quite bright. When you are given a strong argument against bringing the world's new life and how it is given, then you can not take a few minutes to stop and think about it. Actors performed their job well, represented a common mask in the hands of some people found under a sick society. The movie is full of metaphor, but I have to find them out. If you want a light, relaxing time, do not see it. I recommend this movie to all of you who do not want to miss you or look at what you find on your average movie just look different.
