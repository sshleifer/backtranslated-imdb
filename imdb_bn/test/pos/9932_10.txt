Before becoming a fan of the Argentine fan and Open Fan, I was dying to see his first story, so bad- it's a good "Before the opera of Phantom of Argentina". The film is very awesome, even the plot, which is the best of Argentine tales here. The only way to enable a classic romance story in a vague slasher is just awesome. The picture is very good at night, which helps keep you on the edge of your seat. After coloring the "Argentine" color, the color of the Argentine film was never good. The killers are clever and disgusting, all of Argentina's trademark style is completed. In this picture, the thing only makes the turmoil by the eyes, and make some better than the flachter of Phulchi. There are so many acting, but once you have seen the movie better understand the motivations of the character and you use it. Two big complaints about me are the use of rock music. I am a clever idea to mix beautiful opera pieces with heavy metals, but it is not very well executed here. The finishing is very frustrating, the worst thing about the movie is that it seems to be a reflection of the previous "phenomena" of Argentina, but it has been done terribly, it does not need to end. The same thing happened to the director's cut "Exorcist". I wish they kept the last end. But still it's a fantastic motion picture and is really a must, only for the commemoration of Daria Nicolodi's memorable murder sequence.
