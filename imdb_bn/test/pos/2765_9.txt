I would say briefly: I usually hate these toxic movies ... but there is just something about it that drives me in and I do not let me go. Undetected, there are some major errors (some of the performances are below the bottom and the conversation is sometimes so poor it's fun) but at the end it has considerable redemption features to look at. <br /> <br /> But what are they? Well, it's got a cool little plot - in some way it's not real, but it's even better than other types of movies. Three main stars (Haline, Johnson, Long) have performed quite well, which is more than the lack of different quality supporting cast (fat police and coach quinn really made me wrong), and the scripting is faded and malicious (even if it is poor). <br /> <br /> The following line is that this film has so much: I have taken all the way through it and it is a place for my video collection just because it can make someone happy. You do not really like it to be some kind of a ridiculous bore (I sit through this without grinning anyone !!!). <br /> <br /> I wish you a simple, fun, and - all of the above - enjoyable watch. You do not regret it! <br /> <br /> ~ Top $ ~
