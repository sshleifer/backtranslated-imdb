The story of this relationship with a teacher is said in a fine way, which separates most of the film with this plot. Mr. Lam (Jackie Cheng) had a relationship with Chay (Kareena Lam, who was also very good at "Coma"), which initially seems to be an inappropriate situation. He thinks Ching (married for 20 years, Anini Muay, before being cruelly accepted from us in his last role), and it seems to be a loving relationship. Ching offered to take care of him, and Mr. Lam's former teacher, Kwa and Mr. Lam are allowed to stay together. The film makes so much better that director Anne Hui's pissing. It takes some time to unveil Lamsm's secret mysteries and it makes all sense. The movie is very dramatic and touching. You do not feel annoying about the situation of the teacher / student, it is something that highlights the film above the platform. It's moving slowly, but having it with it. Also, Ms. Revel in its wonderful, unglamorous but beautiful performance. She was and nobody really is special and in this movie you fall in love with her last. It is time to witness and only the price with it.
