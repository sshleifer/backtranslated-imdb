Two or three best attempts are available from the date of entry into the European film series Hartley, and, luckily, some of the DVDs are available. It's only 63 minutes in progress, with my only soft hartal, I always wanted more, but not as much as this time. Martin Donovan was surprised like Jesus. PJ Harvey was as beautiful and interesting as Magdalena, but the high point for me was Thomas Jay Ryan (Henry Flower) as Satan. Hartley gives him an excellent conversation and his dominant voice can be used in full effect. Look for three scenes that a microphone is waiting for, such as a poem slam going to win by the devil. I read other comments in this movie and had to add my shaft because there is not enough compliment. If you like Henry Flower, Martin Donovan, a very cute comedy based on some (in contrast to sex) and / or biblical ideas, you can get it as soon as possible.
