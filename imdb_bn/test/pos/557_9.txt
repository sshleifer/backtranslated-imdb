The direction of Wayne Wang can be an element that makes this film more impressive than "Beverly Hills's Slams", which features significantly similar grounds. Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman are riveting the interplay. Real chemistry there. The film succeeded in bringing me the underlying life of these two women, leaving me frustrated. Susan Sarandan's character crawls all the nerves that a Narsingdi parents can touch an insecure teenager. He managed to do this job surprisingly without coming across amazingly insane or deliberately sadistic. And, Natalie Portman reflects every attack of her character's arrogance with the resignation of an intelligent apologetic child, unrecognized by the fascinating antagonism of Natasha Lyon's character in "Beverly Hills Slams". Portman's character is an abnormal creature in modern-day films, with the status of stress. The film reached a very satisfying solution without much hard effort. I highly recommend this film to the visitors who want to challenge and entertain.
