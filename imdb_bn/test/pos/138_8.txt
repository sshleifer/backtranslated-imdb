Although sometimes I was only laughing in movies, which I picked up from the beautiful "thirsty" laugh - smile. Although sometimes it seemed that the identity of the film was a crisis and it was not a tragedy or a joke, the black black smile came through the blackout periodic regularity. <br /> <br /> It certainly helped that the quality of acting by everyone related to it was wonderful and I was sometimes somewhat obscure by the leading leading lady, who was bloody and brutally shocked, <br /> <br /> < > <br /> I read this review that the movie was mentioned. I do not think so. Actually the last scene, moving and sunny (I mean, brown shoes ....) is the best of the film.
