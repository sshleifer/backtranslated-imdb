"Ah ... I did not order any amazing hit show" ..... "We'll get you one" Hack is the only best television show ever. When I got into a quarrel with TV, I was a bit dead. Caught a little hack on a Friday night and it was not there. Show deep deep digging the core social problems of our culture. I saw at the end of any episode; I went away being both entertaining and informed. I am actually threatening that the hack has gone. I do not want to help the poor and less fortunate. Since the hack has gone I see eyeore's and their taxpayers as an unneeded strain. So God's love will bring us back the hack!
