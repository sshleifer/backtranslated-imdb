Absolutely amazing! I've probably never seen this great movie as humorous, up-beat music and anti-war message. <br /> <br /> First of all, I love how cute this film is, especially in Vietnam, the plot. It's funny how they apply ridiculous to the appearance of draft draft military officers. Following the serious situation of the actual war and then the conclusion (which makes me angry at war); And yet there are absolutely no violence on the screen. Wow <br /> <br />, the music is really cool. But what is remarkable about this musical instrument (for example, Ivita, or opposite the Wizard of Oz) is not the story. Mood (with visual and mid-song dialogue): "Donna" is an enthusiastic song that inspires happy mood, where "flush failure" driving in a small key, severe beat. Also, I noticed the LSD view is not very impressive. Now I'm not going to do medicines (which I never wanted to do). <br /> <br /> Considering everything, it's an extraordinary movie. The only negative comment I could say was that the dialog is very hard to hear. But who? 10/10 stars!
