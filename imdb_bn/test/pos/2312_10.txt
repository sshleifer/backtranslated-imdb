I've lost count of times I've seen this movie, but I love it and I find it very interesting to see it. During facial expressions, slapstick humor and jokes makes it great. Characters, especially "nitro", "gold" and "typical" colorful. I did a great job in Kells Grammar, Rip Torne and Bruce Darn. Actually, I think this movie is completely cast. I think it is necessary to release DVDs before I wear VHS version.
