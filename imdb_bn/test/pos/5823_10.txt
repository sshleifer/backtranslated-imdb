One of the other critics mentioned that you will be hooked after only watching 1 episode. All right, it just happened to me. <br /> <br /> The first thing that strikes me about the oz is the cruelty of cruelty and shameless scene, which sets the word right. I believe, this bored is not a show for the heart or the horrible. This show pulls no punches with drugs, sex or violence. Its word is used in classic, hardcore. <br /> <br /> This is called ozwal because it is nicknamed for Oswald's Most Security State Penitentiary. It mainly focuses on an experimental section of the prison Emerald City, where all cells have a glass front and are in the mouth, so the privacy of the agenda is not high. Many people from Aria, Muslim, gangstous, Latinos, Christian, Italian, Irish and many more .... So sparks, death stains, dodgy contracts and shady treaties are ever away. <br /> <br /> I want to say that the original appeal of the show is not that other shows will dare. Forget the beautiful pictures painted for mainstream viewers, forget the charm, forget the romance ... oz does not mess around. The first episode I saw was so nasty that I was not prepared for it, I was not prepared for it, but I saw more, I made a taste for the oz and got accustomed to high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, injustice (prisoners trapped in nickel will be sold for those who kill prisoners and flee with them, good people, middle-class prisoners will be imprisoned due to the lack of skill of the road or prison experience) See oz, you are comfortable with uncomfortable viewing May be .... if you can communicate in your darkest direction.
