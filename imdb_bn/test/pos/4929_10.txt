It's one of my favorite movies from childhood. I saw it many times, finally wear out my tape. I was a huge fan of this show and I'm still there. I like the movie most that it appeals to both young and old alike. I see this movie now and the sooner I saw it, the smile. I have now realized the opinion of adults which I have never had as a child. My favorite character is Elimy and Foulmouth. About fifteen years later, my father (a huge fan of the film) and I'm still quoting the line from this movie. I love the part where I go to Folmouth and Sheryli movies. "You save the seats, the rock and I'll slip the dadgum food." I liked the stories of Plaki and Hampton and his family coming to Captain World Land. Wade Pig reminds me of my father a lot. Eventually, they love the part while participating in the Happy World Land and they go to Monorail in what they do. This movie is pleasing and appealing to kids and kids. Animation, jokes and everything about it is top notch. If you do not meet it, rent it. You will not be sorry.
