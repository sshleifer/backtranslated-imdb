Screenwriter Peter Vierell, Joan Harrison, and Dorothy Parker, director (in all), enables the interpretation of Alfred Hitchcock as his favorite movie theme: The innocent person accidentally gets warm for the crime, taking it to Lam. Hitkoc, who raises the story with some credits, the engineer is responsible for the explosion of a big conspiracy plot about a warehouse worker who killed his best friend; He set out to find the real culprit. There are so many excitement in the grand-scale, usually the colorless actors (Priscilla Lane, Norman Lloyd, Allan Backster) do excellent work. Even infinitely-smug Robert Cummings gets into the right spirit! *** *** to ***
