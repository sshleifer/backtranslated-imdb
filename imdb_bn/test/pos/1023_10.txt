Although I do not like cricket and I have seen this movie 13 years ago, it still seems to be one of the best upcoming films. I think I was back home from my school and I was sitting on my luncheon, I saw the first opening title of that movie and then .... I was so submerged that I was there, it really affected me personally. I still think how I felt when I saw it, I felt that the poor boy was my friend, that day we were going through the same teenage experience. The movie I really liked about is a "shy" boy's dream, which makes his dream girl fantasy about "kissing", is not a crime, but if it is not an American film, of course you will certainly see - The boy "shy" is "loving" his daughter, and I still do not understand the concepts of this conflict ... There is a simple request has, how anyone can get this movie to a DVD by mail, please, if you know what I know, because I need a shot of memory. Thank you
