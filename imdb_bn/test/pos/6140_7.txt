I did not plan to watch this movie, but I was not frustrated when a friend dragged me. Although there is no real surprise here, people obviously work well with decent budgets. <br /> <br /> If you have seen the trailer, then perhaps you can expect from such a movie and there is a beautiful constant, with some classic moments, here's the fun flashbacks of boys in the 1980s with the jokes stream, the highpoint. . Also, I have read somewhere else that the finishing was frustrating, but I was different from what I had expected from this section. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie will not change your life, but it's enough to keep you entertained throughout you laughing there.
