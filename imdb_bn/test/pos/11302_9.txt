For a kids movie, this is great. Like an adult and a mother, I enjoyed watching the movie with my daughter. This movie has a lot of ongoing. The following * might be considered * a * spoiler * ... Barbie does not judge others so fast at this movie to learn courage and learn to learn. He learned to give up hope and master his anger. I liked the knowledge of teamwork to get from the puzzle to see Barbie and her sisters and friends. There is nothing in the movie that I think is offensive or inappropriate for young viewers. Actually, I think the moral messages of the movie were fantastic and good. <br /> <br /> The animation was great. I really enjoy the ice skating scene and think they did a great job. This movie has many steps, so I suspect that most kids will enjoy it ... not only in Barbie but also in the US. My daughter actually picked it due to Pagasas. He loves the horse But he enjoyed the movie very much. My daughter is autistic, and can sit through the whole movie and enjoy it. She really liked any part with action scenes and horses involved. <br /> <br /> One thing that I thought was that many people protested Barbie (and why) because they are very nice. Yet, I like kids, like the adults, like the beautiful people and likes to look at things. It's natural As adults, we enjoy watching big stars in very beautiful movies. Although it's surprising, that there are many characters in the character of Barbie and her "boyfriend". Beautiful people have fun to see, there is no substance behind the beautiful face, if it is old. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would say it's a great movie for kids and parents also enjoy it. :)
