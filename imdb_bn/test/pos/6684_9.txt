I was really surprised when I saw this movie directed by Ian Se Ot Le Lay; It is different from ordinary Hollywood mass production in many ways. Plot itself is easy - Kevin Spacey plays a psychiatric prototype who claims to have reached the planet K-Pack, when Dr. Jeff Bridges operated. Powell tried to help him to solve his errors. First of all, I have fully accepted Cast as admit: Kevin Spacy is really brilliant in portraying the impressive character of the proto, always walking firmly in our strong beliefs and then thinking about whether it is confusing to us ... there are some wax scenes where the promos are innocent Eat whole banana (even sugar) and Dr. Or the observational scene where he showed his confidence to the astronomer K-packs system astounding astronomers ... Jeff Bridges, on the other hand, is a fine, justified aspect of the film and he's fully distribute it. A whole other cast of excellent actors (such as Saturn Williams's acting as Arne), who works really well in this movie. <br /> <br /> All the k-packs, comedy elements; Saifi, even the mental thriller (related to the identity of the protagonist) but most importantly it can be classified as an impressive drama. The main premises of the film is quite complex, but the director never lets it loose, he always kept it credible and still kept explanatory in two ways. Following the main idea of ​​the journey of light, camera and photography are a very important part of it, light shadow games, electricity concentrations are much more focused - one of the memorable scenes where Dr. Powell holds a crystal picture in his office. Could the concept of doubt all doubt all the time when it refracts in a beautiful way? <br /> <br /> Delicate and slow dynamic, interesting and delightful, K-pack is actually a jewel, a kind of movie that can not be for all the taste, but who sees it - they can fall in love with it.
