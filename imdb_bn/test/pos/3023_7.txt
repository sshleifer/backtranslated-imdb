A serial killer, Karl Sturger, abducted and killed a young woman by submerging in a water-filled cell. He was arrested by the FBI, but a quack and his latest abduction victim is waiting for a time in a cell to complete the water <br /> <br /> Keep an eye on the top edge and you'll see that there is a lot too many see it before all saw. The magic of Mark Protosivic's script is that he changes completely the old Chestnut Plant from what he is hoping for. If I mention that this plot involves an instrument that allows psychologists to enter the mind of the Sturgers, then set a different movie. <br /> <br /> This cell is not enough to create a different category of thrillers, but director Tarsem Singh created a visually interesting spiritual thriller. Paul Laufern's cinematography, where Opera's basic colors are in front, it's amazing that the lion does not let it finish, the things like clothing wear, where the Sturgers wander around its illusory universe, wearing a sculpture costume makes it more than a visible impact, a run of a mill thriller <br /> <br /> If a movie is becoming a classic movie, then Apon Becoming more and more aware that the film is not a natural story revolving around the visuals. We see the third character, an FBI person enters Sturger's domain but it seems to be a contrived plot to introduce more stunning but very annoying moments to the audience <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that it is with an atmosphere Rather a boring thriller that is very boring and can prevent the film from being usable . A scene where an FBI agent reconsider a case where a podfili can kill only a rap to cut its victim's heart, but your heart will be so frustrated that you can reach the off button. You will probably see a huge amount of thriller until you see the other as discouraging.
