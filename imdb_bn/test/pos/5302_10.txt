This is the last Gobi movie and it is the main departure from the studio's established style. Above all, this film is probably much more than the earlier films of children, perhaps their goal was. It lacks the depth of another movie and features a much less realistic style of brand new animation ?? And yet it's ever so entertaining. Although there is nothing to attract the adult, I still pulled myself to the screen and completely submerged in the story. Cruelty Honesty about the secret plot and character of the film. The stories and the characters are very similar to their feelings / intentions, but it makes them more respectable. The soundtrack was also given special attention, despite the fact that it was different from the previous Gwony Soundtracks. Every time I sing myself this cute theme, someone will watch this movie!
