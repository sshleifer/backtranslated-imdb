How nice. This movie is a climbing generation voice. Director Sam Keith takes us to the darkest depths of the human soul, where we find love, life and top planting. The World-Fatigue Tele (Leo Fitzpatrick) post-apocalyptic follows his heart and his anchor through a cerebral journey to find Sanitit in Colorado. Instead, fill the clash between Tele-Don (Jason Bartatz), a zeitgeist foibles of Machismo's statue and humanity. The epic film comes to a final mountain in an intestine top-seeded competition, which also shrinks even the strongest spectators to the height of the dinghy. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything: top-planting outside, top gym-cropping, cut off shorts and lazy flannel shirts, great climbing footage (some good, you can see it 2 or 3 times!), beer and Snake attack. <br /> <br /> I gave the movie out of 10 out of 10 because I wanted to see romance with a little bit more development. It seemed that this film led to a spicy, topical sexual scene between the tele and her new lover, but alas, it would not be fit for a jam-packed and semi-thrilling ride. <br /> <br /> Fans of Cliffhanger and Mission Impossible II believe this flick is rough to be diamond. Overall, if you're ready to challenge humanity and challenge your world scene, this movie is for you !!! 1
