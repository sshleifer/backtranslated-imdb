"Christmas in Connecticut" is a jewel in a Christmas movie classic. Although some are less familiar than others - it's a delightful way to spend an evening during the holidays. I see it every year. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwick is completely cast, Elizabeth Lane, singer, carrier girl. Prior to its popularity, Stanwick raised a single girl. In her NYC apartment, and her friendly "uncle" restaurateur city near the corner, the type of single girl type exists. He can not write the homecoming column for a magazine! <br /> <br /> Dennis Morgano also played perfectly like our war veteran Jefferson Jones, who wants to meet the amazing Elizabeth Lane. After losing to the sea, he wants to spend Christmas on "real" home. Which is the delightful, madcap story set up that has set up. It's fun to start from the beginning. We all should have a fax!
