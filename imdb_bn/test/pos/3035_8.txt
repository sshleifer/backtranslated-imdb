I could not sleep at night, I could not sleep, and I would never be happy for the uncertainty! This young story of a young white teacher teaching poor black kids on an island in Carolina is a great advertising for education, and a great advertising to help each other. The issues related to civil rights, Vietnam and the early 60's have been forgotten by the people who came in the late 60's that the Peace Corps and many young people had hit to make a difference in helping inexperienced people. Thinking about her open style of education, these children are interested in being among the kids, and encourages sincere interaction. The class that fears that power. That was John Voight saying that their 20 years of reunion has happened and 18 children have become teachers! It is enough for you to think enough that we can get ourselves the chance to live as people, perhaps, hope. Check out this movie.
