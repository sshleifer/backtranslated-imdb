This is my favorite movie which depicts African Americans in a completely different light. Because it shows a different aspect of African Americans that it is not shown in movies. It can not deal with gang bang, urban vetto settings or deep ethnic problems, it is the complete essence of being young and trying to succeed and adopt your precautions and allow anyone in your life and the great Bohemian atmosphere that makes great great touch Gives it a great script that captivates you to great dialogue and lets you get involved just with character. Perfect casting with many chemistry and very good acting and I still did not see any other film with black characters which were portrayed in this format as the only "springs" to stop, but it quickly decreases it from a comedy. I would like to give 9 and I want African Americans to continue their films with such attitude
