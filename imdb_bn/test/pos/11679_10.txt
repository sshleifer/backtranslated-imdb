I love this picture. It was made before the LA Punk scene became worse. It completely preserves the mood and attitude of that time and place. I feel very fortunate to be present in the filming of Fleetwood's four band that night. The only part that does not fit well with the Catholic Diasporine and their socio-political commentary I do not see that many people who were too much of that. The rest of the picture shows that I have seen a lot; People live hard, or accept a swing in the music industry and / or laui hippies. I do not think I have seen a documentary that is covering so much real and personal matters.
