I remember this movie, the first movie I saw, where the film was dark, I was very nervous. In 74/75 my dad took me to my brother and sister to Newbery film in Newbery Berkshire, England. I remember the tiger and saw a lot of snow in the film, the appearance of Gregory Adams actor Dan Haggery seems to have killed one of the tigers. Please let me know if anyone knows where it is available in DVD etc. The film has now become a fitness club, which is now 20 miles away as the biggest shameful movie, which is good to hear from those who watched this film or any other view.
