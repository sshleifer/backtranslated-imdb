Before watching the House of Max, I think it would be a film of second-level low-tin tin slashher by following the footsteps of filmmakers like Darkness or MTV. After holding an advanced exhibition on my college campus, I can honestly say that the people of Dark Castle did an excellent job of creating a slash. <br /> <br /> A small horror movie starts with normal staples, such as leaving a small street passenger, returning to their country, taking them through the streets, slow but compulsory back-story after meeting with vague locals. This movie really reaches the clip fast. Paris Hilton knows this long ago in the film, but I would really give him for his sturdy performance. Obviously, his performance was not the price of the Oscars, but filmmakers used his full use to prevent his face from being completely full of dampness, let's say that the film has less bright media presence. Mrs. Hilton has claimed the title of the film's greatest death scene, not only because of her death scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is suddenly engulfed with moments and cheap fear, but Jaume Serra has definitely created the mystery and excitement of character in the character. The causes of fear are based on the care of the partners' audience, which we do. Normal buildup follows with a loud sound and the camera jerked some other scary moments. These standard film techniques from past films often make perfect and very good fear with this film. Actually there is not a slow moment after reaching a small town where there is a scary room in the Vaux Museum. <br /> <br /> There are many movies and other series of this movie, but I am not sure how much of the original title of 1953 film. References to Texas Chess Mascasses, Saw and even Titanic movies (see the big death scene of Paris Hilton and tell you what you think), but ultimately you'll be scared and looking for a good fear with a few smiles. not bad.
