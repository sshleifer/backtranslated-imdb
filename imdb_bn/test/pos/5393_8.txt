30 and 40 (as "Dosij City") "Old fashion" is a threat to the West, it has several things for Dallas: Gary Cooper is a photographer with his great, burning technologist Ernest Halar (photographed) and a pulse-pounding Mac stainer ( King Kong, Gidblood, Dobbs City etc) score. In addition, there is a forgery, misidentification, a faked death and more hair-breathing escapes than a Republic's serial. As always, Coop defines what to be a man under pressure. 50 seconds west forgot ... this pure entertainment!
