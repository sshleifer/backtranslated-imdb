This Danish film is an innovation. Endorses Thomas Jensen is not unlike ligger-like mood in Blockinend, but with a novel. One less difference is the lesser characters, leaving more room to stay in them. And what characters?! Two slaughter houses are perfect. A domination of Mads Mikkelsen, deranged parody and Nicolas Lee Kaas is an overwhelming pairing of a twin brother or an overwhelming looser less than two.
