I have seen two episodes so far, I really like it. Although I'm no longer in college, it misses me a wonderful college life. I spent a little more time in socializing. I identify myself with kind of rust. When I was walking around with a friend, my older brother was not like a caper, I wanted to have a big brother like him. So if such a show actually marks people with their characters, then this is a beautiful show. <br /> <br /> This is more realistic than the American pie with less explicit sexual jokes. Can we call it a small version of "harmful wives"? Some of the authors will be Greek, the stories seem to reflect somewhat of the real virus and sorority life. It is shot high definition. And they are actually drawn out inside the studio. So the quality of the pictures is very good. They could easily make it a good film A movie that can last only within a few hours, it can also be 45 minutes fun to watch the TV audience free. <br /> <br /> Welding is wonderful, the actors are about the right age, and they make new and fresh, so that makes them more realistic. This show is practically all about The show has Asian and black frat boys and sorority girls as well. It was a little disappointing that in their first story, there was a little story about two people in the marriage, and then tried to hook again in the second episode. I do not think there is such a thing on the TV. This event reminds me of a Warner TV show that was called "Wine Americans", which was canceled in early 2001. At that show, a girl who was dressed like a man kissed the man, and the man thought that he was a male gay <br /> <br /> <br /> Greek life could be fun, but the same At the time the students will have to read for exam etc. Since people actually have some free time in their lives, there is no bond between them to join them. I do not know how long the event will end, sooner or later, those people also have to "graduate" in the college. Maybe they will get a new actor for another 4 year's fun college life!
