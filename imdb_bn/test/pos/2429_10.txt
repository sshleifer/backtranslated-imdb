Probably watching this TV movie that I was interested in debating about whether Anna "Ana" really was the daughter of Schnier Nicholas Anastasia. As I saw it, I bought a book at different documentaries. Despite the evidence discovered after the film's release, I sometimes think that it was. Amy Irving's performance among these two potters is somewhat generous with historical events, but with the tire-jurarking drama and Irving's completely firmly committed performance. <br /> <br /> I was not aware of this before being aware of Irving, though I saw him without understanding at "Keri" (another favorite movie). In "Anasia", I did not feel for a moment that "this is just a movie" This woman was Anastasia for me, and when the members of the Royal Carrier meeting of the royal family took part, I knew that I would see the second part of the hell or the high water. I just wanted to see how he claimed he was, and with the progress of the story, I felt a deep hatred towards the character of Rex Harrison, although I greatly admired him as an actor. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie re-released in the TV Guide, then I strongly believed my mother that we should see this, and then she thanked me for doing it, as much as I was interested in watching Part 2. Then I bought the video and could fully recommend it. "Astastasia" is one of the rare TV movies that you must watch, to watch for the best performance on TV that you have to watch, and it is not really important that you believe in legend.
