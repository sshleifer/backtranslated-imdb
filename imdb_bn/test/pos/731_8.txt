There are many movies that I have seen and forgot in the drive-in exterior forces (in the late 1970s-decade-decade). This one I could not forget. Despite its low budget, the exploitation-style of movie making, the story was very well done. Isolated Therapy-Asylum, where patients perform their fantasies to help them cure their phosphosis, as new doctors come to the scene, as well as the doctor's assassination of the doctor, (supposedly) taking auxiliary doctor, different mental sensibilities, the assistant doctor is actually a patient, and, Finally, rescue the young nurse with a smoother Sam, who killed everyone else at home He can escape the fumble, made for a great story, which held the film together. I stressed the story word because it made a good or great movie. If the film does not matter if you do not have any disrespectful treatment of blood, pregnancy, nudity, sex or movie, then the film is not good. Movie credits show clips of all actors, including the old line with the final line that asks you to come out and never come back, which is a great ending of this movie. See it and enjoy it if it comes out of video / DVD.
