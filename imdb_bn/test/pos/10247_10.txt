Some people call "Coolie Hi" the same thing as "American graffiti", but I do not want to. At the beginning, everyone in "AG" was white, when "CH" they were all black. Moreover, this is a Motown soundtrack. In particular, the film focuses on African American students in 1964 and some emigrants of Chicago in their revelation. The movie mainly deals with home life and relationships. In their apartment, we see that there is almost no father. But these young men always know how to live a full life. <br /> <br /> One movie that really separates from one of the most important portraits of black film, is thirteen of this movie being very responsible, anxiously portrayed about missing schools. Two really funny scenes Gorilla scene, and a white guy in the movie. But overall, the main star soundtrack. This is really one of the best soundtracks in movie history (we even have it on Vinnie's house here). The real sense of sound is a classic.
