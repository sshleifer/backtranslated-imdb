Perhaps the best royal rumble of the year <br /> <br /> In the first match of the match, Shaun Michaels is well-versed in the team but it is a very long match. Later, one of the worst wrestlers in the roster - took Hydernich Undertaker into a boring casket match. Match number 3 shows Bradshaw Wonderfully in the best competition to defend his WWE title against Big Big Show and Kurt Angle. In the next match, Triple H looks like a great match to defend his 10th heavyweight title against Randy Orton. <br /> <br /> Next Royal Rumble is 15 Super Superstars and 15 SmackDown! Superstars try to hit the ring and face the street and face the competition anyone can have in WrestleMania 21. The three winners included in the highlights Daniel Pudder kicked by Chris Bonoite, Eddie Guerrero and Hardcock Holly! King of Muhammad Hassan, and Roy Superstar vs. SmackDown! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, H vs. Orton - 8.5 / 10 royal rumble Match - 9/10
