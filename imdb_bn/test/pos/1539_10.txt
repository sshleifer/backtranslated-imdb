This movie hit the heart of a reality that I did not see. It shows us what we do in a democratic society, and what we are fortunate is not enough. Acting in the film is extraordinary, sometimes you have to remind yourself that the movie is a drama, not real life. Mr. Rickman expressed surprise with his interrogation about his role in the entire dimensional and humanistic role (for example he played all the roles). Set incredible. It gives the feel of the "round" theater that does not add or accept the emotion of any activity. This movie wants to open the eyes of the audience and I say that they have achieved the goal.
