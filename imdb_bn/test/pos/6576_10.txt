When asked about the event of 911 after 9 years, if you remember that day, most people will probably be commenting on the disaster of the plane and the fall of both the towers, the number of people who died. Terrorism and heroism mixed together, etc. Those people who were alive at that time will not forget that day. Yet most of our memories, though moving, are not at a personal level. Now an extraordinary movie comes in which everybody does not lose a friend or family member, which we lose in 911 just let them get involved in the personal level. This is a movie that needs to be seen.
