The story of Gils Mamuny Max (Vincent Castle) plays with the audience before exploring his biggest lost love (Monica Baluchi) before being involved with another woman. Mamoon uses many flashback sequences without warning, so the best way to know where we are in the story is to watch for the actor's hair. Oherwise it can be very confusing ... Still a strong film debut for the Mamuni, beautifully photographed by Thierry Arabaste (5th element, messenger), and Monica Baluchi is darling to visit ... I feel a little frustrated at the end so I It's 10 out 9.
