I'm so sad to feel the "dark blue world" (sunny), but of course it must have made a film, and it's really good from the Czech Republic. Despite the 'tragic', it's entertaining. It is full of feelings, ties between two main characters and undoubtedly true friendship - a mature Lieutenant pilot (Oriente Vetchchi as French) and young and always interested in the emerging pilot (as Karl Friedek Karel), the inevitable love triangle, and in the '50s Deadly Prison in Czechoslovakia The scenarios are now and then the reminder. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's heartbeat, a Russian story of Russian doctors and French wife who returned after World War II, and many stratified stories about the misfortune of the French woman. "Tmavomodr√Ω svet" (title of check) is quite easy and light laughing The general effects of WWII England singing, chak singing, sky pilots and aircraft crafts - not as broad as Hollywood - do not always need to be bing, joke, and boom when showing windsurgeon scenes. At the beginning of sadness (two paragraphs in English) Was interpreted and wrapped up with follow-up paragraphs. This film is not completely subtitled, only f While translating conversations - the rest is in English, it is very British or Check Act. (So it is a foreign film and English actors with English language.) <br /> <br /> Three main characters, especially two Czech pilots, are splendidly distributed. Was done. Both of them have hugs, although they are intensely mature versus intelligent young people. I always admire Fitzgeraldle: Yes, there is "Brass Off Off" against Yan McGregor and Pete Postlethwaite. Against Adrian Dunbar and Ned Batti, he remembered him from the 1991 "Hello My Song"; In addition to his presence in the PBS Masterpiece Theater Mini-Series, Hugh Grant and "The Englishmen Who One Up Up Heel and Cam Down in Mountain" in 1995 in "Serens" <br /> <br /> 'So sad' - The heroes of the country who treat their country's defense forces so badly and have been treated for 40 years of age. Kindly thank you for the imprints of appropriate memories and unforgettable friendships. So a stain breaks for a ray of the sun through the glass windows (strange or coincidental that it is a church where hard labor takes place) - the symbol of hope, losing ?? The story of the other stories needs to be told: "Kandahar" (Nelphar Pazira travels to Kandahar with Afghanistan's personal 'mission' in Afghanistan with Nafas in Afghanistan) Eyes behind Iran's director Mohsen Makhmelf's Burka. Swiss director Mark Foster's insightful film "Keep Together Together" (Radha Mitchell encounters SID-accidental child death), and most of them talk about the controversial film "Mentos of Ball" (I have not been caught) with Hal Berry, Billy Bob Thornton And Peter Boyle. See movies without expectation or comparison before the movie before. Just see it.
