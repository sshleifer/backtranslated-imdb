"Honkers" is probably the best performance of Slim Pickens all the time. When we were shooting, everyone was involved with this product that was the slim Academy Award winner. Unfortunately, James Bond was in the United States at the same time during the liberation war and did not pay much attention to "The Hankers". I personally feel low rating rates by these critics. Sam Pacinap's "Junior Bonner" was out at the same time and started influencing critics more than our movies. Also, a few months before our release, Cliff Robertson was a rodeo film and it could hit us too. Pictures are viewable, just for the Rudo footage - sometimes best pictured - James Crrabbe shot. Director and my co-writer Steve Inat died a few weeks after the release of the film, cutting out his committed career and moving behind his beloved wife, Sally, her daughter Gabby and newborn son Stephen. Please give a shot to this movie. I'm saying that you would say it was good value. I thank anyone that took the time to read this. Stephen Lodge
