I saw the song version of Lost Harijan was about 14 years old. I love the movie so much, as well as the songs I go to the film several times, to see them again. My mother bought LP and I learned the songs from the heart, just as I "sound of music" (people who know very little in Austria). I think there are some problems among these self-appointed critics who publish comments that they do not have any romantic spirit and they did not see the film with the eyes of a young teenager. Maybe he was an Ingrid Bergman fan but I was happy with Leip Ullman. Eagrid Burgman could sing and dance? What was so great about her? Perhaps the critic did not express his gratitude because he felt the need for new glasses or contact lenses to show close similarity between Lew Olman and Bill Clinton. It was the concept behind the film and the story, the most important and interesting factor in philosophy, and a colorful musical instrument makes it more entertaining and enjoyable without harmful intellectual aspects. It is a shame that with great themes / stories so-called great actors and many other films with actresses are relatively annoying.
