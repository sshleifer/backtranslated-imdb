I agree with the posters that the characters were very strong and credible before and all actors were at their peak. I especially love David Boriany for a lot of love, so he again omitted anything else to prove his amazing gift for the comedy. The first part of the film was light and fun, the Blackmail part was a bit intelligent but funny - and it was flying. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed that at least two of the at least 3 girls (Keira and Lisa) came out of Blackmail and betrayed Scott Free, a trace on their psychological left side. I know the movie has corrected the end of the dark end - and I'm not saying I missed the part of the murder. But I must have seen both of them face-to-face and I finally cried frustrated. (Why I gave it only 9) <br /> <br /> Of course, an interesting picture.
