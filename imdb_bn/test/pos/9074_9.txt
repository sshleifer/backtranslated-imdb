Five medical students (Kevin Bacon, David Labresio, William Beldwin, Dr. Joe Herlie, Oliver Plat, Randy Stackley, Julia Roberts, Dr. Rachel Mannas, K. Swarcherland, Nelson) And for personal knowledge. One by one, the heart of every medical student is closed, then it is revived. <br /> <br /> Every experience under temporary death spells with forgotten aspect, forgotten childhood memories Their flashbacks are like children's nightmare. Resurrected students are bothered to remember gratitude towards them or their actions against them. They experience the afterlife, they bring life back to life in real life. They keep on testing, their memories dramatically intensify; So many, are physically overcome. In this way, they seek death after death and try to enjoy life after death. <br /> <br /> Although the DVD was released in 2007, this motion picture was released in 1990. Therefore, Kevin Bacon, William Belvedin, Julia Roberts and Cather Sutherland were in the early stages of their adult acting staff. The plot is very provocative, suspense building is a dramatic climax and the script creates a strong and convincing all-young actor "flatlines", which is now a universal culture mystery of semi-science-mystery. Who knew 17 years ago that the actor will skyrocket the career of this young team? I suspect the director Joel Shumacha
