NBC is taking a lot of good things after coming out of this series, but none of these viewers are watching. Due to the minimum ratings, at least they have wisely canceled Star Trek and My World and love programs, like their executives wisely. NBC advertisers received an agreement from NBC's ignorance. <br /> <br /> This show was not enough to get visitors to stand as time only. The show had immense support to Margot Kidder near Neva Patterson from Stuart Margolin (later Angel in Rockford file). <br /> <br /> It was founded in the western city of 1900. Garner plays a sheriff who does not want to use violence to perform his duties. It was a small town stuff, but it was nice. Jim Rockford returned successfully, but this was good enough for my money, it was not the right place, the right place or the right opportunity at the right time. <br /> The program was so good that most of the people got jobs in Rockford.
