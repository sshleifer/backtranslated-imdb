The wonderful rollercoaster of this movie has repeated the delightful philosophy for me. It's about three very different people's shocking life. Holly Hunter is passionate workaholic producer. Albert Brooks plays unprepared but brilliant journalists. William Hurt Block, a proponent of news anchor blog but stupid new baby <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image works on many levels. At least it is a brilliant comedy which is a boat race that is so thick and fast flying that every one has missed you last time that a new crop bearings It is also a movie about attraction and incomplete romance. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most important thing is the final victory over intelligence as a physical appearance and modern human characteristics. It is illustrated by the success of the opposite of Brooks' success in the opposite of heart character. <br /> <br /> Although there are fifteen years old, there are some initially relevant messages about the modern news price of the movie and the continuous deterioration of journalistic values ​​<br /> <br /> This picture is a classic in every sense and why it is so negligent It can be hard to understand
