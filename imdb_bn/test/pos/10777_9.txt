Oliver Stone hit Bull's eyes with this film, especially in the presence of bogosiyan electrifying screen and with the help of biting, bright screenplay. Every moment constantly crackles with rising tension, climaxing experience in moving a real, memorable movie. If there is an indication of the combination of two extremely volatile nature in the united consolidation of creativity and a directional director! As a result, the acquisition of a powerhouse, probably due to its bitter attraction with celebrity culture, has been created more time, and it is a distorted interpretation of fame. <br /> <br /> The final complaint about the growing sickness of our society and the self-ill appetite for the next big adventure <br /> <br /> A picture can not be easily forgotten. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in dark aspects of human nature.
