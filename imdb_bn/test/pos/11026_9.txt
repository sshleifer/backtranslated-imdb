There is a lot to appreciate about this movie, but the thing that I got more than others is a wonderful recovery, the romance of romance and the role of romanticization of Hollywood, but which is totally credible and against any character I have encountered. Film or life Also a very believable and annoying illustration of Tourete's syndrome
