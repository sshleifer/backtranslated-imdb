This movie came out and after a few years later a few more times. After 20 years I saw it and it is still a very good story. Does it wreak the "lifetime movie network"? Yes, but no longer existed before living, so it needs some air. <br /> <br /> Cast was nice. The story got a little bit; Two women became close friends and one friend is related to another friendly husband. She is invited to the house for a dinner party, how she discovered her boyfriend husband of her best friend. He tried to break the fear and stop the affair. Shortly afterwards, he was seriously killed in a car accident which suffers from both women. Of course, the wife finds an accident about this incident and now wants to get out of her life, but because of their friendship, they need each other. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very good story. Great cast and perfomrances. I really enjoyed it.
