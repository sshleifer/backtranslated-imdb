I do not think I've ever seen a good movie parody. Mel Brooks is crazy. Every time I see it I find something new and makes it funer than ever. Curry Elwes is perfect for the role of Robin Hood. This is a great and unexpected ending that cracks you down. Each character is great from Little John and will be Marine and Broomhilde Maid. I smiled the whole way and would never be tired. See it !! <br /> <br /> If you like Curly Ellove in this movie, of course you must see Princess Bride.
