I was forced to respond to this movie that was rented from Blockbuster. This movie is all about - comedy, drama, crime, mystery and "realism". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I will definitely see it again! There were some interesting parts as action-packed plays. I enjoy movies which amaze you what is happening next to you. <br /> <br /> Author / Director, Travis Miller, More Cinema to be Created !!! My overall opinion, this movie was great! I look forward to him! Trevis Milloy has real talent as a writer and director.
