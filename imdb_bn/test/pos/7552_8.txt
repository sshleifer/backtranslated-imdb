Four friends are one of the movies that you go without any expectation, only to find yourself for a loop. You remove its file, but then you hear the song "Georgia on My Kind" by Ray Charles, and the images and vague feelings begin to thrive on the edge of your consciousness, and then you think of this crazy movie that makes you smile and tears, almost at the same time . <br /> <br /> Why is this picture so memorable? First of all, at least for everyone living in it, because it holds the period of time so well - its hopes for disappointment, its success, sincerity and all the emotional rolling-coaster journey that leads to a harmful nostalgia. And then, acting is just so amazing. Danilo, all the emotions and emotions, Georgia, is as difficult to perceive as deliberately as the will ... ... but interesting, nevertheless, and Louise invades life with an unexpected room-companion magician and takes every moment a harmful smile, because he knows very well That it might end it. <br /> <br /> Have you seen a movie which has long been a concern for people in the story? Even if they were far from perfect? This image presents you with people whose choices are certainly not admirable, but the film never gives morality, it only allows to appreciate all our human condition ... even the smallest characters have a specific personality and history, which is why this image is so real It seems as if some actions and responses may seem at the top ... because this is the way of life, when Pony think about it. And why does this movie connect you with complexity that is characterized by the character. Really an amazing and satisfying experience
