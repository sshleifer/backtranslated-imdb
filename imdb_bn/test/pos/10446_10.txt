"The Last American Virgin", "The Fast Times in Reedmont High", is a last hit teen movie. It is a neutral story in the early stages of cross-border and unfamiliar love. Most critics of critics believe that it was an impressive, concerted effort to regain the magic of "The Fast Times at Redmont High", the same critics realize that at the end of 1981, two films were actually portrayed simultaneously and were released only by a little distance from each other. In any case, the studios will never allow any bold and incompatible illustration that confront them with sexual maturity as they face most adolescents. Considering the character of the discovery of heart-turning, Gary faces up to the end. American Pie is not this. This story revolves around a thirteen-year-old man, and most of his unsuccessful sexual orientation Gary's team is the least successful, so the latest American Virgin Tagline. Secretly, after Gary Karen, who is involved in Rick, who is his best friend Rick and Karen started to start sex and Karen is pregnant, can be dumped only by rick, who is not interested in the obvious responsibility before. Gary glides to help Karen, which comes in the foregoing, unexpected conclusion. Overall, as a film, I was very successful as a comedy, as a commentary on the sexual encounters of young men, and a remarkable arrival story such as heartwarming, unfamiliar love and miscarriage, which was just as relevant today as they were twenty years ago. Also, it's one of the rockstest soundtrack ever made !!!
