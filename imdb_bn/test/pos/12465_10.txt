Especially by Lambert. This is the essential broom's Tarzan that I was a kid when I grew up. I have read some negative reviews in this movie and could not help but wonder what their problem was. They obviously did not see the movie that I saw or they expected something that was like a serial on Saturday afternoon. <br /> <br /> This should be appreciated for the Tarajan novels and filmmakers to tackle the source material and take it seriously. Lambert was nice. I still think he is one of Hollywood's worst-performing actors. This is a movie in which he shines. <br /> <br /> Fitik and apes, both completed by Rick Bucker, were amazing. You definitely felt from the jungle. The second half, because of being alive, the movement of the movement really leads you to a mental conflict which was forced to solve it. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie
