I was lucky enough recently that I never met (or even heard) a movie with Aggrid Bergman's name. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br> Writer is amazing ridiculous and performance is excellent. <br /> <br /> Walter's head (which is not my favorite) was almost perfect and Goldie Haun (nicely) was fantastic. Tender on time, claiming, then just plain stupid. There is a lot of time in the film that even the most stringent filmmakers will be caught in the story and it will be forgotten in a movie. <br /> <br /> That Bergman could steal a dance scene among 20 year-old people- the olds were amazing to see. Is she continually going back to the screen? (At the age of 54?). The supporter cast was great and the lines ... lines are fine. <br /> <br /> Top 5 romantic comedy all the time.
