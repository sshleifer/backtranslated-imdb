Mario returned to the series, and my opinion, better than ever. Galaxy is still the most creative Mario; Super Mario 64 is more than that. The controls are great; The best thing for wii. As well as the beautiful graphical design. The levels are too big, and the good old boss is back. This game has tons of exploration; Definitely a high level of replay value. I have only two complaints: 1: The story is just like Mario 64. And 2: The difficulty is not too much; Although it requires some patience. Mario Fans: The game you have been waiting for. Casual gamers: This game is worth more than to buy. 10.8 out of 9.8
