I was "different" than most modern interpretations of Shakespeare and I enjoyed it perfectly. It will not be useful to read at school because it does not show the interpretation of traditional Shakespeare character (i.e. Mirinda is portrayed as much as the traditional Shakespeare lady), but for the understanding of the game and on the basis of it the story is a very powerful piece and it is fantastic to see. It is not included in a correct format, such as in work and scenery format, I am currently playing Miranda in a project and most of the lines have been cut and some scenes are divided and almost mixed but it is of course very useful and if I say that you've seen it even a must see As it suggests! Shakespeare fans will love this!
