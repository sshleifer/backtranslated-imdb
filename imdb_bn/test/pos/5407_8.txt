As soon as Salinger's "Perfect Day for Banfish" ends with debut suicide, the movie starts with opening with the death of legendary legendary Matt's death in the house school, who shot his head with Revolver after the first scene. But Matt Trasis acts as the key to unlocking the door of other butterfly's death, his brother Tim, who has never been questioned in his life, "What am I going to do?" <br /> <br /> <br /> When he found his brother dead, the floor of his head broke like watermelon, and the Treviss family broke the secret one after the other. The film focuses on the team. She is related to rape, domestic abuse, family isolation, heart disease, sex and friendship. <br /> <br /> The team expresses its wounds by physical injury, but this person is not the only injury to her, as we gradually understand, because the script shows the invention of team scars and painful results. Anyone who loves him gives pain to him. Hirosh has played well, has expressed frames after publishing the frame in the visual expression of his body, there is confusing emotion inside the soul of a child, some of which do not listen very well or know very well, unknown and unaware of its depth. Soul and extraordinary talents <br /> <br /> Two siblings share a dobby, curls up on a red, spineless playground, Tim Penney asks, "What am I going to do with my life?" In this scene the familiar, repetitive image of the picture has been created: The comfortable playground where teams feel clearly at home, is illustrated from the eyesight of a bird, because each character feels comfortable to share it with the team and we are at this close moment that he is red, spongy Participate in the playground, which is full of pencil-engraved childhood graffiti . After advising him to jointly pass, Penny said to him, "Team, well, the secret of the success of life is to find something that will find your love and do it for the rest of your life?" If you're not in hell then you would probably fail it if you are not good at it. "This easy line of Pani works as a central theme of the film, the talent and the possibility of failure. Why does a person have such talent why she can not stand, like Matt, who hated the attention of his swim fame, but nobody saw the talent of the team? Because someone is not bothered to ask him or even us, the film makes us aware that we are not We do not even know the team as we think we first meet this handsome, sad person; in our intimate understanding of the team, as it progresses, we are reminded that they do not seem to be at all. Those who should not fail? Parents, friends, teachers ?? Anybody? They love the goal of people's attention and see. His mother, Sandy, who works for Sijourini Weaver, Despite being a team member, Beabar, a middle-aged woman, did a cruel act to slay her own demons, because she desperately tried to play the role of domesticity and support, when Team School got disturbed by the school, the boy's trailer was shocking, Threatened, "You can get bored, tortured, punch, drunk with me, I forgave you Can we Hell I can understand that I am a good Christian, you know, I can forgive and forget, but you mess with my kids and God can come down from heaven to protect yourself? Because as long as I live ?? And I'll spare everyone ?? I'll wake up and go to hell on your way to sleep in the night on the world. "After flicking a paper cup in the mouth of the mother, she looks around the trailer, and look at both of them, the kid and her hung mother, comment," Excellent trailer "and leave as soon as she came out. Acid and malicious that match gusto with visceral intelligence Weaver scores in power. And Jeff Daniels's father, played by Jeff Daniels, knows who his son is blind, like him, does not tell his family Spending time off from the office, spending his days in the city park, uninterrupted, an inscribed spirit, and sleeping on Matt's bed, tucked with his high school private jacket. Jeff Daniels does a fantastic job of believing that because he can be both dishonest and loving, We can see that even an inactive father can show his love for his son. In between, the team faces his father, just when you think his father is going to hurt him, he holds him to arrest him. He was not allowed to go, he told the team, "I am your father and you are my son and me I'm fine here but you have to talk to me. I do not know how I can do it myself. "At this moment there is a picture that Baba tells his son that you have to tell me what's going on inside me, you tell me who you are? I want to know who you are in this scene is a catharic Moments reached, Team, anger and the visible movement alone, weeping and weeping to her father, expressing hidden emotions under her shell. Yatharisa this moment to clear his father's experience, especially when you abuse, manipulation, neglect, violence and treachery to consider the long years he acted in the film. I recommend this film.
