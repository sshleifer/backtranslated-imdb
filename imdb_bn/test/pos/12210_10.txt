I'm new to this, so bear with me. I'm a big fan of Surface. I was exceptional in scripts and computer graphics, as well as any sci fi flick that I've seen in the theater. In February, TV Guide Season Finley said the show's announcer, "... and now there will be some impact on the last episode of the Surface". The end of the series, not the end of the series! I can not wait to fall here, see what's going to happen next. So it falls down and it can not be found anywhere! If NBC is not going to accept it, then what is the Sai Fi or the United States? It seems to me that Bay Watch did not last long in ABC and then lifted it in the US, and it went to gang busters! (I was chucking betting ABC) Ha! If there is no series, at least one mini series, to stop all our loyal fans. What happened to the people stuck in the church? What was the chamomile nem animal? Does he have a serious spert? Does the clone come from our side? There are many unanswered questions. Thanks for listening to me fool!
