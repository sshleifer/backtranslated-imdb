I did not see this recent 'traffic' which was based on this, but I would agree on it as a good creation. I do not know about any film that saw complex drug trafficking drugs and 'fight against drugs'. I saw it at least four times and enjoyed it again as part of the 30th anniversary presentation of Masterpiece Theater.
