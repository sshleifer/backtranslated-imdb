This movie was amazing. I was tears after finishing the movie. OK, I know sucked acting but that's not what's important. This message became loud and clear about God's love for us and for Jesus' sacrifice. Whether the film was realistic and showed real human emotions whether it was the pity's pregnancy or the son of the questioner. But shows the joy that comes from a genuine relationship with Christ. The car was awesome and the actor was very hot and that attracted my eyes. But I like the most about this movie, clearly Gospel message. Mother and pastor persecuted Ben in his new way with Christ and tried to make a godly example for others. Nikki D has shown that if you want to give everything around the world, it does not matter to Christ. Nina showed how a confused but good man can easily miss the mark. I liked this movie and thought it would bring many young people to Christ.
