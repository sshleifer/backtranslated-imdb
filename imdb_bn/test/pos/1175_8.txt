8/2008 When I originally wrote my comment, in a very short time after watching this film, I think, Lemon and Matthu originally "phoned-in" their performances, which had done many things as they did before. <<br /> <br /> But when it comes back again, it seems to be different, especially since the two major mega-stars did not make a big deal after its release. <br /> <br /> With all the significant experiences of the spinner, eight principals, and likewise many of us will be much more "in the tooth" on their other films and TVs. But almost everyone is not? <br /> <br /> Seeing, though, it will certainly not be regarded as a "classis" in their carrier, it's a fun movie, along with many interesting scenes <br /> <br /> From my point of view, it Reminds me that many movies, dramas, etc. often look at the very complex perspective, or instead of looking at the light, the film's other "citizen Cain," "Casablance," or (two lead terms), another real "strange Couple. " It will provide a continuous part of Nostalgia for Lemon and Maestro as well as others for Cast.
