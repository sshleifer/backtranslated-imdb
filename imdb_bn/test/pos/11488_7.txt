"Promised" is a steady optimist about Graham, who goes in search of his own self-confident husband, who is in his quest, which leads all to a kind of kaki, as well as to the humorous Odyssey associated with side-characters and problems. A fresh, fun, and unpredictable little flashing, which lacks the "commuted" story, makes it good for nature and fine morals and maxims. If you enjoyed this little chick Flick, which has been critically and critically reviewed by critics in the public, then you might want to see Lisa Krueger's hit indie "Manny and Low" (1996) check.
