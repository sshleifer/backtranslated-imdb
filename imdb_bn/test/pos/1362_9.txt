I liked this quite a bit but my friends hated it. No sex, but episodes have very few nudity - it's a good thing. Also, Kettera has a toilet fix which is searched for at least half the episodes. (The toilets in Japan are even better.) Hmm, I wonder why I gave myself so high ratings ...? It certainly does not want me naked cartoon girls. In some ways, Kattera and (main character) are similar to Bravo, painful to pain, muscular joke, Kettero is a hypertended nerd. Or you can remember him as the answer to Larry's Japanese in Larry's Suit If you see the subtitle instead of dubbing it, it is easy to accept, but if you give him a chance then he will continue to you. He is the Golden Boy. <br /> <br /> The formula for each episode is the same. The boy fills the girl, the boy tries to conquer the heart of the girl despite the distorted Darkie, and the boy is in any way successful against all kinds of impairment. Generally, the girl does not understand that she does not like Katroto until she pits on a chest and / or pulls a spectacular stunt into a modern operating system within a week or uses a motorcycle-powered motorcycle using her bike. br /> <br /> Episode # 1 is a rich software typewrite feature. I think her boobs are making a big difference in the budget because she is the only woman who has such an animation. She is completely unprofessionally dresses Most people have never been able to rate this negative aspect before the first episode. <br /> <br /> Episode # 2 is a rich, young girl who likes to make teijaji. He is only 16 but the legitimate age of Japan (and I can add some states to the United States). His father is also a brutalized Yakuz, who earned a reputation for killing his daughter to interested people. <br /> <br /> Girl # 3 is a Noodle shop owner's sweet innocent daughter who mixes with bad lovers. Apart from Kyatoro, intervention is going on for a girl and a person is kissing, there is no inch of this episode - sharp drop from the previous two. However, Kettero and the evil lover pounding each other. <br /> <br /> Episode # 4 Keitro is trying to influence a top trainer coach. Kettera seems directly 'direct' to anyone other than her elite girls ... and she is looking forward to returning ... <br /> <br /> Girl girl # 5. She is probably the most heaviest of six (though not as a super-buyer as the girl # 1) and "Russia" in terms of sexuality and obscenity. This special episode is the most prominent in terms of easily (lacking) reality. Kitaro could break every bone of his body at least twice during biker competition, but I think the producer and the author said, "It's just a cartoon! We can do something!" Finally, episode # 6 introduces a new girl (it works in animation) and helps the previous 5 girl Katero because she tries to cope with impossible time and organization. Limit to get an OAV out of doors by the deadline. In Ecchi terms, this one is very good, but there are plenty of humor. The last 5 most of the last group of women has ended up finding Keitto, who are quietly silent, with the intention of gang-rape. Yes, the real world will happen in real life. Someone has crossed Yuko Tachibana (Ala Samurai Shadoun) with Steve Urkel (Ala Family Matters) ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < If you are new to anime, you probably do not want to start with it. At the same time, if you can place characters such as Hopesai (from Ranma 1/2) or Johnny Bravo ... ... or you like the humor that is too heavy on the syllabus but you have sex too, you have to give it a shot.
