The Grand Champion is a bit old fashion at first glance. Andrew Marton of Fort Worth Star's Wire said, "Walt Disney came from Texas, he became the champion champion." <br /> <br /> There is no video and special effects on this movie, but it is heart and soul. Great and great array of kids are incredible. I'm really proud of Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts to watch their movie :) (G rating) <br /> <br /> It's a well-made "easy" short film made in Texas by Barry of Texas. Tubb. Take your kids, take your kids' friends, take grandmother ... they all will enjoy it and you too will do it.
