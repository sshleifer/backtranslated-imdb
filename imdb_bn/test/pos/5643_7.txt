This title is significant for the destruction of the residue of crops, such as rice, by the peasants who set fire to the sea. This is an inferior story of the destruction of Japanese soldiers. <br /> <br /> In the last days of the Philippine campaign this story has been defined as a soldier with TB, who comes back from the hospital because he can walk, they have no room for him. His superior officers do not want to surround him because he is really sick to fight or fight. If he is insulted by his officer, he is sent to the hospital to be admitted or killed himself. They still will not accept him and he is left to rotate across the ravaged landscape battle to help soon or to stay or to find the place or even food. This is a great journey and there is no hope in sight and people in every house only die and human inhumanity. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Either, it is occasionally, but it's a comic deeply. How can it be? Here is a movie where madness and madness are run, people are constantly running with Japanese soldiers for a procession but never trying to get the Japanese soldiers, trying to reduce tobacco pills for food. Nowhere else can you help but can not laugh. It can be ensured that the things get dark because it becomes clear that cannibalism, literally and metaphorically, is the only way to survive, but at the same time something uncomfortable about human comedy. <br /> <br /> The awesome anti-war film has its amazing photography style that cleanses the madness of the war, and it also shines our eyes with our beauty. Here we see full landscapes of the body comprising soldiers and civilians. The field is set in forests and trees that would otherwise be, and still some amounts, quite beautiful. This is a jering sensation. <br /> <br /> How fascinating I read that it is written based on a novel about the freedom of Christ. The director removed all religious references of hope and salvation and instead it showed that turning the life, the war has become worse and there is no hope at all. <br /> <br /> I intelligently appreciate this movie mentally. Its part is a strong downbeat score that gets more noticeable on screen for me. Because the image is so tough, liliti is often guillored, it does not necessarily need to be read in a way or other way through music. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, for your decision. Surely it is not like any other war film, bloody, horror and real big budget movies, but it never happens. This is not due to bleeding and blood disorders here.
