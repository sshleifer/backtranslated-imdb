I expected FAME to be an uploading film but it ended the opposite. The overall conspiracy has strong possibilities following the lives of different scheduled students present in a performing arts school. However, FAME creates his characters nicely and leaves us with a lot of questions on it. I was very surprised when the graduation scene popped up - we thought that the DVD was avoided or something. All characters have internal and external conflicts and none of them are resolved at the end of the movie! You might think there are many characters, but perhaps it's a lot of views. Its clear picture has been cut and shortened because it sometimes lacks infections. I think Laura Dean is my favorite character as Lisa Monroe. I really followed the ambition of his character and his heart. Boyd Gaines as Michael, stereotypical poor students who do not fall but a divine dancer, very good. I did not particularly like the character of Koko's Irene Kare, but because of his weakness in the script, there is no blame and his character has not swelled. Her voice is listening to her song warrant to see the beautiful and full song. In a nutshell, the film could use much improvements, but earning its place in the history of quality actors and great music film.
