If you like a fine psychic drama / thriller, it's a movie for you. Those who want to see a common sexual 'crime lover thriller' will not understand this movie, because Colin Firth is obviously calling it "garbage". But Jennifer Rubin, however, is the real star in the movie. She is so beautiful and beautiful actress! With flashing and twisted tales, it gets more psychological and lets you think about yourself, wonderful directions, photography, and especially music make this film an excellent text. Small sections are also very good, especially Belinda Weymouth is awesome in its small scene. I hope the DVD is released soon, and a soundtrack album will be coming true to a dream !!
