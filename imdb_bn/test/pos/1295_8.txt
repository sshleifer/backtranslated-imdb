I have seen other Bollywood flicks with Salman Khan, I can say it is my latest darling. The songs are quite funny, especially the 'Priya and Priya', which seems to be a bit of a mix of beetles, Indian music and music. The story of love is a little more credible, say, brother by rice. Sometimes the focus of the use of love alcohol is to get into trouble because it does not make sense to me, but it has played well by Khan - even though his drunk becomes drunk when he becomes drunk.
