This photo is my favorite comedy all the time and I've seen many comedy. First of all, I did not have any script in this movie. Just a storyboard The conversation is almost entirely written by the actor. This movie is made entirely by hsyterical.Cast is one of the best comedic ensemble you will see. The story shows about Mayflower Dogs in Philadelphia and some competitors among them. Parker Posey shines and is absolutely great! This is the most laughing character in the movie that comes from absolute cruelty. ***** / *****
