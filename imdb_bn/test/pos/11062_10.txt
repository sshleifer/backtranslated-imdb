In the list of Ingrid Bergman movies, I will give this film a high rating. Eagrid's beauty aside, after his talent scene, the scene is clear. He is sad, mean, malicious, <br /> <br /> Snowman, Dazzling, Fun, Funny, Loving, Modest, Sad, Sad, Happy, etc. You name it, it was all. And so <br /> <br /> sure. Ingrid plays a notorious woman (Cleo), who is new again <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper (Clint) for jewelers of Arielians and Texas. I especially like the scene where they are not sitting in the dining table, just looking at each other. She is an elegant white gown and she is sitting in a handsome white cowboy <br /> <br />, looking at her strangely. What chemistry! What love!
