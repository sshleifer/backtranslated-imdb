Full genre movie from the CKY crew ...... (Not Jacques boys ... Janie Noxville, Chris Pontius, Steve-et al. <br /> <br /> <br />) Well, maybe they are not the best actors, but it's not a serious movie, but it's fun to watch and it's fun to see. Do not want to see Don Vito wearing royal emperor! <br /> <br /> If you like Viva La Left or Cke, there will definitely be an amazing soundtrack provided! By the Almighty Him, CCY and others ... Watch additional features in DVDs, especially bran's freestyle <br /> <br /> Chinese rap number two ...... serious sunny ...... See this picture ........ you do not feel it ......... 10/10
