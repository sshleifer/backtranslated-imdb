I've liked this movie for a long time. I have not seen it for a while, so I tested it again and it is actually more enjoyable. When I was young, Chimmuns loved the cartoon, so naturally I used to enjoy 'Chipmun Adventure'. <br /> <br /> I really can not think of a good plot of this movie. It's not wildly creative, but I've always wanted to travel around the world, and so I found it so much fun to see because my interest in travel is increasing. Eleanor's little penguin song is always crying to me ... <br /> <br /> 'Chipmun Adventure' will be my darling forever, I'm sure. I guess because I was so young when I saw it. I do not think it will have an impact on older people to see them older. (Unless, of course, they have a young heart)
