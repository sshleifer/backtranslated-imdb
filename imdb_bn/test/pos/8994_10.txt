I wanted to watch this movie since the previews were released. I do not understand why everyone is so difficult in this picture. It is not technically true for all rugby games, but this film is not primarily about sports. This is about a rugby team that is taught how to be more than them in the world. They become male, and are not taught to temporarily vain boys. Hollywood is not 100% correct in their productions. They have to create a product to sell. Some Recreational The story of coach Gelix and what they have been taught for years is amazing. He teaches about service, respect, honesty and moral cleanliness. How many days other movies are our youth that these days? I was proud to see an amazing story that taught respect and respect.
