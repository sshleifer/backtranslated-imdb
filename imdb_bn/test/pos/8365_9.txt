I found this DVD title from Zhang Imau, a fan and finally after a long search in many places a shelf of a Svensane bookstore. <br /> <br /> It's a huge departure from the work of East Jung Emo, esp style and locale terms. The director himself said that this is the first and only time he will try to set a black comedy in contemporary China. You might say that this work is comparatively more experimental, than its other well known big budget and formal pieces. <br /> <br /> The full movie covers hand-held cameras and wide-angle lenses across full-time, performing quick motion and high strength performance and tone of nature does not let you grips from the start once you go. It represents a very realistic account of modern Chinese urban sensitivity, which is placed in Beijing in this regard. If you appreciate and love such a black laugh, then you love this movie completely. See also Zhao Benshan (Happy Times) and director Zhang Imo himself for the sunny adolescence. <br /> <br /> A last point: I have found the characters in this movie, as in all other Jhang Imo movies, exhibit characteristics of similar personality - try stubbornness, always weird bang. Let me know your thoughts about this. <br /> <br /> David Lee
