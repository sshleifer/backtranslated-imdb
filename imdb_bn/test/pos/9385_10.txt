It's one of the most important budgets, B movies I've ever seen. I was not one of the stand-up and enthusiastic during a movie, but this one was definitely worth it. Obviously this idea is that there is a bed that people eat, well ... I think that is a spiritual word, it actually hides acid bubbles to suck the predators and their acid fills them with kindness. The best part of this movie is one of William Ras's main characters. Normally the family man started his career with this movie ... and an Afro. This flurry has lots of nudity, so it's probably not for children, but anyone who does not stop watching this movie. It is my belief that everyone needs a little bit of death in their life or at other times, it is better to hurry later.
