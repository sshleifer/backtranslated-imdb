Just this evening I just saw Drescher, I saw it almost a dozen years ago. <br /> <br /> This is not a "big" movie, and does not attempt to splash a bigger, but my God, the brightness of the two sides lets me to be innocent. Albert Finney and Tom Court are nothing less than surprising in this film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Dreser Sir, the Old Shakespeare Actor (Finney) and his Woman of Normal (Court), during the rebellion of World War II in King Lear Establishes a product. These two men, each dependent on each other: Sir almost helpless without the help of Northern, Lajar to walk him for his 227th performance, and suppress him by weeping. And Norman has lived his life vividly through sir; Sir, he does not need it, he's nothing, or he thinks, anyway. <br /> <br /> This is a character driven movie; The plot is secondary to communication with characters, and for this, it requires maximum living actors. Only 47-year-old Finney is quite old, very sick, petulant, rapist, but credible as a brilliant actor. When he is smoking his fellow actor and his bow! And in the court is not a little less believable like a mincing dredger, who can sometimes work more as a mother than a valet for her old employer. The wrong word for employers really use though. However, technically their relationship is not so much like the employer and the employee, most of the time Sir and Norman have an old married couple. Yes, there are others in this movie, but the real stars are Fanti, Courtney and Ronald Harwood's extraordinary scripts. There is no other subtle performance, especially Eileen Atkins is not as a long-time distressed stage manager Madge. There is a wonderful scene where sir and majas are old wishes, old remorse and what can be. <br /> <br /> Although these days can not be talked about, it should be remembered that the dancer was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actor for Fine and Courtier Nominated, Best Picture, Best Director (Peter Yeats), and Best Adapted Screenplay <br /> <br /> I remembered it as a good movie, but I I was not ready to prepare as completely mesmerized from the end. If you want to see everything about extraordinary performances and are always very entertained, I encourage you to see the dreser.
