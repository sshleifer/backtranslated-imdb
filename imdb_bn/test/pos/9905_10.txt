It was a rare treatment to see "check out". I was touched by the characters, many scoff at the wonderful script, and these were decorated nicely by throwing ensemble and actually moved deeply by actual emotion by Peter Fog. In fact, in a scene in his own home kitchen where he is experiencing his life experience, deep love for his wife and his decisions about his life, it is deeply true that it is the highest performing Academy Award winning performance level. She is an actress actor who has done herself out in this movie. Screenplay coordinates literary knowledge, time, a gift for conversation and a delightful situation that laughs loudly to me in the theater. I highly recommend playing "out of check out" everyone who would like to enjoy playing fantastic quality stories.
