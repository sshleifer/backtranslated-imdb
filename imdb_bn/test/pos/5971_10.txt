If you have a chance, but this Russian (how do I tell them: gems, excellence, hidden treasures?), Watch movies of this type of war, or here the dons are quiet, or do not show a guardian ... and, then, again American war movies , Or international productions, unity and those with Germans, etc. See. Or, watch even worse, Italian war movies. Everything in the west will seem shallow, concreved, ridiculous than the Russian movie. I am so surprised by the quality of the Russian war film mentioned that I can not find the words to praise the superiority of their emptiness in the Anglo-Saxon war film.
