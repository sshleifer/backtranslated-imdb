Just thinking about the movie, I smile at myself. Ana Rames probably played the unforgettable part as 'Mom', perhaps the most painful, yet Hillary was never caught in maternity films. Danny Davito and Billy Crystal made an imaginary pair by bringing the film a real warmth. Although not very complicated, the beautiful story holds your attention, and laughs you through the whole way. It will light up a funny comedy thing, and even entertain the kids. I give it my complete recommendation.
