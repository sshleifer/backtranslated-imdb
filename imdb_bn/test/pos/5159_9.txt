This picture is not supposed to be funny, but it makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> This is not designed to be sad, but most of my heart feels heavy with Vignette. <br /> <br> This action is not written as adventure, but my pulse has been for more than once. <br /> <br /> If you just want life, this movie does not use your passion and tells you how to feel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> and refreshing to see the director so we sincerely celebrate that we are all people, and we're all stuck here, we're over all of this "life" thing as long as we need it. <br /> <br /> Another day tomorrow.
