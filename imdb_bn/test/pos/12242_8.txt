Spoiler alert <br /> <br /> I have never seen comments on a movie, I disagree with the people who made this comment more. One can learn from this critical view of this movie. As an educational movie, I hate it because it teaches "how to succeed"! We do not learn to watch movies; We usually watch for entertainment. As entertainment, I lose it less: finishing is reduced and the brain is intellectual /. This conflict is my eight star rating results. The film follows Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), a television news producer. Introducing Network Executive Tom Grunnick (William Hart), study for air news anchor position. Tom immediately charms people with modesty. Another potential news anchor is waiting for his windmill for several years, Haroon Altman (Albert Brooks). Altman knows all news stories, inside and outside. <br /> <br /> The network executive wants GranÄ±k in the air and Jane, not the Greek is ready, he does not know the news. They do not listen to him. He is obliged to keep Greanick in the air, contact Altman to know the information of the media, and Alan's comments were released by an ewerp to Greeks after listening to Granani. We see the sharp contrasts between Altman's / Jane Craig's words and Grunnick, as Grunnick skillfully tells everything in Altman and Jane Craig, saying it is understandable in his ears, and entertainment of the audience. Altman gets a chance in the air and the network execs him to seek coaching from the new guy Grunnick. Is this new guy (news engineer) coaching him? It is something that Altman does not see to justify, but is reluctant to agree. <br /> <br /> Glennic Coach Altman and excited by seeing hundreds of appearances, audio and vocabulary, Altman's flaws. Altman never considered this thing before, he became expert in news itself. The complexity of understanding what Grunnick taught him, while Altman has a terrified sweat attack ("flop suit") while he is in the air. Greink was finally anchored to the top network and Altman resigned before resigning. But in the attempt of romance with Jane Craig, the granny failed in his failure, because he found out from Altman, that sometimes Greinke encounters the situation to create a man like him. This enabled him to close her. It sends a message that, in relation, we are not really trying to make us like them. <br /> <br /> This movie sends the message that people like you are the most important of your job skills, but this is especially true in Broadcast News. How the TV news has reduced it and how grunici looks good, but many people comment on the stupid ones or all the styles, but there is no substance. The opposite is true, the skill of the graphic, and the complexity of the mind, how people appear, how they appear in the presence of the mind, and when they are present in the camera (to make Altonman a word in each sentence). The granular error for the relationship with Jane Craig, he was driven to be very selective and a mesh would be a situation. Many people are calling Altman very intelligent or bright. Not as intelligent as the Altman Grunich by Bruins, and the "flop suit" view shows that his mind can not handle the complexity that operates the gruni in the air. Altman was offended by the fact that he knew the news and Greink was even more successful by liking the people. These things are exclusively for the TV news industry. The winning concept of friends is one of the most important skills of a job, obviously not popular, but my experience indicates it is true for most things. As a lesson on how to be successful, this movie is fantastic but it is fantastic Educational, yes, but it's not an uplifting end.
