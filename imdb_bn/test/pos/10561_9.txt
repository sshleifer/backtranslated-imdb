After watching the Velvet Tip by Sarah Water, I decided to look at FingerSmith, the letter was good as both performance, although Rachel Sterling was absent in adaptation of Finger's Myth. <br /> <br /> Overall the story line was good, twisting and unraveling characters was amazing! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a spin that looks better than Velvet Tipping, but it's pretty good. <br /> <br /> Everyone will recommend it!
