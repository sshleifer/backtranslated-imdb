During the IMDB Surfing I just forgot "Midnight Madness". Now, it's all coming back to me .... <br /> <br /> It was one of Nathan's first films (and Fox) and with sharp eyes congratulations to Kaplan (Hannary's TV "Alice"), Fidler ("Winnie The Poo "is the voice of the pirate in cartoon) and the blocker (son of Dan" Hos "Blocker from TV's" Bonanza "). <br /> <br /> But there are two standing in my mind from Furst ("Animal House") and superdude myself - Eddie Deezen. Furst played a badie at this time and one of the best scenes to ask his father, "Why can not you accept me?" Her father sees her fat, thick frame and gives easy, one-word feedback - "Yak!" <br /> <br /> And Disney ... Well, he has a show in himself. Later, like Jerry Lewis, he wades through small golf pond, kept the watermelon hug on his ear, and ended up reading for Magee Roswell for him. My Hero <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is usually the statue of the Element-80, after the college curfew, and the city-wide Scavner goes to Hunt to show that the best part of any campus department . : Jokes, sewage, rich children, feminists or groups of little formed <br /> <br /> Who will win? By taking care, before you create a techstone picture, you will find it much fun to see for the first time in the PG region of Disney Pictures. <br /> <br /> Seven stars You can catch "Midnight Madness" by any means! <br /> <br /> Long Legion!
