Recently I saw this interesting movie with Chinese / French film "2046" at the Dubai Film Festival. Both intelligent work were done in the same year (2004/2005). Both were the main characters residing in a "hotel". In both movies the hotel is a metaphor for exile. Deal with love between both a man and a woman. Both were wonderful music and riveting performances. How worrying is the case of treatment and how the two films are different! At the beginning of the film, one walks on foot and sees a woman and hit the lamp post in such a way. The audience's innocent smile originated in a volcano. But is that short film not an overview of the movie, which gives you 2 hours of entertainment? The film is an amazing mix of black comedy (for example, using stethoscope to listen to neighbors' conversations), the film has been created on Buster Keaton and Jacks Tate which was previously presented with the movie - Stochastic face that brings comedy from opposite to Robin Williams or hearty Danny Kaye equals Intelligent world When the transfer of money from the bank to the hotel otherwise the conversion of a sticky character makes it a memorable one. <br /> <br /> But the picture is not just a joke. Anti-Automation Statement (Cash counting and response to the bank staff in this statement, dummy working as a vulnerable warning to the fast-moving lady, referring to "Moulixics" reference as "company", etc.) The director proposes various load comedy viewers There are many cues that are Laugh, yes, but reflect it and enjoy more .. <br /> <br /> The power of the film is short, Stacko Script (by director Paul Sartintino), which provides comedy mixed with philosophy ("really annoying" "Dad died , But no one told him, "There is no bad luck - it's the disadvantage of the victims and the poor." Then the director gives you an interesting talk from the main character You are not going to sleep through this lecture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> "Truly annoying", the director has a great acting (Tony Sarsilo), good music, cute camera-work (Luca Bajiji), a beautiful, mysterious actress (Magnani, grand-daughter of great Anna) and powerful script. For the sweet sweet image to determine whether it was boring, it was, was not it?
