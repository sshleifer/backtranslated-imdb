Set in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, in this story, there is a great Cold War book or all the mystery of the film to try to smuggle Jason Roberts out of Hungary in Austria, Hungary as a multinational group of foreigners. However, three things make the story supplement, it creates a very good movie. <br /> <br /> First, actors use the actual language of their roles. Russian soldiers only speak Russian; Hungarians are only Hungarian; Germans are the only German, without a brief amount of story telling. Since Durbar Care is in English, he is only speaking in English, and, of course, Yule Brenner and some other English speakers needed for the story also speak English very strongly. As a result, the audience's listeners' sympathy became the maximum. Visitors share all confusion and suspicions of involvement in illegal crossing crossings that do not understand a spoken language around them. Very strong feelings are sparked in the audience, and despite the widespread use of foreign languages, visitors never lose a foothold to follow the movie. No subtitles needed. <br /> <br /> second. I was in Hungary in 1995, and I'm telling you, this movie is okay. Gypsy enhances dinner content from underground caves of the house where most of the steps in village scenes take place, the fact is unbelievable. I did not eat the original restaurant in the movie, I ate it twice. I thought that I actually went to the main street of the village. (In fact, this image was shot in Austria). <br /> <br /> The third, and most importantly, this movie releases the story by reviewing the magnetism between Deberah Carr and Eul Brenner (King and I later) and again in them. Oscars are nothing short of fair. Of course, Yule has already received an Oscar for playing that relationship, so the Academy was not going to give him another, but the picture had the qualities. Do not miss this one.
