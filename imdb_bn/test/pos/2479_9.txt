As far as the fake documentary goes (the ficentry?), This one is with the best! It is very realistic and that is what is the goal for it. Recent Talking Events (Guantanamo) This movie is even awesome, so you can say it was ahead of it's release in the 70's! <br /> <br /> No one can expect that there is no government! Looking for terrorists and just interviewing such people? Of course, everyone had the same view in interview (70 mentality): Generally politicians and screws of politics. Maybe that might not have been so cute ... but hey, do not forget: it's just a movie! ; O)
