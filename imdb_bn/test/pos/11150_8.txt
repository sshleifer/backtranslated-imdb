I am really surprised that this movie has only a rating of 6.4 ratings which I did this review. Although it's not just a great movie, I think it's one of the best of the movies in Dietrich and it's a shame that it's not being considered too much. I think for the reason that I liked this movie that the normal stupid dietit personality is not present as "Ãœber-vamp" and its role is actually to be done. I hated watching films only after the film after the film in the first days of his career, where he seemed more like a curiosity than a real woman. In the 1930s, she did not blame Diirch for the stupid films she made - she loved the audience and they made her famous. But here, he really showed that he could work. Finally, in Morocco, Blend, Venice and The Blue Angel looked at him in movies, who speculated he was very pleased to play a Gypsy! I was ready to hate the film because of the casting decision, but it worked - he was quite trustworthy and had a lot of fun! The film is primarily a car for Ray Milland and Marilyn Dierich - a secondary school for other supporting characters. Million pre-WWII is a wanted spy in Germany and in his attempt to flee, he is rather frustrated over the tempered only Gypsy (Diary), who immediately accepts him as the fulfillment of prophecy - in other words, his new boyfriend! Milland is quite relaxed but unwilling to travel in his wagon - even putting body paint and breaking him in his ear to see a Gypsy (seeing title title). Over time, she gradually realizes that under her very unexplained outdoor most women and romance gradually blooms. <br /> <br /> The image "charming" in a word A nice romance with a good level of comedy and fun - sort of you want that movie is still Hollywood. Also, please note the movie performance of "Jolton" as well. He was very magical in a very short period of time, and I liked his deep and beautiful voice. Finally, consider a tragic note. Although the film is set in Germany, there is no mention of the upcoming Gypsy Holocaust. During the war, throughout the German region, the Nazis destroyed a large number of GPCs, and so the end of the film ended.
