Falcon and Sanman are an extraordinary example of the 80s of the 80s. Other films of the decade lack substance, but this film is pure material. There is nothing stylish or fake or indispensable about it. It features two extraordinary performances: Timothy Hutton and Shan Pens respectively, at the age of Christopher and Dolton Lee. Hutton, Penn, and Tom Cruise were the first actors of the 1980s, who were looking at many big and good things (all played in 3 TAPS). If the popularity of the pen and the cruise increases, Houghton has often forgotten, and it is shameful. In fact, for the support of modern human rights in 1980, Hutton won the Oscars for the first 3, but I think his performance in this film is even more extraordinary. <br /> <br /> Revolt of war in his character Chris Boyce. A failed seminary school student, Chris has played love-hate relationship with his father, good character actor Pat Hingle. Where Chris quoted poetry, his father thought that he had forgotten for a long time, he was particularly strong. <br /> <br /> Chris is given a job in the Defense Department and his hatred towards US Govett and his foreign policy sells seemingly vain plans for the Soviet project. As a courier for the microfilm project project, he got his friend Dalton a hopper drug-dealing self-server. Chris is doing it on his faith, Dalton is doing it strictly for money. Soviet Liaison has played the role of David Suchet very well. Penn and Suchet have a real quirky chemistry and it's a kind of fun set of exchange between them. But, do not make any mistake, nothing more than this movie. It is a serious character study of depression, malaysia, paranoe and disbelief. <br /> <br /> Again, these leads make this movie. Whiten Brightly demonstrated different skills like Christmas, Chris, a skilled young man who was so successful. The pen, naturally, is an amazing characteristic of Dalton, who thinks it is a kind of harmful, and mostly, does not seem to work before that. The end of this true-based movie is very sadening on different levels. A really strong character research.
