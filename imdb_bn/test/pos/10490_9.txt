This is a secret story that lays out Kennedy's killing elements and successfully uses them to create a wonderful western story. <br /> <br /> The movie has a good music score, though it is too much depending on the title of the title repeating the theme. Giuliano Gemma and the rest are fantastic. This is more than normal spaghetti Western, which relies on stories rather than action and it succeeds because the story is wonderful. There is no action to say in this movie. There are lots, and it is very well made. This movie dragged you directly, and eventually kept you absorbed. You will always be amazed that in the documents that are after all. It contains some quoted commentary in American politics. <br /> <br /> This movie is the third place in the list of Spaghetti Western Managers Solaima and Kerbuchi, why in my opinion, Valerie, why.
