I have a 4yr old daughter, and before this movie she was about Disney Princess, she has seen this movie now and she can talk about Princess Janevivi and all her sisters. I definitely recommend this movie for all the young girls. This movie is the best one from Barbie collection. It shows all the good values ​​that a mother loves to encourage small girls. With great music and moving dance, it is trying to imitate my daughter and moves. Extra is also good, even how well your memory works. I would definitely say it would look similar to a kids and encouraged ups.
