This is the only Christopher guest film that competes with spinner tap and Princess Bride to entertain only the value of entertainment, but does not come in any way recognizable. The competition dogs dogs - and their owners are surrounded by competitive dogs venture into the world ... Okay, it's about a dog show. Owners really character, one of their dogs will be so attached. It really does all, but it makes it fun enough. <br /> <br /> You will not ever convince me that it would be interesting to have a Mac-U-mentary before a dog show that Levi and Wahira visited Larry Miller's house on TV where the scene ... but to make any suspected transformation Really all The spin-off was a non-stop hilarity, fun after the joke, when the best in show was a few more slogans (and by this I mean, that most of the time is not funny), but the big smile is bigger. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, in fact, the owner of a lost dog toy owner, owned by his tired Ed Begolly Junior, and probably the most exciting Gag in the film. What is amazing about this movie is how the authors were able to make a plot in some way, it was such a simple joke that it actually seemed that its direction was there. I think there is freedom to have such a plot. Everyone's role is well made here and the characters are rarely above-top. The reality that makes them feel cruel to outsiders makes it even more fun than the significant wind or unfinished Goughman. I actually encountered wierdos like this now and then. You like the staff of the guest, but you must own it.
