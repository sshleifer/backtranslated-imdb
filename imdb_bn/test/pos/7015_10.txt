So good, acting, cutting, direction can never be the best, but dance, moving, heat and passion in this movie are certainly the best (good ... ^^ for me ^^) It really is touching me, motivating me to dance. I even specifically registered on this site so that I can vote for it and I can contribute to my support for this movie. For this movie, when I saw it, it literally gave me a sense of meaning. I love it Jennifer Gray is so beautiful! Patrick is very sexy there !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The first thing I'll do tomorrow, the way to the university is to get it from the video store and buy it a copy, and it will be seen again until I can get old nr crickley and dance with this movie. Before I wanted to learn all the racing movie before! !!!!!!!!!!!!!
