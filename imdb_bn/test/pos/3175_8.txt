Haqqarah is the story of a great daily person to me, like somebody else you may know. Just trying to do it, right around my big shot corner. Then life's little temptation trembles, spoiler, stumbled again. How much you can take your love, and give it to someone who is not really bad, after all, only human I liked it, I was paying an extra money in the movie. The drums in the band shot, with the band, working in various walk shots, there was my green 66 'cervet motor party shot. Wonderful cast and crew, first rate people, down to earth movie Mothers Day was a luncheon with James Coburn, how wonderful a man, just as I knew him for many years, I will never forget him. My father spent the day with Slim Pixon and changed the story of the horse, the thigh was below the earth, loved the boys, we really missed them. Real people about real people, thanks Levi, Gardner, and Lenen making movies.
