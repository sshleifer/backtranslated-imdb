This movie was a modern day skyfish. It was on my toes. This movie is one of the rare epic films that wants to make you a sequel. I especially like Damian Chapa for his performance academy prize, which he donates blood for his performance. The only thing I did not like was because it was behind the scenes because its intensity was not shown, and I'd like to see a low-pitched scenario. But the movie was great and it is always in my best ten films. But the acting was fantastic, there was no bad scene in the movie, I liked it, Jennifer Tilly was perfect and as well as all cast. I did not see what anyone would like to do in this movie. This is a great one. Of course there must be a must see.
