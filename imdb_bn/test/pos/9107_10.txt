I have been waiting for this movie for so many years! The best part is to live up to my perspective! It must be seen for a firm D or true jack black fan. Looks good on the big screen, Jeb, KG and Lee! This is not a true story, but K care. D world's greatest band! Last week I had a soundtrack and I heard about non-stop. There was pure happiness for me and my husband to watch movies. We've met with Jack and Kyle with 2 different Stencios de Concert and watched them while traveling with Weiser. After the D game we left the concert. Someone can top their show! Long live long !!! : D
