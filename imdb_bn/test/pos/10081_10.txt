Is this a bad movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Given this, it is not "a room with a view" or "a scandal's list." If you wanted a movie like "A View View View" but you will not see Beach Father from Bond. But if you look for a good father in a bikini movie with a plot, then it is for you. This flick promises it and then distributes something. It's pure 100% teenage fun. <br /> <br /> There were many bags inside and outside the bikes. The movie was quite funny and was great to see. In this home video I had some of the most beautiful women I ever seen. <br /> <br /> Every high school child will see at least one bad movie like this. It's actually one of the most memorable movies I've ever seen. So unexpectedly, I say again ... if you are just going to watch "Baby Babini" movie, this is it.
