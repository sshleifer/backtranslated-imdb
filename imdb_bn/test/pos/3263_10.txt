If you enjoy movies like Pump Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, you're going to love two hands. It beat similar black humor and gives you entertainment through the whole movie. Like Phip Fiction, it is in non-case scenarios that characters enter and behave with them. Along with Gallipoli and Picnic in Hanging Rock, I saw it as one of the best Australian films. Before it grew big in the state's state, a young Heath also made Laser bigger. <br /> <br /> This is a terrible underlying film that I believe it is just as good as fiction and those greats. You have to see it!
