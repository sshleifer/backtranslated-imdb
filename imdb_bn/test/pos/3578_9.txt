I do not know what I expected. I only saw this on a Sunday in the rain on TV. From the beginning it grabbed me. Music and settings and characters were excellent. I did not hear any of the actors but they were all outstanding. A wonderful thriller <br /> <br /> Now that Ivy mentions other versions of this movie and the previous version, I will try to find out more in this great movie
