I like this comedy so much. Smith will not be slow. Always the best script and comedy that holds your smile and is involved in the plot is right towards the goal. You are watching an efficient comedian, who plays well in all its parts. One believes that he is playing. I liked him and Tommy Lee Jones among men. This comedy rate is right up with that movie. Humor is running fast, and Will Smith himself was sure as the black men were among them. Quickly intelligent, and capable of skillfully competing with everyone, but in a delicious way and with a significant significance. <br /> <br /> Smith thought his comedy routine is good. She was very funny fun. He had an allergic reaction to the part I was eating, and his mouth swelled, and he looked more like Sesias Clay after the war, he liked himself. Then, trying to bring Bendril's bottle back to its right in front of his head. I smiled laughing loudly. He knows how to laugh all of us
