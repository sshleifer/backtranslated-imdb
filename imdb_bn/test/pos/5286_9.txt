My husband dragged me into this picture because I did not want to see some of the animated cartoons. I was absolutely delighted by simple stories and amazing animations. In a digital world where the computer generator is created, it refreshes to see the fantastic, fantastic hand-painted animations. The world of socks and piano is a vivid fable that is covered with a little reality. I did not see the animation when I was a child and it is very good to see that it can endure and be successful. <br /> <br /> The English version was a fictional voice artist. The length of the movie was perfect, especially for children who have trouble getting into movies. Overall we have nowadays a delightful experience of the price of extremely expensive ticket prices.
