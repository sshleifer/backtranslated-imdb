There are not many movies that I would describe as perfect, but the rififf must certainly fit the bill. Before or after any other hijst film, it came closer. The plot is simple, but you engrosses. It does not stop to wonder how the film gripping absolutely when you see it absolutely. You care about all the characters, though they are bank robbery, because they are presented as people with all their problems and errors. Tony Lee Stefano's role is hard to imagine than any other actor except Gene Surrey. Everybody is told about the crew members what they are going to do with their money and finally go to Tony, his answer, and the expression in his face all the way. The 30-minute Haste genre is the most famous part of the film (and immediately) after the movie actually gets better. Director Jules Dasin knew what he was doing when he decided to not do any music in the hasst scene or the final time. The shotout, but instead of Tony's final ride on his luck inserted in a great climatic score. It seems that if American director Dasin was not blacklisted in Hollywood and was forced to work in France, then the best of the film would not have been made in such a way. It was certainly not as good if it had been created as an American film during that time. What was going through Dasin was terrible, but he earned his greatest work for the benefit of all of us. I'm just thinking of the upcoming Al Pascino Remake. Most of the rififf films have already borrowed from it in any other way. There is no reason to rebuild this great composition other than money. Leave alone classic!
