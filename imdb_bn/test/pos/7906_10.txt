It's really bad that nobody knows about this movie. I think if it gets a little spray and if it is not a very low budget, then I think the main film companies want to take it. I first saw this movie at the age of 11, and I thought it was great, but was so strong with the illegal length that Mitchell only kept his family together. It then inspired me and it amazes me now If you are lucky to find a copy of this movie then do not miss it!
