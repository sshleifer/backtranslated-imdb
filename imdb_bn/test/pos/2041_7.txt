<br /> <br /> Speaker in this review <br /> <br /> Long Kiss Goodnight is another major example of many modern film problems; It starts from a very interesting idea - a trained killer whose memory was deleted by restoring his own consciousness - and the initial setup is engaging, but it seems that the authors do not know very well where to go and the whole thing is closed is increasingly confusing and / Or the invisible way of going to taste something frustrating, promises to be very good Had been. Baddies is significantly ineffective, and even Jackson's comic Sidekick turn feels like something from its pre-pop-lance Fiction Day; It's like a hattlin, like the Catroth Island, every effort makes one to stir up his next wife. His character is up to the movie Seratam and this event makes you even more frustrated that they will not do anything better with it. <br /> <br /> But there is still something about this movie that sets me apart from the Hollywood film of Run of the Match, and only if it is kept on top of it. It's something very fine I can not quite do on my fingers; It's a boring, cold, dark, even sick side, a wonderful and unrealistic feeling, a harmful air, an average line that crushes in different ways. It has dark red photography and almost permanent night characters, it is in the dream of Samantha in front of the mirror, it is in its evil eyes and whenever she laughs about killing a man or when she declares how she will enjoy watching her kindness, listen to her daughter. Time has died, Mikey's car has returned to the wheel when he is taking out so much blood from the mouth, he rarely talks Maybe ... I do not know, it's an atmosphere, which I can not define which gives me a cripps (a bit) and that makes this movie weird for me.
