This is my favorite movie because it is so much that you do not see the first and many things that make you wonder "What did Kislovski mean or was it in my head?" For example - does the judge want to be God or any other person? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The beauty of the soul As it happens <br /> <br /> The Trinity is not really saying much more and it's nice to say that, as Valentine's Answer . . "Stay".
