This is a nice, short known movie. Tom Selle has done outstanding work with the film Clint Eastwood of Japan. I would like to see if this movie has come out of the DVD, some of the spots are clearly cut. Hiroku (Tom's love interest) has definitely cut some parts. It will be interesting to see more in Japan. Baseball sequences are the most realistic and far-off of any baseball movie, I'm sure most of the actors are current or eastern baseball players. I love loading this movie tapes at least once a year. After Tom became a bigger player, after having a hot bath with the top hipoko and the lack of hat tipping of the best scenes after an intense sex scene from Tom. Dennis Hesbert also did a great job, it is good to finally get some recognition in baseball (he was not in the Major League).
