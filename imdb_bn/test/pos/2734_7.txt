15 Park Avenue, well known as a New York address and film in Calcutta. However, the story is exposed, one understands a thin line that tries to guide the relationship between relationships, social causes and of course the world of schizophrenia. I would say that Aparna Sen is a director who has a lot to say and has so little time. No doubt he was directed to do a good movie. In the same way he understands that we are probably looking for our own '15 Park Avenue '. This is an integral search of each of us ... <br /> <br /> Shabana Ajmi is a treatment to see the powerhouse performance. The appearance of her screen brings lots of life to the scene. After a long time he was surprised to see such a strong work because I expected that it would be like Conna Sen's terrain. Shabana makes you like a big sister in the skin, who is running a whole show for a sad family, and at that time she almost forgot to save her life.

He and his Schizophrenic Nucleus formed 15 Park Avenue in the world. He has worked really hard for the character, but there is a time when he is not able to relate to the audience. The tragic accident in his life tries to sympathize with sympathy and it has only been partially successful. <br /> <br /> This film starts from the unique world of the most incompetent person, even today in the modern India, from the inequalities of women and trying to solve a few more times with a twisted relationship in a shattered family. . And I believe Aparna has been a bit successful. Fodder helplessness When he worked as a journalist in the rural Eastern Region, then really, all of our country gives nude images which we are proud of. <br /> <br /> I had uninterrupted thirsty feeling after I finished 15 Park Avenue. I wanted to poke me more emotionally from this movie. It is a commendable effort as a director without some hikks. Those who want to watch a different movie must definitely see something for the purpose.
