This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Davy / sir Sluice is done simultaneously: <br /> <br /> 1) She is tortured about her talent (eg, "I can control it; I can! I do not have to do it! It's good!" <br /> 2) Making friends To be dissatisfied, like <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "I want some more crackers. <br /> <br />" How's that? "<br /> <br />" Yes, the soup is very good. "<br /> <br /> 3) He is proud of his achievements (like" beautiful beautiful technique, huh? ") <br /> <br /> 4 ) A woman (for example, "You are so beautiful, why do not you like me?") And <br /> <br /> 5) Sometimes, too, very angry (for example, "You can not go away!" < <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Following the performance, went to the stratosphere, it is not surprising that this is not the best star's bright career to go on. I highly recommend this picture, amazon.com, everyone should own it. And there is a bowl of soup.
