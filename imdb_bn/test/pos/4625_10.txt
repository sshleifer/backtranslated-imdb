I was happy to see this brilliant movie in a preview screening in Sydney. Although it was a pleasure to see it. The joy is not the emotion with the rest of you as the credit roll. <br /> <br /> 2:37 A film that not only felt a scandal by young people but all of them. The main which is isolation. It's not just about filming final glancing scenes on a trip above others, but it's important to see it as a statistic. And from this, it is very important to understand what it represents to the audience and directly affected by it. <br /> <br /> 2:37 Not soft pictures but Mr Thaluri manages this issue with a deep pride and does not act as a credit to its message of any mortgage system. <br /> <br /> I do not believe that movies like 2:37 should be measured by votes for votes. Rather it should be recommended for those looking for people to visit them. <br /> <br /> A brilliant image of innocence is lost. And still a master stroke as an unexpected talent. <br /> <br /> Do not miss.
