When you run Nami Matusushima (Meiko Kazi), female scorpion, and a dangerous group of lip (.. with their rogue head piercing and its equally annoying lady) to the prostitution ring with an iron fist, it is hell to give it. . There is no anger like Scorpio in hell, and a determined detective, Gondo (Mikiyo Narita), wants to revenge for his hand to cut his hand, to do whatever it takes. (And anyone who fears it, knows whose name Can catch). Nami Hooker found a colleague of Yuki (Yayyi Watnabe) who gave him a temporary shelter. Eki is a distraught brother who suffered from brain injury during a job, and must take care of him (.. an annoying revelation, about infamy, he also provides his sexual needs!). He, in fact, locked him in a room while working on the street! Meanwhile, after finding his own place, Nami is targeted by a innocent neighbor (.. he acts as a sewer), and he threatens to turn him into authority. (A policeman fleeing a policeman, who ran away from a subway police) if he did not provide sexual benefit to her. His wife drowned a tea kettle of warm water over the whole body and body, causing death, and the prostitution group lost a key member of their organization to look for loan repayments. At that time Katesu (Reisen Lee), the lover of the pump and believed to be responsible for the loss of his loyal member, is considered to be his ex-prison, Scorpio. Castro defeats him with a drug injected, leaving him in a bird's cage (!), Kasu is dressed in his prison. Ultimately, angry anger burns a prostitute outside her cell, seeing a long-term pregnancy, died of blood in the blood. Held a scalpel with his hand (from the operation room), letting go out of the cage, hunt every dynasty responsible for the killer's death. The series of Scalpel killer provides Gondo with the chance to catch him, and he will trap him in the underground siege under the city, but can he catch or kill him? Especially if Uchi comes for his help <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, believe that there was no chain binding director, Sunita Itoto, or his filmmaker, because the women's Drunken Scoring: Best Stable is yet another distorted, humiliated, and extremely entertaining series fierce entry. Fantastic way to keep all the madness in order to keep the fine production value and decorated with a visible stylistic talent, it removes you properly (.. or he has made me) playable drama which is always available when Nami Matusushima is on the screen. When you have a chronic opening credit sequence where your anti-heroin is being wiped in the crowded city streets, it is a man's shoulder to flip through, and the audience will know what they are for! The cruel sub-plot is only intertwined (.. and it is shot in a soft-core method with which the deaf, the deaf, slowly looking forward to his silent, cold sister!), And the sequence of the entire abortion is difficult to sit. However, the angle of abortion, as annoying, inspires Nami's revenge. Despite the incomplete nature of Namia and despite her criminal nature, you would rather see these slaves accept the opposite side. Attractive angles with the detective Gondo, as well. Gondo is willing to break the rules, and he became attracted to anyone that stands in his way to captive his corpses. Eventually, his fate, Nimi's other enemy, visited the isolated cells, when he showed that, making such films so ridiculous that they do so much encapulation, so much so amusing is so entertaining. Scalpel killings are a montage of scampagas throwing blades flowing in different areas, where the Nami criminal scenes erase the entire group in memory of the fallen victims in very unfortunate situations. Although the film is primarily a comic book adventure, there is a sadness that flows and some characters come in without error. I imagine that many will move away from the curiosity of how the feminist colonial scoring: Best Stability (especially, how to flee time and time captures, accomplish its goals of revenge, return those who have wronged him), but I It has been seen that, as a cartoon for violent acts, like the next 80 films, and enjoyed it for it. As always, this film has some beautiful Asian actresses and some colorful heavy heavy features. Miko Kazi is almost always reserved / quiet, yet his enemies become cold with violent intentions, in exactly the form (.. in multiple ways) and Reisen Lee, his cross-leader, as a hostile opponent, goes away with the image of the ability of psychological torture Completely humiliatingly humiliating enmity. (When both are in prison, the way Nami's way of torture is sweet). There is nothing to do with the plot in my favorite scene, but it is so incredibly wrong, it discovers the dog's disorganized broken hands, walks on the road and finally finds the place to chew it!
