Every day I would say the main time of my kids or the day I was "eaten" in all sorts of SF novels. In the twenty-six and sevens, when the TV was not a major period of time killer, in the mid-seventies, I saw a movie on TV, I think it was ARD and I was surprised. <br /> <br /> Nowadays I see my kids playing sms or something like this and I think that I think that we have released the fascinated movie. I would be very grateful if I could buy this movie in DVD. But in vain I almost tried to get an indication of almost all of the efforts. MATRIX can not be touched by the quality of this movie and the industry. And until now we did not have a glue if we were a superior reality or just a couple simulation models. Perhaps we can know after our death ...
