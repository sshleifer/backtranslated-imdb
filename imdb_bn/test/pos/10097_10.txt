Let me just say - I love the terrible trend that everybody can see that I can get my hands regardless of (except for the low quality B-movie fears I could make) and recently became a big fan of the eastern horror. I do not know the Korean horror is hit by the Japanese penguin (or the American ring), or even six senses and others, at the top of my list, and the hits of hits like Hong Kong, which are widely acclaimed. Ear of the day 'The Eye' <br /> <br /> Previously 'The Ring' appeared as my favorite horror, but it seems that I like the beauty of the story of 'two children' - the story is extraordinary and open to interpret, so allow repeat viewing Although you would like to see this again and again because the film is shot so well ... This story is probably the best serial date dated. I am frightened to see that the acting is very authentic from the whole cast and there is the possibility of giving your opinion on anything in the ring - I was unable to close my eyes, the points which were covered in the screen. <br /> <br /> I was also happy that Saddo did not come from the ring later - such feelings are unpleasant and the story of two sisters leaves you uncomfortable, but hopefully you will not go to sleep but you will be happy That you saw something special. But keep in mind that if you do not understand the plot after the first look, then more than the suggestion to see it again. I did not have time for it personally after the delay, so I saw the scenes on DVDs, there was a good set up in my head for some time and after showing the net, it felt that it was crying with a widely agreed explanation. And satisfaction from a puzzle solution like that is wonderful. All of this - a masterfully designed horror horrible horror 'level' remake (it has been bought by Dreamwork) Korean content and everyone is advised to catch it in the theater or DVDs when it can ... you are the best in it Find out. Unfortunately, due to such a movie, there is no other way to talk about the story except for the story, so I have done what I have done - the Creator - do not know one thing except the 'story of two sisters'! And be ready for some that are unlikely to be combined for some time.
