The biopic year of 2004 was a real event with four photographs, with the degree of critical achievement of real people. In the beginning of 2005, it was among four films for the Oscars competition (Kinsi, The Aviator, Hotel Ruwana, and Roy), to appear in Ray's big-winner acting performance film Jamie Foxx. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How the winner Fox was made, while the other two played relatively vague compliments, Ray Charles still was making music until his death in 2004, and there was no such soul, at least one song Did not know Charles' was written. It helped that Jamie Fox had grown up very well on the film - a little weak like himself and would often not leave it as a TV biopic - and its screenplay was described as violent. He has been appointed neutral for the appointment of a fine person, and once Fox frees all the stops after drunken heroin's addiction crisis, and real true true true true true true true real ideas. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Like Aviator, f. to establish Taylor Hackford It was said that judgment was in vague life, when one of his own ghosts entered the product and success was black and he was brought in huge amounts while he was successful. Among the women, only the mother of Sharon Warren Roy to bring real life. Har is a tough part because he is on a monumental screen with young actor Young Roy, but his mouth and body language intimacy, especially at this moment, to leave his maternity leave to move from house to house. This kind of emotions of emotion, standing there and moving your blind boy into the house and force him to compulsorize for this illogical awakening. There was a beautiful performance, and one that should be accepted. <br /> <br /> RAY is a fantastic counter-featured music. Anyone who knows R & B will enjoy the early recordings of Ray's radio hits, which will then bring him to the next popular music, and Jamie Fox steals the show because he runs the songs as Ray. That movie will still survive when the film is less than a very strong biologist. However, if I used the song "Sing for Me" in the last article of their last adult contemporary hit 1993, it would be closed. Finally, it is Ray Charles, an artist who has made a great dedication to his art.
