<br /> <br /> I was dismissed as lightweight pop nonsense after the release of this film. That was a mistake. <br /> <br /> After viewing the repetition and seeing a documentary about making darts dancing, the depth of this film will certainly increase its appeal. <br /> <br /> Dart Dancing is a movie about change. The increasing nature of the relationship between families, changes in the world's perspective during their arrival etc. The story was held in the last weeks of the last summer of American people's innocence in August 1963. Many personal changes experienced by the characters reflect many changes in American society, which will be characterized by Kennedy killings and Vietnam. <br /> <br /> The female film singer enjoyed this movie and has repeated the journey in the movie room. It is the most successful dance movie in the world. As a man I found a romantic couple in a very simple panic swiss, Jennifer Gray is very easy to accept. It will be animated for most romantic dramas and it can make it very displeasing by most male critics. <br /> <br /> The film's soundtrack # 1 status was found before the film was released. <br /> <br /> The child's child wakes up at the midpoint of the image and asks Baba, "Is there anything wrong?" <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> Father's father, an infected family member, tried to do something secret. He tells his wife to go back to sleep. However, as one can resist, the change is restless. Duty Dancing is the story of a person awake at the final moment of our country's last sleep in solitude.
