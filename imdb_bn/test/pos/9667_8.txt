Romania is a little known from the movie Romanesque. A director from Romania did not come out of the attention of the international crowd, as in other countries of eastern Europe Hungary, Sijololovacia or some other countries of Yugoslavia were successful. Lucian Pintilli, a great director of the Romanian film, who had run a great movie "Rockonstytes" 35 years ago - quickly came out of the circuit through communist censorship. Even after this film, until the fall of Communist rule in 1989, a reference to the Roman film, Pintili was not allowed to be created independently in Romania. <br /> <br /> Firia reminds me of Pintili's picture 35 years ago. The title means 'The Rage' and I can not imagine why the distributors preferred to translate it differently. It's about a lost generation. Pintili's classic is that when the temple is largely under repression and lies of communal rule, then there should be confronting the rise of the young sub-culture here, and ethical slurs which unanimously rule out the rules. The last is sad and painful. <br /> <br /> The movie is well guided, and the performances are good. Without too much complexity, it is also successful in creating a mental link between characters and visitors. Some would say that some situations seem like '8 miles' or 'Fast and the Furious' - but look at the date of production! This image was created at the same time, if Western colleagues were not before. If it is truly the director of Dan Muniten's first film, such as IMDB, it is an outstanding debut. In any case, a good movie can compete and sell well in the western market. <br /> <br /> There is hope for a new generation of Romanian movies that it will be replaced with some fate and good distribution, International Cinema Scenery. <br /> <br /> 8/10 on my personal scale
