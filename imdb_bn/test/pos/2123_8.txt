This is a new Barbie movie. The graphics were really good. They think the movie is partly realistic. I used to do ballet and this movie wants me to continue. This movie was like a Cinderella movie but it is a little different. The 12 princess's father is very ill. His cousin wants him to be poisoned by a throne. Girls thank the story of their dead mother a secret magical land. Protect their father and society over them. With the help of their handsome prince This is a fun movie and I and my friends were fun to see it. We enjoyed this and enjoyed Indian conversations. The music is very beautiful and the movie made even bigger. It was a great classic orchestra. The voice was great and the letters were adoreably sweet and tricky. I enjoyed this movie for her family. All I want to see it again.
