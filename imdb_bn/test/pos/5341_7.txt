I'm going to the movie, I was a little cautious. I have always had a bit of iffy about claymation movies. I've always enjoyed the decent animated movie, but the claymation was always different to me. But this one surprised me. Wallace and Groot are extremely loving characters, and it's a great story with jokes for all ages. There are cute bands / furts for kids and fine jokes, but jokes for our older people on young children's head. Very clear claymation and when the story was in holes, it kept my interest started to end. <br /> <br /> It is very rare to find this day as pure and unrestrained humor, this movie was more refreshing. Wallace and Gromit are doing their normal things, destroying the humanity, which destroys human crop of vegetables. But at this time they found themselves fighting with some form of a fierce rabbit that could not put them under human traps and even tabs. Great smile and a great hour and fun half. I highly recommend this movie without expressing myself in Wallace and Gromit. <br /> <br /> I do not have this rate of 7 and more because it is still a family movie and not my child. I've enjoyed it, but if I was watching it with some little beef and my wife, it would be at least a 9 sure! Give it a kick!
