"Crossfire" seems like an undisclosed masterpiece - it is well played and nicely painted, but thinly written and very small. As it is, the movie's silent (its genes in 1947) and social commentary (as well as in the conventional times) were cast for good measurement. Today is considered to be one of the first two Hollywood movies to deal with semesterism, and it is considered to be much better than similar themes with "Gentlemen's Agreement" (no meaningful achievement). But his real point is that the WWII soldiers were like trained killers, they were like being transformed into civilian life. (For more majesty, try "the best years of our life.") In the first few frames of the film a man was beaten to death. We do not see his attacker. The film is about to investigate the assassination, which is quite straightforward, but it takes some unnecessary smuggling, such as one of the main suspects, a sad soldier, a strange pump acting by Paul Kelly, There is also half a civics lecture by film, which slows down the crawl of action and the last one is suitable for a police show. But otherwise it's a pretty decent mystery. Still, it may be a great silent Director Edward Demitr has given some hints about the main novel - not homosexuality, anti-semitism - as in the brain Mitra spoke to strange people repeatedly in his photo of Mitchi. And cast is excellent. Robert Ryan makes for a very credible cretin, and even becomes a little sympathetic to his final scene, as the child boss as Peter Lorre "M." He deserves Oscar, but lost in the Edmund Gaini (you can not beat Santa Claus) that year. Robert Mitchell is a soldier in a murderer's friend as a friend. Mitum was a great actor or great star? Someone else can understand it, but his sleeping eyes and half smiles have seen the sunshine work very well because they mean that nobody else knows his character. (And he did.) And Robert Young, the assassination of the murderer, he was surprisingly ridiculous, even after reaching the civil rights campaign through the photo, he dropped his usual frivolous qualifications. There is no question that Bougert or Tracy was brilliant in the role, but none of them was in Rico in 1947, so you have to deal with Dr. Welby. Yet, young enough is good that you want someone to "tell the father well" instead of putting him in a detective drama, which he hated and tried to drink and suicide. People were better than terrorism and crisis.
