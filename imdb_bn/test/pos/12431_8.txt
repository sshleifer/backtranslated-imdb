A beautiful woman, a retreat, a mad giant truck, a super sweet monster truck, a road kill zombie brother and 2 friends ... an ass retentive, too sensitive nerd and another foul-mouthed, teenage slogan. Combine them all with the Zappers Cripps, Texas Chainsaw Genocide and the Road Trip Dash, and you've got Monster Man. There is a sunny horror / comedy waiting that sets out to "say something". This is a simple, straight forward smile festival. Neutral and well-made, this horror / comedy is in his heart, a friend is flick. Given some ridiculous and sick pieces set in this picture. I highly recommend this for fans looking to be hospitable.
