I read the book and saw the movie today. The story is so strong that almost any script or playplay will judge it. So there is not much there. However, it is still a beautiful movie because it thinks and feels like a book. It is not seen to see a documentary on a failed state and to feel oppressed towards people suffering under a tyrannical rule, but the story of the other continent, across all other continents, is not like the publisher. Choosing Amir's ugliness, his crime, his conflict, and finally his way to salvation can be a story for us. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Twenty years of rebellious political situation by the Afghans. The vibrant, careless childhood represents Kabul before the Russian invasion and reflects what the Taliban have done in cities destroyed. <br /> <br /> The child actor is all about 'thumb ups'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> People's emotions and feelings are a multi-colored fabric Over. This film is not meant to stimulate anti-Soviet and anti-Taliban feelings, but not to the feeling of justice for human existence. <br /> <br /> I read some reviews related to the site and should admit that I do not see the point in the review reviews that summarize the story of the remote audience and the technical details about the amazing cinematography or something similar. At least for this movie, it should try to attach it instead of materially judging it.
