The first film in Vegas Festival and the most challenging in Vegas. This is not a movie for everyone. Most pictures that were followed are used in predictive classic horror formulas to predict predictable stories. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She was going to burst her cap. It was very nice to hear his interpretation after the film. There was such a great sense of humor about this role. <br /> <br /> I was very happy that I did not have many ideas, because the movie was a lot of surprise. The story was fun and profane and unusual. I was happy to see the love of many. Most importantly, it was a weird edge. In contrast to many of the following movies and trying to use similar classic horror styles, it is a movie that uses it for a purpose. <br /> <br /> There were many films in the Fangori Festival with big budget, but everyone dares to be different from this.
