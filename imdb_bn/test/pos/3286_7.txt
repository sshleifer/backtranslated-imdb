Brian Foster, a new inventor of Wesley Uro, who invented a new crime bomb protection device in the form of a robot dog, titled "CHOOMPS" (it stands for the Canine Home Protection System). CHOOMPS, who was modeled after Brian's real dog Rascal, can only do something; He got improved speed, energy, x-vision, and the like. It's just the thing to save his boss Rolph Norton's (Conrad Bain) security agency. Naturally, a thin rival, Gibbs (Jim Bacchus) wants to the edge so that he tries to get his hands secretly. <br /> <br /> This is such a thing which is very difficult to resist. It has received a lot of slopstick (Chuck McCann and red buttons make a great pair of mushrooms), an objectionable attitude, an attractive cast and enough fun enough to entertain. Energetic disco-style music gets repeated but stupid catchy; The story is straightforward, and dogs themselves absolutely adorable. In a thoroughly seamless but sided disconnected touch, there is another dog in the movie ("Monster") whose thoughts we really hear; Her conversation and the actor both voices are invaluable. In fact, he even uses some mild prejudice and his last words are positively ending the film on the pregnant final note. <br /> <br /> Eurek and the cute Valerie Bertini are very favorite young people, and their veteran supporting plays are all elements they can with Gastro. Larry Bishop, Hermione Badlly, Robert K. Luis and Regis Tomomi co-star. <br /> <br /> A rare theatrical live-action initiative for the Hana and Barbara cartoon creations. ('Flintones' 'scuba-do', 'smarf', etc.), "Champs" are unacceptable silly things. I know it leaves me with a smile on my face. <br /> <br /> 7/10
