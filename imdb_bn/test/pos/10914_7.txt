Hollywood films have been treated like leprosy since the 1930s. To condemn homosexuality, film industry only reflects its day-to-day repressive society that forms the ideology. For example, in the auto priminyera meladrama 196 "advisor and Consent", the actor Don mureke was appointed as a Queer congressman, who committed suicide rather than accept alternative lifestyles. From "Advice and Consent", gay movie characters have covered many grounds. The 1997 film "In and Out" (** **** ** 1/2 in), hereksojyaksiyala actor Kevin Kline starred as gay, lesbian teacher, who came out of the closet on her wedding day. যদিও প্রথমবারের রক্ষণশীল হলিউড নির্ধারিত হয়েছিল যে "পরামর্শ এবং সম্মতি" তে কংগ্রেসীয় কুইয়ার আত্মহত্যা করতে হয়েছিল, আজকের উদার হলিউড নির্দেশ করে যে সমকামী ইংরেজি শিক্ষককে গণনা করার পরিবর্তে আলিঙ্গন করা উচিত। <br /> <br /> Basically, "In and Out" promotes good citizenship in a politically correct comedy girl. Director Frank Oge and painter Scott Rudnik agree with honesty as the best principle because honesty always ensures happiness. High school teacher Howard brackets ( "The Big Chill" and Kevin Kainan) only from the closet to come out after the happy, just as his once fat-but-now-thin tight Emily (Joan kusyaka) only happy with his food can taste . Finally, the film firmly says that when gay societies work with equal integrity and shoulders themselves, then only rich society will accept. The happy gay tabloid reporter, directed by direct actor Tom Selek, has effectively dramatized this open-ended commentary. <br /> <br /> Radclerk's lightweight script embraces the real life events that happened in the Oscars, when Tom Hans paid homage to the school teacher. "In and Out" Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon), a Brad Pitt-style Bibo-type actor, won Oscars for the disguise of great foot soldiers. Drake honored his mentor Howard Braket during his recognition speech. Do not hesitate to stand there, Cameron clearly expresses that Howard has become gay! Suspicious, Paraná, and Green Leaf as horror media, Indiana placed on the sleeping city. (When a number of high school English teacher's sexuality will not spark such a large media concerns?), The journalists Peter malayaya ( "High Road to China" and Tom seleka) there, and he wants Howard to exclusive single week. Howard, however, wants to do anything with witch hunting media, especially pesky Peter Malloy. Howard denies Drake's gay complaint to everyone, including her drunk and her mother. Malloy lingers because he smokes a scoops. The revelation has turned the green leaves upside down. High School Principal Tom Holwell (Bob Newhart) is nervous in relation to all media coverage. Halwal warns that Howard is not coming to her marriage, she must give him a pink slip. Meanwhile, he married Peter Howard, who will be with Emily at the last moment of his marriage and he will be there to record the results of the camera. <br /> <br /> Resorts the Howard Richards on audio tapes about Machu males. He struggles to reform himself But Howard's efforts are in vain. Crime swells inside him. And then Peter Maloy, who torn him to be clear about his homosexuality. Finally, at the altar of God, Howard broke down. Of course, Emily Montgomery was cleared by the bride's confession by the bride's Howard. In the forecast, School shoots Howard, but he looks for a graduation. Drake also shows, and shocks the defense of the bracts. The school did not exclude Howard from his job, but he gave his teacher-year award to someone else. Appeals Harrard to the Prime Minister and Howard receives the social support of society. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest errors in the compiled script of the roudis is the word "self". By radonic gray or straight-quality, a character has become very characteristic to be true. Howard Brackett looms as a saint more than a sinner He helped one student get admission to college, and he tracked the team coach. How many times do you hear an English teacher? Everyone in her high school adores Howard. There is not an average bone in his body. Furthermore, Rudnic and Oz want to believe that anyone else in the Green Leaf is not gay. Where is Howard's gay friend? Are they afraid of coming to her defense? No, "In and Out" gay audiences are not strictly targeted. Oz, whose screen credits "Roton skaundrilasa Dirty" and "house sitter", and as well as tights radanike a politically correct comedy results have been included. "In and Out" is not a gay recruitment movie. Filmmakers do not show any interest to encourage Howard or Peter Malloy to choose a lesbian lifestyle. Instead, Oz and Rudnik are only interested in slipping into the thin premises: Is gay gay? They belong to the Northern Response Community It's meat. Finally, when Howard acknowledges that, despite the differences, Howard, the filmmakers offer films for how to show a conservative, despite the fact that Norman Rockwell can take it as a city. <br /> <br /> <br /> "Probably when a tabloid locker locks a lip on Malloy Howard." The straightforward people who kiss each other in the movie about the homosexual identity crisis are frustrated, headlong-clash compared to clean-face kisses. Kine and Selel wash their face together in what appears to be such as the controversial 1994 British film "Priest," "In and Out" Thak but appears as an engaging but laborious part of social promotion, including process messages. If "Allen" is not equivalent to TV, "In and Out" is probably going to TV as a new sitikom. Not more, but how to be a decent person in the last days of the 20th century. What is "in and out" about a tolerant sexual intolerance Comedy queers and steers about cheers and jeers are its equal opportunities.
