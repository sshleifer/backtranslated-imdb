I love this picture. Black with great characters "Sandalot" to be excellent as baby corrie feldman When the kids frighten the storm, it is pure Adrenaline. Inside the bank, it becomes like the "flyer of the fiji" condition where they turn each other. Justin Walker wonders from "Clueless" I saw this at "Showtime" while surfing the channel. It was an unexpected. James Rima is also quite good here as the small city sheriff. The Taylor Nicholas I love to "Barcelona" do a great job as a federal agent too. I recommend this film for any fan of bank robbery movie with a lot of good character. I was surprised to discover that Roger Krrmann was the producer of this film because it is not a B movie.
