Good job In this way how I will describe this animated skuboo-adventure. It's the best of animated scuba movies ever shown. I liked the story. I think it has some depth. The movie is also good paced.it is not annoying for a minute. It has an interesting group of characters (of course, without squabbi and chorus and gang) plus, the film was really a real explosion. I've had a lot of fun watching this. I like Scottish music very well. It was very interesting and infectious. Naturally, we know that Scooby and Gam will solve the mystery, but it's still getting fun. Animation is also good for this movie. If they love 3D Animation Scooby Adventure, then we just have to wait and see. For me, Scooby-Doo and Loch Ness demon 7/10
