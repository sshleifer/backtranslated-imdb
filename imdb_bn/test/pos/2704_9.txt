While watching this movie, I wonder how media perception can express a celebrity opinion. Karen Carpenter was a liberal, but incredible young girl, whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother Richard to brighten the charts with excellent songs. Like most celebrities of today, they were often criticized about their music, their appearance, style etc. He had a huge influence on Karen, who had a serious effect on his eating and tried to lose weight, which eventually led to his death. The heart was feeling that the film was not initially something I thought about watching. But starting to see it, then I was hooked. If Tina Turner does the same story, then this film enlightens you and lets you see in the life of young actors. The acting was fantastic and even after about 20 years of its creation, directional and dialogue were still entertaining. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone who has not seen it yet. It is amazingly accurate and mentally charged.
