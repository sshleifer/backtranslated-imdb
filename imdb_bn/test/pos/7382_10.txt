At a time in predictable movies, which boosts violence, cheap romance and melodrama, it's astonishingly surprising to find a weird movie. The plot itself is compulsory, and the actors are excellent, especially Alan Rickman. If you want to see a movie that does not provide all the answers before asking questions, but a movie that will surprise you (good or bad), Dark Harber for you. And if you do not believe, Alan Rickman's performance is very valuable ... believe me, especially to the end ...
