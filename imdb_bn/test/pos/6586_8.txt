Finland for Estoninans sometimes feels like a land of dreams. A land where many people want to go and work there or start a business. Find love, start a new life, etc. ... but Acu Louhimies has done this brilliant piece that shows that everything in Finland is not exactly the same. Finland can be the only money mother (The Bed Land) than any other country. It shows that people can be as unfortunate in their lives than elsewhere. That's sometimes nothing good. This movie looks neatly why Finland is one of the top suicide countries. Living in the north is not easy. Cold climate change us I was more attracted to Finnish movies and it is a very good one. The acting is great as well. Jasper Pääkkönnen became one of the top Finnish stars. Beware of sex scenes (if you have a small child) and a little sadness that can come in the movie later! 8/10
