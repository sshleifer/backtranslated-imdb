This is the best movie I've ever seen. At the age of 12, I was late and ran across the cinema. It was in the American Channel, Gilbert Godfrey's Up All Night. I will not forget At that time my friends and I were actually struggling with various issues, some sexual. You know 12 is a very rough and weird age. Looks like you're a little girl, and you're a young girl. This movie really helped answer many questions for me. That I have a girl now 12. This movie has been searching for several years. If it comes out of the DVD, then I will buy it first. It would be difficult for any parent to recommend it to their child to reach a very difficult and difficult age.
