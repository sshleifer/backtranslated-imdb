There are those with Ryan Atkinson's Mr. Bin Lorel and Hardy, Butter Keaton, Marx Brothers and other comedies. I have not seen people laughing so loudly and have literally come out of their chairs when I present them with their videos and now through DVDs to Mr. Bint. My brother will not forget him for the first time. He was for a visit and I asked him if he ever saw Mr. bin? "Who?" He said. So I took out my video and showed him that Mr Bien was in the church and started moving away from there. My brother smiled so hard that he got out of the chair and started laughing so hard. He became Mr Bin's instant fan. We all know how happy these episodes are, but fun is shared with others. Smile smile smiling people! Favorite episodes are: Queen, hotel room visit, late for dentist appointment, Christmas episode (a classic ... plus kids love it!) And New Year party Rowan Atkinson is a comic genius!
