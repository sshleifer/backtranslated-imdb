Flashback has been said, in 1989, the film opened with Charlie awarding the role of the community's defeat. My heart needs to be drowned in thinking that it is more frightened, a bit annoying and long life. I was wrong, because this little scene was so close that the film was ever boring. <br /> <br /> This picture is full of recreational and fun set-up and cracking dialogue in most unexpected places. The scene after the awards ceremony is that some naked women and a guy tries to invest in a TV program, Charlie in a Hot Tub. Another rather funny scene is about 3 quarters of the film, Charlie, instead Sector Secretary, Philip Simmur Hoffman CIA Man and whiskey bottle. As for the conversation, what is it for a line, "says Senator, he teaches us to type but can not teach us to increase bullying." Okay, school-pillow I know but the film has a great line. <br /> <br /> Philip Simmur Hoffman steals his scenes naturally to act. Hendes is okay but I do not have any surprises Julia Roberts <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Entertainment, amuses informs all of the equally measurable measurements.
