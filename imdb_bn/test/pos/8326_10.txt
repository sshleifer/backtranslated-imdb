When Jurassic Park first came out, it was revolutionary in filming and special effects. For the first time people went to a cool dinosaur movie and made sure that they made the original dinosaur alive. However, some of the dinosaurs were almost perfect examples to fit the idea of ​​how genuine animals (T. Reyx, Brachiosaurus, Trichotopus etc) could change the opinion of the film (Velosirapter, Deloosophosaurus), and this film appeared on a tropical island where they did not have their natural habitat . . Walking with dinosaurs shows the original animals in their original habitats millions of years ago. This is great in the amount of detailed and scientific information used. Now we can give an intense quarterly desert, the entire group of Dipkocos, an Ecuadorian, an oceanic monster demon, a potter's eye-sight, a rich dinosaur in the South Pole, two Torsosaurs lock horns. The Rex Rattle camera and comet impacts that make their debris spell. These dinosaurs walk, walk, eat, fight, reproduce, hunt and swim. But the series has revealed other creatures that they have shared with the world, two episodes focused primarily on two different types of animals, flying parsons, and marine reptiles living below the waves. All the more unique look when the position and scenery are spectacular and a CGI Dino gets onto the screen. And for CGI and Animitronics, the movement of CGI dinosaurs looks perfectly and completely naturally, the color is bright and vibrant and the crooner has taken cautious steps to ensure that CG animals communicate with their environment to any living creature. Splash in water, brush with bush, dust applied and shade cast on the ground. It is admitted that CGs are not perfect with some brief instances where animals can see very computational but the rest of the time seems to be exciting. Dolls are poor in some areas, but this is the first time scenes with Scenarios, especially the moment of the scene. Description by Kenneth Branagh as well as providing important bits of information and drama at the same time as well. But in reality, true happiness is performed by living dinosaurs in that year, and the snodont (mammal / reptile hybrid) dogs, soproplets (baby dynepococcus) and T. Rex really looks at some interesting moments with the kids (yes even T.Ex can be tricky) and then reminds us that nature can be cruel and there is more to it.
