In Dublin, the insurgent rebel Rory O'ya (James MacAye) went to Curgrimora's residential house for the disabled, affecting the lives of the residents. Ray was able to understand Michael Connolly (Steven Robertson)'s unexplained speech, who had taken refuge in the shelter of his distinguished father because of his cerebral palace many years ago, and became a close friend. Rory is determined to move Michael from a craftsman to an apartment in Dublin, and they hire the best Siobhan (Romola Garai) for their help. Living together with Rory, Michael faces a new world, friendship, love and freedom and learning to live by yourself. <br /> <br /> "I'm dancing underwear" is a wonderful story of friendship and freedom in a very beautiful story. The performance of Steven Robertson and James McAyay was extraordinary and I was not nominated for the Oscars with extraordinary performances. Ramla Garaio is a top-notch performance and extremely beautiful and sexy. The touch of the screenplay, sometimes empty and without exception, and the direction of the Damien O'Donnell is very sensitive. Unfortunately the DVD is a shameful, ridiculous, Brazilian title, giving the wrong idea to this great movie. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Os Melhores is Nosas Bidas" ("The Best Year of Our Life")
