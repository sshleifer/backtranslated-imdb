It does not surprise me that this short (91 minute) B / W movie, which was produced 50 years ago in the Soviet Union "Otelel" or "Tha", was so much loved and appreciated in it. Movie lovers on the world. It is magnificent and beautifully painted. Something seems like their view was ahead ahead of their time. Sergey Uroussky's camera work and creative discoveries are included in textbooks and have been widely imitated. The film tells of running and imagined stories of love running through a ruthless war, but a young girl is alive forever in memory. It is also a memory, memory, the ability to live, when there is nothing to live there; It's about forgiveness, and hope. The film (absolutely great) Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival and Tetiana Samolov was selected as a special prize for playing Veronica in Kayse, this young girl happily liked the movie with love for the best people in the world. His loved one who went in front of him, after separation from his family, married to his family members on a bomb ride and he does not love anyone he never loved, and he wants that he never existed, he turns himself into a shade, he dies inside. . It is an impressive and heartfelt one for the long journey of the Liberation War, finally to recognize the death of her loved ones and learn how to live with her, and it does not just indulge any audience. <br /> <br /> For me, the film is very personal and dear because I was born and grew up in the city where its characters lived and were very happy at the beginning. I went to the same street, square and bridges on the Moscow River. Each family of the former Soviet Union has lost at least one, but during WWII time or horse horses, frequent or frequent deaths of multiple family members in the camp or family, and my family is no exception. My mother and grandmother knew the horrors of war and did not cure pain and loss of films and books. "Crane flying" speaks clearly and honestly with me and touches me very deeply. This is a wonderful creation of filmmaking but it is a part of my life - my background, my memories, and my past
