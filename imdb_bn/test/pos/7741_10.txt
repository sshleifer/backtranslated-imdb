I love this movie and all its aspects, as a comedy and managed as a drama. Acting is extraordinary, played by a full star cast who plays perfectly in high society New York. The scenery is incredible, completely breathtaking. I like the story too: A successful NYC architect who is passing through the medieval crisis overwhelms his cheating wife and wants to go with her daughter to go to a Greek island to stay secret with her. <br /> <br /> I Just enough about this movie can not express my love affair. "Show me magic".
