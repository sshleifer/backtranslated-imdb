I was 19 or 20 years old and lived in Salt Lake City, Utah and I still remember the new dome theater, called on September 21. Leabac chairs that hold down and a new sound system, big screen and huge open space. Screen and packed theater. We felt all the excitement of a new preview screening. That's Dada's grandfather ... I still hear open music ringing trumpet and simbell crashes. I like the interplay of characters and photo vistas. I know there was some problem with Peter Finch and Louve and Sally Lip-Scin but hey, it was a good feeling, go to feel better about the movie! What I feel is that they see the cut version of the meaning of how to overcome its meaningful heart, and then it's called a flow. I saw the cut version and I lost the view of the viewer in preview version. Yes, I'm a bit surprised by Peter's efforts to love music, but you know that I did not see it when I was leaving the theater. When they left us, they surveyed that I apologize for any comment that may change in the original. I liked it and still see it when I hear my LP music. Most of my family hear me singing soundtracks and I can use movie musicals in our games of "what movie it does". I'm willing to get a director's cut in DVD. It is available in VHS but it is not fairly the same. I especially like his utterance, a completely serious Lord of the ring style commentary about struggle and win. Picky people should leave alone enough alone. Get it back!
