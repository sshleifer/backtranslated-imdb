At the same time in history, a bright animated piece that was far away from anything in the liberation war of mass production. The effect of this work on Team Burton's "Christmas Nightmare" is very clear. Only imagine how Stewart slaves on each well-nicely detailed frame of this beautiful color. <br /> <br /> There are very few animated movies in this career. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> This will be something new - but I do not really have anything else to say!
