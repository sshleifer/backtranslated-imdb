When I started watching this movie I had no expectations. I was surprised! This is a great, beautiful movie, which will give your mind a good job! It's not easy. If you only enjoy the style of Police Academy, non-brain movies, this is not for you. The Cell is a deep, complex film, with many new ideas including cube, silence of the lambs and lonemoir man. Wonderful, rolled atmosphere, good acting and one of the best films I've seen for a long time! Opening Manmohan, and you will love it!
