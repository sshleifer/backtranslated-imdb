The lab speaks to Desmond, and if someone is confused about her past (for example, how did she end up in the same hospital), then you should know that Libby was disappointed in the season, the character would be season 3 more and we would have to answer the answers to her . <br /> <br /> BTW, Great episode It was really a great cliffhanger and some interesting questions ... what happened to Eko and lock what happened to the four thumbs and statues? <br /> <br /> I can not wait till the season 3, just lost the rules !!! I hope all answerless questions will be answered. They explained me why the plane actually crashed. Desmond does not manage to type in the time when he does not. 4 8 15 16 23 42
