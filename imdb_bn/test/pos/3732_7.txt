WTF !! Is any of his books / movies happy last? The notebook was good ... but relaxed, enough with the already depressed end. I said that he wrote in a realistic way that people work in real life. It is understood ... but sometimes it seems nice to see those who have encouraged their entire life to spend their mediating time only - finally find the true meaning of happiness and survive it for the rest of the day. . Do we really know what happens in real life? Can we live a movie for a moment (a half hour) at the end of a happy note - which gives us hope for our own future ??? <br /> <br /> Yeah. I know. But in reality, I think we need to promote movies that are endearing like this one carefully. "Be careful: no happy ending."
