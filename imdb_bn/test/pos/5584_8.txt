I've seen this movie as a child and I'm eager to see it again. Is it alive? I'm releasing the 1980 version completely as being discounted. I'm sure there are so many things needed to save these movies. It's so unfortunate to discover a lost gem discovery after it's gone. Young people today do not realize the hallucinator quality and the effect of their life that a young person who is seen in a young age can have a future. This image "blue legoon" influenced me How many of us wanted to find myself in a place in the modern world to remove fear and chaos. It was an idyllic story of a boy and girl castaway on a summer island. There are difficulties to be sure but eventually they fall in love and have a baby. Life should be so simple and beautiful.
