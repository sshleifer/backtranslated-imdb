Well documented film focusing on two Sudanese refugees living in the US This is a non-fiction twist with the basic fish from the story of your water. It was interesting to see how Peter and Santino lived before coming to America and how they arrived here (in Houston, Texas) to see how they were adapted. They were expected of a heaven but they are much harder to be able to cope with it in good states. They go to some optimistic skeptics from optimistic idealists. Wherever they go they meet bureaucratic papers which most citizens can grant. They are black compared to African-Americans and they do not feel acceptable for that reason. One of the "Lost Boys" moves to Houston, Kansas, where she feels a little better, but still less than the ideal. There are people who try to help them and try to hurt them in this movie. Not shown, but it has been said, who guns and loots their heads, they have negative comments on the Lost Age that "all black people in America are not good". It seems very interesting that the terrorists had reached Houston a month before the World Trade Center attack, in August 2001. I was hoping to see their response to this tragedy but it is not mentioned. Still, everything is a really good documentary with no details. Nobody really needs it. "Lost Boys" is a fine work on events around them without any help, thank you very much.
