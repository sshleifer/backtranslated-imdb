This game is not cartoon graphics, much violence and really small levels - so why are people saying it's so bright? Because it always keeps your attention, it attracts you and refuses to let you go! If you try the hour flight recorder and try for hours, the defenders will try to work in the house without alerting the army! When the dimensions are small then it is short - as long as you get the letters, where to find helicopters and trying to do more! And you'll have all the fun when you're doing it! Rent a good rental!
