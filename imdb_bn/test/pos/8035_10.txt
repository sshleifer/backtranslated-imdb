This is probably one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. It has the effect, but these bullet-flying, good boys - bad guys, van dams - stallone action, but fast, realistic and nervous activity, it's a plot, until the end of the movie you do not know why it will end, it has its characters , Adrian Quinn, Donald Sutherland, and Ben Kingsley are perfect, and it's mysterious, this film is about you Ure will not let go. <br /> <br /> Although there are a few letters, my attention was not difficult to keep my attention, and it is fundamental to the story (too much Tom Clancy-hard, but simple and raw) and realistic <br /> <br /> < br /> If you are in a movie with a good story, some steps and great acting, watch it and I promise, you will not go away until it's over. It's too late.
