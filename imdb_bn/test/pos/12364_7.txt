Victor Szstrom was the master of this movie, acted in, operated it, and even wrote a screenplay! That's pretty amazing. Today, some people have no idea who was unarmed, as one of Bagman's most acclaimed films, one can be known to the Bergman fans of England. <br /> <br /> As far as the film goes away, it is a very mixed bag. On one hand, you have to respect it because in 1921 this is a very good movie. The idea of ​​Grim Ripper is quite fantastic, sitting with a dead person to discuss his dead life. Also, the special effects of Phantom Carriage are strong and technically it's a well-made movie. On the other hand, it is a wonderful date and promotional film - than being able to be seen in Sunday school, you expect something that is honest instead of doing good for good. Plus, some story material does not just have the knowledge. Instead of coming off or coming off as well, the deceased Salvation Army activist feels like a sap - a very sad and confusing sap. Why is he "in love" with this guy? <br /> <br /> I recommend that if you are silent (like me), always see it. However, if you are not a silent fan, this movie can not do anything to convince you that this style film is bright because this story is very mladramatic and dated.
