This film started as College T'A'Alk, but after the gang rape, a biker gang running a van with the main character was quite ugly. It's a pretty good pace, and James van Patten makes a fantastic job of censoring off this Canon tax writing. I saw this first movie in Parkway Drive-In in Toronto. The original feature was "Alfalt City" and "Young Warriors". Among the 2 movies "Young Warriors" was much more entertaining and memorable. If you are a fan of sleeping, then there will be a great addition to these collections of violent movies.
