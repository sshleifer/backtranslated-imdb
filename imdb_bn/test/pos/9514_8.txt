Last year I got an advertisement for Japan sync in Japan magazine, and I was surprised to see this movie trailer. Then I thought that a few years ago I saw the English translation of Sawko Kamatus novel. I got it, and it was quite good, as well as quietly realistic. In Japan, I heard the news about the earthquake, the horror of the reader. <br /> <br /> Now, I read the book, and saw the 2006 film version (the first movie was published in 1973). And you know what? I thought the movie was good, even if there are big changes in the film from the novel (which can be understood). The story is simple - Japan will be drowned in a year due to a major tectonic shipping. Strong attempts to exile as many people as possible as possible due to heavy earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis. A scientist has made a plan that can stop the country from dipping and preserving the residue of landslides, but can it be implemented timely? In 2007 I saw Japan Sins in Otakon and had some problems with me - it was going on for a long time, and the moments of some characters were a little unexpected - I still fly. The whole intricate concept of a whole nation drowning in the ocean became terribly realistic, and any of the best of these impacts I've ever seen, any of Hollywood's challenges. The film does not make any choice with the original characters, it does not make up for some closing credits. <br /> <br /> I am really surprised by some negative comments about this movie. Opinion difference, I guess. Personally, I've enjoyed it. And I've read the original book.
