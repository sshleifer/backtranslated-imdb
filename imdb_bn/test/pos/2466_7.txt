Link to James Dean? In a small plan, we see Emilio Estevez is involved in a teddy bear (Remember the first scene of Reyi's "Revolt against Controversy"). Also, the main contradiction is Esteve v. Shane, the father against the son, such as "Eden's Eastern". The soldier came home and someone was able to speak with him even his sister (a psychology student, what a laugh). Mother, a crude matron (a great kathy betts), submerged in Nuganti, she does not realize that her values ​​(religion, family) have become something of the past, especially someone like her son has betrayed innocentness. Dad, an unreasonable man under his wife's hammer, though he tried hard to play macho, wanted to make his life mediated. So he protected his "honor" by compelling his son to do the duties. Estevez's hatred for his father's explosion in the scene is very intense. Actor-director Lee uses as Strasberg's student, internally, gives an intermediate performance, and so is his tenfold increase in anger by the final explosion.
