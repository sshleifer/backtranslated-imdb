I have studied great managers like Kurosawa, Lian, Phulasi, Lenji, Doodoto, Pekinpah, Kubrick for many years and they are very much appreciated. My favorite movie is once a time in America. <br /> <br /> I recently became a fan of D'Amato, and when he was not a terrible master, his film was extreme whether it was soft core, <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > I said, the terrible master, he is not Phalki or Bawa, but he was Yautica Master, no other director could shoot her like lover movies, she also made a film outside of these films Did not try <br /> <br /> Long Live Joe d'Amto-Post and Erotica Master!
