I am not transparent because I am present on this film, but I like it and I am only in about six minutes and it is almost not the most interesting part of it. The film tries to create a sweetheart film, an honest and impressive account of a highly independent independent group of filmmakers. It is also patched well with a rash expectation and an account of fallen Horoscopes also performed in the interview. Different people are all attractive and a person is not really too much. Also, the interviews are shot in a beautiful fascinating fashion to make it apparently appealing. Of course a suitable film. I hope it gets around.
