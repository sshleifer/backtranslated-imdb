Someone asked why it was canceled. I told you why "reality" earns money. The exhibition was canceled so that they could replace it with the "reality" show, it could defeat almost half of NBC, me and my high school, about 1000 people have pledged to boycott NBC until they return this show. In my area (I did not know about other places) but they had a fantastic thing going on in the Saifai channel where the Saifi Channel would show the last week's episode 7:00 and then show the new episode of NBC Week. It was great at 8:00 because it gave you a little refresh about what happened in the last episode. I was very angry when I came to know that the program was canceled and they were leaving them only at the top of the church!
