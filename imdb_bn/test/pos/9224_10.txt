People talk about how horrible the script was and how awesome the animation was, but Rainbow Bright and Star Stilhar really kept an eye on the children, the Japanese anim. You see Anime today but it has been done in the same style and it is very popular. I do not think this movie can be seen by adults. Just as I do not think it ever wanted to be serious. I love those movies that seem to hate me about this movie. Rainbow Brite is one of the best cartoon characters ever made in my opinion. He is smart She is funny She cares about enviorment He cared for his friends. This movie can teach young kids so much. My younger brother even loved this movie. I told that this movie was a lot when I was young. When I came out of the DVD I bought it. This is a great kids movie. So if it is not perfect, then if you keep an eye on it, then nothing is really perfect.
