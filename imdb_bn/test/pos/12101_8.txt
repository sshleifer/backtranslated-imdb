Believing I believe once I got to know the depth of my passion for this city named Istanbul. Because of being known as a city of cultural mosaics, Fit Akin has contributed to the music through the music of the music mosaics. My ascendant, the highest measure of the film, in my opinion, Mujenein Senar (Turkish music diva), in his younger years when he was 86 years old and poured rakhi glass in the air. One drop, which is a traditional work of Rocky culture. He's just wonderful. At the end of his song, with his mysterious and meaningful appearance, Sajjan Axu (a Turkish pop singer), which gives the title Turkish title to this movie, the scene is not less than Climax. At least but at least, Istanbul's wonderful scenery can leave you away if you feel nostalgic. Be careful!
