Luxurious cinematography from Sergei Urusevsky helps make this work a stunning piece. Early scenes are like someone who is leafy with some master photographer's album and started publishing the story, we moved away with illustrated images and beautiful looks. There are quite a few complete sequences that are all good shots but simply breathtaking. Without 'spoiling' it is difficult to describe but during an air attack a very intense scene is visible and the woman is left intrigued as to leave behind and whine her boyfriend's brother sirens and burst the windows. The other one superpposes a cutting shot in a swirling stairs and trees tops and even develops in a fantasy sequence. The highest order made of Soviet film.
