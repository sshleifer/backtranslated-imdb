Read this: <br /> <br /> Boys 'n' Hood is a scenic-by-scene, complete rif-off of this movie. <br /> <br /> Two friends at Hood, intellectual pursuits and another athlete. Friends, an athlete who is involved with wrong people and dies. (The athlete should just be 'welcome back, quota' to Washington.) <br /> <br /> It makes me crazy that people do not know it. Whenever I go to the video store, my mind is hit hard and Boyz n 'Hood is in the' Drama 'section and Kule Hai is in comedy. This is a embarrassing disrespect. This movie is both fun and more dramatic than John Ringtones' Rip-Off. At least one singlen used to say that his picture was praised by Quuli Hai, but he never said a word. Boys 2 However, their hit record was named after this movie.
