Fuller's (the war veteran of himself) first-hand work of the average quality, but in the most contradictory aspects of Germany's subsequent life, he hit correctly. The main character began on April 45th as CCT, 157th, and 45th DV, which in the movie really ends the Munich War. (Last month the same unit fought extensively in Aspenburg and then liberated part of the Dachau facility). Unauthorized film may seem confusing by flopping in showing good and bad to the German people. But anyone who is there or at least can read well, should know that most of the film that is featured in 45-47 is what happened in Germany. I only understood the only mistake I had: descending on the Ramegen Bridge in a ship in Rhine, he commented that he had crossed over. But its unit really crossed the south-southwestern Worms - in Germany.
