The BBC's Blue Planet is simply jaw dropping. I think when I say that it's sometimes one of the most beautiful sequences in the movie. There is nothing left in the confusing depth of some unreasonable and easy Padma bridge near the known creatures and on the surface of the ocean. Some people overwhelming for 8 hours may want to see the highlights brought to you as a "Deep Blue" movie, but I sincerely recommend you leave the series. I do not think it will be frustrating and if your children find Pixar Nimo enjoying the aquatic ecosystem, I'm sure they will love it too. I just wish all the televisions had this amusement.
