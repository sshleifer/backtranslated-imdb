This Australian film has done a great job to illustrate a bunch of small crows on the King Cross in Sydney in 1999. This plot focuses on the misery of a young man who endangered life after serving his future master. Very well played by Bath Laser and Brian Brown. This plot is fairly credible with some interesting moments of a scene, which circulates around a bank. The central theme of the story is quite well done up to the setting of various themes. Such as When a criminal is searching bullets for his gun. I personally dislike the inefficient violence in the film, and in this case the film does not mind it. It has been trying and successful in showing us the direction of the people of Baddies such as Brian Brown. The rest of the cast is OK, I'm okay with no real stand-out. Good luck to succeed in making a believable movie was very good. This is a great film that plays the role of White Laser and makes a stupid mistake for acting and acting and short-term happiness, which makes a great movie, does not think that he is worthless and does not realize that the terrible people are waiting for a mistake. pounce Director Gregor Jordan is worth mentioning. My book rating - 7 (10).
