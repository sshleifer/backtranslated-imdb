Great Film Most gratuitous gimmicks like most Hollywood films Everything supports the mystery of the plot. B & W makes it feel like a basic, non-freel. In short, it was the vintage of cinematography and simplicity of cast. <br /> <br /> works as an interesting contrasts in Memento. Both widely used manipulation and subterfuge characters. In that sense, both of them reminded me of "men's company", it is highly recommendable. One difference between the two pictures of Nawalan is that Memento was a bit easier to follow me, B and W's scenes continued with continuous functional progress as well as in color. I did not follow the truth that followed, where the scene seems to be shown at random. If you have a choice between VCR and DVD, then I would highly recommend the DVD, since it gives you the option to watch the second movie in the movie, not by Scrabble (though not the Wise), presented by Nalan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No cast was famous . They were characters, not big names in the name of the actor who came with other people who developed the film. <br /> <br /> If something similar in the plot is to me, I think it's like a reconstruction of the Memento follow, but like the great audience, like Edward Barnes, he made one in Mold - and Brothers Macmullan - mostly with the same cast.
