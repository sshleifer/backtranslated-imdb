It is quite good, all things are considered. Anyone should be concerned about the opposite sex (i.e. all of us!). The trailer does not remove any plots for any reason. <br /> <br /> The proof is unreasonable, so it looks nice to see that it does not take itself seriously. Some of the BBC Children's section have decided to make a film for adults. This is not a bad thing. <br /> <br /> 7/10
