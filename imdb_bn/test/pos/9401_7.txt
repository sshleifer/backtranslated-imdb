Recently I hired Twister, a movie that I watched on TV several years ago, and it's been good; I saw myself laughing so loud and weird like these people, until finally I took them seriously. It's like Wudi Gazpacho (well, I think it's like) because it's a little bit of movie made for a distinct audience, it's a delicious taste: You need to be connected to its outstanding wavelength. Production prices can be called impressively cheap and motion and atmosphere take some time to stabilize but the film has "look", especially some nice shots which contrast the dry plane of the ground, the palace interior: even Michael Almereyda had a good eye. We will not be able to live in the summer with Sodapapa Magazine Eugene Cleveland (Harry Dean Stanton) and his family (two adult children, a grandson and a domestic worker). Everyone in this movie is amazing (especially Sujey Amis and Crispin Glover as the untitled talented siblings Maureen and Howdy), their roles are so easy to live when you've just bought the weird steadiness, in any way, the tornado is alive and apparently unable to be happy, these people are lucky, and Still do not know what to do with their fate. There are some really cool scenes: Eugene suddenly encounters with her son with her son, the TV host girlfriend Virginia (an acidous part of Loose Chiles), who digs her gold! William S. Take a goal practice in Barrows Barney and tell a story about a mysterious gym; Marion's lover Chris himself proved himself on the table with an ankle heel of ankle; Howdy, Violet, Maureen and Chris are looking at the desert images on the most social TVs (in lightweight summer dresses, a red blazer and black leather rock 'lol' gear) in the future (the photo was done by Bill Viela, who is not in the last round of the nine-inch Nell Backdrop video installation was done). Predictive spell like Crespen Glover Howard: As always, he remains completely in character. Howdy has done a cult in its suffering and brightness; She is trying to live up to her red velvet suit, like Cancer's Oscar Wilde. She is gripping an electric guitar with a lot of laughing loudly, wearing a black colored outfit, entering the house, even simple things like driving or pouring the soup mentioned above from Blender Pachter, it's being fun. If you like his work you like it.
