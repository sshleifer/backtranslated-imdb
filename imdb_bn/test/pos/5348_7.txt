Wallace, an inventor who likes cheese, and his smart dog, Gomit, is always helping Wallace with his problems, Wallace, and Groomit in the Wair-Robit, from similar producers of similar animations and 'Chicken Run' They are trying to keep everyone from rabbits away from vegetables, because their city has an annual Giant V Vegetable Competition The. But when Wallace discovered that he wanted to save the rabbit from the plant, he would be cursed. Before watching this movie, I did not know that these two characters were already existent and were famous. I love the grass, and I think it's a great dog that he's already seen. <br /> <br /> "Wallace and the Gromit - Botella Dosage Vegetais" - Brazil
