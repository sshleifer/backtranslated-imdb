When I first saw this movie, I thought it was a weird movie. But I know that when the director always creates a movie, then he has his purpose. So I decided to visit it once more. The second time I saw it that Albert Puyin was very talented and an original filmmaker. At the beginning, the audience was told that this film was only after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. But for the 1950s, their designs and carts were designed with designs. They had plutonium which I think is a symbol for future trade. I think it means that the real time of the movie is not specific. Music is producing a long music video, which is a part of the actual story of the song, especially for articles and articles. <br /> <br /> Albert Puyin is using red and blue back-color he is seen as the symbol of communism (red) and capitalism and Western world (blue). Anyone can notice in the Ice-T, his name is Mao (Communism) and when he focuses the red-colored red. American police acting Burt Reynolds, always pictured with blue back-color. Mao and his gang hanging club also have red color. The rails are pendling in six red and blue colors. <br /> <br /> At the beginning Mao was a white white dog, I think, control the ball. Mao was a dog at the beginning, but eventually the police took her away. The symbol, I suppose, the collapse of communalism and the replacement of capitalist thinking from the western world of Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> I think crazy six very well-made movies Albert Puyin has created a science-action / worker film with a political depth. This is a different, but a special film about the collapse of Eastern Europe's communalism. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing another spectacular film by Albert Puy.
