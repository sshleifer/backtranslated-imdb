In 1929, director Walt Disney and Animator We Weaver changed the face of the animation with the release of the first installment of their "Silly Symphonies" series, "The Schlitten Dance". Wizards and Disney collaborate with Disney's "Ligh-o-Gram" cartoon series in the early 2020's; However, their friendship tolerates a fatal injury when Wizards accepts a proposal for leaving Disney and a contestant to start his own animation studio. It was the birth of celebrity productions, where Weisars continued her style and technique (and where she had created the flip flip character). Although his work was of the same high quality, it was not really popular and by 1936 the studio was closed. Later that year, Weisars was hired by Columbia Pictures, and Wwerks decided to return to this time, to return to his old skeleton, in this color, for another dance. <br /> <br /> In 1937, "Sculpton Felix" was originally released, 1929 by a remake classic "The Scleton Dance", the film gave him fame and fate. Like that small film, it was set up in a abandoned graveyard, where at night, the night Rajraj started playing as alive. The hobby groups have formed an orchestra and started to play a happy tune, which begins to rise from their showcase, show ready to start. Now, making bone-making musicians is not easy, because some orchestras have problems in their body parts, but the band runs a good show and another group of sculptures starts to dance. A lovely couple of them are facing the same problem that the orchestra is troubled: The loose body is difficult to dance with. Everything ends with dawn, and when the sun rises again, the skulls run towards their graves. <br /> <br /> "Ub Varkes is itself guided and animated", Schlatten Felix "faithfully" Schlatten Dance "years ago, although there was one important difference: Weaver's technicolor made the whole film. Brilliant toons are to make Weaver more attractive visual film. And after the departure of Disney, practice allows you to use a lot of new techniques, before it's deep and dynamic It also has a much better effect than "The Schlatten Dance", though it does not mean that it is a good film. For beginners, the film was identical with Disney, in which only The difference was music (afterwards) and the effect of color. It is beautiful, there is no doubt about it, but it is definitely However, it is a feeling of frustrating notion alone. (Lastly, Weasvers is a wonderful way to run it), however, the musical tunes created by Joe DiNet for the film are quite unusual and Karl W. Stunning's "charming dancing" lacks charming elegance and curiosity. In other words, Dante's tune is effective and appropriate for the theme, but it is easy to forget quickly, the unique personality of the Stunning Song which makes it unforgettable. It is a musical film, it is very important, and so the musical instrument brings down the shameless work of Ivrique's animation. Personally, I think "Skeleton Freelix" will be remembered with a good musical instrument, "Scalletton's dance is still not like groundbreaking, despite it still a fun movie. <br /> <br /> It is a matter of sadness that after leaving Disney Most of Weaver's work has forgotten due to its poor success, but it should definitely be said that if Wizards Disney or Flush Although the lack of popularity was lacking in popularity, the company's films were probably the unfortunate event that allowed Disney's music to fail from Disney's failure for the first time, despite its flaws, "Skeleton Freelix" is very funny and visually exciting. , Although in fact most original and fresh movies (it's cinnamon Ra "skaletana Dance," but it can not be thinking about the viewing time), it certainly reminds us that, uibharera skuletaguli still disappointed us and inspire us to live here. <br /> <br /> 8/10
