Hercules The Avenger is the best single entry in muscle style that I can remember. Critics complain about it - this is a cut and paste of two previous Harculas films, it adds new elements to create something new - this cut and paste system is a sword-and-shoes movie that resolves central problems. The middle third is mostly scary with most of the films - usually a sad love story or pink political conspiracy or both (love for the Queen Harkuliz and falls in love with her bad brothers plots etc). It's often hard to hold. Exciting end to see Harvulis, The Avenger Sources, which stripped the shit from the movies, and instead described a Hercules's masked person rather than pushing it into force, rather quickly. (It should be noted that this episode acts as a distant but intense critical comment on the rise of Italian fascism.) It is a true match between a real Harcullus and its perversior match with a fine final raceline. <br /> <br /> On a narrow focus, I can add more additions that more edits have improved different views borrowed from other movies. The rebel scene is much better than it is for my money to appear here in Hercules and Capitive Women, because it has several letters and their plots are strengthened due to the reduction of complexity. The monsters, the wonderful underworld atmosphere, literally (from the literal sense) from Mario Bava, destroys a whole city, and the beautiful faces of the gown expression are beautiful. Since some people do not expect to compete with these seven samurai or even compete with the Magnificent Seven - it seems a bit of a favorite to take a film loan from other movies.
