Hair is one of my favorite movies all the time. Even though I was not part of my generation, I saw this movie 9 times and I can not get enough of understanding, emotion, beauty and good messages of love. This movie is against the Vietnam War and shows how people should be free from color, source, religion and class. I love the character of burger and woof and I think that in 70, I have already seen among the most beautiful places in Central Park. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When the moon was in the seventh house and Mercury When planets are bound to Mars, peace will direct the planets and love will manage stars <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Aquarius is a virgin! Virgin! <br /> <br /> Understanding the burden and understanding of sympathy and compassion and the false dreams or the Golden Dreams of decision-making are the mysterious crystals and the true freedom of the mind! Kumar! <br /> <br /> I am surprised to see that the director of this movie is the same director of Amedius. I just love both movies!
