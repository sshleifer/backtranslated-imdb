Following the preceding episode of Steel Age, Cyberman's Rise, which was exceptional in some cases, lacked others. RotC had some positive elements, the most important of Tennant's doctor's excellent illustration. In fact, this author, Tom Baker's doctor's shadow, with his subconscious acids (when Mickey Turdis holds the button on time, closes time), still comes with his own existence, as he gives the event coalesce around him as superiority to La McCoy's Doctor. It seems a little annoying to see some critics and fans I've read, a young actor who portrayed a person who can now be over 1000 years old, but I disagree. The tenant's doctor really "tolerates the weight of the earth on his shoulder" as he mentioned in this episode, and one can see it in his almost kissed character, when ultimately he ultimately encounters the Lumik / Cyber ​​Controller. His world-fatigue, eye-rolling attitude of "other people's frustration" attitude, especially after the excellent inconsistent class of Exelston, explains the Vita ** character, the people of action compared to the fresh face-faced pseudo-dofas of Tenant. After the end of the tenant's best moment, he is restoring Tardes as soon as he resumes Tardis with Bark-Esquien Greene of Tarsik. Here we start to feel the feeling for this new doctor, a character that is divided into 13 different individuals from the average person's individual personality; Some inconsistent, something more preferred than others, yet the whole part is composed. This aside, these two episodes were passable, but weak. The idea of ​​reviving the cyberman is very welcome, and they look fantastic, but parallel globe is a plot involving the plot where this action takes place does not seem right. The metaphor of the fact that humanity relies on technology and the need to serve them like a doctor, it can be easily placed in the contemporary world or at its locations. Some other weak spot, as the others mentioned, the doctors and coaches leave the spot as easily as possible. The death of the Tires component, the relatively endless array of Sony's screwdriver (my wife smiled when they used to burn it with rope; she rarely saw it, so I had to explain it to traditionally used as a plot device from where it was Find out the characters that do not need any escape! There was Gue, especially Mickey, who really needed her due, and some supporter cast.Lummy was unclear, since she needed, her voice even heard the word of Cyberman-Esquiera. Though the score was terrible, with the volume of music often swamping out the scene. Overall, I see the rise of cyberman more entertaining, although the second half was passable. We were unwilling to develop what we knew Many of the plays were frustrating, but the proposal was frustrating, many possibilities escaped, there was no improvement in supporting cast and my opinion was not adequate. This new show is outstanding, and Davis is taking it in a good direction, but the dialogue (out of the doctor) Needed, as Mikeby explains the dismissals, which were pure ham.
