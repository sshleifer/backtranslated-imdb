Two years after the successful 'Biman', Jim Abraham and Jerry and David Zucker created this amazing sitcom, who played Leslie Nilssen as a plain detective detective 'Frank Drebin'. Ashton also had the 'Captain Ed Hawken', Ed Williams 'Ted Olson' and William Duval as 'Johnny the Shoe Shine Boy'. 'Police Squad!' Background playing featured unashamedly corny joke and cute visual gags. Each episode ends with a Mike Fridge frame so that the frames are completely fixed. One of the best 'fridge frames' sequences, a cup of coffee pours in a still standing cup, which flows the cup! Guest stars are killed in the opening title, one of which is being stolen by George Stanford Brown! Despite positive reviews and many critical acclaim, 'Squad!' Before the cancellation, it lasts for six episodes. This does not mean that in the trilogy of the film 'Naked Guns' Shona was transferred to the big screen for the first time in the last five years.
