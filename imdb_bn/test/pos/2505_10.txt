It was one of the best films of the year with Kate Capso in 1999, with a small city and an all-star cast about love letter. First off, scenery is beautiful, and anyone who sees this movie and does not want to go to this place is crazy! For Cast, Capo is stunning as an actress, who has made the role of the mentor roller-coaster impressive. Tom Evertt Scott is beautiful as the "author" of the note throughout the film, and the delightful Allen DeGeneres is funny! Bleet Danar and actress are both very bizarre in book stores. Although it was unsuccessful, the film was great because it was both good and sweet and romantic. 10/10
