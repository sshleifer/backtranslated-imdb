Apparently this movie was based on a true story. Although I'm not sure how accurate it is, though. But it really reminds me that when someone has seen this news, it's amazing how it does not affect me. Of course, I think it's terrible, but I'm not careful. I moved on. It seems that the killing is now trivial. What does this river's edge show? Nobody really does not care about this girl and her death, even think of the killer. Then what is the point? <br /> <br /> The killer John of this story, and for a large number of films he was hiding with another murderer called Fake, starring Dennis Hooper. Fake is older, and you can see the generational gap. He said that he liked the girl he killed. When he asked John that she killed her, she only answered, "She was right." The movie seems to offer only a solution: Life is more important than death. The life of a character is saved, the man gets the second possibility, and is killed in a hopeless case. <br /> <br /> acting is really good. After watching this movie, I can only conclude that the Crispin Glover is a brilliant actor, or a terrible actor. I still have no idea. Although he was my main reason to watch this movie. But the best performance is clearly given by Dennis Hooper. <br /> <br /> While the fashion is really 80 and although sometimes the current issues are mentioned, still the river floor seems relevant today as before. <Br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10
