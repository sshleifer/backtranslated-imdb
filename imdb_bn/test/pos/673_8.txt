I specifically enjoyed the review of this movie's deli and agreed that Howard is not just a "damaged" character. Howard "set up" ruthlessly by the script, but there is no evidence that his previous employer is indeed dead or if he is killed. Howard does not know and we do not even know. Terrorist and confused she saw the woman lying there and she said. However, he is not really threatening Helen Gordon, how angry he would be. In fact, he has reacted terribly to Helen's ironic spelling and he has added a scissor ... then he started his tie-up and found Helen to be reassured almost unhappy "I'm tired now." I think. Going home. "Actually, he does not think he is a psychopath, a sick puppy, of course, but not a psychopath. <br /> <br /> Howard's problem is that he does not have any real men. He wanted to, but his mental condition denied him a place in the army. He is uniquely foolish and isolated: no wife, no daughter, no house (again, at least as far as And, she works for a woman - "My specialty of the floor." Hellen's nephew brutally removed this pride from her seriousness and said that she wants a man with a real man, even though she is firmly drawn to Helen. However, he passes a strong sex, unable or unwilling to do more than he fears. He is a super-powerful - can not fight, can work No, love can not. <br /> <br /> Helen is fairly scared, but she tries to connect with her but she does not respond normally (ie the way out of the comfort zone given by her husband's pink memorial memorial) Finding out, he presses all Howard's buttons by telling him to lie in his escape attempt. <br /> <br /> Both characters, trapped, trapped by fear, nervous, anger and memory, deserve sympathy. I know that suddenly some of the critics have disappointed, but I think it feels good because it offers a kind of freedom of letters. Helen is free, I think, from the past. When Howard tries on her husband's army coat, Helen's hateful reaction is highlighted. He suspects that the "sanctity" of Ned's property has been violated, but it is hoped that keeping his "straying" is lost in the reality of his danger. Probably he can go. <br /> <br /> Howard is also freed - from the final cycle of anger, injury and violence. Whether he is going to treatment or going to jail is controversial, but I hope it is a former. <br /> <br /> Ryan and Lupino have great acting. I like the "dangerous grounds", but it's also pretty good.
