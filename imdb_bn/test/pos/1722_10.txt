I love u I believe David Tenant is the best show and the best partner ever to deliver! I like the relationship with Dr. and Rose and the way to good relationships and to express love for the rose. It sadly came an end after only 2 seasons. I will miss the rose hips and think that the show will not be the same without every day! But David is still there to make me happy to laugh and play this fantastic role! I rate this show 110% it's great! Graphics and monsters in this show are amazing and each story is different but some are connected and I really learned something about this love of love, world and relationship. Therefore it will be the most spectacular show of all time!
