The third film by Polish brothers is still their best, most beautiful, imaginative movie. Although most audiences will have a problem with the lack of traditional dramatic structures of Northfark, "Stick with it, Jack!". The plot is difficult to summarize, so only this story is included: The agent is trying to evacuate a city, a cow's hat, the angel selling wings and trying to sell sick orphans (but it all works). M. David Mullen's great photography makes almost every frame attractive and surprising. Inspired by the Polish Brothers, performers with offbeat scripts perform performance pitch-perfect and give the film its mental punch. The steadfast audience members will be moved by the myths and legends, tricks and ongoing actors and finally incredible courage and commands which Michael looks behind the Polish camera. Again all of these incredible and seemingly seamless elements will bring you together incredibly one of the incredible things and you should have experience. A great, great, great movie !!!
