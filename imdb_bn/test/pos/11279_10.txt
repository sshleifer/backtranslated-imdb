What is this movie: Cool, entertaining <br /> <br /> <br /> What is this movie: Apparently interesting, difficult to get through, intentional <br /> <br /> I think this movie keeps the viewer (if he Or he wishes) through a clip where they experience a world without languages. There is a lot more to know about the animal world. As much as you see the horrific series of events in "realizing", the more you see this movie. <br /> <br /> consistently it lasted longer than being comfortable. This film can be edited in a 20 minute short and it will be a completely different movie. It will be quiet and entertaining, but the experience will be lost. I saw several cool movies, but I have never experienced it like this. If you can get your head in the right place for this, you are really grateful (but probably not "enjoy") which they should be able to perform here. 10 out of 10
