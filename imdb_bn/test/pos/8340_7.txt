This is a movie that seems like a "date" that is a fun part of that way. Today you will see or hear what you see or hear on silver screen. That's something good; For some words, it is very wet, somewhat bad (depending on your view of some cultural matters) <br /> <br /> For example, in this short (68 minute) 1931 movie you have: <br /> <br> In this story Why should we talk to criminals for the grandfather of a patriot family describing the value of patriotism and the love of the United States (the picture that is on today's movies!) <br /> <br /> <br /> A J La Attorney (Walter Houston) is often shown to give 100% support to begging for death sentences (again, in the modern day film of the film). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> Violence, such as a young boy, is selected several times and in the literal sense the head is thrown into the closet and lifted from his father and once the wall Crucial to the head of it. It's a tough element, at least say. <br /> <br /> Although the image was played by a comedy, most patriotic grandfathers, Charles played "brilliant" sales memorable. For those who see this unique crime film there is a bunch of smiles. And, for the soft touch, two young boys, one of whom - Dickie Moore - became a famous famous child actor on his day. Here, she is a little about 5 years old, who understands, is too far to be a polished actor, but you can see her horoscope for the horoscope. In fact, he did it with a strong performance in "Blonde Venus" starring Marilyn Dyreich in the following year. <br /> <br /> However, it is an entertainment film due to the effective mix of violence, jokes and sensitivity. .... and it has a nice feeling-good finish and a thought-provoking message. It was also for the academy award for "academic story, best story". I am just sorry to be seen on TV because it has never been released from VHS or DVD ... and it is shameful.
