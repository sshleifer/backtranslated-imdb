Like most people, I was only interested in "more" for "Pink Floyd Soundtrack", which became the only Pink Floyd album that I heard about all these years later. In a digital remastered version, a local video shop was quite amazed to run across the film. It was a very wonderful thing that it was a beautiful movie. It is apparently quite beautiful, especially when the two main characters are going on a rock in the Spanish island of Ibiza. And the use of soundtrack music, which I can say, by Pinck Floyd, especially nice. My copy of the album was delighted to see the movie with me, mentally it stopped every track that was used in the film. Dave Gilmore's short "A Spanish Piece" I just could not hear, and several tracks were specially used, especially "Symbols," "Main Theme" and "Quisiliver." The next track is tiring on the soundtrack album but works well according to the title of the film, which is revived at least once. Maybe I can now praise it on the album, now in my mind there are some scenes with it. <br /> <br /> "More" plot is sometimes very difficult, especially in the first place, when only one movie is shown to show the person's hip leader involved in creating it. But finally this film proves that it is much more than a proposal, because the plot has become even more attentive. Why not take Steven heroin? Why take anodie heroin, knowing fully potential consequences? The film does not try to answer the question directly, but Stefan's heroin usage is the logical extension of its single psychological pure pleasure. <br /> <br /> I firmly recommend any Pink Pink Floyd fan to this image, greatly appreciated the underlying "more" soundtrack. I recommend to anyone who is interested in the counter culture of the sixties and how it is portrayed in the media. I do not know how realistic this film is, because I'm young enough to have a 60-year-old experience, but it does not seem to capture the spirit of that time as a different movie.
