This picture was a surprise. The plot sounds synopsis strange, and Clint Eastwood and the great Geraldine page are big. I do not know what to expect. There is an opening scene where the injured soldier says that a 12-year-old kiss is enough for a kiss to kiss and a child can be lasting, and very adult, to give money. The child takes her to the school school of girls where she lives. He tries to escape from the headmaster and takes advantage of the situation, acting by the page, his assistant and another student. Jealousy, sexual tension, turmoil, conspiracy, and Macbre are all involved in these amazing original stories. <br /> <br /> I read other comments here and disagreed with disagreement. However, I wanted to make a point clear before that the film has no sympathetic characters. I find that there is one. The striking female slave successfully succeeds in the advancement of the soldier, which apparently works well because it can be gained by white men by touching the black history of slaves of black men. Although the lack of strength and delusion is the total complement of his experience, I will consider his sympathetic character. More than any other girl and girls in the school, there are legitimate reasons for participating in the last.
