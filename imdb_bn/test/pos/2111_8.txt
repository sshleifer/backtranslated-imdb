The "grand champion" set was still my special privilege to be a photographer and I worked for the movie for 42 days. I have been in the photography business for 25 years and have worked in 16 films and I can not remember when I enjoyed my draft more. The kids were wonderful to work with and little Emma Roberts said she has so much energy in a real trip. He grabbed one of my cameras even during the stockshore scene rehearsal and started shooting. Some of her pictures are used for PR. I could earn more money to produce one big budget, but I suspected that I used to have fun and was like great actors and great people in West Texas.
