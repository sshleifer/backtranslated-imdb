"I know that I am not a man and if you do all these things, then you will attack me properly, so some of you are still human. This thing does not want to show itself, it wants to hide inside it, but it will fight. It is weak in the open, if it takes us, then there is no other enemy, there is no one to kill anyone, and then it won. "<br /> <br /> John Carpenter's" Things " Is one of the most entertaining horror movies created by Khan? Fast, cute and purely exciting from the beginning That's how all kinds of movies should be made. <br /> <br /> Antarctic took place in 1982, the film focused specifically on a group of American scientists. A base of seemingly crazy Norwegians is displayed at their base camp, behind a shirted dog when we are given no role in their mission, but are raised in their existence. Norwegians are killed, and dogs find its way into colonies, when things start to get really crazy. It is very clear that "dog" is actually transferred to a shape of alien creatures, which express itself in the physical form of its victims ?? In other words, it started to eat Americans and their proper imitation that the rest of the people can not understand the difference between their friends and enemies <br /> <br /> Scientists pack under the leadership of MacRD (Cart Russell), fight for their own survival Instead, start using Brun instead wits. In fact, if they have material things, how are they going to reveal it? There are so many things? How Things Can Kill? (Or can it be destroyed?) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The origin of the creature created in this film is easily explained: the spacecraft fell to Earth some thirty thousand years ago, and it was frozen in the interactive ice . Thing tried to escaped, discovered by the Norwegians in the snow, who unknowingly released it from its natural prison. <br /> <br /> "Cinema," itself, is Reidley Scott's iconic "Alien Similar" (1979). Have been a lot compared ?? Dramas have been leaked to a lonely area, which rarely gets sown by the enemies, which often leads to kill them one by one. However, "Things" ?? For all real purposes ?? The first came. <br /> <br /> The famous short story "Who goes there?" John W. Campbell, Jr. (written as Don A. Stewart's nickname), was originally adapted as a feature by Howard Hawke and Christian Nauby in 1951. The result is "Things from Another World", an inefficient classic. But to be fair, it was consistent with the short story, and the courtier remake more and more. <br /> <br /> Things are able to adapt to anyone's physical body, it definitely makes this movie so. Great, and short stories are the most important links. Special effects in 1951 were very poorly painted in the shape of a living image, but for many years SFX made many advances. <br /> <br /> The effect of animal effects on what the artist Rob Bobtine can do is become a chicory gore-fest easily in a surprisingly awesome (and realistic) mess of blood and fear. Thing, although not actually taking a specific form, can be seen continuously at a morphing stage, and the effect is simply gorgeous. They still pack a punch after 22 years. <br /> <br /> Anne Mikeron score (nominated for the Razzi Award at that time) is a bit of electronic and tiny, but hunting is also used properly. <Br /> <br /> Her cast is completely male, her ending is one of the most thought provoking and unclear decisions of all time, "Thing"? By any value ?? Awesome Hollywood is its Best It is not surprising that during the liberation war "Things" was performed badly in the theater and "ET"? Combined in the same year and featuring a merciful alien ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Spieberg's story is flopped during the release of the old and its 20th anniversary. On the other hand, "Things" gradually climbed a ladder to classical classic ?? It is one of the most famous non-famous films ever made. <br /> <br /> is notorious for having a very unfinished career? From his amazing "Pretunt 13th Ault" (1976) to the cool "Halloween" (1978) from the frustrating and stupid "from L.A. (1996), "Things" remains its very best motion picture. Though its fame was never enough for years to occupy its place in most "great movies" list, "Things" is still one of my favorite horror movies, and ?? Close inspection on ??? Made efficiently Is it a bold and impressive thrill ride that is unique and cool at once ?? A real relief for film buffs who are tired of the horrific threat of the same age. This one, at least, is indeed unpredictable.
