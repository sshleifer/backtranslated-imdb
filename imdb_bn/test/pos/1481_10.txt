I liked this way in the movie too. My only problem was to think that Michael Iranside is playing the actor villain. Corse Ironside is just a low-paying Jack Nicholson. I think Mike was busy in that year "Hylander 2: The Quicking". Sadly, "Bustmaster 2" has been a very good career step. This is definitely the best of the BestMaster series and the memorable Big Screen Classic "Universe of Master" in many memorable ways. It's not just great Mark Singer, it's an extraordinary supporting cast, especially the second from the "Sliders", Uncle Phil and "Superman 2" from the "New Prince of Belar" shows the evil cock. It rocked my world and must of course certainly look for someone with no social or physical outlets. BESTMASTER FOREVER !!! Rock n roll !!!
