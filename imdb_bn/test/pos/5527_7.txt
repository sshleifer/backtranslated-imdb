But George and Gracie are not among them. The movie is fun and the pool table scene with WC Fields that I have ever seen to be the most fun, but Grassie and George are somewhat less bizarre than the humor in their roles due to lack of script and partly their explanation. I donated 7 out of 10 for the rest of the cast, the WC is a treasure of comedic timing and energy.
