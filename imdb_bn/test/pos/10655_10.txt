When I saw this movie I did something a bit brave tonight. I try to feed myself milk to silent movie scores. Surely, when this movie was originally distributed, the piano score probably played with it. Often the director will choose the score himself (Charlie Chaplin often scored his next silent film score). But the music you heard on VHS tapes in silent film is by no means the same music played during the film's first liberation war. And, again, there were plenty of silent movies that played without scores. I do not know Potemkin's score history, so I decided to see it for this piece of art - the medium produced in the film. <br /> <br /> After I stopped the song, I was unwitting (or unconstitutional) by the musical interpretation of emotion on the screen, I became fully connected to the film. Apparently, it is easily one of the most stunning of all films. Eisenstein was a master of composition. Editing, perhaps the most famous for the cinematic technique Eisenstein (Montage), is remarkable. The mood of this photo is angry, and it stirred my passion to stirred. <br /> <br /> A lot of effort is needed to enjoy a silent film, especially a play, but films such as Battleship Potemkin prove that this effort is completely valuable. Come on! You are indebted to see this picture! Your education is incomplete without it.
