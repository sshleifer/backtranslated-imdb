The greatest movie of all time. <br /> <br /> How to debate this? However, if we look at it entirely through the cinematic sequences, it is a wonderful composition of three colors. It's not enough just to say - The color of the 3D red world movie excellence. If you admit that Citizen is not enough for the people, if you accept that Star Wars is not really good, if you accept that Ozu and Mijoguchi both have to take a step back - then three colors are the all-time seratom Best Composition. As discussed in human morality, the three colors red work on an intense worship level, whose depth does not match. Blue almost went around in the human mind, but it stopped as the hat is going to pull the hare out. White forced to reflect humanity in our equality - this, retreat, was still good, but still there are not many. Red, however, is the real thing. What he has revealed in this movie, does it reveal to people what it is like. Actually, what he has published is how _how_ it is human to feel. It is our neutral detail, our moral nature, to keep an eye on the nature of our souls. In red, one could find one of its different levels. At the first level, the Red has achieved high level of intensity - we can not have any problem in describing the unusual entertaining story of Lal. However, the music in the film and its fantasies emphasized to test us as a film. It's like Kieslowski says: "Cecci n'est pass la réalité". Indeed, in pursuit of a humanitarian goal, Kieslowski can compete in reality. It is a strategy that Kieslowski Le Double Vie de Véronique is trying, but until his last film, he finally managed to reach the divine intertwining of fate, philosophy and situations. Actors and actresses, also, appear to be a greater power mercy. Valentines (Jacob in Iran), a perfect creator, because he represents almost pure love. Meanwhile, the concept of the first impression has been challenged by the judge of Jinn-Louis Triesteant Karne, which is a dangerous man, who has finally become almost all the wise observers of events - a character that symbolizes the ability to bring together the characters - the ability to make people happy, Which he can achieve only through Valentine's. <br /> <br /> Our image is able to see more movies than a series. Actually, movies have the potential to make more money than literature. Of course this does not happen, but at least we have the power to see this movie, because we know that it gives the power to achieve something that we can not define, but all possess A summary of this movie reads: "A movie about a woman managed by a dog". Okay, this is it. <br /> <br /> What is this? <br /> <br /> - Simon Huxbal <br /> <br />
