This is one of the better documentaries I've clearly seen on family relationships and marriage. I've seen "friends taken hold of friends" a few moments ago and thought it was even better. <br /> <br /> The story is not uncommonly disappointing, but it's a sudden personality and related cold war. Block visually guides visitors through diaries, family footage and after-events interview; His interview style is sensitive and searched, and his insights are clear and measurable. <br /> <br /> A great test of personality and relationships on the road of 51 beats, 40-50 years of social change, social decline, and feasibility. For release.
