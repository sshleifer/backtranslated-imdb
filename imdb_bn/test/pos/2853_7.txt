Renee Zenelzer is a cancer housewife, whose husband's husband is involved in drug trafficking. Two professional hits men - Morgan Freeman and his son Chris Rock, killed his husband in his dining room. Neglected by the killers, Jelviger, witness and bear an incomplete reaction, a nurse's personality - feeling Betty - a character in his favorite soap opera. Believing herself as the character of TV, Jeljord jumped into her husband's car, with a lot of pressure on her trunk and traveling to L. where she hopes to link to another character of the play, "Dr. David Ravel" Greg Binayer. He did not realize that he was being followed by two injured men and moved to LA where he managed to link with Kainer and was actually written to be seen as a nurse named Beti. Keep some people familiar with local sheriffs, keep what is happening, and look for jailguards in LA. The last is trustworthy and disgusting. <br /> <br /> If it sounds crazy because it is. And the responsibility of the author, John C. Richards The strange thing is that Richards and Director Neil Labot, with enough help from the actors, just to stop it. It is a plot which is not cast into a familiar mold. No I give it bonus points for sheer basicity. Someone went out of a posture. Some people took the opportunity of a film that was not a copy or rebuild that earned ten years or fifty years ago. I imagine people involved, pray every night down every knee, fervently. I do not know what the film was profitable, but it's the most successful on its own aesthetic conditions. <br /> <br /> This is known as the "primary prize" movie. If you start with a single converted event, in this case, kill the husband of the husband of the husband and take a new personality, and follow the actual consequential logical path. Another "ground day", better and more complexly designed, for example. "Nurses Betty" has its rational cracks, where to leave their feasibility of events. For example, in a party in LA, Jelivevar finally goes to Kinna, the man who plays his ex-drunk on the TV. He was surprised (because he thinks he is Betty, who had lost his drunk many times). He went to Kinyar and some of his colleagues and presented himself as a "nurse bettie". He addressed the name of his TV character "David Ravell" in Kinnear. This group is confused at first, then be pleased to yourself that she is an aspiring actress who emphasized the need to have "character" during the conversation - and later, Kinnar was fascinated by her and bothered others. Kinna runs in her house and even when she kisses her and kissing her, she still remains in character, making the character of the cat astonishingly, to cry. The next day, Kinnar returned to her love. This development, at this time the relation between the jailer and the Kinnan is a logical error that is absent from "Ground Days". At the end of the night, like any other person, Kainer will realize that the Jellweger is less than a few circular strips. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film, which includes a lot of shock, succeeded by exceeding expectations. The relationship between Morgan Freeman and his ungrateful, nihilistic son is wonderfully spelled. Morgan flawless in her exasperation. She managed to fall in love with Jhelger's film because she discovered the source of her position and activity and eventually she could not paint herself. He shoots very sweet. After his transformation in the bout, he left a note behind Kansas. "I want to help everyone whether I am alive, plant or mineral." Who could harm an extravagant connative statement of this type of author? His respect for him comes in cosmic form, because he stands on one side of the lamps enclosed in the rim of the Grand Canyon. Clothing such as jellyvision, dorothi, or perhaps the previous good witch - well, any letter similar to a jailer - comes from the cancer - comes to Freeman and he embraces him and kisses him humbly. This is a scene that is monotonous, romantic, and a little surprising. Once I stood between those lamps and lightened some of the pure paper from the dark canyon and surrounded me with a thousand rolling bat, who had quarreled like a moth. <br /> <br /> OK. Where was I? OK. I was trying to not run out of space. Zellweger's performance deserves plaudits. Whatever he does, every movement, each pronouncement, homosexuality and tentative. He is really a favorite character - and that despite the fact that he has no glamor girl by Hollywood standards. But - what the actress Compare its performance as the "cold mountain" 19th century hick. Just the opposite. But then everyone is lost in this usable film. A minor role of Alison Jannings does a fine job. Greg Kinnner said that when he thinks of killing his character in soap opera in the sinking accident, look at him. One of those narcissists of Kinnear who wear ten thousand dollars thin black leather jacket was popular at that time. He chocolates and says, "Oh, one of those camouflages, okay? Okay, how can I get back?" Jannings do not answer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
