The title for a sick movie is brutal, Pinck Flamming is an ongoing classic. Of course, the camerawork is harmful and off-center, the story is fake and slow, and every single character in the film is disrespectful and disgusting, but Pinf's flimsiness has a pretty playful and brilliant wit that does not match any other film. <br /> This picture is really objectionable, the story of what is going on in the film is actually worse than watching it. Only John Waters can make people known as rapture, murder, misery, cannibalism, hypocrisy, and any other form of human rebellion. This movie will be seen to believe.
