OK. A guardian or guardian who has a warning for anyone out there. Be careful about who you see this movie - that is, - do not take children to see this movie. I'll explain why <br /> 1 - The title is confusing and there is nothing to do with the romance of the movie - I think it was totally deliberate for the creators, but the annoying 2 - the film itself is really boring. I have some problems - first of all it is not violent or sexual and so it's not a 'horror movie'. But it is a very annoying film, and a child and his parents, and a small town involved. <br /> <br /> Okay, fly it up so far. The film is not suitable for minors, because it contains a growing number of images and images and it will be confusing to a child. It has an odd quality, and it only makes it feel inappropriate to me because it has a child. As a parent, I feel strongly enough to say myself because I read the rest in the theater for another day. <br /> <br /> I hope filmmakers say this, but I think it's my right, it's got a release, and there's only one M rating. (Because it is not violent or sexual). Just curious and unsettling but very good and itself.
