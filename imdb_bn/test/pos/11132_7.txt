A recent survey of the children of the UK re-applied the concept of promoting the film 27 years ago. More than anything else, young people want to grow up to be big. It used to be doctors and firemen that kids wanted to be. Now, everyone wants to be famous. Fame is a group of children from New York City's High School for Performing Arts. We saw their first audition, then took classes and learned about life for the next four years. The film has a lot of good qualities, but eventually you feel a little unhappy. <br /> <br /> Allen Parker's bold director style fits perfectly. The film has been classified as a musical, but it is something more than a play. Musical numbers and dance routines spread here and there, and Parker keeps them as real realistic as they may have actually been portrayed. The most part with some exceptions is for the top drawer. Pacing is a little off, especially at the end of the film, but at that time, the story has already made some mistakes. <br /> <br /> First, the auditions at the beginning of the film should weeded out a couple of original characters. It seems that anyone will display and listens for one section, then postpone their route through admission to others. Look at this some people just not talented or eager to start with. Once the first year of class goes, the film becomes a beautiful croak. Interaction between students and teachers is handled very well and it likes you more. We see more students' lives in school when the film begins to lose itself later. Some of these people are not only careful. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake in the film is that Ralph Garcia has made the character so prominent. This guy is a lazy; Self-centered corrosive As a "professional a hole" he proudly announced the stage during his comedy routine. The audience is supposed to feel for this person and for his tragic personal situation, but I hope they will throw his Butt out of school. Irene Carr, Maureen Tiffy, Paul McCracken and Late Gene Anthony Ray are those people who will take care of you till the end of this film. As soon as I try, I am still unable to develop ABS like John Anthony Roy. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> It's memorable, interesting, and full of bold scenes and performances. It may take a little longer and possibly some incorrect characters are completely improved when others are hovering in the background. The number of musical instruments is great, and it is relatively unexpected or even two seconds after the end of the movie. Although not perfect, Fame is a film that will run in a different way or any other way for many years. <br /> <br /> 10 7 stars <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hound.
