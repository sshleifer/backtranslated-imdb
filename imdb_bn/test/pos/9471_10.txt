I got the opportunity to watch this movie in Bra's early screening and I've been crazy for it since then. The image is based on Shakespeare's twelfth night, which I read and liked and saw on the stage several times so I certainly liked the references. But you do not like Shakespeare or it does not matter - the film is standing on it. It's super funny, malicious and charming. Amanda Bynes was lovely and so was David Cross. Indeed the whole cast is great - I just have to be a huge David Cross fanatic. Cast hot and soundtrack many cool bands and some I have not heard of before, but I know that a CD is coming out so I must buy it. Each of our audiences laughed from the beginning to the end - all the old groups. !!!!
