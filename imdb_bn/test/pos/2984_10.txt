Well ... I do not want to give any speech, but I feel the desire to say something important about this beautiful movie. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I was 14 years old) and one year later, once more. That was it. The rest was the soundtrack of Alton John's Pink LP and the song was deep and deep in my heart. How deep is that? A week ago my cousin gave me a VHS copy. (There is no DVD yet). Boy ... I'm surprised !! Poet is always deep childhood and beauty, love, God, teenager experience of idealistic pursuits, have to stay with you permanently. As they appear at the heart level (no intelligence yet!), They define the body of your soul as a stone with a stone. Sometimes we could not forget how accurate they are, perhaps we will make every decision of each moment, better to understand every curved point of our life. <br /> <br /> So, I admit I feel nostalgia. But the impressive part is seeing the film again, and over time with this journey, we have realized why 60-year-old people grew up. The spirit of that period is here: A complete, romantic view of teenage rebellion with beautiful pop ballads, song poetry, awakening, love war, creating love and creating economic progress away from the official world, is covered with a completely romantic and authentic love, these two lively souls They are still fulfilling the promise of growing fulfillment together as they learn mutual and turn into "maturity Kadera ". <br /> <br /> I showed this movie in a group of school youth and they commented on it as helpless and stupid with simple and silly comments. Friends, be serious !! As an art and art film, it reflects only the human emotion but the historical moment. And this is exactly what "friends" work in a masterly way. It reflects a new idea of ​​revolt and new beginning, we all dreamed at the age of 15. I am a musician and I think some of us, the artist, still dream about it !! How can we live? That "friends", that "brother sun moon moon", that "hair". From the increasingly new "world order" to pornography as "obscene" in this violent new "world order" after September 11, it was repeated in clear and obscene texts in pop music with no tune in tune pornography. <br /> <br /> How the heart's warming experience discovers Paul and Michelle again, terribly and humbly discover new fantasies of their romantic world. How the key part of our heart is returned: In Paris, Elton John at his best, in the urban surrounded by 2 CV Citrones and VW Beatles. A new wind from the peaceful cottage in Cameroon, which is surrounded by fishing ponds and wild horses. Who made us, such as Spain's Supreme, France's Braille, Peter Paul and Mary, Joan Boyz, Luther King, Beatles, Elementary Elements, Belmont's Spiritual, Gandhi, Elvis's Gospel. <br /> <br /> People are still expecting: Get this picture. Start with solitude and grow from there. Find out what you have all about it. And from there you will have a solid and more real foundation; A way to find some ideal life, personal and world affairs. Today we need this much! Give yourself the opportunity and will probably end the time of someday synics. (I have an extra VHS copy) <br /> <br /> Santiago Zoolat Bogotá Colombia
