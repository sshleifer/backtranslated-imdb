This review is from Millid Spoklar, but not enough to spoil the story ... <br /> <br /> Recently, Nihin Chinbotsu (depending on Japan's sync with Japan, where you live), saw a rebuilt 1970 movie. The name, which was itself based on the best selling novel by Sakio Komatsu. This movie is a jewel of Japanese film making. It seems as if a tectonic plate is submerged due to the lagoon in the west of Japan. Americans predict that this will happen within 40 years, but according to Dr. Todocoro (perhaps an insane scientist), it will happen in less than a year. The Japanese government is not convinced but sets up a disaster settlement plan, as well as formed a new D1 team to deal with the crisis. Japanese Prime Minister was killed during a visit to China to discuss the development of the scheme, and the panic was sent to the cabinet. The D1 team is mostly released for handling and headed by the newly elected Minister of Crisis Management, Soro Takmari (former ex-wife of Dr. Todocor). He changed Dr. Tadokor for advice and planned to blow up the huge holes in astronomy under Japan to avoid the drowning process. <br /> <br /> soon Japan will have to discuss with different countries and be motivated to accept them. Japanese refugees. Soon, it appears that many countries seem to be reluctant to accept Japan's sudden flutter in Japan due to the sudden fluctuation in Japan and more chaos (if it happens then touch wood, I hope Mitto remains safe ... he is always in my place Maybe ... Hey Hey). Displacement scenes are really well done, destructive, painful and frustrating people will have to face in such a disastrous time. And many faces of men, pride, selfishness, bribe, courage, ugliness ... <br /> <br /> This is a really well-made movie. With a hard story and wonderful acting of storytelling, it is difficult. Dr. Todocor (played by Toyokawa Efushi) has done a really good job, portraying a divorced and often mad scientist, who is shivering and blurred. Her frustration and anxiety were very visible and it is really a good thing. Reiko (played by Pretty Shibasaki Kou) also plays well well, and has a wonderful acting voice that has the most memorable lines in the whole movie (see it to find out) and I have played. He played Toshiyonode's love interest (SMAP played Suoyashi Kusangi). Oh, I almost forgot ... he really, really long hair ~ and here's a fine but background love story, which is well written and if the Japanese do something really good, it's a love story ... <br /> <br /> One thing that makes this film attractive is the technical explanation of the events, and if you are interested in geography, you will have a really good time (I know that I am .. Hey). I can see that they went to great lengths to make the theory of this film credible and the first few graphical displays and explanations were well done (though you will be playing Japan's famous "Engrish".) <br /> <br /> Okay, now about the effects ( It's all of the effects, is not it?). After watching the movie with best wishes, I must say that the film has a special effect That's what produces something similar to Hollywood (or even better) ... Volcanic eruption ... a massive earthquake ... the destruction ... tsunamis ... explosions ... all happened nicely. The first scene was very cool, the first earthquake surprised you. Lets fall, the mountains are destroyed, because of the volcanic eruption you are crying ... actually an amazing view of Mount Fuji is hot ... then you are in the shadows Look at it ... It's so tragic! But what I felt was that the best scenes were a huge tsunami scene, that the rescue operation failed and the people went away just after leaving and there is no hope ... the last scene Eligible to mention ... wonderful stuff. If you like the effect, you would love this movie. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah ... there's a great song behind every good movie. Super-cute and adorable snooze "Keep Holding U" is a twin with Kubota, and it's simply beautiful. I think the movie really feels good and it shows that no disaster strikes us, our love and strength holds us back. Disaster scenes are directed by orchestra music and sometimes silence (a Japanese specialty) and cause chaos for the destruction of the screen. Oh, and I've mentioned it really really, really Wide Screen? Okla, running and about this movie. Yes, I liked it, and hope to see it again ... There are holes in it, but it was all excusable because it was a wonderful popcorn movie. Not perfect, but really well made. I want to give it 9 out of 10 I'm glad to say that the most expensive movie in Japanese history is also their best. If you have not seen it, you really need to see it today ...
