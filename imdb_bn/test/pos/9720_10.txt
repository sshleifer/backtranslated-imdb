Each story has a lesson for the young and old. But what I have to say is to waste the story in the future. But, I believe that what I say is for everyone; Just for a specific episode: The Solar and Death. <br /> <br /> Okay ... the stories that came out for me are "soldiers and death" because it was in my life. Realized life terminal I'm not really kidding. The wind was my 8 1/2 birthday ... and I'll always remember it. I did not think of his title until tonight, but I new to the synopsis (May 15, 1988) <br /> <br /> It is always difficult to explain life as a natural death. It is also difficult to admit that adults can accept this issue. I am living proof (currently 28 years old) that children can accept this fact and from time to time reminds adults ... <br /> <br /> I write these with my eyes tears. Hit Laser - A wonderful actor in my own age - died today. It reminds me of a lot of lessons I have learned in my life. So I write to remind the young man and the elderly ... what can be saved for us is not resisted. <br /> <br /> I want to say that death will happen, but for the first time in this story I have not seen death as a bad thing; But in a part of life, this story was quite literal. I can not help it. It was a life changing moment for me and always will be. <br /> <br /> And for that ... <br /> <br /> I love Jim Henson (and I still remember a lot of your work till the day of living, and live up to your memorial muppet show) and Thanks to Brian Henson for keeping the workshop alive !!! Honestly, I would like to thank you, your colleagues, editors, and interim all. <br /> <br /> The stage is just a stage / and a show will be made only for a show / screenplay / magic / forever world. <br /> <br /> Thank you !!! <br /> <br /> (And who suspects me ... Dance, magic dance)
