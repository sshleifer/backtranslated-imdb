A continuous movie that represents a catalyst in our daily life, which presents us with our thoughts, behavior and emotions that we can not change among. This story is a love story where true emotions are arising. For outstanding performance, I gave credit to Malcolm Jamal Warner (Win) and challenge cadet. A movie is definitely valuable, a holiday roadtrip that turns into a mental rotation-at-circle. I recommend to see it.
