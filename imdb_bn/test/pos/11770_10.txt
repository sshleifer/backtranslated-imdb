This is a great movie and if you have not seen it, you must go to the video store and rent it. First off, cast fantastic. It's not just the current star, like Ryan Phillip and Billy Bob Thornton, but you have his star like Justice Reynold. It has many similarities with actors such as John Bon Jovi, Ted Danson, and Jamie Lee Curtis. Second off, the story was very good. They were fascinating how to make a plot for a movie movie, and almost made it dramatic. It takes drugs in the United States and instead of giving it a ridiculous face like "Half-Box", it contains a true, life-text picture like "traffic". So you will see this story, if you are a stoner, express insight into what you like, if you do not get the medicine, it will give you a more realistic view of medicine than what you want to see.
