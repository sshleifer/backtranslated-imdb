This is probably probably my favorite tv show. I love all the letters, especially Alex, who is the perfect woman! Always makes me smile and feel good when I watch this show. It's hard to describe, which is something amazing about, <br /> <br /> It looks like some or all episodes are synced with music albums. Here are some examples. (The episodes begin again after the end - but do not play the end credits until the end, but always play the starting credits. Most of the episodes are played with the album once and the episodes are played twice but something goes on.) <<Br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 'Shirts' Kid A / Meddle / Shot Off Love <br /> <br /> 2.19 'World Without Alex' Kid A / Wish was here / Pablo Honey (played at least 4 times in the episode) <br /> <br /> <br /> Mind you, that is the source album is synchronized. Children can synchronize with each episode!
