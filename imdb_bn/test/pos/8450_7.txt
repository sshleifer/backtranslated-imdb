Abused by the "Chinese syndrome" nuclear power, Paraniah has launched a complete string of films about the potentially devastating black color, which would be leaked for most of the American Reagan years. This is a well-established and effective drama, it has given an extra punch by its high-powered stars, notably Jack Lemonman, who plays a senior official in the nuclear power plant, who enjoys conscience crisis. But no one can help, but it seems that this three miles island is a nuclear accident, only a few weeks after the release of this movie, it has been a classic appealing appeals in the 70's. It's not as classic as it is, it's certainly not classic. <br /> <br /> A red-headed journalist with Jane Fonda and his camera man (and film producer, by the way), with a bearded Michael Douglas. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
