I saw this movie as one of the most amazing examples of all the interesting and artistic films. Herzeg can easily catch the beauty of the tragedy and Dieter's story, as well as his favorite personal character. At the end of the film, I got the chance to meet Deetter before his passport that I wished. <br /> <br /> In a technical note, cinematography is intimate and surprisingly beautiful. The story is deeply sung with the ability to re-establish and reconsider the widespread awareness of the subject. Some documentary directors have a powerful ability to invest in the letter audience thoroughly. This picture must be seen !!!
