I gave this 8 stars out of a possible 10. It was a wonderful plot, and Peter Cooet and Michel Lee, as well as the rest of the cast, were well in their part. <br /> <br /> Teeth for both ages of Peter and Michele were supposed to be their character too long, and the film was well suited for their children, probably being their grandfather. <br /> <br /> I missed the first ten minutes of this film, so I do not know how that body turned out after 25 years and Danny Tryner (Peter Quet's character) came back, but I have no problem in the story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He was surprised that his longtime husband, Dinie, was arrested for killing Oregon some 25 years ago, Claimed that he never lived. <br /> <br /> Dinie, changed her story. Then his story changes again and again, until Barbara does not know what to believe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A young girl called Sherry Owen accepted a journey from a stranger named Kennedy, which ended in the killings. <br /> <br /> I found the movie entertaining, beautiful, and it seemed to me that what happened in them three people <br /> <br /> from what I saw while closing the last The real story was based on.
