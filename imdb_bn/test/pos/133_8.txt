Spoiler alert! Do not fall until you're ready for some spoilers. <br /> <br /> I think this film was a lot below its shell. In addition to the apparent links to "Old Town" (and other Park-Wake movies), such an unholy relationship has really bothered me, and the fine extreme extremist themes for all the vampical, physical activities. <br /> <br /> The main actor, the Kang-Ho song, the cleric of Sang-Hyeon Rolle is horrific - conflicting, "Sanga" means "blood" in some languages ​​- truly love the same-junk, which is fine - Bin Kim Their relationship reminds me of many things between Martin Shane and CC Space in "Badlands", where the girl seems to be a psychologist and people are mainly wrapped around her finger. <br /> <br /> Their relationship is the same, but the mother's mother is completely different. In the moving, he is strict, one-dimensional and instant, but paralyzed, he says, not by walking, or by the inside of the eye. <br /> <br /> Park-Walk really truly mastered his cinematography. This film, and Stanley Kubrick owed a lot; There are many beautiful shots spanning across the film, for some easy effects and for some to see and maybe to get completely caught repeat views. <br /> <br /> Music uses most of the stock using most strings. Monoreaction of the main th spian; It is a very good thing that is the character he recalled. Although he did very little work and lost it, instead he could be a person who thinks so much. Although his interest in love and many things, his works show fewer thought behind him. My modest opinion <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's magnificent, and repellant at the same time.
