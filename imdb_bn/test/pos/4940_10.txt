It started only after the TV began, and when I thought the channel was too lazy to change, I ended up watching it. Man, that was fortunate. <br /> <br /> This image is more fairy tales than a play, and occasionally openly sensitive. It is definitely sure which one can make a good-quality movie call, and I usually find such annoying or annoying. Yet this picture has been so good that I could not help but love. The script will not relieve your brain; It's conventional, but flawless. Brilliant actors, a perfect fit for every single role. There are not many scores, but music bits make the movie nicely. <br /> <br /> If you can appreciate other things than expensive piratics, harmful murders or movies in the movie, but you can see that you have a chance. 5/5
