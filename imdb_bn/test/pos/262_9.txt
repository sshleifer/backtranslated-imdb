It's just one of those movies, you love it or hate it, my girlfriend and I like it, ask my brother to rent it and he hates it, it was very dazzling and conversations, again he usually went to big action movies See, perhaps enough blast left him frustrated. There were some great new talents (I've never heard before that Lead)? Des Brady (director's brother?) Was especially good. Playing the right dick at the beginning I thought that he would never free himself, but he would get out of the dark hole that he had created and ultimately I would have been routing for him. Without a body count and a blast, you can live a very wonderful movie with many hearts, but it is a very original one. Yashimo Britain's Briston.
