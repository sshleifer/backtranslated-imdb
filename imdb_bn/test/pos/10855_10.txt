"Tipping the Velvet" is one of the modern television productions that proves that some televisions may be better or even better (even this) than what they see in your local theater. <br /> <br /> If you want to read the plot, read this and if you leave the other details in the next paragraph. This is an unforgettable portrait of an incomplete young girl named Nan, who acts as a silly raunchy girl until she finds her professional homosexuality, when she loves a successful woman dressed in a male-like dress for her breasts. The young girl soon joined this act as another male camouflage and they were a big hit. Soon both of them started a flexible affair. What finally becomes a bond of convenience and ruins the young nan's heart. Then, the male works as a man's manipulative man to show sexual relation with the boys, then he becomes the dreadful and nightmare Diana's private sexual slave, in which the nuns get serious psychological abuse experience. When it ended badly, again took to the streets on the street, where he remembered Florence, a young woman; A good heartwarming socialist who had the real possibility of being a wonderful partner. There, Nan will discover the power of socialism and learn how to achieve fame. <br /> <br /> 1 transit of this region is an interesting interview with quality pictures, a very good view, an entertaining photo gallery and novelist Sarah Waters and film writer Andrew Davies. <br /> <br /> Set, clothing, cinematography and music are fantastic. Acting, writing and direction is very strong and full of realism, class and originality. I like film and novel. The third division in the film is much different than the film, because the third section of the novel is written extraordinary, but not the screen material. I'll be brave and say that I love this movie more. <br /> <br /> This exciting historical boldness combines drama, comedy, erotica and romance with dynamic perfection, both of which are deeply moving and spiritually raised. For every mature and open-minded adult, who felt the joy, pain and power of fullness in the life of love and living. A revolutionary production; An absolute must see!
