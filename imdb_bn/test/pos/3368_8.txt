I was not sure what to expect from the box. I saw a huge fan of Darko, but the Southland Tales saw a mess, who knows whether it was a studio's butt-up. In the box I was pleasantly surprised. This is a threat to the classic Saif-Fi paranoia movies, which indicates a lot of confusing events, but centers based on a close character. <br /> <br /> Slower and blurry tension was very effective for tones and themes. The whole picture There will be no change in the pacing, generally Hollywood or 'MTV' style, that this story's purpose will not serve properly. In the short explanation of the extravagantly displayed / played extras, the lower-end scores, which are right, adds a complete attention to the underlying horror and the shrinking feeling of hope for our greedy, though good meaning, lead letters. From the first to the beginning it was something Richard Kelly thought well and kept in motion. The little story of Richard Matheaneson, which was based on it, is not the AP of nine Twilight Zone, which was another subject in the story, it was in morality and greed, which is still the central element of the box. It was not an easy task to extend its feature with only 8 pounds tall, but it was done with style, originality, and left the film's chronic thinking about the audience. Many have compared to DARCO and compare it as deep, but I found it completely different and film-based as a different movie. Its voice is completely different, such as the message and the purpose of the film. Where Darko kept up with our internal questions, the box releases the viewer with external questions related to our outside world. For example, knowing the human nature, the box will never end the test? Bent down, gentle, vivid visual, and lumpy atmosphere add slowly to a cool ride. It's not for everyone, but for those coming from it, it's a treat.
