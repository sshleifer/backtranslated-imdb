"Pearl Harbor, friend." This movie is bright! Of course it does not flow like a million-dollar comedy, but the continuous cast junk is incredible. I'm going for a cylinder, a lot like "fool and dumb", "air" and "wet hot summer summer" and I want to say it easily. Films are not written with such spodic comedy. Many jokes have become so amazed to the audience that it is truly amazing that they do not know much more and appreciate this crystal composition! While viewing it, you can easily find more than 20 quotes that you will find yourself quotes later ... and you will find more after viewing it again!
