I like this movie! Oh, my meat! This movie was so tough! I found it in some old tape and I did not know what it was and after reading the cover for what the summer had said (BTV, which mentions that Elton John covered the soundtrack for the movie, what the film actually meant. More often than not.), I thought it was interesting, and I was more interested in seeing it because it was at The old film. <br /> <br /> "No debate?" As I keep the tape in the player as I think myself, I was curious to know. And my expectations were met. I love it I guess it really is a girly kind of movie, but it was so sweet and adorable! It was a beautiful romance, though sometimes the direction reminds me of the camera work in 'The Graduate', which I saw was that the director could have some close compromises with acids. <BR> <br /> This is not entirely conclusive for both of these children and it's going to survive on their own ... but it can happen ... in a fantasy ... <br /> <br / > But, lastly lucky to lock me up! I was so crazy by finishing it ... it's like hanging pages, and I guess they can deal with what's actually happening to them ... but at the same time, I'm not hesitant to see them, since almost at the sq. The first is not as good either. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie for a solar over! This is a great movie ... awesome!
