Leonard Maltin has given this film an awesome BOMB rating in his 1995 film and video guide. What was he looking for film? Child revenge or God's gun bombs are. This photo is a pleasure. It's amazing. It's educated. It is well mounted. It uses beautiful photography, a bright color. Starting from the first scene, the movie draws your attention and tips stop you that this movie is a good part of Spaghetti Western style. The movie is played from the beginning to the end until the end, Douglas Fairbank, 77 Sunset Strip and Good, The Add, and The Wiley are famous for their ridicule with famous showdowns. Ed Byers, George Hilton, and Gilbert Roland work together to work ridiculously. It's too bad. Mr. Maltin rated this image as bad as it is unwanted. One can guess as his cause. I think he missed the point of the film completely and hoped for something more serious than this film. Kudos belong to everyone involved in this project. The film is awaiting the help of a little jewel that takes care of educated films and appreciates the mockery.
