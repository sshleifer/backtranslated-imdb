Thank you FilmJone for showing this lazy soft-core Flickr 1 AM I really enjoyed it. To be honest, I hope more from a sexy cast with McCalla, Drew Brewroo and of course, talented come Nicoil (as Rebecca Carter). <br /> <br /> Production is basically basically bad budget but a little more effort will not harm. For example, cinematography shows it like a hard-core porn movie. There is absolutely no effort in the lightning. But let us ignore this thing because honesty, we saw "the joy of sin" in a high degree of sex. <br /> <br /> The sex factor is pretty good and offers steam, clear views. Chola Nicole Women Cast provides the best performance. <br /> <br /> So my suggestion is to see this movie if you are in explicit sex mood, or if you are a fan of Mrs. Nicolle, then just watch it. <br /> <br /> Recommended for sex scenes only; Do not expect anything else.
