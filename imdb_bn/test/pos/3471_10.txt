I thought this lady was from the store I was selling from this store! Once she was cold! What a fantastic film! First of all I was sure that James MacAye and Romola Garai were Irish, so their expression was believable; And through halfway through the film, I was completely convinced Steven Robertson was an inactive actor and definitely James MacAye! When I saw the special feature in DVD and both actors watched their 'normal' ridicule, saying that I was disappeared !!! I can remember that at the age of 80, all the films, 'Rain Man', can commemorate the acclaimed Dustin Hoffman for autism filming - quite clearly (my opinion!) Steven Robertson's acting / screenplay has come out of the right water of Dustin Hoffman - and he deserves such recognition !! All of the greatest screenplays of all the friendships / love / relationships of all human beings - and it was made with actors taken in Britain / Ireland - Yee's Pipe Stick and it smokes Hollywood!
