Love this short film, which reminds me of some of the original Japanese gem, will we dance? (Extremely Expensive / Zolo Remake is not ...) Fortunately I found it and taped it while showing the Starz Promotion Weekend, so far as I know it is not available on DVD. I'll look at anything with Yancy Butler (anyone who thinks it as a short-lived TV series man and machine), and he's positively illuminated this topic. He routinely made a disco song, which is Hello! Particularly played by Patrick Stewart and Leslie Carnos (where he has been all these years?) Especially those who like all other characters. The movies that I have taken at this time and laughing after seeing it smiles. Highly recommend !!!
