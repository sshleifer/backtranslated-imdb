This movie did not have much hope when I went to the theater but I was waiting for it for many years. To add it, it was quite good! Chad Michael Murray was pretty good, I thought he was going from wrong turn to Chris Flynn but I was wrong. Elisa Cuthbert was also good but the best performance was to go to Brian Van Hollt. He was a bad guy very well, I meant to say he was sick, evil, and very cruel. The stories back in the brothers were good, plus I liked how to take any killings up to 40 minutes in film. This gives you the time to choose the character that you wanted to live and that you wanted to die. John Abraham was quite good as CMM's fool's good bud. When I shouted Chad's voice in search of death, it would have been good, then it was good, "Anyway, my friend is dead, who carries". It really showed how she cared for. So overall, this was a shadow god slasher with some great effect. Say!
