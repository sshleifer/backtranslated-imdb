The most fun siticom until it's ever broadcasted on TV. I own all 9 seasons in DVD and can literally see over them. Nobody finds this show funny, hearty, entertaining, and high laughing smile, crazy! Kevin James is absolutely out of the most gifted comedians. My boyfriend and I love to stand in front of the comedy shows (where we live) and Kevin James twice and his brother, Gary Valentin (Danny), have seen once. They are both incredibly talented and smart plans with their work. There are many comedians, which are just awful and Kevin and Gary shows the true side of the real comedy. Leo Remini, although a snake and bitch of real life (so I read) deserve a wonderful actress and sitcoms more credit than any other woman. She really makes the show ... along with Jerry Stiler! This show will certainly see and you will be addicted to one to two episodes!
