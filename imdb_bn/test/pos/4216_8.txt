That's right. Fate 1 was good. Lucky 2 was good. Lucky sucked 3. Now, the series is 4th, in my opinion, the best out of the series. Jennifer Tilly was just great in this film. For dolls, they were better than some actors (think Freddy Prince Junior, for one) and much fun than what I have seen in the past. <br /> <br /> The plot was not great, but I did not really care about it. Just watch the Chaki and Tifani disorder and fight with each other. And for the last 5th sequence it can be wide open (which I can hear). Adal Hands appears to be premiere and another horror / comedy next week, but I doubt it will be at the top of it.
