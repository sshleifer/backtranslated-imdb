I've just revisited these wonderful memories of the movie's craziness from my first day, and you must ask to steal or borrow it. <br /> <br /> The story begins with the conflict between a righteous Shaolin priest and our villains, Abbott White says that Abbott kicked the White Buddhist ass and wage his campaign against the help of his new Nina allies against Salolin (fighting with the golden ring) Such a golden cloth, a black-haired man who fought with a spear, and my favorite; Fights with pairs who may disappear and reappear as a flying carpet). The rest of the story is obsolete to train disciples of Shoblonian monks, one of which is Alexander the Low. Although our disciplinary training is treated in sequence, the two young attendants must learn the necessary shawlene finger jab technique for defeating Abbott White's vital armor technology, we see some ways of shaping our villain ... Most of the blood is used by nude women using Taoist magic Accumulation We all know how this will end, but in it we are in a cyclical trip. In conclusion, Hong Kong was a good example of what Taiwan was doing while making martial arts films sick and making it more deadly martial arts film. This movie is very good dancer, some nudity, some cows and wall gamikrite enough balls, which even the most magical keepers entertained. Go to your local the same way today! <br /> <br />
