I saw this picture as the last picture of Ezmir Film Festival. I did not know anything about it, but now I'm happy that I did not refuse to see Ding-non-low-less! It is one of the most fun movies I have ever seen and believe I saw movie zillions !! (I'm a movie critic!) Shiny script and dialog ... Smart details ... What else can I say? Andy masterpiece with a completely unique ridiculous style ... she can not stop by now wonder what she is capable of right now. Five years ago Ding-A-Link was shot, and I'm sure the director Oruk's Tuckle is now more mature. I have heard that his next feature will be a political mockery and I really can not wait to see his previous works like "pancax house" ...
