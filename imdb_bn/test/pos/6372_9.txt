A Great Show <br /> <br /> First, those who do not like it .. do not like it, then it will not be seen ... <br /> <br /> It was (was) a terrific show Good according to Jim (mine is a favorite). It shows a real family family (8 opposes the general rules, where everything is curled). <br /> <br /> They are loud, they are dirty ... I can congratulate them for dragging them all in the kitchen. It has happened in real life ... Sara "portal of hell", and fast food boxes like dogs are all like dogs. <br /> <br /> This was a "there" show .... you know coming, but fun to watch because you were there before. <br /> <br /> A good cast, they do great work together, a pretty decent show for a DVD release. Mel Gibson was a highlight of the "safety video" series as well. <br /> <br /> Opinion? Good show, really a DVD release (can not be canceled as well)
