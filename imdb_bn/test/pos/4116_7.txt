I thought this movie was great, Richard Greco and Yasmin Blyth had great chemistry in this film. Yasmine Blythe's character plays a woman who is disappointed to love Richard Greco's character. They marry and end and everything seems perfect without Yasmin Blyth wants more than a child, but trying to imagine her is difficult. Richard Greco will do something to please him, and take extreme steps to make him happy. I thought this movie was great, and it keeps you guessing. It looks naive how one can be when it has fallen into love. Yasmin Blyth is such a good actress, and I wonder why she did not make it in her career. Richard Greco as a treacherous husband is very impressive, and very good part is playing bad. I wonder why some actors did not specify it and anything else. All and a great movie that I would recommend.
