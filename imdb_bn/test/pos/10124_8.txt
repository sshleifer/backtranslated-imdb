Inspired by the true facts, the radio is one of the best performing, heart-felt plays seen to be widely publicized. This is definitely one of the best films of the year 2003. <br /> <br /> Radio Star Ed Harris as Radio Football coach Harold Jones, who is Oscar worthy in this film. Coach Jones is teaching football all his life and loves the game. However, coach Jones played his wife and daughter Debra Wingner and Sarah Draa. One day the radio, Cuba Gooding Jr., who played football at the Man of Honor's best performance, was coached by the coach team. Some members of the team, then tie up the radio and throw him into a building. Then they bang on the building and eventually coach Jones doubts some mistakes. He came and helped the radio, who was scared, and shared a very special bond from that point on the coach Jones and the radio. Radio became the highlight of every football game and really participates in football games and school events. He also maintained the key interest of life coach Jones on football, which was the first major priority of both his family and the radio. <br /> <br /> This film is related to all real-life problems, including the priorities of your life, they are different, death, and family relationships for which they accept it. The film touches all of these things and is done very well and Director Michael Tolen will be proud of this picture. Most of the things about the radio I like it were so real. Performance was to happen right before your eyes to see something in real life. There was a great mix of radio comedy and drama. Some parts were quite funny yet the other part was very serious and sad. At the conclusion, I think the radio received only radio reviews by critics, the radio is very scared. There should be a head on there because there is no wonder why this amazing movie can only get 2 star reviews and some 3 or 4 stars like rock school do not get it, it does not give me any sense. The above mentioned performance is the top notch and Oscar worthy. In my opinion, both Edward Harris, who called me an actor, and Cuba Gooding Jr. both should be nominated for this film. The radio year is one of my favorite movies and still gives me reason to see some of the big Hollywood movies. My final rating for radio is a 9/10.
