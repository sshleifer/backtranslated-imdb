I usually do not like romantic films, but I love this movie a lot. The stories are really touching, and the end is very suitable. I really care too many characters in this film I can feel their feelings. Although most romantic movies always disintegrate and feel annoyed, as soon as I finish it completely, I feel myself starting from the capsa scene running along Sky Beach. I want to rate this image 11 out of 10, because I want to give an extra point for the end. The acting part is very strong. Kate has a good chance to show her talent in Capshaw. Although I am not fascinated with Scott on Dead Man on the campus, 'This film completely changes my view of me. He is so irresistibly charming here Geraldine McEwan is as awesome as ever. <br /> <br /> This film can not be good, complex, deep, or credible, with other movies that deal with the same kind of relationship, such as' El 'Ecole de La Ch√¢teau' or 'Post Cottom, Animal Trist'. But 'The Love Letter' can still make itself proud because it creates a rare light of light on such relationships. And that difference makes this film humbly usable. Dreaming on the overwhelming and small big impressive, DreamWorks, this time you really come true to my dreams.
