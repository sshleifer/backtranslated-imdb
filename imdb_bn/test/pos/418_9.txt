This is not your run-of-the-mill police story where the characters were secondary to gun fighting and driving. The episodes are as realistic and intelligent as possible, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I gave it 9. I hope this series will be for a long time. Excellent!
