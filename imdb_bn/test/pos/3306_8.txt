Great pieces that show how the attitude has changed in 40 years. Great production design, interesting big line ("Miss Bandar, if you could not lose it in a native drum, I do not care!", When speaking of Amanda Farrow Hope Lanz of Joan Croft, when Lanz incredibly asks how he can read very little A large amount of manuscripts briefly). If you have scanned this movie on TV and have scanned on TV and you have not seen it in the non-versioned version of pay-TV or AMC (American Movie Classics), then you have not really seen it. Hopefully, this guilty pleasure of a movie will soon be available in a letterboxed version with the DVD and its original 4-track stereophonic soundtrack. The 1959 New York mood is a great opening sequence in the opening of the great opening, when Janie Mathis starts singing the theme "Best of Everything", a chorus of the image of the image and an echo chamber surrounded by other choruses in the background scam. Abortion! Insanity! Office Romance! Cold cold hearted sitting! love! Here's all to enjoy it.
