Colombian terrorists keep hostage to a military school in the United States until their demands are met. Students decided to fight again. Will they be able to do it? <br /> <br /> Cruelly proved but the movie really works. After the release of this film in 1991, all of the children's fighting group was coming up and coming: San Austin (looks very nice); Will Wheaton (looking sad); Keith Kuogan; George Perez (Token Latino is very nice, very muscular and mostly shown without tight underwear); T.E. Russell (Black People Token) and Shane Drop. None of these are very good actors (except Astin), but who care? This is a stupid action film. The only other good performance is Danamel Elliott (having a ball as headmaster) and Louis Gusset as junior dean. <br /> <br /> more than anything, doubt, explosion and a little brain. In other words --- fun! <br /> <br /> Only complaint (and it is minor) - it's a little longer (three ends) and many casual, bloody violence (and the rating was well earned). Yet, I've enjoyed it a lot.
