Beautiful ... that one word mostly sums up this whole movie. Everything from cinematography, direction, acting ..... bright. At any time in the movie, you can pause it and you will not doubt that you are viewing some mosaics or "arts france" I assure you, after seeing one, "bikrash" will be stuck on your head. I know this from the first hand experience. Even the soundtrack is great. It goes together with the sound and speed of the film. Thanks grateful that cam arc exists in this world. The need for more people like him to create films that show love and shame in the real (and miraculous) images.
