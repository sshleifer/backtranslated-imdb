Finally, I have had the opportunity to set and compare two versions of this movie - First, the old, well-known old-fashioned, slammer embassy VHS print known as SCREAMERS, and then every new new media media company, the new fully restored Italian DVD, Italy No one is involved. <br /> <br /> Americans "Men Inside Inside", as everyone says, completely confusing, and Roger indicates chromanized that would otherwise be considered as an extraordinary fantasy-adventure thriller. Big up The entire Italian version is somewhat spreading on "Dr. Moreau Island", well-designed and deliberately taken steps, and there is no mistake in it. It's a wonderful, handsome Euro Hororend Brain, good plot, character development, location shooting, time-consuming and set etc. However, it must be acknowledged that 14-year-old poultry weeds are still hiding somewhere, my inner ruckus has emerged from the lollids, lazy, and many versions of Roger, which is something beautiful on top of Gore, a dazzling But the rebel opening segment, and then most of Martino's original film, though, create ideas about the somewhat narrow Roger Entertainment. The pacing was slightly faster, the shock sequences were close together, and as much as you could in the expanded Italian version. See the amazing form of boycott. <br /> <br /> I still do not have much of my own, though the concept of the particular story is worrying: there are many plots and official characters that are hard to keep track of. A local Voodoo Sub-place did not help a lot, and it is interesting how a big prisoner and a madman have been confronted in the big prison, and probably there are some more philosophies. I would say: Supporters of the movie will enjoy themselves in one of these PAL imports and look at a movie instead of just another vague old home video - WideScreen shot compositions again reveal that Martino's eyes are to fill her screen with interesting stuff. Their heads can not be cut like scammer printers, but it is still interesting, and again proves that its values ​​were probably very limited to the area around Gutter, but when Roger's order created it, it was a good trash for those funny, as well as alongside stars. A better movie than to be. <br /> <br /> 7/10
