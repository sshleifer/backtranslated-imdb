This was the most worried capital punitive movie! It was refrained from being considered unilateral and the emotion felt throughout the story is real as it can get. This movie was the most 'human' (and I am using this word properly) Sometimes a compassionate religious character! This movie actually finds me out and reads the book (which is rare for me). Sister Helen stretches more of a spiritual tone than a religious (which is very rare). And it presented this topic to both sides so that people on both sides of the movie think that a point was not dropped. And we have a thank you director for that. This is not a film for entertainment. But this is a message that provides a message that can reach the heart of your heart. I can not think of another film like it.
