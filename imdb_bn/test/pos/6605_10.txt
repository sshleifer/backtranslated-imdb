Dogtown and Z-boys <br /> <br /> Description: Dogtown and Z-boys are a documentary about a group of revolutionary youth that has changed the world of surfing and skboarding in Venice (Dogton), California, worldwide, we know it. With their humble style, they started the dominant journey of Larry Burtlin, which led to numerous successes and a few failures. Following the revised Doggown's articles on the rest of Skogboarder magazine, this game was reviewed and Jeff Ho's members forgot about Jeff Ho and joined other skateboard parties to watch the rest of his life appear on summer holidays to give them the kind of movie they like. Real Jeffair Skboard Team JJ Adams, Tony Alva, Stasi Peralta, Bob Bark, Chris Cahill, Shogo Kubo, Paul Constantine Au, Jim Muir, Peggy Oki, the only woman who was collected by Jeff Ho (Jeffrey Surfership owner) and Craig Static (photographer), Nathan Pratt, Ventzal Roumal fourth, Alan Sarlo and David Ray Perry. Apart from J Adams and Chris Cahill, one of the main members is still good and surfing / skating. During the documentary, J. Adams spent time in drug-related complaints. The documentary was last seen in Chris Cahill, Mexico. Themes: The themes of this documentary are like occasionally-read-lines, but if there was a clear-cut theme it would be that even the kids can spark revolution. In other themes, due to the vast partnership of the past, there may be an incomplete future and be careful in a very fruitful future with your resources carefully. <br /> <br /> Other works: Stasi Peralta (author and director) is a fairly comprehensive documentary that he has written, produced or directed. Most of the common themes of surfing or skateboarding, such as riding giants, Sc 8 TVs, The Horses Brigades and Lord of Dogton. He also made films with a theme of growing up in America, such as: Impact: From yesterday to today, Cripps and Bloods: Made in America, and The 70s: The Decade That Changed Television. Subject: Dogtown and Z-boys are the real members of Jeff's Skboard Team Except Chris Kahill. In Pareta interviews include Jeff Ho and Craig Stecyk. Other topics include Dogtown Articles as well as skateboard enthusiasts in the 70's. Skaters from Dogtown area, but the team has not been interviewed. <br /> <br /> Edit: This opinion was awesome in my opinion. Speaking topics were visible so that the audience could speak and get the sense of the character, but will immediately be exposed to the archive's footage, explaining what the speaker is saying. When a song can better explain the emotions of things, such as the unfortunate life of J Adams when it was a subject of discussion, Neil Young found the song Old Man, which expresses many emotions. Sin Pan described the film and he explained the infection throughout the film. The Zephyr Surf team was put together to create this screen for a scrobar team, all z-boys who were randomly presented from other skate companies or to leave their creations to create their own company. <br /> <br /> Cinematography: The picture was shot interestingly. The talk content of the talk was all black and white, and Z-Boys had all the archive footage footage of surfing or skating. Of course, the footage of the 70s was visible, but it only improved the film. Interviews were mostly shot in the same area shown, but all were outside. The footage also got very amazing which even the archive footage was very well controlled. <br /> <br /> Music: "season of seasons" - edited by eroskith "The Atkins of Toys" - Published by Eroskit "Generation Landscape" - Alice Cooper "and Way Way Out" - The Alumni Brothers "Lollipops" Pink "and "Whip cream" - performed by Half Separt "Into the Void" and "Paranoid" - Black Sabbath "Godzilla" - Blue oyster cult "Aladdin Sane" and "Rebel Rebel" - David Bowie "Fastcars" - Buzzcocks performed by "Gut Feeling "- Devo" I'll give you "- Peter Frumpton" Funk 49 "- James Gang" Easy Rider "and" Foxi Lady "and" Freedom "and" Bold As Love "- Jimmy Hendrix" Sidewell Surfing "- John and Dean" Achilles's Last Stand " And "Hot on for Coverage" - led Zeppelin "Six Underground" - Snicker Pimps "Surfidor" - The Live Lines One "Bit Scratch Fever" and "Motor City Madhouse" and "Wang Dang" Sweet Doontang - Ted Nugent "Use and Theme" - Pink Floyd "Bad Boy" - The Pendents "Maggie May" - Rod Stewart "I Want to Be Your Dog" and "Gum Danger" - Stogs "Child of Revolution" - T-Rex "Bad Reputa Tone "- Thin Leighy" Disco Inferno "- The Tramps" Hannah "- Rob Tower" Rocky Mountain Way "- Joe Walsh" Old Man "- Neil Young" La Grange "- ZJJ <br /> <br /> Making movie cinema.
