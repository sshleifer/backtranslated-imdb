I really like this show. It has rolled one of all the drama, romance, and comedy. I'm 28 years old and I'm a married mother, so I can identify both Laurelie and Rory's experiences. I've seen most of the repeat in the family channel recently, so I'm not up to date now. I think women would love this show more than men, but I know some men will enjoy it! I do not really want it an hour long and half an hour, I seem to fly hours by looking at it! Give it a chance if you do not see the show! I think Lorelei and Luke are my favorite character of this event, mainly on the way to being with each other. How do you see something in it (or I think it will take a long time to see it)? <br /> <br /> Good look!
