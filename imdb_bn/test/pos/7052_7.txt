When this came as a young teen, I completely related it. As an adult of present-day sex-emotive American culture, it is not enough nudity which is known as trivial. <br /> <br /> If you look for America's pie-type fog, laziness or fur and junkies, the Matches will be disappointed with impunity and guarantee. <br /> <br /> If you like Bill Murray, and you love good fun, you probably love this movie and enjoy it. Similarly, stripes, hostbusters, caddy shack etc. <br /> <br /> Enough, just watch it, and stop it intellectualization. It is drunk, crying aloud! Why read a review? Just enjoy it and have fun. And ignore trash conversations by others. Film, like many other things in life, is subjective. Each his own <br /> <br /> Always keep an eye on 'experts' who reduce the taste of others.
