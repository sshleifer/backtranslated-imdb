The piece LUCK followed a homeless drifter as he became entangled in the world of underground crime of fraud and chaos. Archie (Norman Ridas) is released from prison and there is nothing to lose.

Earache soon expressed his strong desire to kill a lover dancer for Carnival, his mischievous wife, Divina (Dagmar Domnagic). When Archi loves Divan, it becomes complicated and warns about its plans. They are involved very steamily, which puts the imagination of the viewers a little, then they make a plan soon. Together they planned to kill Ik, but the plans were not quite planned. <br /> <br /> I said that if this picture does not surprise me, I will lie. I personally, this film was blown up by how good it was. While renting it a couple of years ago, I look forward to another clich√© thriller with many common elements shown in many movies of this type and themes. Within a few minutes I was involved in this film. This is such a movie, like Buflo 66, it only sucks and feels stylish and paranoid. It is a film that really pulls it into a stunning fashion. One thing I particularly appreciate is how the film depicts its character. The film is not easy and clean that can be displayed in the plot summary. These are letters that you really care about and are fascinated despite having bad guys with characters. Actually, there are no good guys or bad guys in this movie. All the characters are flawed in ways that are realistic and incredibly true-life. Just like the film is a shameless act, there are not many movies to complete this work, but it is certainly a movie genre that I like and I want to see more from today's film. There were several criminal films in the early 50's, but since then it was not that unique and unique! <br /> <br /> In terms of flaws, I have a very small firmness. The film itself is not exactly the original. However, I suspect that most people would expect it to be real. The film's editing style can also disturb some people because it has camcorder type cameras. Although I was not disturbed by it and actually I thought it was added to the atmosphere, I am sure that most viewers will not be free by it and it can usually stop it. Despite minor flaws, it was one of the most underrated films of the 2000s. To be lucky and it shows an unknown movie unknown, which is very good. It seems that this movie was a direct release on the video, though this film is much better than that. If it is kept in the theater, it can not win any awards and it is not seen much, but it gets much recognition from today. Recognize that this film deserves. TOUGH LUCK is a wonderful, entertaining, and flexible non-dramatic thriller that is in real sense and genuine enough to make the average moviegoers more than just the genuine sense of style and style JUSTSPAPZ.
