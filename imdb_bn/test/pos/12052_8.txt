I've never seen a Bollywood movie before, but I caught it for the first ten minutes, smiling myself and smashing the R button in Sky. I'm happy i did !! I hope I do not insult anyone (because, basically, BF and I like it!) But like the actors we could not take it half seriously - especially the illusory (which I understand, it's a huge Bollywood star because we're covering it with many DVDs I saw it and today I saw a doll in Hamili !! BF holds this block - I started thinking that she was frustrated! She said it is strange A traditionally well-liked person should be the hero of a movie! But then we like stocks that are not your stock's predictable Hollywood fare). <br /> <br /> It was completely above the top but was really good fun. If all Bollywood movies are like this then we are seeing more. This blumin song is on my blog all week and I can not say Hindi word! Any recommendation of PS will be appreciated!
