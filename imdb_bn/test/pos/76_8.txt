I think I love this film and I know what to do; This is not perfect, but under the title "The Americanization of Lily", this impressive and memorable semi-musical archetype I can be recommended to receive more praise and still like those who have recognized their special Black-Edwards-genteel, clever-produced soul. Humor and difficult descriptions. The unlikely but delightful storyline follows Lily Smith, a freemen-type spy in Germany for a simple and less black-white battle. Going to Lily Schmidt Smith, she is helping her uncle who is patriotic for Germany, but cruel or political, only opportunistic Lily's goal is William Lerrobi, a charismatic US Squadron leader who can provide her valuable information. When Lily falls in love with Lily in love, the plot grows further, her eyes are open for the consequences of open spies, and she sees the impact of the war on people injured in hospital and she understands what it means to her male and she likes to understand. He became envious of Larrabee's opponents, then realized that he could no longer do what he was doing and leave the spying business. The film's logical end comes after the end of the terrible WWI, when he is singing the theme of the film "Wisning" in a dark theater, one after another, with his own boyfriend, Lorarabi's Squadron members appear that they have forgiven him and his former opponents; And even Uncle Cart has enthusiastically joined "It's a Long to Tipperrury" song, which refers to the world as good again. It's a weird and somewhat brilliant story idea, written by director William Blackstone, director Black Edwards and "John Goldfarb"; And it's a delightful story. Larbyby's squadron fills this animated film with a drunk that keeps crying and other loving types; And the feeling of this stylish and burning film almost his space and perception, almost epic. Credit must be for Jack Beer and Donald Brooks for their dress, Reg Allen and Jack Stevens sets, Fernando Correa's other beautiful production design, Henry Mancini has his sensitive and appropriate music scores and Russell Harlan for his flickering film. In the beautiful footage, the original actor is Julie Andrews Lily, as Rock Hudson Lerarby, Larry's Uncle Cart, Michael Witten, Lions Percival as a casual pilot, as the outstanding Gloria Paul Lily's streetising competitor and many other wonderful actors as beautiful actors. Small parts. It is difficult to speculate about the speed or the elaborate broad comedy. This element was presented by Edwards to eat the horrors of the real war, for example, with the comic-opera approach, which fought in the more innocent-human age of human civilization. This comedy also helps Lily to prepare for the transition path, recognizing the reality of what she is doing in recognition of the responsibility of the German state, and possibly accepting what is happening. This is a rare "sensible" film about Lilli's "Americanization", in his own real world, and then before being tragedy among others. It's hunting, I find, and beautiful in many ways. I consider it to be mastermind of managing Black Edwards; And under the title "The Americanization of Lily", I believe that it does not believe in any change that it has been recognized as a polished sapphire film in a film that I know by every standard.
