I tried to correct why this movie was so bad that when a rating is given between 7 and 10 for most of the reviews. Because this movie may be difficult to describe in a positive review, although some have already done quite nicely that worked. This picture is confusing, depressing, and does not have a happy ending. I still gave PÃ´le X 10 rating, because it was essentially mixed in literature and industry for me. It really made my favorite kind of film. I only saw two pictures of Karax: This and Movis Sung When I call one of Karaksea's best films with this movie, I'm a little excited - but I Carax has a short style. If such a movie does not appease to you and is boring, then it will not be good to see it. But Polo XVVS was less than Sango, so it was very intense for my thriller - at least for my taste. I found it quite interesting and absorption. Acting in two lead roles did an excellent job. (I mean lead and young girl she was half her sister.) Catherine D is always great, but her role was not very big or significant in the story. But everyone worked well. I thought Bhakti material was great It may not be very credible, but it is instead rather abstract. There is a lot going on in this photo line. This is a very Freudian Psycho Thriller.
