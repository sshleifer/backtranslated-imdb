This brilliant English comedy about school girl antics is a neglected gem. Where are the significant questions to viewers? This image has got 10 ratings with most voters, but how many voters? They do not make such a comedy because the film is not distributed or seen. I will never miss a chance to see this old art house classic again. But where is the Art House?
