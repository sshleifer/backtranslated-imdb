Best Years of Non Live, a movie that exploded under my radar for years - I heard about it, but it was not a chance to see it. Thanks, for the TCM on Demand, I was able to see it void and commercially free. <br /> <br /> I was surprised by this movie about how soon after the war. This movie is physically and mentally speaking to people injured in the war. It manages to integrate almost all kinds of combat experiences in three letters. <br /> <br /> We had an air force officer who was an experienced European bomb attack. Because of the horrific accidental rate among the bombers, the Air Force gained fame quickly to defend officials quickly. This was the case with a man who suffered from a lowly under-soda jarak, a captain and his B-17 bombing. He is also suffering from PTSD known as "fatigue of war" at that time. <br /> <br /> We have a military non-complex working in the Pacific and are afraid of the operation. His story is against the Air Force colleague that he became infuriated by the army as a banker and was promoted to sergeant. From her slave strip it is clear that she is the sergeant's highest level, yet she is in the front row. <br /> <br /> Finally we have our navy, who are part of the helpless support staff. , Commonly known as REMFs (Rear Eqilan MFers) by Fellow on Line. Wickedly, while working as a mechanic under deck under naval ship, he enjoys the most serious physical wounds, his ship may be hit by kamikaze and 400 lives. He pulled from the water, but his badly burnt hands were distorted and replaced with a toe hook. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How do these air travels in the three aircrafts on the air transport plane and how they re-modify civil society? <br /> <br /> Most affected me about this movie, despite the obvious problems faced by three plays, it never comes to Melodrama. Navy children played by an actual amputee, may be sorry for her where we are placed for situations, yet the script does not allow us to feel that passion. The army sergeant is obviously an alcoholic, and the story indicates it, but never lives in it. Air Force struggled with the loss of Captain's condition when he was forced to return to the drug stores made of soda (now bought by a big chain) and disrespectful to support his ungrateful and savage wife. <br /> <br /> These characters give lots of opportunity for some dramatic measurements regarding their plot, but it can be avoided properly. But for very dramatic scores, the director is walking around the obvious exploitation. <br /> <br /> Representing the whole movie in one scene, the Army Sergeant's daughter (Frederick March) discusses with her father and mother related to the Air Force captain. Despite her marriage, she fell in love, and she is convinced of breaking the marriage, which is obviously annoyed. Now we have seen thousands of scenes where Baba is angry and the girl wanders in her house in tears, closing the door and falling on the bed. Later, mother shows, consoles daughter and gives mother tongue knowledge and everyone lives happily with everyone. <br /> <br /> In the Beyonel, this scene plays completely different than the one described above. Surely the conversation gets heated, but all sides are reasonable, and there is a serious and timeless discussion about the nature of the relationship which I have seen some of the best conversations. Finally, BYOOL is a highly satisfied film, thrown into full with honest performance. Technically, it's good shot, editing and cinematography frames, but never overshadow the gripping details. Despite scores, which are cliche and over dramatic, I give this movie the highest rating which is definitely worth it
