*** There are spoilers *** <br /> <br /> It's played in a lovely movie, Brad Renfro and has ever played the wonderful Joseph Mazzello. I like Joseph Magello, out of the movies I have seen, I've liked each of them for many different reasons and the treatment is not different. Brad Renfro as well as this movie is very good. The treatment comes from a sick child and a friend / old film from his friend's perspective. <br /> <br /> The main idea is: Dester (Joseph Magello) AIDS. He adds a child to friend on the next side (Brad Renfro), but Eric's mom is very narrow, sick and somewhat "thick" at Dixter's illness. He thinks AIDS is infectious like ordinary Cold, so his son is not going anywhere near China Dexter. <br /> <br /> After many attempts to cure himself without any success, the boy went on the way to New Orleans. Find a cure after reading it about a pufflet. After receiving their kick from Playboy Magazine, Dester's health soon moved to the south and ended the health, while still enough breath of breath for the boy, enough life for two hobbies. Unfortunately, the poor Dexter actually died from his illness, leaving behind his poor Erik why he could not find healing. Throughout the film, she maintains more relationships with Dexter's mother than herself. <br /> <br /> This is a very heartfelt film and absolutely not perfect (film rarely) but you do not notice less about her as you involve more film. Joseph Majello is certainly one of his best performances for fans. Very good recommendations to watch movies - you can find a copy :)
