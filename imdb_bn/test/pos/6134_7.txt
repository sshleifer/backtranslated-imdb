Yes I saw this short series as my baby and my father as a child. It was one of my few years short series that could actually follow my 9 year old mind. I think it works very well, and is not necessarily usually a sense of shit mini series. It is basically a basic idea that grabbed your attention, less or less. I would recommend these miniseries to a fan of history and plot twists. Although most of the twists in this movie are spelled or predictable, it is still worth it. However, I have yet to check whether you can get it through Netfix. I will not imagine. They should play history channels or something.
