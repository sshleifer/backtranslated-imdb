From the beginning you will love the character of Sam Eliot (Falun): A trusted policeman who is especially loyal to his partner But he is very loyal and very important when he sees his partner dead on a lane, and he thinks he is an attacker before giving him a chance to explain. Falun is a drunkard, and it drives him to be self-controlled, although he arranges to give attention to whoever is actually looking after his partner's death. He carries with a rookie as his new partner (which seems to be seen often in the film), but SEO Morales works well with Sam Elliott, although Marlos starts fixing the pieces of pieces to start a self-approved investigation of Falun; He really wants to find answers because Fallon does not let him enter the whole story and he does not like what he gets. The bad detectives who do not have the last minute, which is fine; And they are not able to join Fallon, which leads to a dramatic finish. With a touch of silly from Paul Sorvino, all acting fine around, those of the detective captain. This is a good movie that you want to see it many times; So it qualifies as a past view, and a good addition to a movie collection! (Filmed in San Francisco)
