When I hired the first Batman Returns, I immediately thought it would be less than exceptional. I mean, Jack Nicholson is undoubtedly the best part of the first, so how could a good movie be without him? Throw in easy, Danny Davito. <br /> <br /> A controversial more dark film than Batman Returns Batman. There are many more villains, fewer dark dark comedies, and more nervous-interesting topics. However, if the music is not bold then the first is similar. Scenery is definitely more depressing than all the details, first in comparison to the year. This movie follows the same comic-style format as the same batman. <br /> <br /> Now for performance. Michael Keaton is back as Batman / Bruce Wayne. He is the first movie great, and this is just as a sigl. There was not enough screen time in the world for Keaton as Batman, more! Danny Davito has sometimes given an award-winning performance as the Penguin, the most hateful, hateful, loving, angry, evil, sad, kind-hearted villain to grace a superhero movie. You hate him very much but at the same time it feels very bad for him. And this explains to him the last story, it creates more conflicts. Michelle Pfeiffer was as excellent as Catwoman / Selina Kyle. One in two completely different personalities. He actually got a good amount of stories back as well. Christopher Waken Max Shrek, Govi, Roy, was not as disappointed as the selfish CEO of the power company. Michael Gough also humbly brought back as Alfred, and he was also good at here. Pat Hinglow also came back as Gordon, although I think he was not really in the spotlight. <br /> <br /> With many wonderful twists and sub-plots, Batman Returns must be confirmed by any fan. <BR> <br /> 9/10
