This movie surprised me. The box is confusing, the tagline is confusing and the film's clothing and tune are confusing. The movie is quite serious, well played and beautiful shot. Special effects seem to be top quality and before their time, unless you come out of this movie in 1979, it will not be recommended in 1963. It is Mourou is a unique character in the story, and is featured in a better version. Highlight the first fifteen minutes and most ludicrous, but the film does not really really fall apart. Definitely valuable if you are a fan of dramatic costumes / horror classics and Gore-Fest.
