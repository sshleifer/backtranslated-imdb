The low budget thriller is created nicely, which you can do with more twists and turns, and at the same time you can also do a lot of humorous humor. <br /> <br /> Cast is playing very well, although Richards' self-centric movie director is a little harder to take time. The scene of the worst two scenes of Sir Alex Ginnes was seen as a criminal offense of Moscow. It is covered only on a cake. <br /> <br /> Good to be seen, but not in the dark night alone!
