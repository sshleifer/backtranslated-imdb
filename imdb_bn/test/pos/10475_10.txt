Some people comment on subtitles in this movie - I want to be different - the facial expressions and the fine interactions between the characters that you can not even move your eyes for a fraction of a second. I tried to watch the DVD in English to overcome this problem (do not make this mistake, the result is a quarrel). The only way to get the full benefit is to see it quickly or two times in succession, so that you know it and then ignore the subtitles. An acting master class - Conversation but not body language. <br /> <br /> This is a small thing - the postmaster / shopkeeper leaks on his chest and gets his cap before sending a letter from him! France As the joy of the grapes of perfect grapes, the general's disrespectful expression highlights a reference to the Bible with the ability to 'stay there'. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is remarkable and awkward minimalist village which is ok with its washed color when it comes to enthusiasm accentuates enthusiasm. A friend of mine who claimed to be coming down from Borgias and his family policy is, 'If it is good to do so, then it is valuable to spare.' - Amen. <br /> <br /> I laugh and cry, I see this picture
