Finally !! Sandra Bullock is really a pretty woman, but finally I was able to act as an actress! Forget the speed predictive keynote, when you are slipping, forget about the clennix-sheet forecast - it tests it! <br /> <br /> And she's great! A techno-feminist role that works well on the screen, one that is very close to the bone. The issues raised do not appear fully and with full experience, it also helps with a great supporting cast, which makes it unusable for several hours. <br /> <br /> You can not chat with others again, I'm actually very annoying writing this review ... ER ... bye!
