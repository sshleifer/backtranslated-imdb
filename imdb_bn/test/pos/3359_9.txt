25 sitcoms were big screen spins off. Most of these came in the 1970's. Here's a list of all: You are slaves, Blackdooder, Enjoy this House, Below, Daddy's Army, Father's Favorite Father, Love for Adher, George and Milldale, League of Gentlemen, Love Your Neighborhood, Lover, People Near the Closest, Neighborhood Dear, do not think quality, on the width, in buses (3), please sir, poros, rising dumps, stapto and gold (2), this is your Wherefore, until death does us part. (2), up Pomie (3), Hack-o, whatever the possible ladders and oops apocalypse happened. <br /> <br /> So my favorite sitcom dad army was a big screen for all time. Focused on what the film was about when men were listed. It is difficult to get a uniform and get arms. It was a big summary of the first series of the Dodge Army. At the end of the film, they hold some German spies in the church. The home guard was dressed as a server change and had bayonets with them and defeated the Germans. The best bit of film when they were watching HG lectures and German lectures at the same time: German: Head Office on the phone, you will get 10,000 bombs (God will do the homage) God: On the Mrs. Mainwiring phone, you get 1 / 2lb Brucele Sprouts. <br /> <br /> This is probably the second best sitcom spin movie off, it was only beaten by Til Death You Part (1969). It would have been better before the movie started, it was already formed, it was half through war. Although still an excellent movie, a good for the family.
