I saw it in a preview and it did not appear in the United States, but it was one of the more enjoyable little comedies. It is a small British city competition contest between two funeral directors. In the third episode [movie] the plot disappears suddenly, but the characters are very enjoyable and memorable <br /> <br /> Acting is great across the board. Blockbuster is sure to ignore the accident, it's a movie that is looking for. I will try to hold it in the theater again and / or buy videos.
