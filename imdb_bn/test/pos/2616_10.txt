This episode is not as inconsistent as another person. The source agreed to help because if he could not obey his words, if you pay attention ... He said (after frowning) to agree to stay there from hell, "hunt him and his daughter in law so that I am not in the future thinking about them "... and, instead of accepting Dell, he did not give permission to warn SEEsers on the phone, so Private Died, because he was pipe The hardest hit was the head, and this time there was not a phone for LEO, and the highest in the past that he was killed Leo. Next time pay more attention! And after this episode "will not continue ..." This is the end of season 3, and season 4, they can not show anything from Prue because it owns the rights of "rights", so the producers have to pay for what they see. This is the last episode he is!
