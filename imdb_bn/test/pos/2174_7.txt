First of all, I admit that I did not read this particular Balzak novel, so maybe I am directing the director and editor to my cavilades. Still my experience with Balzac in other stories is that he does not write as a realist, an obscurantist. It must of course be of a movie, but eventually it gets completely annoyed. The colonel was a fraud, which the lawyer used for his own end (or who was outside for himself); Or the colonel was not cheated, but he was used as a solicitor by the lawyer; Or did the lawyer really try to serve the honest colonel? The director and / or editor thinks I have deliberately hidden these questions, which do not look like realistic Balzac. At the same time, film characters do excellent work to illustrate, unless their objectives and cast and production are fantastic. That opening battleground scene is bound to hunt one's dreams. Yet, there is a general surprise in contemporary film makers to enjoy ambiguity in any other matter. Is Yves Angelo complicated enough for these characters to have problems and intentions?
