This is a malicious curiosity, operated by a person who manages the "Texas Chess genocide". Chuck Concerts gives an outstandingly high-level performance of the "wax" museum on the street by the road as the owner of the ruins near the ruins of our deaf children. Wax statistics are "true", it is seen in one direction. Hey, hey, hey ... psychological horror and old fashion "wax house" - is not a slash film as a weird mix of style terrorism. I can think of many, many terrible films that are worse than this.
