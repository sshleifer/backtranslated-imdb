Like Mel Brook's other comic, men in tights are laughable. But seeing it as an incompatible comedy, I think many people do not realize that this movie is so funny because the characters have been well-behaved. Elwes is a British British noble, Lewis is an eternal king annoyed (I hope it is all valuable!), DeLuise is a French godfather, Roger Rees is a worried and cynical Sheriff .... Actors and actresses are so loyalty in their part that the trick is easily Is flowing. Yes, we have seen this kind of comedy before, but I think, Big Chiboski, the only comedy to achieve good character development. Very funny
