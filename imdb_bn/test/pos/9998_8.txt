I was unusually impressed by this picture. It's one of the best sports movies I've seen. This movie is outstanding in the visual. I love the sequences that the camera tracks the ball in the air or through the cup. The film offers both moving, excitement and drama well. Cinematography was fantastic. <br /> <br /> Performing performances are superb. I am surprised by the young Shia La Bauf He works well in this role. Steven Dillon is just as good as Harry Warden's Bruding. Peter Firth, Justin Ashforth, and Elias Coats supported support. The film is great and entertaining and for the first time in my life, I want to see a golf tournament.
