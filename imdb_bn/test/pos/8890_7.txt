A delicate black comedy about middle-aged scalp (Danny Davito) who wants to suppress his mound and plans to do a wicked divorce, who wants to beat his ex-wife. The film is completely illogical, and does not let anyone like us, but once it is closed, it works for the film instead. <br /> <br /> Ana Ramsey as the mother of Davito's Battlefield, steals a great performance performance show. Although she is awful, you have been transformed for him, because he seems to be kicking both the devito and crystal bands behind his back and at the same time. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
