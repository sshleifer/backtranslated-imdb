Canadian filmmaker Ron Swiez gave a tremendous journey to the film, in a strong, non-stop thriller "Science Credited". A terrible giant takes revenge on his mother, a police officer and an apartment building tenants. Bright real make-up and special effects designs create really awesome monsters, especially when ambient shadows and depressed apartment settings hide through the smoke. Characters are nicely enhanced with outstanding and surprising touching performances from a ensemble cast. Ron Switzer, the creator of Doon Switzer's producer, Ron Switzer, has written the face-read script, a roller-coaster road, twist, turn and terror that guides you to the last frame. Crazed Science No doubt you leave long haunted after the suspicious conclusion. Highly recommended!
