Unless you usually intend to pay a little more attention to other movies, one of the best "thrillers" you'll see on it. The film depicts an event that can happen in real life; It seems to be nothing, actually imagined. It also illustrates how people can react in real images. <br /> <br /> In fact, it looks so good that it feels like real life. Get together with the lack of soundtracks and you've got the best news-like movie you've ever seen. Jane Fonda and Jack Lamon are particularly good at this seventeenth masterpiece, expressing concern at the end and expressing genuine grief at the end of it. I highly recommend it to those who love thriller.
