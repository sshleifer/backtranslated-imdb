I first saw this movie in the early 80's on the cable. 60, culture, war, music, race, and I'm sure I was certain as a statement about a bunch of something unique. But almost a year ago it came back to my life when I started enjoying it with my son. He is young for many themes (9), but he does not realize that the dancing hippies are fun, and he concludes that the last is ironic. Although I can not think of other movies of this type, it is my love alone. It's a unique justice in Central Park. Most of the musical instruments lost, one way or another. "Tommy" was handed at the top and heavily handed, "Oliver" seemed like a crowd control on the silver screen, "The Wall" was so abstractly selfish and kind wine, but listening to the "failure of the fever" from the hair correctly sounds for our time today, as in eighty Was, as it should be in 60 percent ... the real timeless.
