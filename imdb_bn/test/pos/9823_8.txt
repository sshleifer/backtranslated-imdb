Like many, I was attracted to the combination of Paul, Ford and Scott-Thomas. Observe the work of Pollack and Ford in Sabrina, a good film and rehearsing of old elements carefully. When I heard the production of this film, I read the book. Immediately it seems that it is a difficult story Characters are not always sympathetic, no comedians and authors create a number of plot shortcuts to focus on their original theme: It will be a little less: Because, each one will see each other that it will share the unique combination of harm and betrayal, plane accidents, Surprised husbands want to find each other. Moreover, he thinks that this resolution can come both by bitter searches of the adulterous life of adulterous, and the experience of "thick and thin" may fall deeper than before. Although most of the book deals with their bitterness and the hatred of their former partners, the last acknowledgment and forgiveness can be found. Film script only maintains the fate of air crash and spouses sharing. In this book women researchers attacking, the man and woman of the film are never interested co-researchers. This film is a complete new dramatic sub-plot for Harrison Ford, which has more than twice the frequency of aircraft accidents. "The congressman for re-election" is a new sub-plot for women, but it works even better. This story focuses on a very bitter pill because the audience can not meet the expectations of pure romance or romantic comedy. While the book's resolution and forgiveness can be found, there is no similar moments in the film, allowing readers to increase the burden of bitterness and permit libivism. Although forgiveness is never indicated, but after shooting, we were forced to heal that there is dual duty in shooting. Ford's character can not be a stranger to a few words, and the change of speech of Scott-Thomas is a bit annoying at first. This image is not the dead loss offered by others. However, this is a reason to appreciate a solid film, the rewriting of the screen and the adaptation are previously below the quality achieved by the director thrown.
