This is a fantastic film. Acting I saw something good. Tatyana Samojlova is probably very nice, and she automatically draws you into the film with her credible acting. Cinematography was ahead of its time. By seeing this, I could see parallel cinematography used today. It's really a groundbreaking film. Due to cinematography and acting, visitors can feel the voice change from beginning to end in the voice of the movie changing environment. This is a very sensitive and powerful piece. My friend told me to see it, and I must agree with her. It's one of the things you watch that watch and never forget. Everyone will see this intense moving film. This should keep everyone in the movie "________ (whatever)" list beforehand.
