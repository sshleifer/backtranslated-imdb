Above all, there is a nice film from the time and source (Warner Bros. Coming because it reached telegraphy and style just before WWII), but you will not take it seriously. The film does not claim to be historically correct, and it is certainly not that JFK is less or less accurate. (It may actually be more honest about it, although it is essentially acknowledged as the fact that it is not particularly practical but much more stylish semi-heroic imagery.) It was more naive about today's story during the audience; The New York Times review acknowledged that viewers described "the real mistakes that have spread throughout the film", describing the life story of the client as "fantastic" and mention that the presentation of the motivation of the client on final events was contradictory to the various historical accounts. They could actually go to the overboard to build casters, one thinks, but they succeed successfully by illustrating them as sharp or the most industrious people around them, but properly defined, principals and inspirational. <br /> <br /> Flin and DeHavilland, doing their 8th film together 7 years (and their end) together, they are so comfortable together and play easily with each other, ignoring how much their orphanage can be written here It's not too hard to do. It's hard to imagine that the first pair could draw Elizabeth closer to the cast, but these two work. The film has absolved its director (together partly Michael Cartridge) together with their previous seven films, but it has been given that he has worked with the same theme with the same theme, Santa Fe Tril, of the previous year, if he chooses to skip it, but one understands. (They all started together with the charge of Captain Blood and Light Brigade - both are horrific - so if we can start them all in a hurry, we can not blame them) <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> Here, the director is more comfortable with the order of action - which is outstanding - and everything else outside. Interior scenes are a bit unusual, but studio craftsmen are very successful in compensating for the "normal suspects" of Warner Brass and new faces (Greenstreet, Gene Lockheart, Anthony Quinn, Arthur Kennedy, etc.). Kennedy's character would be even better than that (I usually like her work), but here she seems to be hurt by the same notes of almost every scene; The part may be well-written - and it may seem uncertain that they might not be able to manage, because he was only in film for a year (Walsh probably picked him after being together with Hi Sierra). <br /> <br /> Garawein's original artwork on various highlights (possibly fantasy) is included as a caviar theme. Particularly outstanding in the last half hour, especially with the part of leads in the competition at the end of their screen partnership, following the final war scene. A thoroughly enthusiastic adventure <br /> <br /> 8
