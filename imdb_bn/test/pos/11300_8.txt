I have heard about this picture many days ago and eventually it was found in Ibne in five rupees. I was not much but waiting, I was never surprised. It reminds me of the story of love for a boy and girl, who wants a girl for himself and wants to get out of a big castle, for the PS2, the ICO reminds me because some shots lend you title. This movie is insane! It was not difficult to believe in creating such an animated feature in 1952. Also, the king is probably one of the longest scenes in a woman's walk, strange eyes (usually crossed), and a soft voice of voice. My only problem with the film was that the boy and girl had no personality and at least even in addition to a line Mr. The wonderbird (a big talk green bird) save them. The animation was fantastic in some cases but some cells were missing in some scenes. It is incredibly original and occasionally loud funny with flying police and giant matches, it's really a good movie because it's a vague title, it's a real shame. Check it out for a while.
