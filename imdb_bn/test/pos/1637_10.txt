This is definitely the most exciting X-Files episode in the first season. This episode seems like when I hear "x-files". The plot is easy but exiting. Our main cast plus some scientists are going to investigate an Alsakan square where the research agency has killed each other. It removes a small parasite which is excavated by the ice, the research team is infected. Parasites attach themselves to the brain and make madness and madness. Soon some people can not believe that they can believe, or who are infected or not. <br /> <br /> This episode was a direct tribute to John's greatest horror movie "Things". Thing is set in Antarctica and a group of scientists found a debris where it killed residents or killed themselves. An underworld was buried out in the ice for 10000 years. It has the power to imitate any life form. Therefore, the main characters can not be independent friends from enemies. <br /> <br /> Trust me, Things are one of the exterior and exciting horror movies you can ever see. If you like the IQ episode, then I suggest you see it. Or if you only see Things, then I suggest you look at the ICE. <br /> <br /> ICE John Kerrentar's best respect / tribute I have ever seen, and it is alive as one of his inspirations. Best X-Files Episode. I pay it a 10/10.
