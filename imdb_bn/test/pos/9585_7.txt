Fritz Freelong's 'All-Abder-RD-D' is one of the best selecer and TV cartoons. Contrary to many repetitive cartoons in the series, which replaces only the same tired gags in a new setting, 'All Abar-RD-D' makes most of its ideas. Tweety and Sylvester being sent home unpatched by trains who are domestic pets. Finishing work with both the volunteer officer and a naughty bulldog to work with him. Sylvester and TV cartoons are always benefited from some additional participants and a good example of how much 'All Abar-RD-D' helps these additional characters. Although they did not create memorable memories, they created some more obstacles in Sylvester's path and made more interesting battles. This is the first silvester and tivy to press many buttons on the lower right, and when the tivit is often annoying with its forced authority, Sylvester and dog have some delicious violent antics, which are surprisingly uncomfortable with Tweety non-quip.
