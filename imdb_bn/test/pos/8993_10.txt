I wonder how nobody could make up on this movie. It is based on a real story. It is not about "rugby" that one posted here will have to make a "true" rugby movie, you missed the point. This is not a common sports movie where a team sucks, they hired Emilio Estevez and surrounded the team and won the championship and warmed and blurred for everyone. It focuses on a story. It shows how anyone can change his life for himself. Films are now always about sex, drugs, partitioning, etc. I'm a big fan of movies, but I have to say this is an inspirational movie with a great message. If you think that you are a "tough guy," do not see the movie, it will not depend on your values. If you want to see a good, inspirational movie, it's a good one.
