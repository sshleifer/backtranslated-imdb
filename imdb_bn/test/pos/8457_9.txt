The first thing you see in this movie is that of a static angle (one that will be repeated in the film), in a studio, which shows the viewer's attention (invisible to the viewer) that airs the news. Shortly after, the common story of the fundamental character is shown in the same corner. Let this confusion do not let you; The film is not a female reporter, a woman is struggling to succeed in male-dominated profession. This is simply a lead-in, a way to start film (though it is used later). The real points of this production are gradually expressed, and the first is a deliberately long scene we see it. The whole film has the speed; Slow or not drawn out, but deliberate. It is never too fast, even in some sequences that may normally be naturally occurring. This pacing (especially because it is slowly and steadily being slowly and steadily slowly, as the plot is released, if it is possible, it is possible, it takes place on the screen, Grab the people responsible for the caller and solve the situation to do something about them. Sometimes I have a screen for a moment It does not seem like taking my eyes, it is very important to be aware of the subject, and it is perfectly operated here, no dramatization (good ... very little, whatever), just the right presentation of the issue.Design is wonderful.Lemon's character is a deep feeling Feelings ... Excellent editing ... A scene perfectly illustrates a scene, the editor, judging from his filmography, is underrated very well. The performance was great, especially by Lemmon, Fonda and Douglas (who created it), lack of score is perfect; no need to improve the music, the last glorious and effective. The film contains some negative topics ... some of them The dialogue is clearly and unmistakably expressed, a special part of the film, though dramatic, with something that follows it Does not seem to be fake. Not everyone can see the movie because of the two movies that are generally (and correctly) responsible for bad movies. Pacing (which may be gradually wrong) and (lack) scores. It may be advisable for someone to be a negative thing, because everyone should consider these issues, but it is probably better. Managing the subject with intelligence and respect (for the subject and the observer) ... something like this, probably it should not be spoonful. I was mesmerized with the film, and left to be very surprised. Anyone who believes in me strong enough to manage myself recommends this. 9/10
