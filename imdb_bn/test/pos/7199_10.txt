This movie I have ever seen is the most playful joke, parody of many joker films, (related to Kung Fu etc. from Dragon Ball to Dragon Range) or related to any other history, (making the Otis lift), many jokes with the modern world Related and fun because it was BC (like the horse wagon cutting wheels) other jokes are fairly Normal non-indriyagrahi but ridiculous (like the famous scene, the dog and the dog with a little music, including the Roman people). In fact, they mostly mix in this movie, all kinds of humor. I saw this image 6 times and every time I saw it I found other fine jokes. (Like the scene where Waldo is the Egyptian crowd part). It seems to me the most fun movie, finally a sunny trick, that does not include toilets or sexual humor. Numerobis also makes what the movie makes, that guys come out of the mouth, delighting everything. This movie is almost perfect without some cluttered things, it gets its strength due to the kiss of asterisks, which is common stupid. But overall a nice movie !! 9.5 out of 10
