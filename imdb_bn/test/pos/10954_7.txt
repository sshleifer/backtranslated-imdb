12/17/01 What I can do with this movie is to improve my impressions. I have not been given "change", I do not know "scores" and I did not attend this school. I always encountered problems after following (trumpet player, Y'nownow) anyway, so I fundamentally "remember the tune" and were limited to worship around it. This incredibly what made me woken up about the black and white blues piece of Moody knit me in my head and heart, whether I tried to identify whether it was tried to come out, or choose a path with tune (story.). Went with tunes as usual; I lost lost in change - too deep, wide, on my head, perhaps. Nevertheless, it was a gas trying to keep pace. I admired playing the actor's theme and story lines. I did not see anything or think of something different: I do not think the light skin glass is "trying to pass" as much as he was unaware of color problems or tried to ignore it - first: later he returned to war. Brooding Light Skin Youth (his Trumpet Noodling Month Ludicas) is hesitant, hesitant, and perhaps his best features - remote. What, I thought the shadow curtain off this provocative piece - the foundation of a thing like this? Is it a way to find out the "reality" by setting up a stage, reinforcing it with the publisher characters and giving them a tone and theme? Without the convenience of editing and modifying it, it is more realistic than a well-planned script? Emojiation is heroic, "artist"? - Moreso than tactical work? Where are the broader or obvious truths: in opposite art / craft or fabrication and reform? Well, I still lost in this question. I liked the film; It was lost to me in a cool blue fog evening, where I just had to go home and find out my horn. Guess what I could try to break into a twelve times bluff riff, and not really distract myself from the tune. The reality is just too scary. Jaeem says saying their 7 and more. I paused over
