Pierre Jolivet is able to play a Don Quixote character, which can live in a world consistent with the unknown life. He canceled the housepap, seat cushion, and office furniture - helmets, sleeves, and spears - rely on his homemade surgery. Just as Don Quixote was surrounded by Roccant, "The Man", by passing the intense and harsh modern world away from the suffering of the modern man, he passed his lost life (literally) "The Man" with his consent. Both characters travel in search of courage to correct the mistakes of the world. Both characters are essentially the protagonists of the character of the protagonists of the nobility. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the story of the Servants, in this movie we identify more directly with the spiritual ideals of the protagonist. We can only compare this side-by-side and we can compare the beautiful and beautiful landscape of the landscape. Our reference frame is fantasy realm which may remember the only night. Our vision will be one that can defeat the main character, defeat, change his world (better), which does not become a lot of earth. <br /> <br /> We see this movie and see people as a true night in a world of animals. Don Quixote considers himself a real knight among animals. <br /> <br /> Through the stories of Servantes, we can only see the dreamer, we do not really understand the scope of his displacement. In the story of Beans and Jolivitz we see a new world from the eyes of Don Quixote, because we consider the same aspect and ideals as the main character of Crusading.
