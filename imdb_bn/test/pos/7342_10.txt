Whatever you do, stop watching while you are finished in the movie! Stay close to the first batch of credit or you really miss something! We saw this movie at the Saawnaa Film Festival and thought that it was the best of the bunch. Drea Weber can only drag it on the ground, not just because of its performance. In the question-answer, he said, there were no wires or effects, so everything you see is actually going on for him. Adie could not do this festival because of the dance with Madonna. She was nice and my guides were so beautiful. I am surprised that this picture has gone very well with the blue-haired lady, but there you have it, Savannah is not a backwaters.
