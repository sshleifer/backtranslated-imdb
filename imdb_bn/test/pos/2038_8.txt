I'm an action movie fan but I have not seen any preview or ad for this movie in Italy so I hope to see "The Long Kiss Goodnight" on Pay-TV. <br /> <br /> But what a surprise! This movie is great! The only problem that can be found is the presence of some holes in the plot, but the rest is the most entertaining, playful and fun action movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Resident agents from ordinary wife-teacher Samantha / Charlie's conversion hungry agents think a good idea. Action scenes and stunt the best I've ever seen. Samuel L. Jackson said that I heard any good line and his chemistry with Jina Davis is good. <br /> <br /> And what about Jina? She is wonderful, she's the best action heroine ever seen and plays strong, strong acting and spanking stunts. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was a poor performance of the box office and bad critics because most critics and some kind of public have a tough time with the role of leading female lead. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
