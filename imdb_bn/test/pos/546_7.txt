This picture is about single mom, who is happy that she is almost unlawful, and her intelligent teenage daughter, who is going through a teenage pregnancy. <br /> <br /> "Anywhere But Here" starts from the end of an engaging movie. Both Anne and Adel have been correctly described at the beginning, so we can know how different their personality is. Clashes inevitably ensue, and they are presented positively. I find myself drawing their minds and their circumstances so. It seems like I'm living their lives, feeling what they feel. <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandan gave another excellent performance "elsewhere" here. He is charismatic, happy, lucky, hedonistic, warm and once loving all. I always liked Susan Sarandan, and I think he's pretty intuitive. <br /> <br /> "Anywhere But Here" is an impressive emotional journey.
