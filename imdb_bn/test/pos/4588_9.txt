Mike Judge's Eidisress is an interesting movie, and his fans will undoubtedly track and see. <br /> <br /> Before I start the review, I'm not saying that if you get a chance to see it, definitely, it's valuable to watch and it's not the easiest movie in the world. <br /> <br /> Let's start - Louis Wilson Private Joe Govers, an army librarian who thinks there is absolutely no outstanding attributes or glaring errors, making him the absolute average way. He has no relation with him, he stands as a candidate for an experimental cruisanic approach. Frozen with Joe also had a prostitution called Rita, who was upgraded, pimped by his humiliating pimple project. Unfortunately, a few days after they were frozen, the top secret projects were abandoned, and they forgot. <br /> <br /> They got up in 2505 and they followed this trend and came down to the society. In recent times, every one of the world is a little more intelligent than a chip. Now, anyone who thinks "public" Joe Bauer's conversation as "faggy" now speaking like Shakespeare will now be ridiculed and a former professional wrestler's US president (in fact, this is probably not harmful indeed). The best show on TV is "oh my ball!" It is said, which seems to be quite good and not everything is wrong, but the words seem to have come out of place for the word, which allows them to drag them right away. Last <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a fun documentary film, but this is the problem - from the initial initial point, the film is not really that much fun. This means that I think that the concepts coming from the film background are probably funny as a movie. Obviously, this is not terrible, but it was probably fun. <br /> <br /> Some of the winners of the script, such as Starbucks are now offering "happy ending" and blindly believing their blind beliefs, "electrolytes", but they are very few and far away, so long as you are laughing fiercely, When one is born with a logic and / or intelligence, a little shocking, atrocities <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I say Lum, this is a fun idea that you might laugh a lot more than 15-20 minutes compared to other movies. <br /> <br /> I can give it 5 out of 10 because it's enjoyable, but it's not enough to get up in the middle of the street.
