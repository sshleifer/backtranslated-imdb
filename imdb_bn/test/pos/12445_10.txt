Slipcote is a great metal band that wears their own distinctive masks from Do Iainas, Iowa City (I know that someone has already said this but I have to fill the space for this review). Band member Joey, Mick, 133, Sid, Clown, James, Corey, Chris and Paul. This band is one of the best new heavy metal bands in my opinion and it should be heard by Ronaldo's love for everyone. Another good movie is called "Desstripes" which shows the performance of the band in London Arena. The video "My Plug" was shot there and included in the DVD. They have the most kick ass songs made (sis). So if you love the band you will have to see it and if you like heavy metal music you will hear this band.
