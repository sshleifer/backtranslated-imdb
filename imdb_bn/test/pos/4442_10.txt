Luciano Fooli has created many great films throughout his career and many of them showed bucket load bucket loads to achieve the title 'The Godfather of Gore'. A dalking was not tortured before being known among Falsi Gourhounds, and it is not all poor; This is definitely a satirical and nasty little thriller and for my money - Phulasi has made the best movie! Not to be head and shoulder pain over most of the genre of production and extraordinary like the next films of Phulchi, this is all about the best of Giallo. The plot focuses on a small rustic community where the bodies have started bending. The killers are more frustrating because the victim is just a young boy. Shortly after police found guilty of an innocent person, a journalist from Andrey Martelli came to the village and decided to start a murder investigation on himself. Marteli soon met Patricia, a sexy young woman, a scandalous priest and a local wizard who made wax statues and stuck the pins among them, along with several suspects. <br /> <br /> While this movie may not load load, it is made for it's two nastiest sequences of Phulchi. A woman at the nostest is brutally murdered by a group of men in the graveyard, when a person's image falls from the hill and strikes any number of stones on the road, some turn around. Do not torture a duckling absolutely great Italian Cast features. Her role as Barbara Bueut (my personal favorite) Patricia is incredibly sexy, and many acting muscles later she did much more muscle after her after she did. Thomas Million looks superb as usual and the rest of the cast is well-liked by the likes of Irene Papas, Florida, Balkan and Mark Porrell. The cinematography on the display is stunning and the Phulchis really impresses the viewer that he takes great care and effort into each scene. The story is going on slowly, and it does not always allow the film to go far too far from the central plot line, it is always interesting The secret to murderous identity is not a great deal; But Fulci does not finalize until we finally put our guess and do a duckling torture on a high. Overall, Floris is not ashamed of making more of this type of film. Do not make a duckling torture out of her and work out best and I emphasize that every Giallo fans see it!
