There is another masterpiece that requires a DVD release but some libraries have VHS and are capable of searching. Many things are just a brilliant game, the most vivacious, "respectfulness", religion, and basic human relationships. The script effectively uses intelligent humor not only to deal with a problem like a seriously disabled child, but to confuse the father in "Joe" and their love for each other. As a couple, Allan Bates and Janet Sujman have met with acting skills and have led their deep, intelligent characters to life. <br /> <br /> I recently released Bets as "Boutley", "Joe Egg" a few years later, and he plays both, connoisseur, intellectual, and funny a teacher, although Batley is here much more than Brian's character Dark If you throw in this great performance because of the notable mention of "The Go Between", "Women in Love", "Hostile Down the Wind", "The Caretaker" and "Georgy Girl", such as "Hudupaan Raja" and "Jubba The Greek ", and I used to say that compared to the career of Allan Betts, Peter O'Toole, Albert Finney, and other great British actors of his era. <br /> <br /> Director Peter Medak was also my most beloved "The Ruling Class" released one year (1972) as "Joe Ege", which included the book career year of somebody. He had a spotty filmography ("The Kays" was another highlight), but these two gems would mark him as a great director.
