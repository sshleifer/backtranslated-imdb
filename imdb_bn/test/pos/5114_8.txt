A really good flick with this awesome humor Jim Verney, as we know, was very good with facial expressions and this movie showed many. This must be the best of Ernest Films. I would definitely recommend it to an Ernest fan. Movies and I'm sure nobody will enjoy this movie. In movies, (Ernest) plays 2, bad guys and good people, and they play quite well. I really enjoy the fantastic kind of humor where something seems unlikely, for example, like nude gun films, and this movie contains a lot of it. I have seen this movie. Good instruction, good script, rental price.
