Although it failed in the movie theater, mainly because of Malin Fermer, France's three top stars did not have a first role. The fans changed their mind and were waiting for the DVD. This year's release in DVD is a tremendous success! As others failed, slow speeds and incredible lengths (3 hours) at that time (1994) bothered critics. But slow motion and long time that makes melancholic stories mandatory. The moral of the movie you can not escape from the determined death for you. This is the same theme as the movie "Final Destination" and it creates a Gothic story. The atmosphere is very annoying.
