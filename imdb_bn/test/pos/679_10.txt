Whenever Ida Lupino displayed or directed a film in the 30's, 40's and 50's, the picture was black and white, yet you guaranteed great entertainment. Idra was able to keep viewers and keep them spellings till the end of their photo. Mrs. Helen Gordon, "Hi Sierra", Robert Ryan, ("Howard Wilton"), "Golden Gloves", 40 '40 relationships are going to stop you and exactly how poor Miss Gordon is natural and happy with love and real affection Be able to marry. If you like Ida Lupino, who is a criminal criminal in a woman and hates prison warden, this movie is for you to enjoy it. I really believe that Ida Lupino was not a real credo for the great movie in the movie industry !!!
