** 1/2 Elisa Cuthbert, Chad Michael Murray, Brian Van Holt, Paris Hilton and John Abraham Managed by Jaume Collet-Serra. <br /> <br /> Yet another classic horror movie, reborn with deaf-headed teenage acting despite smell and creative death. Based on the 1953 Vincent Price Film House of Max, where a patient kills a patient and turns them into an invaluable wax. Although the film was still a cow's picture, despite the creativity of Storytree Hooper's classic Texas Chess genocide in 1974, the movie was a classic classic horror reconciliation with a fantastic set of wax-making designs. The director has shown interest in light with his guidance but is still looking valuable. My final rating is 7/10.
