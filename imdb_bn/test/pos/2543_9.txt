Wonderful movie about a soul of this scholar. This is a journey of the heart of the heart. I found it fascinating. The director did a great job. She makes views on the scene. Especially on silent scenes. Aale's window is a big one. One of the best visual scenes I've seen on the bed. <br /> <br /> In addition to the instructions. It's a long time I do not see a movie about a soul. As a philosopher I can say that this film proves that age is not a matter of your soul. So as the soul of Alley. <br /> <br /> As a Turkish resident, I am not worried on the other side of New York. This is a universal view that you can see throughout the world. My opinion is more universal than every other thing. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this picture. Otherwise you will miss a great thing about a soul. If you have one. <br /> <br /> Boris Sentuna
