It is always a good feeling when you distribute the movie when you do not expect a movie. The Dead and Kids / Boyer boys found themselves in many unfinished films, and were generally good as a support role in "Angels with Disaster". Here, as a retreat of a boxer story created for murder, their presence gives the screen time without confusion from their main action. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When a newspaper reporter unknowingly said that Johnny is a party loving lady organizer, his plan to spread the information in the column is interrupted by a whiskey bottle from the head of the manager's manager, Dock Ward (Robert Gleller). Instead, Doc tells Jonia girlfriend Goldie (Anne Sheridan) to accompany him to avoid legal trouble related to the death of journalists. After both fleeing, the police wind up wind in a flaming car debris, and Doc's body was identified as Johnny from the gold watch he was wearing. <br /> <br /> Cloud rain receives an Edward G. Robinson graduation that 'has been reassign the morgue details after a bad arrest several years ago working as a detective. His character had Monty, and he had a pretty good body that was not Johnny in a car accident. He was handed over the case closest to his friend and was given the responsibility to go outside and outside the city. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Janani seeks advice from her lawyer and she gets worse when she weeps for most of her $ 10,000 savings certificate. His way made the cross-country, Johnny powered by a crusty Granny Rafferty (May Robson), wind up the Rancho Rafferty date farm in Arizona. The farm is a descendant of a dead cleric Granny's brother in Brackline and is now a band house of rage tag street boys (The Dead and Kids) who work in the farm. Billy Haloop was the nominal leader of these boys, and his sister Peggy (Gloria Dixon) became romantic interest for Janeyi, now called Jack Derny. <br /> <br /> I kick out the historical perspective proposed in this pre-war era film. When Johnny and the boys walk on the trunk of the farm, they were admitted to the gas station for $ 1.28! Tommy (Haloop) got the idea that a gas station in the farm would be a good way to earn some extra money, and with this concept Jack Dorne decided to give a $ 500 a round gift to Jack Barney, whoever might have a ring with him. When Jack lost in the fifth round, the queued premiere became his ear, but then he earned enough to give the fruit farm his own chance of fighting. Maybe Grandma Raffert should have been in the ring, she just took everyone out of her sitting around the ring. Johnny / Jack Locker came closer to the room, but he was in the custody of Detective to take him to the Intelligence Department. Through this caller he can bring his reputation back, ask if he is following his arrest - you have to find out. <br /> <br /> I love Dead and Leo, who is in charge of Leo Gorski, but there is not much to do about this. However, he flamped a great deal of ticket taker in the boxing match gate. Another thought - if the current wall of the priest's wall is like Pat O'Brien, was not it great? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a nice entry for everyone. John Garfield and Dead and Kid's Filmography, and an entertaining way to spend a half an hour. If one is close by, it is not enough screen time for most anne Sheridan. If the references to Sheridan and Gloria Dixon are reversed, the film might be more harmful, because screen chemistry between Dickason's Peggy and Jack was stronger than usual.
