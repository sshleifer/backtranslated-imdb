It's Showtime! Showtime is just a hindrance to the career of Eddie Murphy and Robert Dinner. This is an entertainment film and a guilty pleasure but not on the standards of actors, especially Robert. Showtime is run by Tim Day and shows some small roles such as William Shatner and Moses Def. <br /> <br /> There are almost two different police, Mitch Preston (Denro) and Tray Sellers (Murphy). Someone works quietly in the profile, the other is running smoothly with a cool approach and wants to have more fun than the phone in the back seat. They are both behind the huge copper in television, VCR etc. Then they cross the road and a TV station wants a new reality TV show so that they commit crimes when they are on TV. Mitch hates the promotion when Tray likes it in his line, "It's Showtime!" Their TV antics and methods are shown on TV and they are new "police" shows. The fun begins. <br /> <br /> Overall, Showtime is a fun comedy action game. A good film but the expectations and standards of the actors are not quite far. However, it treads along with rolls and parodies as reality TV shows. A good break from the show like the police. Really end up, just a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Eliasson A.
