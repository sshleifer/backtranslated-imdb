As a former student of Erasmus, I enjoyed this picture a lot. It was so realistic and fun. It really sorted the existing soul among Erasmus students. I hope many other students also follow this experience. However, I am surprised that this movie is interesting to watch without any international experience. But at least those of my friends who did not go to Erasmus also enjoyed it. I got it 9 out of 9
