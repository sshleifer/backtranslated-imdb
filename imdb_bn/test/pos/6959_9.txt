Ten years ago I saw this movie for the first time on a sick day in school. I've seen generally compared to live-time movies, although it has been an instant but favorite yet instant. <br /> <br /> I have seen twice since then. I think some parts are a little cheesy, maybe the plot could use something more. <br /> <br /> However, it captures the imagination and reality of children with uniqueness and warmth. The historical reality is similar to Amelie, and the heart is equal with The Wonder Years. Despite the special development of my taste, I still find the subtle magic of this film, loving character, and its simplicity stimulus.
