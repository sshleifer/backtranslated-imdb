This episode is probably closely related to its partner law, "You do not know how to kill", it directly shows the controversial problem, "Why do we kill people and see that killing is wrong?" This topic is presented in two episodes: Before the assassination, when the film shows bipartisanism between idealistic up-coming lawyers and street thugs, it is found in his way that his life is only after his trial and execution, when both are hurt for death , Then they are responsible for doing so and after doing this, it is done. <br /> <br /> One of the great things on this path is that an episode of the story is fully developed in both small and big ways, so that we can understand both the motivation and the history of letters, we can only spend less than one hour. For all his criminal intentions and fun, the killer is still very sympathetic, the most important part of his action around the history of the accidental death. His way of killing is more than willing to control death, it really is a desire to destroy. Likewise, the idealistic proximity of the lawyer is reluctant to allow death in a world, where he can not control it. Their meeting is important, important; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the biggest influences of Kesselovsky seems to be the concept of trial, and it is considered that the D Divlue considers some of the issues that represent divine judgment, it seems to be almost most self-conscious. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
