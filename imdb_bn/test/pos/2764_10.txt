I saw this flick on the big screen as a kid and loved it - scream and all. Recently, I found a copy in the video and checked it again. Badly made, sure ... schlogy fun, most definitely. It's still a recreational punch pack. It's much more fun than the dull Disney version ("Alive"). The only thing "living" was a good influence on special effects. If you are a lover of B-movie, I highly recommend "Superviv", recommend to mention all other Ronaldo cardinal films and Mexican wrestlers made by their parents (Ronnie Cardona graduate). DVD special edition "late" is long delayed for treatment. Are you all listening, all kinds of people at Anchor Bay ...?
