"One True Thing" puts Zeljgar in a family crisis, an adult journalist who returns home after taking care of his dead mother (Strip). On Monday and pladding, the film considers the adult child to be considered by the parents of their parents because they gradually say something less than the kind of child that is becoming intelligent. Producing a search with an extraordinary character study and a little guilt, "OTT" provides three fine performances by top performers and some stimulating reflection of life and death.
