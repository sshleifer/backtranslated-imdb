"The Begid" is a strange work in Clint Eastwood's Ow. Until 1971, he became known as the star of the action film, not only the West (which he first made his name), but the films of war (such as "Where Eagle Dyer") and Cop Thrillers (such as "Cognac Bluff"). " Beagleil "took place during the war period (American Civil War), and was created by Don Siegel, who was previously" Earned in the Kugen Bluff " Who directed and directed the same year to direct him to "Dirty Harry", is not an action film in the traditional sense. Most of his earlier films, Eastwood played an active role, but here his role was largely passive-his character, Sergeant John McBurney, wounded one harmful harmful, who lives on women's charity When he was serving with his unit, McBurney did not take active part in the conflict; he was a kakar, whose religious principles prohibited him from carrying arms, and provided medical services in the union forces. <br /> <br /> This image was set at the end of the war in Louisiana, and the wounded Macburney started with a young girl named Emir and was brought back to her boarding school. The school is small with only two teachers and some girls. Although some daughters want to be encouraged by the Confederate due to the enthusiasm and to the authorities, the Prime Minister's wife Martha Fernsworth decided to shelter her and threatened that she would have to prove fatal because of her injury. One Confederation Strong prison camp of notoriety. <br /> <br /> While Macberney follows his religion's teaching with patience, though he is not so intelligent while pursuing his education on the sin of adultery, and he uses full-time to recover his staff and to practice his characters in both the old girls' Opportunity, and he is one of the older girls, including his assistant Edwina and Carroll Miss Fernson Has won the competition. Even 12-year-old Amy started showing a baby crush on her. His presence in all female school sexual abuse environments increases jealousy and hatred, and Miss Fornesworth, refusing to rape Carol, takes a terrible retaliation. (Interestingly, Halley, a female slave to oppose McBurney's bleeding, is a black slave of Miss Farnsworth, though she tries to win in her round to see that she is fighting to liberate people like her). <br /> <br /> "The Begead" is described as a war film, but it seems to be my wrong idea. This film is not about the rights or wrongs of civil war. We see that the only act of violence is harassed by the unreasonable, and they are inspired by personal vengeance, not by initiative because of the Confederate. Due to the extraordinary circumstances of the war, it will be more appropriate to see the movie as a play on emotional pressure. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the school is situated in a beautiful old Antibal palace, and it seems like the island of peace between the war. The building is in classical style, in relation to order, harmony and restraint, but the story that is published within its walls is the disorder, emotion and violence, the attributes related to writing in Gothic schools, which are often considered in the 19th century to antithesis of classism. American film and literature is called "Southern Gothic" tradition which can be seen as the fall of this movie. <br /> <br /> The box was not a big hit at the box office, probably throwing so much against the Eastwood type. This is probably not his best movie, but it shows that he can extend his range and play something other than action heroes. ("Play Misty for Me", as the director made his first film the next year, he was again playing a "passive" character in danger from a neutral woman). Customers have some good performance from the female members, especially Geraldine Page Martha Fernsworth, externally respectful middle-class spinster, but the strongest emotion inside. (There is some indication that he had some relation with a person whom he had stopped as his brother). Elizabeth Hartman's embarrassing, repressed Adina, who loves McBurney and rejects the idea of ​​retaliation, and the young Pamelin contributed as an Amir from the reunion. (Amy is an animal lover- McBurney murders her pet turtle when there is an important moment in the film - it was interesting that later Fardin became an animal rights activist). Joan Anne Harrison's Carroll seemed to be very modern, as the character of Swinging Siksey was back in the 1860s. The film is notable for Seagull's emotionally intense "Hawthouse" atmosphere. This will not be a movie that is for everyone's taste; Some find it very overwrought and melodramatic, and some have found it misogynistic. (Judith Krish called it a film for "women hate and sadists"). Others, however, could find it an engaging psychic drama. 7/10
