It seems like everyone wants to jump in the bandwagon and say "Maha goo ka" .... the word "Maacha" ........ "Maach" liked ... translated maa-ka "... <br /> < br /> I was late with this series late in the late 70's and very shameless channel 56 ... in the year 1963, there was Tetsuwan etu (Astro Boy), which was in Kevliz since 1963. TV. The first TV example we got here in the state ... A I was an anime as a child and followed it by the end of the 80's, then it became a series of "animated" conversation headlines. "An incident that just got worse." Naph said. <br /> <br /> As a "Speed ​​Racers", I've really enjoyed it, the Pov shot, the dynamic aspects of living actions have been efficiently animated ... which were mostly standard after most Japanese anime ... Graphics Graphics Graphics! Stanley Crumar's film "Grand Prix" (1966), especially new American credit .... <br /> <br /> Oh yes, I'm a series based real comics, so I know what I say. <br /> <br /> Are we doing an animation-based job without a whip like Johnny Quest? ..... 'the same' ol 'that we used to do since 20 years ago is .... Ho-hum! <br /> <br /> I think the issue was coming to an American TV anime. Scribes, credits, etc., to "sanitize" for American audiences ... I will not go to other programs, as we are talking about 'speed here See <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> (Think Felix Cats and Powerful Mighty - oy vey!) They take a sticky, very sophisticated show and leave it down to the level of the Oscars. "Crookery Block", "Fortheberd Company", "School Dogri" Think ... I'll mute if I go. <br /> <br /> This series was already 40 annoying years but I was eager to be humiliated by dumbing down the time, this and other Japanese programs ... I mean, when someone is killed ', but they removed it Or gloss it ........ Pleeeeeze! <<br /> Good show - basically. Sadly, among the more recent incarnations in the series are "cropped in Korea", which does not refer to the content being "PC". Even the Japanese now outsource their animation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Robert
