Over the years, I did not miss this picture of Ronald Reagan and recently it was shown on TV because of his big screen appearance in heaven recently. In the late 1930s it was a big low budget B and W film, but it is very interesting to see how criminals use their talents to steal money from insurance companies, including false claims in this period. Ronald Reagan, (Eric Greg), "The Killers, 64" starred in the role, who starred alongside the famous movie star, Shila Bromley, (Nona Greg), "Nightmare Circus", 73. It was a great supporting actor. It was a great film that showed Ronald Reagan as a young man at a very young age, at the time Hollywood made his career differentiated. Thank God!
