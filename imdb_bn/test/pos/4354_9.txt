Although some of Herzeg's work is probably not entertaining, Little Deuter is one of the best film artists in the world. When Heterz leaves the usual themes, Little Deiter conducts a brave and raised character of his character and his efforts to live a life-threatening experience. <br /> <br /> Dieter Dengla wanted to fly from a very young age, and the Vietnam War gave him the chance, but instead of fighting the cockpit storm, he mostly grounded it as a POW. Dieter occasionally encourages and encourages most of his stories from holographic with help. Herzag gives very little voice at this time, but sounds strong enough and contributes to visual visas - which should not surprise anyone with her. <br /> <br /> Denler is an impressive and highly liked person. As a human and living, I think his life story and his illogical enthusiastic personality are inspirational. Thanks for the Harzg (again) to introduce him to us. <br /> <br /> The film's scale is not spread, and the plays are not as horrible as the early films like Horjag making a ball. Count with. Nevertheless, I firmly recommend to his fans and those who enjoy the documentary. This is a very interesting and well executed film.
