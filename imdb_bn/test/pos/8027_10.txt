This movie was covered by 'The Jackal' (Bruce Willis, Richard Gere) which was released in the same year. I have seen both movies, I can honestly say this best movie. Guess, the production price of 'Jackal' was very good, probably it was a big budget. However, 'Assignment' has good writing and an interesting story. Aiden Quinn's dual role is flawless. Aiden Quinn and director Christian Duguie did a great job of establishing deep and multi-level relationships between the title character and his family. I particularly liked the end choice. <br /> <br /> I reminded of Jack Ryan's character in Tom Clancy. Both of them secretly act in behalf of national security and play an incredibly dangerous role in naval officers. And yet, both Harrison Ford and Eden Quinn have expressed their own characters as heroes who lead to both viral and mild. Their relation with their family has genuine elegance and weakness. <br /> <br /> I do not understand that the opinion of everyone posting in this movie (which is included) can be far more positive than the receipt of the film's reception. This is a film that has a lot of complexity and subtlety, which is mandatory after multiple views. If you are a fan of spying-film movies, I encourage 'Assignment' with enthusiasm.
