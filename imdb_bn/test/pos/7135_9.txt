I've heard about "Gaming" and "Dingios and Dragons" before, but I knew it was like "Gammers: Darkness Rising" which I saw. These guys are so funny to see and fun. Especially the person who "Bird" or "Minister" or whatever, he has a gift for physical comedy and duration. There are so many backgrounds humorous and power in some scenes that you really feel that at least some of these have been fixed in the set. Special effects were needed to work a bit, but last year I saw it at one conference and one of the things they said is that they are going to reload and make even better, so it's probably evil now!
