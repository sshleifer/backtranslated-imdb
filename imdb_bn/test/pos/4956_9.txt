All right, yes it's bad, yes it's totally Faffe, yes it creates the look of a cage like an Oscar winner, but when I was 13 years old, special effects were not very intolerable in 90% of the movies, and again in the good old days when a story of movies The line needs .. ok so the story is even a bit dodgy .. but I got this image as a kid in the 80s. Hungry rock, bad effects, but airplanes are an aerial fights and surround it with a view of soundtrack. Even the worst things have a silver ornaments. If you want to see a bad 12-year-old movie, everyone hates computer effects (if there is such a movie) it's a standard choice.
