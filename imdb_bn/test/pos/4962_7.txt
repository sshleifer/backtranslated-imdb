It focuses on the lives of four women, all good friends and their male partner. Every one has a story, men too, everything links to everything and everything goes with a girl after having a quick change after going to Palam Springs. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film is not different from the other, but I like the details. Brooke Shields is a divorcee who fears loneliness, so he pushes everyone to put a "warm body" beside him, but then he can not really cheat. As a man, I have a blessing for these women :), but he is not a happy person. All of these crazy women revolve around, but eventually we get more clarity on life and relationships which are good. <br /> <br /> I can not say whether I'm acting bad. It does not seem to me. The script was slightly inconsistent, but no romantic comedy is more than that. It's a bit more depressing than most, which is good because you do not get a romantic romantic comedy every day :) <br /> <br /> It's worth the watch with Mrs, especially if you have planned or planned on it ...
