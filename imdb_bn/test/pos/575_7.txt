It's a fantastic blurry, stupid horror film set which is the Everglades of the 1970s. It's really stupid and hairy for the first half, then it actually starts to get better for the last half. Hero has a view of running his friends to interspersed interspersed with a group singing shot, I do not know. It is mesmerizing. I was fascinated by the scenes during the night, because it was actually night, it is like the worst movie of the low budget, where it looks like days still. I think the director was really talented but was working with a tiny budget and a tough schedule. There are several scenes at the end, the one mentioned above and the end credits are extremely cool. This movie could be a real classic if she went straight to her Scooby Doo conference and left behind. I was amazed at how well this movie has been made. I could not take my eyes from it, and I had to ask myself "why?"
