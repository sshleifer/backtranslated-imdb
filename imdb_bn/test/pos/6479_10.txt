I do not have to be a note-dame football fan to enjoy it, because I'm not .... But, as a football fan in general, it was fun to see. It almost makes me a fighting Irish fan. If you can not get caught in the emotion of this film, gridiron fan or not, you should check your pulse better because it is a psychological film with very sensitive scenes. <br /> <br /> As a sports fan, I like watching the classic footage of the primary college games. They had quite beautiful wild plays back with so much later. They showed footage with Pad O'Brien, along with footage head coach Nick Racken and George Zip (Ronald Reagan) some players. <br /> <br /> Reagan has got quite good bills in this movie but its share is not really big. O'Brien is the only actor with a big role here Rest - Playing All Good Characters - Include Fallen Wife As "Bonnie;" Donald Chris, as "Father John Callhan" by Notre Dame; Albert Besserman, a professor of chemistry department "Father Newland" and Reagan, probably as guitarist, probably the most talented and famous player of Nottre Dame. <br /> <br /> How does this picture nicely match personal stories with football? Both angles are not overdone. As there are no characters here, you can root for here. In my last appearance, Jonny Sheffield - son of Tarzan - playing the rock at seven years of age and watching television superman George Reeves as a player. <br /> <br /> Only a few of the football movies have been made in the studio, for some reason, and some of the best things to do. This is one of them.
