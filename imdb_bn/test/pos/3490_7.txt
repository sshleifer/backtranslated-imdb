If you like his show you might be a little disappointed. This movie has some fun moments and laughs are quite constant but none is very memorable and funny as the show. The sequence at the beginning is really really silly and fun, and a great start. Yes! The borat is a camio look. <br /> <br /> See if you're a fan! If you do not know him or do not like him, do not bother. 6.5 / 10
