This is a very sensitive movie. This is a story about a special bond between a child and his grandfather. A villager (Arun Nalawad) brought his grandson, Parashuram to the city to treat his eyes. But it is known that Parasuram (Asin Chitalale) has some rare cancer and has had to undergo surgery and lose his eyes. The movie goes through both their emotions and unrest, and how they accept the whole thing. The film can avoid any melodrama and say this story in an easy way. Although the movie is not a language barrier in Marathi language. It proves that you do not need item songs, superstars and normal muscles to create good movies. Excellent performance. This is India's entry for the 2004 Oscars. Hopefully at least got the nomination. Rate will be 10/10
