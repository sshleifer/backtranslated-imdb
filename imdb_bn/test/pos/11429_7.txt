Prior to the 1927 Oliver Hardy team it was one of Stan Laurel's best solo comedy. Laurel is a very good actor in the film, and offers good comedy. The best scene in the film is when Stan Dance with Ma'arlal (his real life wife of common law) in Kahn Espanol. Stan has fun, stupid dance without you listening to music. I would recommend this to any Stan Laurel fan.
