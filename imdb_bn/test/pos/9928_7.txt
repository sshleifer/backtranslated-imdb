Betty Vardy is absolutely unclear in the production of Macbeth, who is told to go to the time of Diva being injured in an accident. However, in the grand tradition of "The Scottish Play", production seems to be cursed with problems, at least not to push a crazy crew. Unfortunately for Betty, the killer seems to have a special plan for him ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not measure it, but I think almost two-thirds of the film is involved in pan, dolls, tracking or crane - the amount of free camera movement is wonderful and it makes ten times more exciting than the map thriller. The image is wild and flashing - the bonds of the eyes of the hero are open with nails, from a revolve point of view to a hole in the vicinity of an opera house, a bullet bust of a murderer, a bullet fired by a pipolof, and a molten chain of hunting trachea. Conceptually it is only amazing and can only be provided by this director. Although the movie is not without any errors; The most notable of the draws - both Marcelach and Barbarini, both slightly cone (and by its dubbing wonderful, even Italian quality in the English version), although Argentina regularly nicolidi funny and Charles gives a thoughtful performance in a more introduction to a little autobiographical (a lot for reliance on his awesome director and technique Awful director). The element is a mix of the cool three ways of opera, Shakespeare, and Slashar Flick, inspired by Argentino and its natural partner Franco Ferrini, to explain the general abnormalities for the large number of suspected and annoying scenes with the suspicious suspects, which are actually going on. All kinds of different musicians - Brian Anno, Claudio Siemanetti, Bill Wimen, Pookini, and of course, Verdi. The scenes of the beautiful Opera room were shot in the Perm's Titoro Regio. For some strange reasons, the UK printing of this movie is an alternative title terrorist on the opera.
