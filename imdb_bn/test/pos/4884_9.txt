The gentleman's league is the most annoying British sitikum on TV and how a funny movie can get such a bad rating, they have no taste that you want to watch this movie again and still think it's funny. <br /> <br /> It is astonishing that it has done a bad thing, but it is the British who often ridicule, but at this time it (in my language) is a gesture with a giraffe sponge on the lady, with an interest in comedy, a top British comedy, Better than the ball, so it will not prove you wrongly because I'm not really funny through movies, but this film is the best character in the comedy with Aishwarya Was bad but I was disappointed how Edward and Tabb had to buy this film back to type there and it would not disappoint you.
