I saw a treatment when I was a child and I then loved it. Now, a few years later, I almost got a copy by an accident, and saw it again. As a child, you do not have the power to buy your own things, it is usually your parental privileges - but when I saw it again, I'm sorry that I did not do anything more to get a copy. After this movie again, and finally almost forgot it till today. <br /> <br /> This is really a beautiful movie. This is a hard-a -az, mischievous story about impossible friendship between children - who highlight signs of his horrific, insulting mother - and his neighbor, his own neighbor, who is a little boy of AIDS. <br /> <br /> Okay, you say it. "Who" is another one. A tier zarker. A bucket movie A Morality Trail Yes, I know, I hate them too. Not just this one. This is one of only a few of the films I have seen that it has presented a very rare strategy: it publishes a real sad story (and yes, morality story), except for a moment where it is fattened, forced, or otherwise " Hollywood ". It shows a real relationship between real two kids, who have conversations like real kids. And through the interaction, the older son, Eric's good nature, the character of the boy begins to shine through his "tough guy" personality, because he takes care of great brotherhood for Dexter, his HIV-positive little neighbor. Together, they start an adventure to find a cure - which just seems to be near the corner - so that all these stupid aids can go away and they can always be friends. <br /> <br /> Production is top notch. But, of course, what this film really carries is the performance of two characters - Brad Renfro and Joseph Majello. Particularly Majelo, who is easily stunning - he has expressed the feelings of weaknesses needed for a sick boy, but at the same time he directs Dexter to create a truly energetic and determined character. The boys face the presence of Tony at the brightness of her, she expresses her passion for protecting her old friend, driving him by talking about her words - and yet, her horror scene is shown because she realizes what she said to herself: her Blood poison ... ... at his moment, especially his soil scenes: He fully illustrated that this lofty, street-savvy When the child is completely frozen and bent when facing his offensive, windy mother, and bans his relationship with the sick boy, because of his relation and ignorance, because he can not get a word to oppose him. Enabella Cyraara also gives memorable performance to Dexter's mother, who has finally portrayed Iriki as a mother. <br /> <br /> I came back to school in America to see this picture. , And liked it - this sort is not a movie related to all. But the behavior of kids in this movie was so real, I could easily relate to them. Surprisingly, the teacher who showed us this movie (a wonderful woman, I'm still communicating with her) has been hurt for her, because some generous parents complained about the scene when two boys are looking at a player ... kind. Actually, Americans can never be found with this ridiculous fear, I do not know. There was a hard-difference shot of a playboy cover in the film and thus it is not shown in school ... how tragic it is Kids need to watch this movie. All of the school authorities are more inspirational and educational than all the "official" ones. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one more thing. I know I'm angry, but still score! It's great. I'm a musician, and as I know from Dave Grossin his record: He is a famous jazz pianist and record producer. Until this movie, I did not really know that he also made a film score, although when I checked later, I found out that I had seen a number of movies unknowingly. Really, there's a nice job. <br /> <br /> All, a tough ten. I'd recommend this movie to anyone. And I'm definitely going to see it with my younger siblings - they can generally use it to see a film like this in all the standard special-effects histories.
