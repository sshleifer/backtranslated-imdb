This matter was so ridiculous that the whole point of the program was pedophilia highlighting the behavior of the media with 'banned' issues. Newsdesk set, Sue, smug presenter, visible people behind you, what you see behind them, uninterrupted CGI graphs and statistics, the whole thing was ironic, a very funny satire. C-list celebrities will say absolutely nothing if their agent tells them that it will be good for their career ("There is no evidence for this, but scientific information"). It may be difficult to see (Mili Dowler and Cambridgeshire girls as well as 9/11), but the mockery is considered challenging, and should not be afraid to stand against our fearsome horror and titling media, just because it's a delicate thing. It is embarrassing to see how this show fails to win any TV awards for its intelligence, observation, courage, acting and thinking, but it will show you that it is not to be seen, at least not surprising.
