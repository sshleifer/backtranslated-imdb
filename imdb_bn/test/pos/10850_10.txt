I like this movie. I saw it over the rental time from Netfix. I had a lot of money and money for it. I think many people will enjoy it. I've read several lesbian stories for several years and have seen and am glad I'm getting better about how they are presented. There is a more positive feeling for their living. And the feelings of gay women Finding two women and looking good in others like them in this society. I think more movies with this theme will satisfy our theater and TV screens. Many producers and directors of Lesbians have lived in a very full and healthy life and realize that there are wonderful stories and are seen by families and families without hesitation.
