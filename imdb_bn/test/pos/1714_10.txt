For those who have access to BBC or CBC, it has been proven to be spectacular. Blaster likes galactica, it is rebuilt from a show ground. But who is Dr., they have preserved the best parts. I can not believe I am saying this, but so far There is no cheap plodding of this cheap production value and sometimes the old show. The acting is quite good and has a real knowledge of continuity and history. The new doctor is easily similar to the great Tom Baker, and the author (former QAF Lead) seems even even the smallest characters are alive. <br /> <br /> I know ... I am involved. But all these sci-fi geeks should have a list. I do not know why it has not been here .. whatever you do ... if you ever like Dr. K. or scientist ... look at this !!!
