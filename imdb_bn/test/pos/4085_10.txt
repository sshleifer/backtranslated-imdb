I usually do not like this movie but worked at home and wanted to see almost half when I used to. I was so busy that I was sitting alone and looking at the last thickness continuously. And I definitely do not shed tears on such events, but at the end I was crying. Many minds are different. Great acting, and feeling good south. John Carberry was one of the most talented actors out there, and that guy playing Luke was really good. Highly recommended.
