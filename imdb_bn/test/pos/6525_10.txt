For a movie within 18 days and less than $ 2 million in budget, this little movie can be eligible for the 'Best We' award. Interesting premiere (aside from normal metallic element) with hard perfs by a cast of familiar faces. 2 thumbs up Other critics suggest: Do not be afraid to choose anything you like.
