When I went to the video rental shop, the day the DVD was unknown to me, I returned to see all the movies I was interested in. Or I thought! The man behind the counter told me that there was something for me that I definitely want. He gave me "Plunkett and MacLeane". First of all, I suspected it to be good, but I trusted his advice and ... man, I'm sure I was also happy with this jewelery! If you ask me, it's one of the best adventure movies of the year! Of course, as a major part of Robert Carlisle, how bad can a movie be? Certainly, Levi Tyler does something better and does not do anything more beautiful: But still, you can clearly understand that casting was fun enough to make this movie.
