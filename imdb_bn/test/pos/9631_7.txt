It seems that all people did not like Steven Sigal: once to see his nomination list, only for Razi Award nominations (with one person), but I think he did not earn any money. I saw good movies with Steven Sigal, saw bad movies with Steven Siegel. And Patriot (1998) is one of his best films, almost as well as Siege (1992) or Hard-to-Kill (1990). Patriot shows his activities for nature's protection. Of course, this movie is not great and I must say that there is more violence than me, and why Sigel's best friend is there. Will Jones die in the death of the victim? Dr. The role of McClaren is one of Sigal's best performances. She always has a very good charisma. And in summary, Patriot's good entertainment-and average ratings are just the 4-minute lowest ever movie. <br /> <br /> Best regards, Hans-Dieter
