Eisenstein published his collaboration with Prokaviv in equal partnership, where they worked together in conjunction with photos and music, scene scenes. Unfortunately, the sound recording was a disaster, so once the standards devotion to the DVD's backfires. Fortunately, there is at least one retrieved version of VHS (BMG Classics) films, by the excellent re-recording of music (Philharmonic orchestra and chorus of St. Petersburg). <br /> <br /> It is interesting to compare this movie with contemporary propaganda films of England, Germany and the United States. In 1938, the image of Eisenstein was created in response to the fear of the German attack; And in 1943 when the German attack in German was still expected in Olivia. Both films are periodically, but in different ways. Olivier started showing Shakespeare's own company with a stage performance in Globe Theater, then moved from our theater to another cinematic (though stylized) settings. Eisenstein's film is cinematic from the beginning, but dialogues and lectures are still influenced by the melodramatic performances of the old Russian theater. This works well for Alexander Serrakasov's speech, because his role as a prince and military leader plays a role in the public. <br /> <br /> The first major campaign film in Nazi Germany is Lenny Rifenstahl's Tired Will Trimm, which records a huge political show - crowds of people are encouraging Hitler's boring speeches. The 1936 Berlin Olympics film has its greatest propaganda all-out great mythological legend about the athletic male body worship. But German promotional films of war may also be fine. Curl Ritter's Urlab Auf Arinwart (Honor Ward Furlaf) is the norm. It shows a young lieutenant that his company will go on a 24-hour holiday before returning to WWI (and almost certain death). Against the suggestion of veterans, he receives honorary words for his return, although he sued the court and shot him if not shot. Naturally, they all come back (though many of them surround themselves on this), perhaps giving inspiration to the viewers to showcase their country's duties. <br /> <br /> In the United States, one of the best propaganda films of WWII was Howard Hawke 'Air Force. In it, we follow a blooming crew because they bond with each other with the experience of the war and overcome the obstacles to continue their fight in the war. Usually for Haq's movies, but their true loyalty is even more to each other than their country. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein has to go a long way in history to find a Russian military victory. Wickedly, Alexander (like other Russian princes) came from Viking, who wished to conquer the Russian river and rule his own Rafims. So he is a conquerrer to be reclelling another conquerrer. Physically, they are not different (although acting actors of the German prince were certainly chosen for their unwiseness and stupidity). But in the opposite of ordinary soldiers. Russian farmers are tall and strong like high-ups; German farmers who came out of the shield wall to kill the wounded Russians are smaller than their owners. Contrary to this there are some historical truths. Medieval Russian surfaces were much better than their European counterparts because they always ran to the thighs and could clean their own lands. <br /> <br /> Eisstein's film also gave us the first glimpse of Alexander with our expertise. Fishermen In the war with the Germans, he used his knowledge of the ice about his fishermen and his knowledge of their military strategy to defeat them. When the Gavirillo breaks the shield wall, they are forced to rely on the west of the lake, where the ice is thin. <br /> <br /> One of the other joy of Eisenstein's film (which most visitors miss) is historically the right way to illustrate the politics of medieval Russian. Cities such as Pskov and Novgorod give special importance to their growing wealth and mainly trade, which empowers traders and expels the royal family until they need to attack their military skills and attackers of feudal aggressors. In the film, Alexander was shown not only as a military leader but also as a politician, who would wait for his time and how to make his popularity after victory.
