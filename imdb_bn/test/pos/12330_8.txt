I can not describe the feeling of getting this painful VHS rental cassette 20 years ago. Somehow I rent it to my dad and I saw it twice with my younger brother. Yes, we got nightmares. In other countries including Finland, this film was originally set as a PG in the United States, it was 18 or under 16 years old. The film was about thirteen years old, but it must be the best PG-rated film ever of all time. There is no bad language or nudity. Originally created in 1981, was seen for several years before the release. <br /> <br /> This is a class B-movie, a true, horror of the good 80's. A group of college girls decided to spend a night in a burial, waiting for a supernatural evil ... <br /> <br /> You can smell the almost rolling meat and feel the atmosphere of this movie. It's a campie, totally stupid, but they can not do this movie anymore. Definitely there is a certain feeling of this horrible section of 80's. After all these years still effective and wonderful. <br /> <br /> These effects are dependent on Alice Burman Junior and quality and quality only by Thomas and Burman. The make-up effect plays a big part of this flash, otherwise it was just a boring teen slasher. <br /> <br /> it is finally available on DVD and it is also a special edition DVD with some addition. The commentary track is interesting <br /> <br /> (Actually, this version is not so special.) The average transfer in DVD, here and there below are some glit and scratch) It will be first highlighted in the blue underground but unfortunately it was rejected, so restoring the Shake Show print. Without releasing it. Very bad!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! I gave 10 to 8 because of "nostalgic values", otherwise 6 out of 10
