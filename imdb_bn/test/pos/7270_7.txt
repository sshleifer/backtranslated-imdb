When I was sitting to watch the movie I wanted to see a stylish tongue-in-the-go action film, which was applicable to the trailer. However, it has become very fast that this image is trying to do more. <br /> <br /> Typically, I do not approve of many movies that try to entertain in many ways. For example, the film tries to combine together with comedy, romance, light heart and intense seriousness. This type of method mostly does not work in movies (just keep an eye on Batman), but I was surprised to wonder that in this case, they stopped it. <br /> <br /> The end result is an extremely entertaining film that should appeal to most mature cinemagoers. (However, the stomach should be warned about one or two scenes of weaknesses.) Robert Carleley and Johnny Lee Miller pulled a brilliant Double Act and Kain Stretch. This makes for a very enjoyable watch mixed with gorgeous dresses and some decent action scenes. However, let me do the big down here that 'Gentleman Highwayman' was a real chance to have some good conversations but the script was clearly lacking in punch and some stomach laughs. OK, so the lines were not terrible, but to me it has presented a problem with recent British films; Some of today's major exceptions are ignored by some of Hollywood's efforts, which are currently being written.
