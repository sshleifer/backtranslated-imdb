An interesting movie based on the novel Zeus Verne. Considering today's special effects and computer-enhanced animation, this film has stood as the historic marker of cinematic enthusiasm and imagination. Karel Zeinan raised lithographic images in the original Zeus Verne texts. This must be seen for classic science fiction and history buffs. <br /> <br /> I give 9 out of this movie 9.
