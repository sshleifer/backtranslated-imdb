There was such a great series for black folk at this time. We like it a lot. This is the only show of black TV middle-class family. V.V. Time. Please release this on DVD. I know a lot ... many people who are still talking about the show. If it is released, I am sure that many black young people will get this light and attractive. The show addresses many issues from racism, inter-racial discrimination, teen pregnancy, siblings competence, single parents, colleagues, and more. The event ended in a sudden and left its fans stupid and left, why it was removed from the wind. Since then we have seen some of the actors and actors. DVD ASAP please release it.
