The Lost Oscillation of Slausen. . . A place for food, fun. . . And kill! When a guy disappears on his way to the gas station, a group of his friends comes out on a trip to find him. They may come across a wax museum where they think their friend may end up. Unfortunately, for friends, however, the owner of the street attraction has the power to control his wax mankines and use them for evil. One by one, tourists slacked and slausen and wax dummies were killed by his soldiers. Will friends escape or will they fall in the same fate as their lost friend? Following the footsteps of great classic wax films (House of Max, Max of Max Museum), the tourist trap makes it absolutely curious and interesting with wonderful stories and styles. As far as character development, action, dialogue, flow, etc., it seems to be a basic slasher flick. But, as far as it goes, the director takes control of this plot and leads it towards the supernatural thriller. The performances are very good (from the main cast) (from Beckwood-Shawman Mr. Slossen (played by Western King Chuck Connors). The writing is going well and the conversation has been well-formed, but there are some reasonable reasons for the film to go deep into the story. Some scenes are somewhat silly like cries-mannein attack on the picnic. However, it is not something like that. As it is expected from a movie about wax dummy, it is a continuous supply of mancuin that is a strange one (most of the inactive substance) can still sit and can be quite unstable ... Anyhow it is similar to the man , Or empty hole, or you know it's about an attack spring ... whatever, dolls are very b The effect is very well used with the fullness of the comedy and the film, as far as slashhers go, it's the best one, and it stands as one of the most minimal film I've ever seen. Obligatory Slasher Material: <br /> < br /> - Violence / Gore: The film is full of great deaths. The womb is not too much, but it did well and gave it up as realistic. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: There is an enhanced skinny-dipping scene with very attractive lead ladies (although 'very interesting' rare futuristic-began to describe Tania Roberts) but most of the girls are under water, but It's all lusty <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> One of the best killers in Slashher subgenre. <br /> <br /> - Scares / Suspense: From the first scene, the film maintains a great blend of moaning of mannequins, jump scares from attack, and strong level of strong level in a weak situation. . . This is really very good for creating a terrible horror movie. <br /> <br /> - Mystery: Well, the mystery was not the main point of the movie. . . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 8/10. Check out this vague slashher! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
