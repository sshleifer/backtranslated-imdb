The value of this film from today's perspective is ridiculous to lose 18 (or X in the US). The film has to say a sex, yet great love story, but the picture is rather innocent. Throughout the film you saw self-confidence in the late 1960's and early 70's, and conversations and general experimental films and light. And this is exactly the part that makes it valuable.
