I gave these movies 7 out of 10. I think the general dislike of this film can not really be understood by people's plot. If you think about the line of the story, then this movie actually makes a perfect idea, it never gives you an explanation for fooling you. Special effects are the special effects of sub-paras and it is displayed in half budget, but I think the originality of the plot dragged you. People say that the vampire style has completely ended and what you got from bleed is not your current vampire flick. This is a dream / alternative story of reality - it is a vampire / line with eternal life spin. I love it The only thing that prevents me from giving it high ratings, lack of special effects and I personally dislike movies where most people have the pronunciation. But I said before, if you really get the plot then this is not a bad movie ..
