Well, I have to admit, I'll do something like Peter Lipis and I'll admit that this is not the best Gullies Siegel. I mean, yes, it was his fault, as no gahilly himself But two obscure people come to the world are really fun, I think they are known as Dark and Light. I enjoyed the movie plot. Even at the end of the movie, Ghalley is understood to have a signal there. Still waiting Hah hah Peter Leipis revived his role as Jonathan Griffs, this time playing a detective, how beautiful! Ghoulies IV can not be frightening or suspenseful, but it's definitely fun. I thought I would comment on this movie and say - it's not bad. It is valuable to see if there are no ghulira.
