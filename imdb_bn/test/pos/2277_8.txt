"Japan takes the best from all over the world and makes it their own", although it may be true, it applies in addition to one thing, which is ... Major League Baseball .... But do not worry, "Mr. Baseball" all That has to try and change. But who will change, the film part is really making it rock! Tom Selleck is one of my favorite actors and really shines in his comedic role. The story can be true in life, but the sub-plot is dead-on. Japanese people are different from the Western Society and traditionally gentle, respectful people. Combine these elements and barriers for one really delightful, fun film. It's definitely worth the watch!
