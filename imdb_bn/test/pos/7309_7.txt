The film began with a gentle housewife (Narva Shearer) who cheated her husband (Rod La Roche). Three years passed and apparently they were divorced due to Belarus this year. Surprisingly, during this time, La Roch did not see Shi'er or his two children because Sherrar took him to Paris. <br /> <br /> Mary Dresler is a rich lady of the ladies and she invites a new and improved Softman to help her to break a rising romance between her daughter and La Rococo - apparently her home for the weekend! Apparently, Norman is now a super-vamp, and with her covetous sexual appeal, she can break the romance - and nobody thinks she and La Roch were married. There are a few weeks left for there and Immediately Narma has got an injury in her gay, discouraging sexy way - and almost all men (including La Rocco) are captivated by him. Someone told someone not to marry, but it is clear that his new and improved Norman is back! This movie is a sophisticated comedy of behavior in the upper crust - in some ways, like the rules of the game of Genone. Surprisingly, despite the intensity of depression, such movies were quite popular about rich people, although today many suspiciously find too much drills in their stains. However, fortunately, stay in the United States, there are lots of cute and fun moments (especially when Marie Dresler shows her true colors at the end). Although not a great movie, it is certainly a better and more time-than-passer. My only real remorse is that I do not really love. You just have to see it for yourself - maybe you agree with the last, probably you do not, but I'm sure you enjoy this cute movie.
