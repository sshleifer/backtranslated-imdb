It has been said that Batman started "fixing it" in the first Batman film, but I think it is a terrible situation, because I think the new Batman movie, though Batman is more than ever and more than Batman and Robin, as well as Tim Burton's classics, these five best Being Dark beautiful, such as music and scenery, in contrast to Batman Beginn, a Gotham City is hidden in the mystery of the city, where Gotham City is a natural look city. Villain is awesome in this movie. You can not literally take your eyes off the Penguin and the cat woman. I congratulate Tim Burton on the use of papaya instead of a simple criminal or old Batman TV show clone. At the beginning of Batman we have a squarecase, which has almost no fifth or cat screen demand. The film just does not need to look at Batman, because we already know his story, and this is the villain we are searching for and trying to identify it, and they create that plot, whose mayor Major Pensin is running. And he failed to do a job to take revenge of his father's father's death by killing Gotham's firstborn child. Danny Davito has given the superhero role of superhero villain in a film, even more than the Nicholson joker. Closer view where the penguins drag the penguin into the water and touch it. Interesting marketing appeal, Warner Bros, since Batman wanted the movie "light" up, since it was a tragedy that Tim Burton was not allowed to complete his trilogy. And they got their wish ... unfortunately. Tim Burton planned to manage the third film, using Ridler as the arc, no bi-face and Robin were objectionable, and I'm sure Michael Keaton signed on. So this is the end of the great Batman film. Batman begins with darkness, but annoying, tired, filled with ordinary, needy villains, and a playboy Bruce Wayne. An appropriate Batman film, but the best Batman film ever? Ever. Batman returns the crown that returns.
