Seriously need to take up the light of the people and just be fun that is fun, and this movie f ** king is pleasing. Better than the first and the Noxville, this pair really increased for this movie, and the first made more crazy stunts. If Ebert and Roder (I do not say I'm a big fan of them), I can see the image of this film so that it is 2 thumbs, but I think other people can do it. I was not sure what I could expect from this, but I was fair and it is rare when it is better than a series. I believe this new one is the first big time to cross. So what I've done, just do not barf at some point and try to smile off your ass, kick the kicks.
