I realized that this show is so weird to please everyone, I do not get where I got these bad reviews, and I am surprised at the bad reviews that it got from fans of the movie. I liked it and got hooked on it from the first episode I saw. Although it was a little mad, that Kujko was kept in school. And it looks like high school instead of college. But I guess it's only eighteen years, okay, so is he not old enough to be educated? And Royals should not always have got the best education for them? So the "Do not have to graduate, or he will not be emperor" is not very strange for me. And I think his education was neglected before, so he must be educated now.
