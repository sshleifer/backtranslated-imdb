Duck_of_Death Again this film needs to be seen, because its main criticism is totally baseless. The film did not forget the delay, and it was clearly mentioned in some places. The crew never showed a conversation with the mission control, which does not comply with long-term rules. <br /> <br /> One thing that I thought was a little risky - a crew land would have only two hours to press the pressure on a planet? I suspect it. Will a manned space ship go into a star's corona? I suspect it. People will take the moon and attack the moon with a huge bomb? I suspect it. Also, the ship seemed overly sturdy. Will it be slow to design like a ship that is atmospheric risk? I suspect it. Will it survive being hit by smoker debris? I suspect it. I think the pressure on the structure in both cases will be very high. But above all, the unlikely situation was compensated by some nicely special effects, better editing and production, and by some well-played actors especially the ship's captain and Russian astronauts portrayed.
