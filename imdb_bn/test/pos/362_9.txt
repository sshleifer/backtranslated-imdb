The first killings scene is one of the best killings in the history of the film (almost as well as the Shikar fountain scene) and Robert Walker's performance is remarkable. A disciplined exchange involving murderous tennis stars. Story and overall this image is very good but there is a problem: why Guy Henes first place 4/5 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
