All right, I'm going to agree with the past comment criticizing this show. I think this show is awesome. (I was still the Jasmine Weber and I mean that Frei was still alive, so addicting!). And I was surprised that it was classified as a soap because it is not like the same look and feel in America. Here swap is absolutely awesome! At least GZSZ highlights the lines of movies, original music, and more playful stories. Moreover, in most cases, JZAD's performance is quite strong, especially with Josephine Schmidt and Felix Jasperf. (Plus, soap actors mostly work on behalf of most of the workers who have their highest job schedules). If this rating is high, it must certainly do something; US soaps are displayed day by day and historically, there is always a rock-down rating. Give GZSZ a chance! Believe it, it's good!
