I was not sure what to expect from "driving lessons" - whether it was uncertain whether Rupert Green might carry this role, but within the first few minutes I was completely submerged. All the way, the music, the acting and the scenery were absolutely stunning. Julie Walters, as always, gave a fantastic performance as the bright old actress EV, and Rupert Grint gave a fantastic performance as well, as well as romantic Ben. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the right, I was forced to fight Antantian cringes, laughter and bliss instead of Ben when he was free from his controlling mother and his only friend fought for his friendship with Ivy. A very controversial story, perhaps exaggerated but I do not see the best movie any time in the long run. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Just enjoy yourself.
