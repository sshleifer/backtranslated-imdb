This review speaker can have! What is the reduction of Western civilization ...... What is a great title? And fat is a great movie. This is the best concert film I've ever seen. Talking Heads Movie "Stop Making Sense" is one of the closest. When Wayne World came out in 1992, I heard about this movie. I saw the director name Penelope Spirits and thought the cool name, what else did he point out? I was pronounced like yeast in the first name. After some time in the film guides, I was in the critically acclaimed Dicline and realized that Penelope was a woman ... my mother corrected me. I spent 8 years in my life trying to track this. I finally saw VHS in Vancouver, where I'm currently living. It was worth the wait. This LA bird's movement captures very well. It's teen angst at its best folks. Because my favorite band is microbes who need subtitles for songs because Derby crashes so crazy songs, you can not understand it. I laughed when I saw it. The band's black flag is a very intimate bunch to live in a abandoned church and band X. In the letter laughs, some stupid slash has written in the magazine that how to save our whales, we have a myriad of poisonous toxic seas! After that I became a huge Penelope Spirits fan, and I saw all his punk films - Dude was right, and Saberia is a classical classic! I own this both of VHS. She is a true underground film maker and I love her stuff. I thought of this movie in 1994 that Grunge was so popular. I was so fond of having a great execution, but I saw it in 2002 and at that time I came out of Grunge and now I can hear Crystal Method / Fataby Slim. Much change in speed, I know, but what can you do? But if you want the true screenplay of the punk movement, it does better than this. Better than 1991: The year's punk breaks. It's a tough movie to track, but if you get your hands on it, rent it, even if you do not like music, it's a great job. Now with the DVD being so popular it can be easy. Penelope created a small Albert Brooks movie called "Real Life", which I also own. Today's reality is a very interesting thing on TV! RENT RENT ...... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Thanks!
