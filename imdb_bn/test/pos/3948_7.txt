One of the curiosity of this historical drama is to illustrate the "Tories" or British American Loyalists, and the glass provided for the help of King George III encouraged them. In many ways the American Revolution was certainly a family affair, in which some of the wealthy colonial families were divided. If there is strong criticism from this film, perhaps the story of this story has become worse than them in real life. In some cases, the role of Major Bolton's character, managed by Colonel Wilde, makes him the least favorite of imagination and defect in the story. He thinks, 'something for the reason', seems to be different from being a miserable patriot to be a colleague. This image greatly paid attention to the personal concepts of personal dignity and the concept of personal heritage which was a great social norm in that day and age. Among the symptoms of <br /> <br />, twenty-five percent of the colonial population is fairly glossed pro-British too. However, the power of the Tory material is notably disappointing, although the best doctor's character is about twenty-five percent higher class tweets (stolen fine words from Monty Python's Flying Circus). Anne Francis does a whole lot of work with a thin part instead of the script, and it stands. He lucky loyalty was a good choice for women, a 'gallery', more modern than the day's social conference - if life and death struggle could not continue. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Above all, leading letters are very well-drawn, minor letters are not just "promos" and war scenes are credible enough to carry dramatic steps. <br /> <br /> This is a great spy movie. This is not a great historical drama, but it is not quite well satisfied. Kernel WILD was so deeply submerged in his role and it did very well and made much of the foremost effort of Anna Francis. <br /> <br /> Color printing used in tender classic movies is very clear, as well, and so it was an enjoyable presentation in an important way. <br /> <br /> I hope it will run again soon.
