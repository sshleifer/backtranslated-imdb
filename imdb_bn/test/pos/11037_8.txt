If you are very sensitive to extreme ethnic tendencies, this cartoon is not for you. But if you are interested in seeing a rare piece of battlefield animation, then come in! <br /> <br /> In this cartoon, Popeye is melting the sea and discover what she saw in Japanese fishing boats. Two Japanese fishermen seem to want to sign strategically peace agreement with Popeye. But beauty can be deceitful; Japanese navy ship fishing boat! It is believed that promotion of psychosis is promoted today. <br /> <br /> Stay tuned, Japanese representations of the film are done in a moderate cheerful fashion. Remember, the war was going on at that time. But I strongly recommend this cartoon who are interested in WWII era.
