A movie for adult, educated audiences ... <br /> <br /> I saw "Random Hearts" in advance screening a few days before the release of North America. This romantic drama was quite a treat. I'm not sure that this story will not be a cup of tea, especially considering the film's deep downbeat premiere. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I suddenly said, <br /> <br /> Force One, "Patriot Games") in his game Leading Dutch athlete and frustrated Internal Officer Dutch Ford shows a very low, dancing performance range that can achieve with the class and determination to bring the world to the listener and its betrayal and betrayal. This is a perfect role model for Harrison Ford and various types of films to satisfy the screen with its blockbusters. The following year, Harrison Ford starred in its summer 2000 thriller "Hat Lease Bainth", directed by Robert Jamkis ("Forrest Gump," "Back to the Future"), and later Clancy's "all the fears" of Tom's adaptation of the movie. 'Fears' Harrison Ford CIA Operative Jack Ryan will be third on <br /> <br /> Director Sydney Pollack ("Outside Africa," "Firm", "Tootie") has played an important role in this feature. Scott-Thomas Congressman's political adviser This is a very sharp and energetic portrayal for Pollack. Sidney Palak is not just a gifted director, she is also one of the most credible, natural and fascinating actors around. ("Eyed Wide Shot" as well as he can see). <br /> <br /> <br /> Christine Scott-Thomas ("English Patient," "Horse Whisperer") shows that you do not have to be sexy to be strangers or mundane. This is one of his best movies, and he has given a splendid and gentle performance that works well against Ford's peace-loving people. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . Actor Dennis Hesbert's "hit" actor, a cool and effective counter-appearance to prevent detection of detective George Weaver into Dutch investigation into police corruption. <br /> <br /> The rest supporter actor is a wonderful delight. Charles S. Duighton (whose long-term exposure for a film's leading role) saw that he was the best character actor around and Bonnie Hunt, who has found this product very firmly, in most of those scenes that wonderful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is from Dave Grusin (Pollack's "The Farm"), Philip Rousselt ("This is a River RUNSHEET") Unfortunate ending To edit a new intense movie that beo, Philip ruselatata ( "it runs through it"), the fully-felt jaji exaggeration to score. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who puts a good twist of mystery, beautifully plotting characters, character-driven stories and romance all together. This is a horror story about betrayal and forgiveness. This is Harrison Ford's most surprising, yet insane, and some controversial conclusions in recent times. "Random Hearts" is definitely one of the best movies of the year. <br /> <br /> (**** in 1/2) or (10.0 out of 8.5)
