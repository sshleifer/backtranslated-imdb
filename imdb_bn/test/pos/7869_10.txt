"The Begume" is one of my favorite Clint Eastwood movies and it's a departure from its usual primary role. Directed by Don Siegel, with which Eastwood collaborated in several films, it was created with "Play Misty for Me", a year before Edward's debut was made by Eastwood. An alternative title was considered for the film, "Pud-futting down the old plantation", which was not used gratefully, otherwise I am sure that what happens to girls in school should be avoided. In the mid-1970s, I first saw this movie in my college film class, and it was immediately taken away. Until recently I purchased WideScreen DVD, it was its old VHS tapes, which included highlights, terrible trailers that added the film as "PoEnPlace" sub-opera and did not reveal the cries of film. Interesting Note: Eastwood and Seagull had to fight with Universal Pictures to win the original, and they won; And, the film was billed as Standard Eastwood Western, which certainly is not. This is a deceptive and horrible gothic story during civil war, which is going on in sex and sexual tension throughout life. <br /> <br /> I am not sorry about this review, and if you want to see it, you want to watch the movie but be cautious to see it on the Internet, because its spoiler reviews are abundant. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood portrayed a union soldier John McBurney. Fired at the Confederate Ground and discovered by a young girl from nearby girls' school. He saved him and took him back to school, but instead of informing the local square of his presence he would be taken to prison, Prime Minister's wife Miss Martha (Geraldine Page), his assistant Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman), his black servant Holly (Ma Messer) , And most of the girls take her away, she cures her, and falls under her spell. The film sets the vocabulary of title to right and gothic, because it shows the real battlefield shots from the war, when Eastwood's voice quietly sings a scary song of the time. <br /> <br /> Because of her face with the little girl, her voice of character, and the whole film sets the voice. More than that, the surprise of that first scene will be lost. To say anything more about the film, it can destroy it for anyone who did not see it ... If you are in the fuzzy, Gothic story, find it and rent it. Eastwood is extraordinary in the film, and it is fascinating to see him as a primary role, or role, in which he mostly portrays a very disrespectful character. <br /> <br /> A Paul on the Geraldine page was the role of a movie like the Prime Minister, and I can not imagine another actress in that role; The lengthy shot can be Piper Laurie, but I do not think that Laurie Geraldine can play the same role as Page. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Hartman (An extraordinary performance of the film "A Patch of Blue" is another high point of her little career as a dark girl of love for the character of Poetry) at the same time, her main, fine, and efficient Unfortunately, his flexibility in the film was also part of his real life; He committed suicide at the age of 45. <br /> <br /> I finished this review with this observation: Yankee is no match for a liar, hateful and despicable southern bell.
