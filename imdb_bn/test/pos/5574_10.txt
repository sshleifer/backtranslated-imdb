Two years after using this site for movie reviews, I finally got registered with IMDB so I could have given a "10" in Farsk. The show's authors, cast and crew have proven themselves in the series of science fiction, feel free to master. Even those who generally do not appreciate the science-fee should be encouraged to give them an opportunity for this exceptional series too! <br /> <br /> There are many awesome things to do in the list of the only way Firefox's attributes are listed, but one of them is still standing; The writing quality is amazing. "Black 7." Since then, I have not heard this good conversation. Far from the very best special effects and "romance 7" with a little more romance. <br /> <br /> Everybody, enjoy!
