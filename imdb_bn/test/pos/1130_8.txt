I saw the pilot episode for this one with high expectations, just graduating college and moving "real life". I was not in a brother-in-law, but most of my friends were there, and I was able to take part in the many partitions I had in their house, so I know what's going on somewhat. <br /> <br /> This show is probably a drama, not a documentary in Greek way of life, or college life in that way, although it mostly holds the truth in most cases, although in most cases it is exaggerated. If you watch the show for quality as a TV show and nothing else, it is very entertaining, just like movies like old school, poker, and animate house. If you want to do all of its chronology in your own experience in college life, perhaps you get more, or crazy that they make many events dramatic.
