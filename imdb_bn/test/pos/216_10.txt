The inspiration for the film "Naked Guns" Leslie Nilsen was recently able to start a comedy * - Incompetent but heroic Frank Drewin always resolved a stupid case. Like "Aircraft!" And movies based on the series, comedians, depending on Brooks-style spot gag and stupid comments (such as "yes it" comments), as well as fools around him, Nilson is very serious. And of course, the final frame, which keeps anything moving. <br /> <br /> It is very bad that there were only six episodes on the show. At least it spawned the movie. You might not be wrong in such a role with Leslie Nielsen. I suspect that they are all musicing. Really funny <br /> <br /> * "Before the Bike!", Leslie Nilssen starred in the movie "Forbidden Planet", "Harlow" and "The Posidon Adventure". At the end of 1987, he starred alongside Barbara Streisand and Richard Dreyfas in "Badam". But since the first "nude gun" movie it has all been comedy.
