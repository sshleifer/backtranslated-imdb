This intelligent, moving and beautiful film is a study of the way people respond to tradition (reminds me about the novels of William Faulkner). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < , And instead of throwing them completely to seek a way to live in those roles. But the story develops two wives, trapped in a loveless marriage, gathered together. Taking hold of their friendship and love power, they dare each other to give up their role. They have seen that there is no living life in their heritage, it is a living death: without passion, without perfection, without true connection. Although they know that they will have to pay for rebellion and independence, but it is far less dear than a sacrificed sacrifice for a comfortable, anticipated existence. <br /> <br /> The picture is amazing, incredible acting. Near perfect!
