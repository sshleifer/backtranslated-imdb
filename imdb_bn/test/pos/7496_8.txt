OK, so this movie is not very well known and has not been promoted very well. I saw this annoying gangster watching a good movie on a number of millions of movie channels in Sky over a bitter evening, but I'm glad I did! The sequence of the film is fantastic in a very dark way. This is actually what I think is the general sound for the movie. I think many critics and movie fans who actually saw this movie. It is not a bad thing to write it like a resident dog vein.OK in a low-budget gangster movie, so unlike the comparisons between Thursday and other criminal films, there is an unlikely resemblance, but with all the accuracy, I think the film is a much darker comedy in this type of film. Takes up and the end result is completely original Although not the end, the end result is a great, good, funny, Tom Jane, good at it and worthy of recognition, he will now expect Punisher to go. As a bad guy, its performance has gone well, realistic, fun and cool enough that you believe that he was actually a bad ass before reform. The other thing that stands for me is the character of this film. Happy blood lover triggers a catalyst of a psychologist mountain with brain with a smooth, lethal but very cold leader (Nick), a woman (Dallas) and sexually abused (Billy Hill) in the Nix Gang. [7] The most vicious police detective is sometimes seen on the screen, played Mickey Roork well, and got a recipe for you ... Thursday is genuinely true. It is sometimes darkly ridiculous, sometimes cruel, sometimes irrational, but always bizarre and valuable. 8/10
