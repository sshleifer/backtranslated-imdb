Ali Ji Shaw was really amazing - he was so rapper making such a fool, but in an interview someone said that he was just pretending. Sasha Cohen is a very intelligent man, who pretends to be stupid, so he can get a really honest answer from humans ... and this is very interesting. So I did not expect the movie to be good, because it was all work - there was no real person or interview. So the basic point of all shows is lost. But I was wrong - I always smiled, it was one of the funniest movies I've seen. Surely it was stupid, but none of the others, some of them, to some of them, to some of them, but to some of them. It was not supposed to be a realistic documentary ... and it's not like the show, it goes quite differently, but that does not mean it's bad. When I finished observing, I was totally impressed, but after spending time I realized that it is not that special, but it is still better than nine - for what it is supposed to be at least.
