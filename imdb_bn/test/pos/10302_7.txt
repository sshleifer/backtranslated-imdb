This movie is based on a game, and the second adaptation of this work. Paul Sorvino took home the championship home 20 years ago against all odds that players play basketball coach in a team. They all have met for a reunion. Terry Kinney plays James, a junior high princess, and will quickly get on your nerves with all her whip and feel sorry for my role. Vincent D'Ophrio, as Phil, only plays an insulting businessman with the exact amount of "money" power. Tony Salahb was the current mayor of the city George, and he was present at the breaking point of the breakdown. Gary Sines Tom, who is a writer, drunk, and in my opinion, the role is excellent. They all seem to celebrate their championship, conflict, jealousy, and war celebrations. What did the men talk to, and now they are forced to see their lives in an unwanted way. What a group of men can be talking and cry is unusual, and I find it interesting to see related to each other. It's not the best movie I've seen, but it's good enough to look at.
