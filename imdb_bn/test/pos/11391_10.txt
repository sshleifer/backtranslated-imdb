Boogie Night's was the best movie of 1997 without any doubt. I watch this movie over over and still love it. I do not have to watch that overblown romance / disaster epic Titanic watch again. Bugi Knights, even without getting the nomination of the best picture, is proven to be very convincing and narrow in terms of how estimate the Academy is. Only Sweet athman's The Sweet Akhtar and Robert Zemkis's relationship grew up like Bugy Nights. In recent years, any other filmmaker, Terrentino, has been remotely locked even to make good films such as Pert Fiction. Paul Thomas Anderson got the challenge and was successful. Tarantino John Travolter gave a kick in the carrier, just as Anderson has given the stick Bert Reynolds that needs his carrier. Bogie Nights will undoubtedly make Don Chadle, Heather Graham and John Reilly's star. Overall, a wonderful film. Better than PL fiction. Maybe even better.
