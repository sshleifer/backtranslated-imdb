Broadcast news opens with a series of short codes, which are shiny ways to start a story about TV anchors that have no source of what they are reporting. <br /> <br /> In a speech to a group of journalists, all of whom are annoyed by his presentation, most of them go away. When the last came out, the co-host of the event slowly said to Honey Hunter: "I do not think there will be any questions and answers." A fine line in a brilliantly written low-key comedy, a bay about the TV anchoring show Biz aspect. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Need help with a serious hazardous report and Holly refuses to get involved for the first time. He knows that he is looking good only, but is not a reporter. As long as his earpiece is working, he will continue to do research and get direct information from executive producer Hunter. <br /> <br /> Holly's another Anchor friend (Albert Brock's) helps her by providing information. Be sorry Of course, he has been confronted with his feelings about Assalamu Alaikum Brooks and has attracted strong protagonist Ankman Heart, who has a personal relationship with a commendable member of the staff. <br /> <br /> You have to wait twenty minutes before the movie ends, he will find a man. Brooks told him that the heart is wrong because he represents what he does against him. There is no story that this unexpected comedy will end with the Hunter (Neurotic heroine). Well, Holly Hunter, William Hurt, and Albert Brockes were all nominated for the Oscars (supporting role Brooks) that image itself and director / writer James L. Brooks After all, seven good Oscar nominees are eligible. <br /> <br /> This script does not like for a typical happy end - and, in this case, this is the only error for a great image. I felt cheated and somewhat deliberately given down by conclusion.
