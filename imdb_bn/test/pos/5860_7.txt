It is the murder detective intelligence agencies who fight with some rich children who do not do better than planning complex crime and cover it, it seems that they deliberately cheated the police force. They planted the formula and taunted the detectives headed off them in a wild hanging. At the end of this movie there is a decent plot with some good twists, Sandra Bulkak works herself well as a woman at this end and can not fight with her inner monsters, she can not remember that a man in her life, especially the partners, looks like she Forgetting him for some reason. Overall it's not a bad movie, it keeps you guessing to the end very frustrating.
