Anyone watching TV news is essential because it can help to be even more suspicious, even to be folk. In a personal note, I recall interviewing for TV some years back - what to do, what to do or not. Course instructors impressed on us that TV news was "show-winning section". That boring scene, is probably more valid than it is today, it is strengthened by this film. Do not remember the integrity of the journalism, how good is the appearance and excellent smile. And make sure you do not sleep in the camera. <br /> <br /> The interactions between three main characters form a central piece, each with its own ambition, power and belief. Brooks accepts these differences and sets them in a TV news studio volatile setting and adds more than the love interest in the mix. The result is complex, if something is overwhelming, to fill our ambitions and take with us to others so that we can illustrate how we compromise everyday. It's always entertaining, although the final scene was probably unnecessary, given everything that went before.
