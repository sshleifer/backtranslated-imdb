This is a movie which was suggested to me as a shining light, it really is. If you give a little note to this movie, then you really miss the point. You could describe as Fosca manipulaval, but if it is really serious, love is sick when love is sure of it. But what if you are certain that someone else loves you and you 'ugly' is simply 'rejected'? You do not fight for it. At least I think it is good to fight for it that dies in distress. And it reminds me that how will I react to physical deception in the first sight as a human being and do not look at the person or the person. This movie confronts me with very serious questions about respect, faith, fascinating feeling etc. If someone has tried me to manipulate or contact me, how can I do now? The most amazing feature of this movie that I think is that Itto Scola makes it absolutely believable that Jeregio falls in love with Fossa.
