A horror comedy drama about friendship power. Despite the rebuilding of a 1939 film of the same title, it would probably be compared to gender and City. I will not compare it at all. The story begins with Mary (Meg Ryan), who thinks that most women will be jealous, she will happily get married, she will have a good girl, a great friend and a great house. But Morris does not seem to have a perfect life, when he discovered Jack from the Crystal (Eve Mendes) with his husband being cheated. Mary is confused and does not know what to do. But his four best friends, Sylvia (Annette Benning), Eddie (Debra Messing), and Alex (Jada Pocket Smith) tried to stay there for the way they were. I do not really want to give away But I found this enjoyable, and I'm a man. Meg Ryan is great, after seeing a series of flop again look beautiful on the screen. And the rest of the cover is great, including the Eve Evans as Crystal. Just an enjoyable lighthearted comedy.
