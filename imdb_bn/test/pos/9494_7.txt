"Dance Change Your Husband", producer / director, Cecil B.D. Millal's other sub-opera comedy. He is a notable among several films by Gloria Swanon. I think you can also call a series of "Old Wives for For New" (1918) series. <br /> <br /> James (Eliot Dictator) and Lela (Swansea) Porter is a forty-ish couple, where James seeds have gone and slovenly and lazy. He has a raw and raw onion for smell cigar. She takes his wife for granted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ). She invites her to the house for Weekend to "Miss Miss" Will. Once Shailar begins to walk on her, promises her happiness, wealth and love, if she leaves her husband and goes with her. Imagine this committed new life, Lillar's series consistent with the success of his career, the epic drama of Day Mills was predicted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Finally, James realized that he only lost everything he wanted and started to correct his ways. He closed his torch, worked, stopped the onion and restored some modesty. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Lella is not all flexible with the new wedding. Sheela seems to have found it gambling and brought gold with the name Nanet (Ur Tootsi, or some name) (Julia Faye). Rila lost all his money and Lilar's diamond ring stole for his loss. <br /> <br /> A lucky day, Lella meets "New" James and is taken by her change. James drives his home and becomes aware of his condition ....................................... br /> <br /> <br /> This picture was marked by the start of the Superstar's rise to Gloria Swansea in the career of Mary Pikeford's rival. At the age of 20, he began his career at Mc Senet in which two reel comedies were at a teenage age. Eliot Dexter was about 50 at this time, but he and Swanson made a good team, although in this film anyone who is pretty hard to imagine Miss Swansea's tiredness. <br /> <br /> Dexter and Sylvia Ashton were similar to "Old Wives for New" where the woman went to bed and the husband was insulted. <br /> <br /> Cast Castro is also regularly seen as a bishop and Raymond Haton in gambling with Thailand's Roberts. .
