I am a big fan of Lonesome Dove and all the books in the series and I love the movie. I'm glad to see that they are ending with the moon. I have become a fan of Steve Jhanan for a long time and he was interested in playing a serious role. I personally think that Gus has made an amazing job of re-creating Steve Jhan. I can not think of another actor who has been well. He has all the voices, the methods, the word pronoun. Imagine, nobody ever drew a candle to Robert Duval as Gus, but I think Steve Jhan did a great job. Karl City has done the same work in all his movies so that he made a good match for the vendo call. For the movie, yes it's a little bit, but can you really hit the Lomnom? No, I do not think so.
