Really a good Australian movie Sydney's looks and feelings revitalize as well as the 1950s. I was very impressed by this during the first film of the first liberation war and it still stands very well. Fill Knows, Wonderful Camera Works, Reflective Lights and Fine Indicator works by some fine performances across the board. For a student of the 70's Australian movie, an absolute "must be seen" box is out!
