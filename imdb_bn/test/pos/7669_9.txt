The revised version of 1943 (which was contrary to the original production of 1935) was included in a widely-repeated review. This time there was fashion, so blame the film for a 16 year tradition. The film should only be visible for Sammy Davis Jr. for the extraordinary catalytic performance such as Preity Life. One of the many highlights of Doctor Davidridge's Bess her seduction soon said "Leavin of a boat for New York". Almost all major music is intact and beautiful singing. It certainly does bores which the recent PBS and MET version did. It is delighted to see that the movie did not diminish the time, and it is expected that it will be available for future generations who do not have the opportunity to gain experience.
