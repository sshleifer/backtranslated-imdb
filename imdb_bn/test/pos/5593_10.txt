It must be seen by playing 5 big stars. <br /> <br /> Based on a level playing, the Silver Cord is about "Mother Love" at her worst time. This picture was very controversial for the underlying boyhood of the little boy and the emotional expression of the mother's unusual "romantic" for both the boys. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But something seems wrong <br /> <br /> <br /> Mother, Laura Hope Crisis, seems to be annoyed with the little boy (Eris Linden) mother tongue (Frances D). But Don puts it on one side and tells of some strange thing as mother. Then he found out that "his" room is located under the hall of Macrosres, and he is standing by his mother's house. <br /> <br /> She is walking like a Mamiya and wants to kiss McCain (Lips) Good night. Mummy is working on Linden and she suspects her feelings for Dyer. Everything flies and runs on frozen pond in the frosty night. When the boys ran after him, Mami shouted from the window to return the boys and get their quotes! Dye falls through the ice and can be saved. <br /> <br /> When the girls left home the next morning, Don asked Mom to know what he was thinking and his attachment to the boy. But Mummy has a tight hold, faking illness and boasting of her sacrifice forever. The girls leave but the boys are behind ... <br /> <br /> The mother of the chicken is the glorious mother (her role of the stage repeats); It will dare to play a few actresses in a part. Sex overalls for the 1933 film are incredible and crew plays the role of her best film. Dunne is very nice as he tried to run the course after losing McCain. DD has some nice scenes after he dumped by Linden bewildered. All 5 stars are horrible in this play that is intrinsically intrinsically and unknown. <br /> <br /> For anyone who likes acting, a neglected gem ......
