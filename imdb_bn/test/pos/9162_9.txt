From the first scene to the last scene, this film is very realistic, even very realistic that sometimes we can not see details in the night scenes (dark like real darkness), in the desert (sunlight is so strong in the real desert). <br /> <br /> The script and the actor's game are very realistic. Shots and episodes are edited so that things and events are not shown as "effective", their "interpretation", or Hollywood movies, in order to "entertain" viewers. The edits here represent such events as they really happened in Afghanistan. The camera is sometimes set far away from the soldiers who died, even when the main character Major Bandur was shot dead. <br /> <br /> This method reminds me of the excellence of Italian neo-reality. And the story here is based on the same principles as "Pisa" or "Bike Thief" - the series of "real life" episodes and some patienceful moments that seem to be first and forehand, but there are internal reasons. <br /> <br /> I think the inner cause of Major Bandura's suicide death is religious emotions - a reminder for the death of innocent people (not only in the village but also the death of his family but also the death of the soldier). He is not portrayed as a stylish believer, on the contrary he is portrayed as a strategic and responsible officer. Because of this, his last decision seems to be a job of repentance (returning to the demolished village and going back to the armed forces), whose family he killed). <br /> <br /> The Russian Orthodox Qur'an, which looks at the end ("soothing") is another topic by which the film can be seen.
