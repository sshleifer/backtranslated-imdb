When I came to know about this movie I found American Pi 2, at the beginning it was a trailer for Ali Ji Indahouse, I saw the trailer and it forced me to buy a DVD, it looked incredibly funny! So the next day, I went to my local store and sorted it for Â£ 3.99 (door!). This image is about Ali Ji, who is a "gangster" large crew of West Strike, who is the rival of the East Raider's big crew. Ali has a "Cub Scout" pack in which he learned how to survive by "swearing", how to swear and steal, Ali finds out that the government stops the money coming to the retired center where Ali teaches the kids, he staines For MPs and MPs one of the staves to try to get rid of the retirement center for the airport for an airport. Ali takes a lot of smiles, smiles throughout the whole movie! Boraat produces a look for a few seconds in the film, this is definitely a sure movie for Saakara Baron Cohen fans for you!
