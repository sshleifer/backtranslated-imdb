A documentary filmmaker searches for unusual phenomena related to an ancient monster legend known as "Kututba". From its appearance, the film looks like a camcorder movie that has been popular in the last few months, even one that will be released next week (nuclear activity)! However, like movies like Cloverfield, REC, and Blair Witch, where most of the movies are full of chaos and all frustration, it is originally shown in a traditional documentary style. It's TV quotes and interviews and fears are very fine, well, apart from the last 20 minutes, we will go under the influence of chaos and where a terrible factor is raised. <br /> <br /> and it works. The film is very harmful and it makes you think. Yes, you heard me right: it thinks you You must pay attention to the related details of the film, and during the movie these things will start to get together with each other. The film is moving very slow, which, in this case, is a good thing. We can absorb the details shown on the screen, as an audience, but they are subtle or disgusting. <br /> <br /> Above all, this is a terrific little movie. I am a person who is afraid of ghosts and is more unusual than the killers, who have killed teenagers, yes, the film gave me some nightmares. Here are some pictures that are really annoying to see, which is close to the end where it lets you go "What am I seeing?" Well, it's a good answer. There are about ten reusable characters, all of which have given real performance in their roles. <br /> <br /> The only thing that I like about film ends, because most of the questions go unanswered. The question "What is it?" My mind went though. It left a bad taste in my face. However, the rest of the film is just shocked and really scared. You'll regret this choice because you will not see this alone in the dark. Also, for several years I can see that Hollywood will rebuild this movie. That would be interesting.
