Lacwana Blues, a tactful story about a grandmother, a woman who gave herself to everyone to help. It is said from a boy's point of view that when grandmother does not do anything till her own mother's task, <br /> <br /> I respect this movie for three main reasons: 1) It is touching, but two Not sad It is said in a very real fashion, saying too much provocative Hollywood stories. And the last is pretty (lusty but not above). <br /> <br /> 2) Although it is clearly an African-American film, which is being set up in the black community of Lacwana, New York, , It does not wear her race on its lining. The story stands on the strengths of characters and plays (and comedy) surrounding their lives. It's not promotional, it's easy, it's easy. <br /> <br /> 3) This is a great soundtrack (old school and B and the Chicago blues can not beat). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Usually acting is strong, but not universally so. Some of the acting performances are supposed to be kept in character until the characters are supposed to be acting. But it is considered a movie made for a TV, which can be expected. <br /> <br /> Out of 10, 8 are incomplete but preferably, good films for the rainy season.
