I just love this show. It's very fun and cool. This ridiculous and attractive character of the hood, I love him. He is making this program what he does, although Crank and Ijma are very funny and charming. But the show is great for me, because it always keeps me laughing, it's not just a episode. But this is very interesting and all the characters are so beautiful and cool, it makes the display time valuable, unlike some Disney Channel shit Try this shot next time, if you've seen this movie and even if you do not see the movie you can still enjoy it enjoyable, so go ahead.
