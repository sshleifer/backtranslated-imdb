This wonderful movie is a love story, and shows that all relationships are not determined to end. <br /> <br /> Director Peter Verhoeff gives us closer insight into the 1900's, how society deals with mistakes (mistakes), and how strong can be a very powerful. Police with woman (Nynke). Great clothes, landscapes, lovely songs and good actors, and acting on this photo, you attract you to the length of the film. <br /> <br /> Scroll to a page that explores the rest of the lives of the rest of the life. This is a great (best) way on reflection that can make your own imagination the rest of the life. <br /> <br /> This was the second movie for me, when scrolling the last titles (when the first is the list of Schindler). This effect was apparently on everyone in the movie.
