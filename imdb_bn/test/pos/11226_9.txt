Big Sky Country Stark, Cold Island, Its Cosmic Snowfall Mountains are in the Barren Plains, here in this linguistic fallible / slide film, young and talented Polish Brothers (who previously played the bizarre and chic "twin fruit idaho" of Indie filmmakers - a young girl Samayam's twins who fell in love with two brothers A movie on screen). A small orphan is going to die, and a flood called a city progress (form is a damn and hydrothermal energy plant). Through his hearty delightful music score, minimal development and character development, and extraordinary fantasy sequences involving some extraordinary angels, Polish brothers know every film to a good film artist, moving pictures ... images scenes ... deep beauty pictures are caught in celluloid. It's good to see late in the night, so that the hunting image can make your mind lasting longer and you can get out of sleep. All of this was done in less than two million dollars of shoe street budget, which puts Hollywood at risk for their leakage film and cheat films, and in the future, it is a great part of Polish brothers.
