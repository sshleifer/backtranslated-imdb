2:37 An intense and impressive drama that has some similarities between voice and content like Bullie, Elephant and Kid's (though, according to my perspective, 2:37 These are three best films). Before watching this movie, my expectations were neutral, but I took a very good impression thanks to the wonderful screenplay, the perfect aspect of Murali K Thalali and a wonderful performance from a group of young actors. <br /> <br /> Spodic incident school violence around the world has inspired many movies, TV programs and books that seek to find out and predict the external or internal factors of rebellion, incompetence, and especially the crazy expressions of madness. Some people might say that 2:37 that the artistic movement is too late; However, I do not think so, because due to this delay, the film was given more artistic analysis, rather than a clear reaction to cruelty and pain, the situation was in line with more intelligence and intelligence, which inspired other movies with similar stories. <br /> <br /> In 2:37 characters, we can find a teenage movie from director (director and screenwriter John Hughes-RIP movies), beautiful "princess", weird "nerd", antipathetic Athletes, etc. It has been very easy to be created in ollow caricatures defined by their function in their screenplay; But it is a commendable curriculum that crosses the tendency to implement the real person with credible problems, in less or less degrees, a person may find it on the road to maturity. <br /> <br /> 2:37 An extraordinary movie, whose only failure is some of the last effects, but which compensates it with many positive elements. Thaluri will be very interested to see the next projects, because her first debut came with this movie.
