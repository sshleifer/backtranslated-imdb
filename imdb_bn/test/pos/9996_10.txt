This movie gives golf a high sign, it was well played and well directed. You are giving a view of history that some non-sports fans will enjoy. The historical factor alone gives it a high rating, the Brooklyn golf course is really working well. I'm in the northeast and saw Brooklyn as a fan, and anyone who loves this game. The movie is well done on all levels. You will see a 5 star. Acting was extraordinary, Disney is another winner in her bag in her great movie. For any other reason, the film gives hope and encouragement to young people who do not expect their hope in life. In the late 1800s and early in the 1900's, I told you very realistic. The costume and dialect were just as well. Duty for a golf film is to above and beyond the call. One should also look for fans and non-fans alike.
