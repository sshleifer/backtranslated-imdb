I saw this picture in the early 70's and I was gentle by Judy Geson. For me, it kept the emotion of Rod Stiggers secretly young and extremely sexy with hit hikers, which was played by Gayson. <br /> <br /> You could not help the wife with a little sadness, Bloom was glowing brilliantly by Claire. I was really disappointed that the original cut was lost and there was little chance of getting rid of the DVD. <br /> <br /> I deny anyone who saw the movie, and its powerful message is not evenly absorbed by three main character performance, and I will meet it again, if anything else for a completely nostalgic reasons. <br /> <br /> Returning to some 35 years time <br /> <br> A real classic.
