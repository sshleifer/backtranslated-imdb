This image takes everything at the next level, the previous incarnation top by one mile. Always JackASS people are totally unbelievable, and I myself also laugh more than the hard times in that theater. Like the first jackasses, this is not the movie that Stantes and Junk's long-standing 80-minute string. This is the highest level of pure circus entertainment. Basically these guys are clowns, debasing themselves for amusement of others. And its great The Schengenians are so low, humiliating, and often annoying that they overhang higher entertainment. <br /> <br /> You can not rate it in your own category with other movies. And it shines. Go and enjoy it for that pure spectacle.
