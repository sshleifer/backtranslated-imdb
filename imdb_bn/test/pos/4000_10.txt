The fire gives all ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the most meritorious meditators of artistry. In the 19th century Korea, it tells the story of the famous paintwoman Ohahan, but instead of hiding on melodious music, melody, or psychoanalytic eggs, it portrays the episodes of various episodes of life, all of which are beautiful works of art in themselves. . It does not give any explanation for these episodes, but abandons them to think about the pictures of the owahans for the audience. In this way, visitors can enter the same thinking as Wahwan and his talents can "feel" their feelings on the way to the inspiration of his painting. <br /> <br /> Why is it so effective? The 19th Century Korea and the brutally enthusiastic publication of the musical / artistic world that Wahwan moved away from. Outside the painting, there are many fantastic shots in the world which have a mirror effect in which we inspire the beautiful world to be inspired by the world, and the creation of art, mirroring off each other. <br /> <br /> The story is called with extreme economy. A feeling is sometimes lingered or interpreted with the emergence, it will appear faster then gone for the next appears. As an analogy, it is a sort of Mozartian work of art (endless and quick succession of great ideas) compared to beetvivian (emotional lingering on one great idea). This is a classical restraint, like the painting of wahawans. There are no music about how to feel in any way other than some classical Korean pieces used with great effect on several scenes (and mostly played by characters in the film). A scary picture, if I remember correctly, a bird of the bird is flying over the blue hills, when a female singer cries. <br /> <br /> "This life is a dream, and only death will awaken us" << br /> One line of advice from one of the wahahan teachers in the film, "This image is in the stroke." In this film, it is followed by a lot of things * spoken and described * in the film. I saw it twice and it was very fruitful for the second viewing. A little film with a repetitive explanation method, one can see how it works in the movie 96. This is an artistic masterwork. Ohahan's great friend and mentor describes a picture of his painting, "One stroke is not lost. <br /> <br /> I compare it to Andrei Rubelov, though it is very different in style, it is much easier and more direct. For entertaining, however, Anderi Gothic is classical in form. <br /> <br /> Everybody is recommended to anyone other than junking too much. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, just great knowledge and learning Come on. "The next short scene was very angry, and the next time he was for the rest of the film, he became drunk. I wanted to know why so many words influenced him so much that he led him to drink alcoholic beverages over the rest of his life. Or was it just a coincidence?
