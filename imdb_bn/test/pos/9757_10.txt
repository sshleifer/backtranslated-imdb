I do not know where this movie was shot, but it was shot due to the location, it is true that this story has the capability. This is the story of a young English woman who was captured by the Japanese of South Asia at the beginning of WWII, along with a group of second English women. There is no prison for women, so they are forced to travel from space for a few months, because the Japanese do not know what to do with them. Australian women courage and stability in English women, and those who try to help them, the movie originals. This movie is very long, maybe 10 hours, so you can see it as shown in PBS, like the series, which actually connects this remote island across this remote island, and eventually joins the feeling of endless journey from Australia. . Story, cinematography, position and actor will not miss this single movie. My only question is why this DVD is not released!
