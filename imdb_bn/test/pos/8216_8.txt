Seeing this movie was suspenseful and fun. As a fan of such a movie, I enjoyed it. The evidence is scary, but I actually did not rate it 10 because it was topped in some cases. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Salmon could not recognize this girl? I understand the idea of ​​separating myself, but I believe that someone could not ID to this girl as Angela Bennett. That was above and so was the scene where he walked on someone else's desks and started typing. This overall a really good movie, was suspenseful and keeps your interest. Dennis Miller was as great as Allen, who was really credible, Bullock was bad as a secure computer worker, bad guys underestimated everything. <br /> <br /> I think the film's premium was really different and it was scary. What can be known in today's era? But some pictures of the top scenes prevented the film from stopping 10 to 10.
