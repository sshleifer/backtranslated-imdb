It can not be the most exotic or incredible episode they've ever made, but in my opinion it remains one of the most important stages of Star Trek and Saif-Fi genre. In particular, most of the reverse reverse Sy-Fi series with Star Trek has been reused, while on the other hand, it is a win once in most cases. In this episode, which ultimately affected me most. <br /> <br /> I like another thing with this episode like how the story of this particular and special effects could have been made and brutalized. Now, without criticizing this episode, I must admit that the dates are very dateable, but what can you expect from a TV show again since 1967? But the animal of this episode ("Horta") is basically just a carpet with some colored rubber on it. Yet you forget about it after about 1 minute and you start thinking about it as it was supposed to be about. Also the cave just does not look like rock, but after few minutes you forget it. How good is this episode and proof of living on a good story, it can ignore your visual effects. <br /> <br /> Acting from the main cast is always cool. This episode speaks of Maggie's series second mind and one of my favorites. So simple Leonard Nemo steals a scene here clearly, and his performance is excellent. Kirk or Hones will not get their share of episodes, but Spock is one of the most exciting in this one. Although this episode is not nearly the same as a specific character, it is close to three of those who manage an alien problem. The episode also looks very nice to see who does not happen in the enterprise. <br /> <br /> Like most Star Trek episodes this episode speaks of our open mind. I will not loot the story, but what is happening in the beginning often seems like a common demon story. It has killed many people and therefore must be killed. But is it really? I can explain to you that ultimately the explanation will not disappoint you. It's still my favorite Star Trek Taus episode and I give it a 10/10.
