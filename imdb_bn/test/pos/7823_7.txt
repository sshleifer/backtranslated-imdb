This is made for Hallmark's TV movie. Hallmark is always a family-oriented quality movie. While working together in the movie is just a sweet boy and fall in love. Two bakers of competition for a $ 250,000 prize against a field of professional bakers It's fun and light-hearted. Sweet look great During this competition, the film has a striking, encouraging little song. I guess it is made for movie songs by Roger Roller. No soundtrack available that is bad. I really want to get a copy of the song. I do not even know the name of the song, because the credits have ended for making hundreds of cinematic productions. However, Cast is great. It's always nice to see Brenda Vaccaro. He is very bubbly and enthusiastic. Lauren Holly is always a plus and Costas Mandylor rounds out good guys with a nice performance. Professional chef Wolfgang Puck has a guest appearance. Watching movies is valuable.
