I traveled with the friend in Blockbuster and decided on the other night that we were very broke and became very lazy and active. He wanted to see Closer that a distorted idea seems to be to hire another movie to go to bed. I was not very interested in looking around, but in the new release section I saw the dalm mast. Based on the cover sleeve (a woman like a doll crying blood tears) I thought it would be interesting enough to rent it. <br /> <br /> For the film, it was almost horrible to see it almost empty, with all the lights off. I have to admit that I have received a large fountain of dolls from childhood (and saw a terrible movie called Asylum, in which a mental patient was involved in a story in a story that killed the pupil, but it was scary, and this was the first three quarters Hit the spot for me. Especially the first half-hour was awesome. The strange foreboding environment really set the scene well, and the doll looked really threatening without moving. But unfortunately, as soon as they started to remove it, everyone got a little chessy, I was somewhat frustrated when the moments really became terrible because they laugh at me because of the way they were portrayed. <br /> <br /> For the characters, it's a horror film, you're not really expecting something memorable. I have seen that I think the name and face are better than most Asian horror films, which have evolved some hidden characters which I have not consciously observed. This film usually involves stereotype. Each of them has some character that separates them from others, shy and calm, Yeong-hah and his pupp from Damien, outgoing Bibo Sion-Yong. <br /> The plot itself was quite cool, though the end, which bought several loose streams of the plot, was somewhat confused and did not really do anything for me, though it was really a nice plot-twist that I will not be destroyed here. A bunch of basic plot kids are invited to be modeled as dolls by a famous repetition old doll maker, they will start to become strange houses (scary dolls, some decorated with something big) and our heroine starts exploring the halls of the house and Some start to happen with other residents. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would definitely recommend the film, because if you are surrounded by friends in some moments due to not meeting many people, you can laugh, but in the dark you see something like yourself, windows and doors are only slightly open, If a doll seems to meet you. This really guides you for most movies, which allows you to completely destroy wild conspiracy theories only afterwards. If you really go into it and ignore the impression in its place, then I can guarantee that you can check your bed before going to bed and even leave the lights. <br /> <br /> Or maybe it's my: As near, it was ok but I like this.
