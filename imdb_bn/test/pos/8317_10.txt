(R # 88) Very entertaining show with gorgeous, spectacular effects. There is no fan this prehistoric reverse to see this. CGI mixes very well with the environment and discovers that these giants are surprised by their daily business, just like the discovery channel. This event was a gifted genius and it came out of its followers "walking with animals" and "wild in the future" water. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This stuff is almost too awesome for television. How about releasing a theater? I want to see some of these dinosos in the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The dinosaur has not been cool.
