An American gi Great Film About In the last days of the war, who left the army to marry the German girl to save her life. He admits, but he really likes him because he does, or can he easily support him for food and through such access? Meanwhile, his brother and an elderly friend called America's anti-American terrorist group, Overevlevs, their purpose to run their operations (you can eat the same group in Lars von Trier's film Europa (Giantotrop). The 1980s television show The Duchess James Beast, famous for his role in Roscoo P. Coulter of Off Hashard, is as spectacular as America. Should he become a big movie star? At this age he reminded me of Warren Bitti, and the other main actor is good, as well, Fuller's side is quite good, using a lot of time again (although they are not nearly as complex as Park Park, but many It takes much longer than the long scenes with the dialogue). The only problem with the script, as I have seen This was the case with fuller movies, but it is not very bad, but it should be stretching large characters and parts of the script, muscles, Helga, wife, goes through a big change, but the screen is completely closed. Therefore, the mental center is the best shoulder squarely rest. In the film of Fuller, the sick soil should have been killed. I hope that does not sound too harsh! She just does not have anything around the film without lying on the bed. She has so few lines. But after filming, Fuller kept him up. I will integrate itself in David and Helga's relationship with his death. And the film ends very casually, and it lacks the payoff. These are not the biggest mistakes in the world (the way I've described them make a bigger noise than them). 9/10
