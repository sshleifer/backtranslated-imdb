The thing that makes "fire" different from its magical art catalog makes it more interesting, it is the touch of feminism and rebellion. I think the symbol of Indian women's protests against the Indian character played by Shabana Azmi. The movie scene and scene when Ragha walks through fire in his kitchen, Lord Rama's wife Sita, the wife of Hindu mythology, walks through the fire to prove his condescension, the same picture also shows in the same description. This movie can be a great inspiration for women, especially in the sub-continent who can search for their independence and keep control of their lives.
