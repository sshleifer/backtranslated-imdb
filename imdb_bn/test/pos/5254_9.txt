This movie was fun since the beginning. Everyone in the movie laughing loudly around the movie! The best characters are Alex Fisher (Jada Peckett), Eddie Cohen (Dere Messing, Will and Grace's daughter) and Tania Manicurist (Goddess Mazar). Their best lines, best attitude etc were. Jada Peckett was a really funny lesbian game, she really played it well and was very confident. The only bad thing about the movie is that the main two characters were not funny, but the movie focused around them ........ Above all, it's a great movie to see and see your girls (Yes guys, through and through a girl girl !). Enjoy !!!
