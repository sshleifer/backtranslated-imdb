The Assent (1977) <br /> <br /> Larisa Sheppitko is very less familiar. As a director, his brilliant career lasted only a single decade, suddenly ended by a tragic car accident. Despite his short career, he was able to make the best Soviet film of his time. His latest film, The Assent, is widely known as one of the best Soviet movies of the 1970s. Despite this, his work remains unclear in the current year, usually on rare and poor copies of the video. Now thanks to the criteria people have changed. They publish Shakesito's best work through two of their eclipse section - The Wings and the Best Theorem of The End of The Assent. <br /> <br /> Snowy is set in the darkest days of the Russian WWII on the dark side, both sides are running their way. Naze patrols, after their group's attack, land in search of food. They are basically just to go near a farm, but when they arrive they find it razed by the Germans. They simply do not want to handover, they continue to go deep into the enemy territory. Along the way, they will not only face enemy forces, but also face the plight of Russian plains, potential betrayal and the dire situation of their souls. <br /> <br /> The movie does not fall on plain plates or destinations. It's painful to address difficult questions with reasonable. It does not take an easy road or gives us comforting answers. The second half of the picture is filled with moral contradictions. Shepitko shows intimidation of war between our fellow Russians and internal conflict - who cooperated and who fought. Although he shows the associate as a clear heel, he sees why such strategies - have become to live. <br /> <br /> There are several religious references to leadership in this movie, especially the leadership of crucifixion. It is a spiritual journey, the heart of the two parties, the soul, and the mind and the people who they face. Shepitko and his painters captured the journey of beautiful black and white photography. Cameron-like camera comes in long shots like Andrei Tarkovsky, one of Russia's best filmmaker. Sheppitko, like others, was apparently influenced by Tarkovsky style, and took some of her laticky notes from Usent Evans Childhood. It's a stunning movie to watch, and excellent work to keep the occupier Russian's cold and terrific environment. <br /> <br /> Shepit's husband will pay tribute to his great film after one year. Elem Klimov created the best piece of his own war which I have ever seen - come and see. The stories and themes of that movie were clearly influenced by The Usent. Although the film is fairly fuzzy, it has attracted even more attention to a film in Shepitko. But she worked as Shepitko's bridge, and helped her to keep her work alive. <br /> <br /> Ascent is really a great movie, and should be considered as one of the best movies in the 70s. It is inspirational cinematography inspirational; Her mood is terribly pure; And his lessons are unforgettable. It's no definition of noise, nothing less than a masterpiece. It is unfortunate that Shapitko's career is as bad as it is to hit him.
