I saw this movie last night and it was decent. It has an estimate that you will tell the moment. Some of the scenes with special OPS forces were cool, and some location shots were very authentic. I will not keep this movie in my DVD collection but it is worthwhile to recommend it to rent. I think the movie sets in a different level than the other side of the same level. The action is good, acting is decent, women in my opinion are highly seductive and exotic, and the stories are quite interesting. Ten out of 7
