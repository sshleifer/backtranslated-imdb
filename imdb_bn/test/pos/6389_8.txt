Psychopath (1973) A trip to Memory Lane. I have seen this photo on black and white TVs many years ago. Show host of kids' show Rabib has been subjected to severe torture on his queue fans. Mr. Rabib (who always feels like the losing side), finally decided to go to the crack and hunting trip. See bad parents, Mr. Rabbe trembles! What is next is invaluable. However, trying to find out the film will be very annoying. <br /> <br /> It makes the movie notable that Joe "Maniac" Spinal has created a small preacher for the film. In his unfinished picture, he Rabbi, a TV. Shoes (who looks like a pudding like Edward James Olmos), who revenge his young fans for the abuse of children after his parents. Sadly, Mr. Can not find fund to complete the spinel project. The film is going to be titled Maniac II: "Mr. Robi". Rabbey or Robbie similarity is very close to comfort. A PG For the most violent. Movie <br /> <br /> Recommended.
