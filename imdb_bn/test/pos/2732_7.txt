Spirir Aayed <br /> <br /> 15 pounds Avenue: I take this picture of my submergence. <br /> <br /> Now, for the sake of taste as a limited audience like me, 15 film awards such as Park Avenue should be my sensitivity palatable To be With this thought, and a light sense of embarrassment I did not see the whole movie before, I saw this movie on Saturday. There are some similarities with other works such as the legendary Mulholland Drive (David Lyncht) that the film borrowed at least 3 concepts: - <br /> <br /> That (at least some) is true relative b) Shawana and Connom The first scene is in the car as an open credit roll, it is lazy like a car ride, which was operated in Belt and Rita Mulholland Drive. In both cases, the search object may be a place which is probably mythological and perhaps more open symbol in Aparna's film. C) The phenomenon that revolves around the crazy beggar again involves a left 'wonderful whole story behind the scandals' but some of the scary creatures are attached to a posture and that 'some' as well as every character of the character is seamlessly linked with other work of the lint (long hair alarms) , The beggar woman exhibits a tribute of 15 pounds and hence the context of the film and its message It seems to be incomplete <br /> <br /> Other movies where the 15 PAO lenders bloat up (especially the last scene is empty again) true versus Antonyoni's masterpiece poses the truth poses at the end). Of course, the angle of professor and schizophrenia also brought "a beautiful mind" to the mind. However, here the matter is of high physics and Shabana, who preached it, formally became the bright competition of the confusing errors of the character of Kanakona through those predictions. In an outstanding view of the film, some of these elements resemble each other and the scene disappears in the 'real' world of Shabana, where quantum physics and relative theory theory supports the perfection and structure of the universe, by the artificial means of 'My Belief' For all the differences, the sisters are the same. Both are unable to form long-lasting relationships- one out of choice and another out of nature. Therefore, the refusal of Jayadeep's love is not the inability of Shabana to relieve the pain of Mitha or to establish a special relationship with Kunal (Dharatman) or Sanjib (Kankaljit). But I got myself ahead. Visitors usually see this movie in two ways: - <br /> <br /> Hypothesis1: "It was along the Shabana". The viewer has a specific part of those who think. But the explanation is not too far, but it has also been transformed that it meant that she was dreaming many other characters (that is, those letters she portrays Mithai with her as visible) <br /> <br /> Hypothesis 2: "It was true And the last one metaphor ". This POV says that a summary of the film is summarized in a dialogue with the film, when in response to a statement by Joy (Rahul Bose), Siddhi is looking for something that he can never find, his wife Lakshmi (Shefali Shah) philosopher that we are all looking for that misleading ruthlessness , At the end of sunshine that looks like a mirror of happiness and pleasure <br /> <br /> There is something else we are wise Hypothesis 3: "Shawna and Connor are reflected in the same person" Hypothesis 4: "Shabanao is a symptom of fantasy" Hypothesis 5: "Old, Haggard Perhaps the real hero of crazy, alms women story "<br /> <br /> Are these hypotheses worth testing? Well, your guess is just like me <br /> <br /> "Why 15 Park Avenue?" About Park Avenue in New York, he thinks that, unlike the popular concept, I believe that the name has been derived from the name of the semi-popular Swan Soap brand. Remember, he has described Joe Joe's career as the "Prime Minister of Sikkai", which you can be known as a popular element used to make Shikuos. On 15th December the novel '15' used to be associated with Mithi Jayadeep and after his walk, he remains forever forever. The film has defective parts - the lack of a strong background score, which can actually enhance the details of such movies, some vicious conversation is unknown by distributing some strong dialogues. Outstanding performances (Shawana and Improvising IMO are fantastic), along with a few custom members, many members of this pair have been lost. The sudden insecurity of the husband of Shefali tea seems to be an indefinitely introduced level of intrigue. I got it 7/10 because it thought of me but not because I can easily understand the sources of inspiration and before I feel experienced (and fully enjoyed), I have already thought in the same lines. So, 15 PHP Experiences can be a specific degree of innovation. Where do I come from? I gave 9 .5 / 10 from '36 Chauvinie Lane '(though the rumors are still going on that Satyajit Ray is pointing to ghosts), 7.5 to' permit a day ', 7 to' Mr and Mrs. Aiyar 'and 5' parmos'. At the level of an existence, it failed to call on my interest, even saying 'truman show'.
