So I started TV today on Sunday, hoping to see shit and documentary and this great movie just started, I do not know what it was, but almost immediately attracted me. The movie was excellent. <br /> <br /> There were a few things that you did not understand for one reason, because the dead man is not talking about doing things to get you out of your bad situation, but Jimmy does not really do anything except the basic stuff, In other words, it was not his intention that he brought him out of his bad condition only luck, secondly I finally killed the gangsters. The thing to get, because the people of the moon steal the panda money partially behind it, and then kill another thief, so they steal their money twice and kill him. How is that good
