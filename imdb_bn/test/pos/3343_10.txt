I first saw this on the big screen with my girlfriend. It was a fun romp with some cool music. Kristine was playboy cover, and centerfold, I think. He has lots of really cute and perky and charm. The film wanted to see me more and so I keep an eye on it for other things. Steven Spielberg's "I Wanna Hold You Hand Hand" and Barbara Streisand's "The Main Event" and Bill Mure's "Metables" as well as many TV shows like Night Court and TV Films. Me and my friends really enjoy her. But Alice in Wonderland must play an important role in her role as well as concentration, probably the most beautiful, supernatural girl I've ever seen in movies.
