Siriusly, where is the Oscars nomination of Al Pasino? Have we allowed him in his career right now? Here the casino is extraordinary .. He gives a complex, heartfelt performance as Shylock, the Jewish money holder .. Completely beautiful scenes of Venice and a pitch to listen to the right .. Other actors do all the good work, but the real reason to see it is the passino .. I saw all of 2004's nominated Oscar's performance, and I must say that the passino was lost .. It is with the anti-constitutional game Udiora lack of publicity, not a big push with a maximum release date, or most likely, above all .. In my mind, the best performance of the year Jamie phakssera rayon, Don cyadala Hotel Rwanda, and the Venice of the marcente Al pyasino ..
