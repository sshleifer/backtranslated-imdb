This comic classic of Antique English school girls is one of the great Art House classics. Then invisible with the arrival of the art home video. And so did the audience for this movie. Damage is not the house of the house or this great film. The loss is for those who have a real opportunity to see the best composition of this memorable smile movie. But I'm converting, I'm not. Who will look at this flickr?
