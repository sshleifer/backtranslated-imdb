'Brother, Where Art Art' is a delightful writing of Hemer 'ODC', set in Mississippi in the 1930s and the brand of Coen's trademark, which broadens with fantastic curiosity. In this delightful movie, three helpless people have to flee to find wealth - and more than their courage. George Clooney is a tricky, stunning look as impressive, three tragic leaders; But the real-acting Kudo John Turturo and Tim Blake went to Nelson as his stupid but loving quart, dubbing after being baptized with full immersion in a river called 'Sogi Botom Boys' through the character of Clonier. Cut down a record under three homemade samples for cash cash, and unwittingly become overnight sensations with the real 'Rock Star' status. The film is well-suited to music with music and music. And here are some incredible achievements of making the film: The scene is a real dosage in KKK Rally, and similar to the scene, when Dorothy's friends rescued her from the wizard's castle of 'The Wizard of Oz', which is about cinematic theft. And how much theft! The climax of the movie is not the end, one of the most exciting sequences in the recent past to enter the film ('Magnolia' on the spectacular end, one of my favorite pictures). 'Oh brother' is definitely a visible, a perfect 10!
