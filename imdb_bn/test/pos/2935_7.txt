Being dabbled (as a model) in the modeling industry, I most likely watch this show with a slightly different view compared to that. Although I enter an antim, it can be a fun and entertaining event, since it continues in the season, it seems to have continued from any reality. <br /> <br /> This event seems to be almost pure promotion for the contestants. The winner of the ceremony (or fellow contestants) did not make a name for herself from the shoe of the shoe. Maybe it is true that you can not have too much difficulty in submitting to a company with a realistic probability of a high fashion model (if you can prevent the distance due to an agency open call, but can do this via email or snap mail) a company sign In, and start a modeling career. Yes, the process does not guarantee success, but apparently not the ATMO. And instead of signing in, a top or decent agency participant in a reality show (which guarantees only every competitor has a guarantee) offers to improve the modeling business. <br /> <br /> Still, the show can not hurt, it can be fun, and especially there is a kind of magic that works for teenage girls, I found it. However, I have to add, after watching several cycles, it has become for me, ATN can become a fatigue and dullness. And in addition to some unrealistic situations (insulting to each other compared to the last one), only the other annoyance, "Taira, Teera, Taira!" Tyra actually seems to want to guide these girls for success, but each model in Tyra's photo must be covered with temporary digs; "Tyra" experienced and included a story or scenario that overcame for virtually every panel and challenge? I do not think so. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, take a little tire and bring back a little more reality and there will be 10 star shows instead of ATM 7.
