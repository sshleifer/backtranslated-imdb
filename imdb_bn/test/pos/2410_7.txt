After the very frustrating part 3, I was very surprised if I should bother with the next Karate, but I could see why this musical would not continue, I still enjoyed the children from the second Karate in the second and third Karate. Movie Although there are some unreal moments and situations, it was very enjoyable and the story is an interesting and warm one. <br /> <br /> Hillary Swing, this girl has come too far? He played a rebel girl, who lost his parents in a car accident, and when Miyagi talked about "baby" sort of to him, he noticed that he had carpet skills. She gives more lessons if she becomes more serious in life. Now of course there is a boy who likes him and the original bulls that are similar to the first karate, but I would recommend it. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> 7/10
