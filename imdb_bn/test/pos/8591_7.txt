A superb, mind-boggling historical drama - Well played, written article, shot in the way that expresses the correct visible images of the Congo and with some moving moments, especially those who care about the history of African history and imperialism. However, a fair amount of content is lost in the translation, and because of the names, acronyms, and so forth announcements are difficult to follow. So I strongly recommend checking a neutral source like Wikipedia to get the basic ideas of the story described (and the next history) before enjoying the film. If you have a DVD version then there are some useful historical backgrounds. At the end of the film there is a point where the name of a character who speaks with American vocabulary is actually out of the box - a simple Google search "Lumbuna Film Sensor" or something similar (and possibly annoying) twist related to this important film production. If this film is mixed with a little external research, then it helps to make relevant the Central / East Africa and / or other dozens of films related to imperialism, such as. Hotel Rwanda, taking hands in the hands of Satan, adaptations of Conrad's heart's heart, and even "Ali" went to Muhammad Ali Kinsass.
