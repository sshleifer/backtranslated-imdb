All right, probably can not be compared to other popular cowboys / western movies. But that was because these movies did not have the meaning. Obviously, whenever you want to create such a story, African American Historians are focusing on (and not the servants, and 'Miamis' historians involved), Hollywood is not going to be very helpful. And they do not believe me. Producers and actors dedicate a lot of 'pocket' costs to create "pockets", so that the story can be called. I think it's just commendable. Posse can not be the Oscar material (and they do not like too much of the Black Media), but it's a start. It's entertaining, and it introduces black cowboy to us, one of our characters is unfamiliar.
