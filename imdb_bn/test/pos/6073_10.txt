Since 1996, I first saw this movie, I never felt my satisfaction at all, I think I want to see more till now, my God, I do not believe it was ten years ago, and I can believe that I almost remember every word of dialogue. I love this movie and I love this novel, absolutely perfection. I love Willow Defo, he has a weird voice to make the word "black night" and I always say it, never bother. I love the music of Szarmeem, it is much more spiritual, it has made me deep into my heart deeper. Can anyone feel and someone else can make such a movie? I do not believe so Thanks, thanks to Onnaj, Mingla
