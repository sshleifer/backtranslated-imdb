Clearly, the infamous "Mandingo" has been made cheap to capitalize, this terribly disguised Italian junk junk, this terrible panking of Hong Kong has truly entered into the abusive material with a commendable lack of taste and moderation: The arrogant white families who own and own slave-owned slaves, each other and Skull attracted both of their slaves to the Hankee Panee Rina spends most of the time. Director Mario Penzotti and screenwriter Tikla Romanelli have embroiled the brittle flavor with the stream of snow: We have received rude rape, a white kidnapper (a white lady loves to live in a muscular black stud attached to a cross with a cruise), hypocritical female atrocities, brutal Hippings , Brutal despair, lots of soft-core sexuality, and a deadly fatal tragedy Fascinating incidents that blame elements of persecution, murder, and damage to suspected attempt of slavery in a horrendous statement of slavery. The fountain Brunette Paola D'Aigidio has special characters, whose radioactive and inexhaustible screenplay, the picture of the abducted and unexpected evil scavengers, is positively burning on the screen. Moreover, Marcelo Geomini's horrible, sharp tribal score hits Groove Spot. The moderately polished cinematography of Marizo Centini runs the same technique. Thin swill is a satisfying seamy fragment.
