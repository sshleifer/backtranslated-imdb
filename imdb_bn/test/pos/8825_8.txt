Seeing this PPV, I had high expectations, because SmackDown is the best show in WWW, this is a very good PPV because it ended before WrestleMania. <br /> <br /> First match-Hardy Boyce and character Benoit VS MVP and MNMW / Mailing are the best ways to start matches in the 6th Men TAG Team Match. At the beginning it started at a slow pace, but the speed quickly reached and the match became more exciting and entertaining. Joey Mercury makes Benoyett rolls and hardy boys and separates themselves from Joyi Mercury for winning for themselves. 6/10 <br /> <br /> Gregory Helms in the second match {champion} VS Shannon More VS FUNKY VS. CHAVO GUERRERO VS. Daiwari VS. Scottie Hathie VS. Jem Nobel VS In an open cruiser Wavight International match for the WWE CRUISERWEIGHT Championship, Jimmy Wang Yang is a very big fan of Cruiserwats, and I will not be disappointed to see them, especially in this match here. Chavo Gerero nailed Frog Splash to win hostage Wang Yang and become the new WWE Cruiserweight champion. 5/10 <br /> <br /> The third match finals and a small bastard VS. It was not a wrestling match, it was a comedy match, although it was not a clean wrestling competition, it still entertained me with funny antics. Finlay win with nails with Little Boogeyman Shillegh Boogeyman does not deserve to be a PPV, and does not deserve to be WWE. 4/10 <br /> <br /> In the fourth match - VS at the ear. King Booker W / Shermeel This was a wonderful match, I thought it was a mediator, but it became a real competition competition competition. Both men strike off, pull a very entertaining match. King Booker won after the Chocasalam! 6/10 <br /> <br /> Fifth Match - Paul London and Brian Kendreck [Champions] VS. The charity is not really a good match for the DUES and DominionW / WWE TAG Team Championships, Duos and Dominino need more training in the competition, and London and the center keep the match fast. London and Kendreck hold their titles, got one roll-up after another for the Kendrick Win. 4/10 <br /> <br /> Six matches - Bobby Lashley {Champion} VS. Mr. Kennedy Mr. for the ECW championship Kennedy attacks Lashley back from the match before starting. It was a good match, but not really good. Lashley and Kennedy have a bit of chemistry, but not enough to pull a great match. Kennedy won by a decourer, Lashley rejected him with a chair, then attacked him with a chair all over the entrance. Lashley still maintains his title. 4/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> In the seventh match - John Sena and Shawn Michaels Vies It's probably the greatest tag team match ever seen in Batista and Undercover that I've ever seen. To stop closing the 5th star's main event, all these men {{Batista}} shut down. These 4 men played very well in this match, because it was a great and entertaining tag team match. Batista returned to Undertaker's back spine, then left the ring, which urges Mitchell to add liquor to sweet Chinese song, then the army nails an F-U for a tough fight. 7/10 <br /> <br /> I do not know why everyone says that this PPV is not good enough, or it's annoying, I did not get it. This is a great PPV that always smackdowns deliver. A great PPV really does <br /> <br /> Overall I have to give it 8/10 and a B +
