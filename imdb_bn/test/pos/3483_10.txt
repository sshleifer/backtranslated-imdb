Michael has a serial policy (played by Steven Robertson), and Carrigmore resident house lives in a quiet, and dull life. When a new person, Rory (MacAye), makes friends with her at home, she showed Michael how helplessness is going on. Despite Rory's helpless disability (unable to move a few numbers on her head and her hand), or perhaps, Rory is extremely independent and highly rebellious. His influence on calm and reserve Michael is spectacular, and soon he leaves the care home to live in two worlds, where he recruits Siyoban (Romola Garai) as a care assistant. <br /> <br /> This photo is one of the gems of the year! Like last year's American, the film is very fun, painful, sensitive, annoying, and true confectionery is not going to sweet. To know where the heartwarming will be dragged and where to tell stories and characters only, O'Donnell has created a great movie that tells us to show patronage and to see what's in it. <BR> <br /> The real power of the film comes to the main actors. So their characters are believable that you truly believe that they are unable. It is also amazing to manage to reveal humor and sorrow over the already great performances. This couple looks really close friends, and by publishing their story, you take full care of them. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best movies of this year, which is simply telling a very relevant story. If this image fails to touch your heart, you must have pure ice inside.
