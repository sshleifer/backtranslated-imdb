Exciting story, wonderful performance, amazing production value and a cool, short-action-pack with a perfect twist at the end. What a great small film! <br /> <br /> I saw this film in a movie festival of Vele or Aspen and was forgotten by it. Then I again saw another festival (where it was won again) and I was more impressed because the delicate touch became more frequent - for a small film, it packs many clever levels in a short time. <Br /> <br /> AWOL is not for the heart's dissatisfaction, but it is very good and absolutely impressive for a very small film - for a movie. It's an interesting story very well, and every scene inspires the story, which reveals the trend of making good films for making this film. The film looks gorgeous and David Morse is also stunning with a dynamic performance of each scene delivery. His attempts to defeat Harvabal's life in his career gave him a great viewing experience. It should also be noted that when the daily titles of war are oppressed, the reality, good and evil, can get very gray when the rhetoric gets superior and the effort to make things black and white. AWL lets smartphones make the audience decide for themselves what they think, what is real and what does not, that adds to the mystery. <br /> <br /> I've seen it both times, the audience is playing even more in this movie, much to say. There are now many shorts, but some are unavailable and complex issues that AWOL provides. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the previous critic is like a rocker, or some personal agenda, because it is a great example of actually making a short film independent. I can see many small films, and I must say that only festival shades were good, but there were some serious footprints in the shorts business.
