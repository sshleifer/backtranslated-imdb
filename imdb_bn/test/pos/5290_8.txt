I am reading different opinions and reviews of this movie, and I understand why so many people got mixed feelings about Ponyo, whether it is story lines, animations, conversations etc. And I believe that its the easiest way I can answer this is a movie that is very young, A pair of bracelets younger than the Tonerino Tatoro (my Nebbec Tatoro) <br /> <br /> Most of the surgeries of this site are like Miyazaki fan, I hope the wonderful animations, compositions of music, and not complicated stories. , The stunning development of characters, how the story is related to today's society, etc., is an ideal Miyazaki film that we grew up. And to tell the truth, I did not understand what the story should have been supposed to be supposed to be and should not last for an hour or twenty minutes (twenty minutes left in the film), this film is for deep thinkers and hard-core Ghibli-ists, but kids And do not go for young people and happy lucky Japanese people. Also, I believe this movie is based on simplicity and creative animation; Straight up grass grass Ghibli studio style. <br /> <br /> The villain who was not presently surprised me, except for his father, probably the crazy ass typhoon. But more than that, this movie is simply fun! To stimulate a young person's mind, and to feel happy time. Here's the end. <br /> <br /> Animation Miyazaki returned to school in mid-80s by the mid-90s, where Moninoc Him (Princess Manooke) and there was not much specific detail in contrast to Manjakki's films. When I watched gorgeous movies like Tonerino Tatoro in my childhood, I appreciate the simplicity of making a little nostalgia. Children's reactions and movements are all like kids, and many physical language of studio gossip is very attentive. The studio has added some creative moments and graduates that they can only work with their wonderful animations, but perhaps it will not take gibli-festivals with fear. <br /> <br /> Japanese dialogue is very child-friendly and most scenes and dialogues are very relative to telling and working for Japanese kids and mothers. Music is very hopeless and "fluffy" I can assume that you can start (similar to Totoro) from start to finish. Even dark scenes do not seem to be strong. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie is a kind of. Every aspect of this movie is only for the children. And I realized that the whole 80 minutes are waiting. Quite obviously, I did not see any movie or it was not shown like Miyazaki. The studio Ghobi is still widespread, and refreshing the story of a variety of listeners can tell a story, and the trademark is still a ghostly impression.
