I mostly like this movie, but do not say that it was not good as the role of someone other than Bill Murray. He has come up with a power in this role that if the film is not otherwise, it shows a groove. I've enjoyed a freak freely dragging a counselor and the other hilarious things in this movie, such as the Hot Dog Eating Contest. At the end of the film, the platform will set up the stage for summer camp films with the competition. Almost every camp movie has this or the idea of ​​unwanted or problematic kids, or both. This series will spontaneously transform itself because both single and two families are both friendly films and more than third and fourth adults, like the old teen sex comedy of that time. This is the opposite of police academy film that went from P to PG to PG-13. This series goes back to the opposite. This is the first and only good bill to bury due to the price of some chuckles.
