Hi, look around IMDB to see the whole plot around "Oz" to see it here. <br /> <br /> ** Warning to the spinners in this review! ** Oz is a series that has not only been transferred to me but also shows a small bit. American prison system, but I have to say (judging the discovery channel program on the prison) it is not actually realistic. <br /> <br /> While I can say, no shame, no rape, no fear is allocated. Yet it's television, so find out there for you think it's a real mistake. There is a lot of violence in it and some of the extra scenes here and there (plot on the plot on the plot) can get quite annoying. But remember the series is now almost ancient. So it changes with time, I believe that it should be judged in time. <br /> <br /> There were 5 beautiful menstrual periods to be prolonged! Wins a $ 2 million lottery ticket at one price, because he talked to God, it hit me "OK, right now I'm going to see this series again" I'm still going forward! And now I only saw 3 episodes in the 6th episode. This serial jams his brain and then holds it after his "mother", when he drowns. Then you see O Reilly crying and saw his broke as well (with RL brothers as well) so far the best view of the entire "Ozzy" series came to me! Still do not fall into this mistake that I'm wrong and trying to burn it. This is a really good series! And even 2010 a clock price is good! I think it is a season 7 that is weak with that season. But still a golden glove.
