A stunning and thoughtful observation of modern life for young people in Japan, like sand cropping, rape, homosexuality and lung problems solve problems in a subtle and significant way. It gives an insight into youth culture that struggles to define itself beyond the bounds of their parents, it is a rough analogy and face-to-face. Ideal for the Japanese film, often what is said is not important, so be more cautious about those who are not aware of Japanese film and culture. If you do not want to see it, it can be considered dull and straightforward (pretty much like every movie coming from Japan Bar mangas). I saw it for the first time at the age of 15 and basically my interest in Japan has arisen, it's culture and language. I am now 22 years old and teaching Japan with the intention of living for two years, it is not saying that it is a powerful film. Enjoy!
