A good thing: A crime drama is incredibly entertaining from the start of these hidden treasures. The best example of this, the author / director, skip woods, can use all of the things that he can find for example (eg tall longs, super models, cows phones) and an add-on and all his camera set for the conversation to add amazement to the plot -Up. Another good thing: this movie seems to have been made for the DVD era, which is included in most categories (works like Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's Disparo). Each of the film's "chapters" Thomas Zen's main character is growing in a day, with fast and memorable performance with the unforgettable role of the house, Haroon Eckhardt, Glen Plummer, Mickey Rourke, Michael Jeter, James Legoros and Pauline Poriczkova. <br /> Another good thing: Not just a "good" thing, but incredibly frustrating and memorable ... This movie remembers an important scene. Delivery will always be remembered for the horrific rape of Anand Bitti, Thursday will go down as a movie where a woman is forcibly raped with an unwitting person. Unforgettable. One bad thing: People think that it is related to ice cream-related "Friday" series (or derivative) related. <br /> <br /> Grade: The first row
