Thanks to a group of artists thanks to gratitude, this story of a 28-year struggle for death will free him from his dead body, it will be a wonderful work to remember. Directed, written, edited and scored by Allenandro Amenabar, it touches you from the first pictures and does not give rest to your eyes and your heart until the last eyes, thanks to Alangandro and a team of wonderful actors and actors. Bardem is a performer: one of the few comrades who can often perform best from any character, acting actress is great in their role and the story is sensitized to say that in one minute laughs and crys, as we used to do with great old masterpieces. The best film of the year in all senses. 10/10
