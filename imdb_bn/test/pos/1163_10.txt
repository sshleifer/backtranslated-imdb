When I reviewed the local newspaper's video, I called it "the greatest achievement in American film history". That cheek was not completely tongue. TL & TL continues the best work of Millionaire, and it is sad that he no longer has a chance to work. However, T & TL was once known as the American character, which is a brilliant illustration by Brian Keith's Teddy. (Clearly Milys and Keith - TR was praised for making two films about him), including "The Rough riders".) This film is hard to blame at any level: great balance of action, encouragement, relationship, and serious issues in America. Moreover, there are exceptional appeals to the TL & TL on board: 18-Male, 18 to 18 and over 45-year-old age statistic shows the statistics! Clearly hit a reactionary rope with Candy Barzene women and men.
