I was surprised and touched by this emotional movie, which made me very weird. I am confused, sad and happy at the same moment. I guess very few people will pay attention to this movie. But I hope at least some people will be able to see it and get something out of it. The story of two friends suffering from physical obstruction, who (as a team) beat the system of medical facilities and fight for their rights. This movie shows an aspect that some of us can not understand, too exaggerated but not presented emotionally. I hope this movie will help us understand some of the things better and understand how important a friend of the world is, especially when you are unable to reveal this fact almost.
