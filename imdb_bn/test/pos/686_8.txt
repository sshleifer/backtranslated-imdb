This one is a sunny diamond in rough. Acting and plot that is not impressive, but the lines just keep coming. It mostly captures the flake because it seems at first glance, good movie, bad movie, but it is so stupid that you can not help but be amazed. Spotlight Lighting Fast Dialogs and Playful Characters It continues ... I was particularly loved on Sharon, Shrooms eh Canuck? However, Richard's younger brother Andrew (Ira Hayden), who truly stole Shoke, was shocked at his high screams. Hold the whole movie.
