I would assume that this movie will be reviewed in Canada especially in Quebec. Because Canadians traditionally prefer hockey, and for decades Canadian Montreal Canadians were like Gods. As the American, the closest thing to them is New York Yankees. If you are a fan, then the greatest and winning team in history. If you are not a fan, then they are Satan's party! Well, it was like growing up in DC Dallas Cowboys in Washington DC. So I'm sure that when this movie is shown, the answer is sure everyone was immediately a strong emotional reaction - the closest things to their national team in NHL and their national sport. <br /> <br /> Now the cartoon is striking while it starts and the main character is growing around Autaug and encouraging the Canadians and talking to Maurice "Rocket" Richard. However, when his mother accidentally bought the Jersey Maple Leaf Jersey and forced him to wear, I wanted to know what a terrible and shameful thing for this little boy! This ability to connect with the character - although he lives in a distance, but produces a very special little film. Other kids recognized him and ultimately his conversation with God made such a nice nostalgic film. Very cute and memorable.
