The number of songs and dances, in general, as soon as they are not as strong, the storyline of the film and the message are still there, and the sound of the 70-style musical numbers louder aloud <br /> <br /> Remember that this film was created after the death of Hollywood musical (which was no exception to rock musical instruments), the viewers did not realize that it was not date to date A bold effort. The viewers who see it today will judge today's movies and songs and, perhaps, judge the great stars of past past songs. But in this movie or in any other case, it's injustice in the film. <br /> <br /> There are some good musical moments in the film. That's the first Bobby van Van Warri took the role of Harry Lavett after the 2 year Tony Nominated (Best Actor) for Broadway to revive, "No, no, nanette." She is from the way and a dancer and, in fact, one of the only cast who was talented and experienced for musical instruments. He did not miss a step in his "question me an answer" and just so ... he was completely at home as Harry. While Olivia Hasee welcomes other new visitors and the songs are poor, the other happy numbers are done, while James Chegata shows her strong voice in the "family" song as well as the beautifully staged piece of the whole piece. <br /> <br /> See this movie for what it is ... an imagination where you will never grow old, hide in ice and snow snow in the snow, which is found by a group of uneducated modern people, a modern culture conflict. Take it and compare it to reality and you get a movie that falls short of a target. But ... Accept this picture for love and peace, peace and brotherhood and you will receive a warm and tidy message and a positive message. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The reality of others is to release a welcome from real speed. First, try not to judge and just enjoy the message. On the other hand, you've discovered Shangri-La secret!
