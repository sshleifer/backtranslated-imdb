Eros and Thanatos, love and death indicate dialectics of life. In the late 19th century a young man and married woman in a remote Japanese village, older than them, love each other and agreed to kill her husband to enjoy her love. But they do not enjoy that freedom, because at that time, the weakest member of the couple, of course, women, in their minds, began to begin their normal routine. Then, in an atmosphere where dreams (nightmares) meet reality, the murderer's husband comes to the first woman of ghosts, but then to humans. It has also threatened the dreams of other villagers, creating suspicious and silent climate around the couple, which grew by the arrival of a husband's officer, who came to investigate the disappearance of the murderous husband. But without this almost common story of adultery, the film made it more interesting, the evolution, pain and fear of Shakespeare's deep psychological and dramatic development couples make their relationship of love into nightmares till their ultimate destruction. The Japanese theater or movie starring so much that the expressionists are also present in the performance of the players, but not too much. Show only the deepest impression of the letters effectively shaped more effectively in the necessary measurements. It's actually a tough good movie.
