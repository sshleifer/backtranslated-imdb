I agree with Gary Johal completely from comments on this picture of Singapore. Quote: 'Yes, I do not see a big deal about this picture of Singapore. Some references to this movie fly directly from the head of foreign viewers and most Singaporeans really can get it. It's still not true and as a Malaysian-Chinese, I can get it, though I can not say hockey because we also have similar problems in Malaysia. I know that it is really hard to understand and accept it as true but it is certainly not a real story. I am happy to see this movie in Malaysia because it must be banned in Malaysia and banned. Which means you can get 'illegal copy' or 'VCD or DVD' or hope someone can be 'kind to share' on the Internet. This is not a 'violent teenage drama .......' because it portrays the reality in Singapore (and Malaysia) (Interesting + humor). I was sad to know that I got more than 20 mobile phones in this censorship. What a waste!
