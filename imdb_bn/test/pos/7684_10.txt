When will ART overcome racism? I believe the American people grew up after the film was created. Porgy cast a star and made music. This motion picture is a great adaptation to a great opera. For example, Miss Saigon is based on Madame Butterfly, based on Les Mies a classic book. Recently, an opera was launched in Los Angeles based on the movie The Floy. At the opera !! So be it !! <br /> <br /> Disney is not hesitant about releasing the southern song. The NAACP has not released any competition for racial problems, and do not forget to miss a huge hit by a 50s as a TV series. The United Nations should embrace our UN heritage, and all our ethnic artistic diversity. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
