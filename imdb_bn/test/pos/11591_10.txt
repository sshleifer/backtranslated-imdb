I had my special opportunity to see Mar Adentro on Friday, and I still lost the reason for the court, a legal euthanasia well-known for Spain, and finally the poison with its beauty, every single actor and actress's powerful work and the incredible ability to describe the story of Amnabar Roman Samadoro A glass of glasses died in front of a camera, never immobilized forever due to an accident, its strong With it all clams in our hearts. <br /> <br /> I have already been softened by the strong symbolism of his title before watching this movie, which I will translate as "in the sea" and will not recommend anything "out of the sea" and from which it is taken from Human poetry is an original poem. Then I saw the movie. Oh my friend This is a movie with Capital C. The description flows to take you into the heart of every single character: Sameddro, which you forgot from the beginning, is resurrected in a Bermend, it is a humorous hope at the center, and its hope is to die, because for him, he is not worthy of living. The remaining characters, but dancing around them and honoring his decision because they think of him as a free man (he forgets for all things, depending on others), even though they love him so much. And what about this movie: Love. You can feel it, you can breathe it on every character's skin. Witnessing the feeling of feeling among three women who met her in the film: Jenny, her right to die with dignity, her friend, her story in the film, lucky hope for us can lead a normal life in this world; Rosa joins a good man in the middle of the relationship between the woman who despises her and despises her, breaking her hand; Julia, who shares a tragic fate with Ramon, and finally we do not realize that we just do not understand. However, before meeting these women, Raman knew the love of love, because you can not meet him after love, and he is deeply in love with his cruel family: four letters are unique among their humility and bravery, Each of their own decisions about their decision, everyone is respected in their own way, because the terrible thing about this story is that Is not responsible for what happened. That, sadly, life is sometimes that terrible. From this familiar quadrennial I especially like the work of Momle Rivera as Ramon's sister, Manuela: as a great performance. <br /> <br /> I want to draw attention to the three episodes that are the best measurement points for me for a long time, and if you have not seen the movie, do not read it, cross this paragraph and start "MARD Adentro" Read again from the beginning, let the movie show your confidentiality. The episodes I liked were: 3. I saw in the movie that the good love scene, when I really feel the love of the attack on the screen, Raman dreamed that he was flying to meet Julia and he kissed each other. 2. Before talking to James Ramon, he was going to do it, and he told him that he would not be able to say goodbye at the moment, do not hurt him with the authorities. And then he knows that the last time they are going to talk, and he has fought for his right to die ... but he is not going to lose him, because he loves him as a real friend, and even though he owes all his expenses to his decision. 1. Best. A young ramoon on the beach saw his girlfriend under the sun, jumped from the stone to the water, which was retreating. We saw the crash, we heard his voice what happened and claimed that he died soon. Beharm face, bottom face, shown below from us. And a friend who pulls him from the forehead and brings him a life back that will be a hell for him for the next 30 years. In Spanish we knew very well that despite the fact that what Ramon did he has many interesting endings. <br /> <br /> Mark Martyn did not cheat me, Amenab never did, but this time to thank the participants for this project, and who has taken it personally, because it is not just a movie, it is absolutely for a person Is responsible, when he died alone when asking for "legal" death, which means that for him, Bardem mentioned that he was a person He loved, and who loved to die with them.
