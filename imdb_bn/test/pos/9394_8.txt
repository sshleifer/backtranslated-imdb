Hmmmm. I kinda at a loss here I mean, I know I like the death bed, I know that on the bed of death I will spread to all my friends and acquaintances, and if you read this, I want to see you bed of death, but I can not really say why. Perhaps it secreted her kisses. <br /> <br /> Plot? Good kind This bird can feed humans (and fried chickens, apples, flowers, suitcases, and any dust items near it). In close proximity to her, the ability to maintain the spirit of Aubar Beardie stuck behind the photo to monitor and describe the incident of BID's picture. Then many people roam in the abandoned palace of the bed (the habit of eating something in the bed that makes the place unreasonable reputation), and can bring sex, or sleep, or they do not feel good and can not eat, sometimes trippy dreams are the first. And in the end our Beardsley, the bed of the bed (you were there), and have explosive final clashes in the bed. <br /> <br /> It seems to be easier, when I put it that it is, it does not - well, except for part of the Beardsley part. But it seems to be a bit of a continuous off-killer, and the story comes from sleeping from one scene to another, but it is related to visible smiles or strange effects. Imagine, Bunell crossed with Bergman, then Herschel Gordon drowned in a large variant of Lewis. The story is horrifying, from fairy tales, to a comedy, to unimaginable meditation, without a breakdown - a budget student in the Detroit area is incredible achievement for the film. <br /> <br /> All, a wonderful little film, perhaps, no review can ever fully judge. See it for yourself.
