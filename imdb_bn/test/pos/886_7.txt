After watching this film's preview in my local mall there is a stand for buying foreign movies, I thought it was very entertaining. Before watching the movie I went to IMDB to see if there were any ratings and comments. I was worried when I noticed lower numbers and negative ratings. Despite the publicity, I have seen it in the film and with my surprise I find it incredible. <br /> <br /> The story was great (just pay attention) and the characters in the film and their relationship are wonderful. I have not seen such a good combination of leading characters in long time. I really felt for both characters and felt a strong bond. I can not even further disagree with the previous posts of this movie "epic" or lack of enough or martial arts. This movie is not what it is not a Braveheart and it has not entered the dragon, but it is still a wonderful movie that both the story and the coordinator of the work do excellent work. <br /> <br /> The moon's sword is perfect (what movie?) it's still wonderful and moving. Wait till the last scene, together with music and movies, its exciting. I just hope more people see this movie to vote for fair.
