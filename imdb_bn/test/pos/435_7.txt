It was a beautiful musical instrument about the construction of the Moulin Rouge dance hall. In many ways, this reminds me of the Hollywood music songs of the 40s and 50s, with so many clich√©s to the inevitable conclusion ("this show will still be?"). Of course this new someone is new, it is usable and well made. The end musical numbers are frenetic and look nice. In many ways it reminds me of a sexual version of Great Jiggle. In real life, Jizzfeld was a good player, but it was sanitized in American films. But, in French cancers, the characters are fully working in Libidos - but nothing is shown, so the film is okay for the kids. <br /> <br /> Although nothing new but good.
