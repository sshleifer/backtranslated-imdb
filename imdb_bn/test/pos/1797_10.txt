Remember to remember this movie when I got released and I still remember 'buzz' when I left the movie. Everything great about this movie! The song is the best and I still play soundtrack after all these years. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie many times and are seen repeatedly to see it again and again. Nicholas Cage was great and whenever I saw Cameron Dye, I always associated him with this movie. It is very bad that the rest did not go further, but perhaps it is part of the attraction of this movie. <br /> <br /> I will not criticize film school because I'm sure they wanted analysts to make a mistake, but what I would say is that this movie has defined my teen years and has still influenced my life for more than 20 years. The movie 'mix' is great and when you see it (then ... it has done for me) and I can not recommend enough to look after it. <br /> <br /> You do not have to 'get' or you film! Those who 'get it' will be rewarded with a unique film experience.
