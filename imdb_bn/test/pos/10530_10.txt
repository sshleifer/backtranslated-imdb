Bright work Wonderful actors dissolve as brave and brave characters. An unforgettable part of the curiosity and capturing action ?? Thriller Welding is perfect. Both of the stars are: Armond Assange, Bernerhart, Kier, Denis. But for the new look I also congratulate the gang member of the young actress Moustafa. You believe each one from the Turkish gang. Michael Barrall and all the white power followers are very confident. I appreciate the beat of the main theme of "children of wax". This soundtrack is a compelling mix of Turkish, Hard Rock and Udo Ki Hamming ?? And at the same time wax children "is a story focusing on ethnic conflicts. Intolerance and cruelty among skin and turkeys.
