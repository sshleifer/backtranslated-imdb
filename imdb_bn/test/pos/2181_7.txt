Awesome acting to make this cheapo rebuild of the horror five star finals. Humphrey Bogart frustrated stars as a Sledge Radio station manager who boosts sagging rating. The owner decides to take a consistent decision of morality plays in a famous murder case 20 years ago. So they rented the banned preacher (Harry Hyden) for hijacking, who was separated and lived peacefully under a fake name. The preacher arrives on the wedding day of the girl, but the ruthless radio station reveals her mother and refuses to destroy her life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hey, Everyone else is just awful Helen McClair does not have any sympathy (important for the role), Linda Perry is an extraordinary actress, Beverly Roberts is okay, but always old, Claire Dood and Habart Kavanagh have no part, Karleille Moore is notorious as a boy, son of Virginia Brissak society. Robert Middleham works as the owner of the station. <br /> <br /> It comes within an hour but Edward G. Robinson, Alain McMahon, Dr. Francis Starr, and Boris Karloff. But it's always worth watching Boagrt
