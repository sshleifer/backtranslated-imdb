This movie should be exported to the rest of the world! A perfect masterpiece with both odd and deadly films about four different stories of four different locations in Sweden. The old finance minister's unfinished timber image with one of the new newly built hotels, four extraordinary stories about love or careers. I want to see four as a movie around them, they can grow so much. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br DVD Apparently they had just cut a lot of 3,5 hours to fit it.
