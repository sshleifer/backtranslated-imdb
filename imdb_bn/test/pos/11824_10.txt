This beautiful composition has not been well recognized for unknown reasons, and it has been widely acclaimed by many American film critics. So it is easy to understand that I have tried many problems by trying to find this movie. Finally I saw it and it was so beautiful, hearty and shocking that for the first time in my life, I saw a movie five times a week to get the tape. This story focuses on friendship between two young people Eric and Dester, 11 and twelve, who are different from each other but they are becoming the best (and only) friends. The beauty and sincerity of their friendships have been shown to cure and naturally cure as never before. Many beautiful, heartfelt and disgusting scenes (especially on the river), which hurt the heart and can not leave any person indifferent to them. The film is incredibly strong and full of mental emotions, (especially strong with Eric shoes), which increases the visual impression from such a beautiful work. The story written by Robert Kuhn is well-written and in most cases in modern Hollywood, apparently every scene in every scene, every phrase and every sentence, meaningful and brings something important about the characters and relationships between them. Peter Horton, who I knew earlier, had no great experience in film management, he showed his great talent and talent in this field. The cinematography is also fantastic with the chosen location for the film, but the most important is the perfect performance, which is one of the best films of all the above mentioned topics. Both Brad and Renfro, as both Adam and Joseph Majello, have created a wonderful atmosphere in the two main characters, sincere friendship and great chemistry like Dexter. Only this movie (I have not seen most of them work) is enough to give their name as the best actor of their generation. Anbal Cheers as a mother of the dancer also gave a terrific performance. It is unfortunate that such talented actors have not been widely recognized, although many enjoy great popularity and huge salary. Eventually, David Grossin's amazing soundtrack is notable, and Great Great Apex without mentioning Mark No's song (any movie I've ever heard of). So all I can say about cure is a simple word ?? Great To any scene, this film is a beautiful, heartfelt and inspirational work for everyone involved in creating this masterpiece. I have to credit their hearts and souls all in the movie and the universal film, which has found a way to create a beautiful movie among many formative commercial projects. But this type of movie rarely comes to the movie theater which often studios themselves do not realize that they have created a jewel that they can not supply their marketing campaigns. The only small loss of cure for me is its short length (only 97 minutes). I do not want to write anything more about the movie because it is impossible to make words of beauty and sincerity, so if you have a chance to look for healing, rent it or buy it and you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 sorry for my bad english
