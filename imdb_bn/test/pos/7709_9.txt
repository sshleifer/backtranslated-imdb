Meet the film silent anime ... brilliant! This is one of the highlight of the amazing creative animatrix shorts. If it was not my favorite then it was my favorite (I also liked world record). It originally included animated and matrix including a 40 second classic movie silent detective story and a reference to the movies. But by animated, it is capable of taking a full-blown camera angle, detective life style, shadow and a whole new level of film-making. Femme Fatale? Trinity. In this story, the detective seems to be living within 40 seconds of his mind, but the modern world has been stuck, and suddenly his imagination happened when he was suddenly involved in science fiction and agents when a mysterious woman in black went to his office. <Br /> <br /> My grade: 9/10
