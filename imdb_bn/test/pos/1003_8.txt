So Keira Knightley ... So automatically we attentement to compare this film. Along with this Rome is also a painting during the war and its appearance is uncomfortable, these films are quite different. <br /> <br /> Actors do well, it seems there is no good thing, no memorable person, they <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want a movie that does something like , But ID is advising others that the story of this picture is harmful to people and their physical mentality has been affected by their experiences and how their life is disintegrated. <br /> <br /> There is real interaction with this film, the perfect break moment that keeps you in your breath. Not it is not exciting, but you can empathize with these characters, however it is gripping. At the moment, I am surprised that this movie can be as good as theatrical drama rather than the movie. We hope a lot from the movie as much as possible, and yet we believe in the interaction with the theater and rely on faith. <br /> <br /> If you look for a blockbuster then there is some error. And the movie allows you to take it, remove you, allow yourself to forget these stars, and do not allow them to judge them as actors, but let them be human, you really will move yourself. Go <br /> <br />! ! Give it a go!
