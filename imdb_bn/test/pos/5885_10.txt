The film features another extraordinary collaboration between William Wyler and cinematographer Greg Tullen, the first to do after purchasing the Tallinn citizen. But the talent of both of these men focused on achieving a perfectly created movie, a good story is understood as well as in the old American sense. The technical aspects of the film are covered so that the viewer is absorbed in the work done on the screen without depositing the energy of the image. Tactue is seen as a vehicle of representation, unlike Citizen's purchase where the 'Barco Style' story of Wales attracted attention from the story of how it was said. One of my favorite favorites with a deep focus on this picture is the hometown Homer and the returning home of Ala. If Homer's daughter comes to her completely at Wilma Focus, Al Focus also takes her wife. It's a brilliant step because it is only through the nature of this picture that we see that throughout the film we will see: Willma loves Homer and she also accepts him, Ali's wife loves him, but she feels completely unworthy to welcome him completely. Later on in the film we see that their marriage was not always a rose bed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He wanted to show his listeners how hard it was for American soldiers to cope with a society to come back from the war, which they did not understand or insulted them. Through perfect casting and great conversations, Gold Win and Wyler have created a movie that will be templates for returning to any other country. Three hours that match "rough cut" because the testers did not feel for a moment that the action is going on slowly, and in reality, every scene in the film seems completely justified. The whole thing is made nicely, each character gets enough exposure, there is no scope for opportunity, and it is frustrating that Hollywood does not presently bring contradiction between characters on the screen. TBVaille explores the depth of family society in America, the amount of American family and society that other movies consider "children's hours".
