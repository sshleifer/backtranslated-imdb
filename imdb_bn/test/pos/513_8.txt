Watch this film ASAP if you like scary or action. If the opening scene does not get your adrenaline pumping, someone can check your pulse. Great action, excellent casting and top one-liners. This is the only movie I have seen in a movie where the crowd praises each chop, kick and punch. Care is not on perfection but when this can be a lot of fun in the movie. It is a pure racing in the action of dark comic books. 9/10
