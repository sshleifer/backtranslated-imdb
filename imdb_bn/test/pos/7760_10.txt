Sujumiya Haruhi N Yutu (Harhu Sujumiya Malanni) At first sight you may think that this is another animated school comedy / drama. Well, it's not! Setting will be only a school environment. It's okay with a comedy, but with a very smart multiple quiz. And the letters have a mental excellence that is almost the same class that can be found in the works of England Bergman. Episodes are circulated, it seems, outside orders, such as pilot actually episode 11. It is possible to present small signals in upcoming episodes. The program is an adaptation of the popular novel series of Nagu Tianigao, about Harhu Sujumiya. <br /> <br /> What is the story? Like all episodes, the story goes to Huhu Suzumiya, who tries to make her feel uncomfortable. Harujah has no interest in the common people of his own, and actively searches the aliens, time travelers and espers (people with supernatural forces). To find such people, he formed a club, which he called the SOS Brigade (it's fun overloading the world: Haruj Sujumiyas Brigade). In addition to Haruhi, other members of the SOS-Brigade are kayon. She is the show's real hero. It is his view that we follow the story. When Huhu came to the idea of ​​forming the SSS-Brigade, he was just sitting in front of the class. He is quite skeptical of most clubs' activities and tags to ensure he does not go too much for extremists, and he is the only one in the class to talk to Haruhi. Another member, Yuki Nagato, is the "essential silent member" and the only remaining member of the literary club, which has captured the SOS-Brigade for a free club room. He does not think that the SOS-Brigade uses him in his clubroom, as long as he can sit in a corner and read his books. She participated in brigade activities. Murur was arrested "voluntarily" by Asahina Hrahu, because the club needed a lolita-like mascot for some suspected cases. She often acted as a club maid. The last member has always been a cheerful eutuki quizumi, who has become a "mysterious transfer student" (i.e. he transferred to semester two months which qualifies as a mysterious Haruhi). <br /> <br /> <br /> All members but some randomly picked people in the queen school, but actually have their own interest in it.
