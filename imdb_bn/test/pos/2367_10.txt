In the 1980s, many British alternative 'comedy' was obscure, confused, too political, and illogical, and the worst presentation of comic strip ... stuff fell into this section. <br /> <br /> But on the other hand - it's an extraordinary movie that works on different intellectual level. <br /> <br /> Dennis is a criminal mastermind or lying? <br /> <br /> is he telling the truth? <br /> <br /> I've probably seen the supergraduation 20 or 30 times, and I still can not make 100% decisions. This is excellent thing. <br /> <br /> As well as Ad Edson, other primary comic strip plays a major role for the main episodes - French and Sanders, Pett Richardson, Alexey Sial, Keith Allen, Nigel Planner and Robi Coltton. Playing rick is not a play. <br /> <br /> All the comic strip cast - though I do not like the hidden contents of some of their members - they are the convincing actors and the great screening of this big screen launch, the work of Richardson-Richens writing team is often a pure talent, wonderful around the world With little touch <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > And it's very fun with it. You do not have to be frustrated.
