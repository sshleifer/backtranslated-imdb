It kicks you in the stomach There is more solid character, more realistic stories, and other films with more depth in political dialogue. But then again, most of them are not driven by Peter Watkins. Perhaps in the 1960s a truly gifted artist appeared in British films, Watkins has created some rarely seen films that debut in the outlandish world - political attacks, social problems, and governmental solutions. So, his job is probably less "filming", political, which may be called weak in their underlying artistic quality. Why do not you get involved in the art again? Watkins courage. And successful. You will not feel better with this one. You will not feel happy Indeed, you really do not like film; It is incompatible, honest, straight, unashamed; A debris in your face, short You can not help to get angry, you can not touch to see you touch. Watkins makes movies so fruitful.
