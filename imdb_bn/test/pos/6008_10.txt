Ted Danson made a great choice to play the game. Although her background was mostly comedy, she showed here that she could make the play correct or perhaps even better (though it has a lot of humor). Especially because his character is supposed to be English, it is difficult to turn a blind eye to his American accent, but it is just a small thing. <br /> <br /> All villains have thrown up equally well: James Fox, Edward Fox, Peter and 'Toll, Warwick Davies, John Permanent, etc. Even most of them are small or giant, 100% believable in what they do and their motivations are very clear. Gillyver's Gilivar, the grillier (monster) Lilipiptian's suspicion about the frustration of the left front, Dr. Youssef to use his position in court. Bates's attempts, to prove Galvoror's madness so that he could marry Mary. <br /> <br /> Merry Stenbergen is wonderful as Mary Galliver (17th-century English character with an American accent but never thinks). She is a painful character, because she is waiting nine years to return to her husband's house, and ultimately he is talking about small people, demon, flying island and talking horse! Mary, despite the fictional story of the story, it is a very credible character. <br /> <br /> Special effects are exciting, especially when you think it was featured on a television scale when the CGI was childhood at that time. It is very realistic to see a 6-feet-tall man walking across a city full of 6 inches long people. <br /> <br /> Common is also good: Omar Sharif, Richard Wilson, Sir John Gilgood, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ned Beatty. All the great actors who made strong supporter cast, which Donson has done great acting ability. <br /> <br /> Hounyhnhms and Yahoo are probably the most effective element of the story on the ridicule of things: The horse-talk society, which has no benefit to the dependent people of Yahoo! primitive, hateful people, who is forcibly companion and their leader is appointed. Greater work has also been done in the study of 'Golver and Mersey' and there is a difference between the people and Yahoo!. <br /> <br /> The best version of "Gliwice Travels" and the best version of the best mini series ever. .
