When a worthy power station Pinky was released from prison, his parole officer found him in a bank in a big city. When he got some past crime to know about his past, they planned to exploit it and loot the bank. Pinky is afraid of the first fear because he really wants to go straight, but in a twist of fate, when Pinky thinks that no one will see a donkey horse in front of him. <br /> <br /> Caper, also known as the Mayfair Bank {among others!}, is a hugely fragile piece which is a great example of the 1970s. London and all its suspicious fashion Ralph Thomas and Gaya are like a Christmas tree like Elmas's 'Christmas tree'. If the audience can take David Nivene as an adult criminal for some development {It is not easy that I can tell you}, then a Nightingale of Berkeley Square can surprise you. The actor is definitely not dragging any tree, but it does not really hurt the image, it is a good fun quality which is never less than entertaining. Scores and soundtracks are probably convicted of joliferation during dramatic criminal moments, but it is a minor complaint that makes me think it is an underlying British jewel. <br /> <br /> Richard Jordan plays the main role of Pinky. Clearly hoping for a desire among American viewers}, 70's obituary Olavia Tobias (hair mass) is there to be interested in women there, though the blocks have a delightful view of Ll Sommer and his delightful feet for the company. Suitable enough clips and a seriously rewarded finale, a Nightingale in Berkeley Square is far better than the rating of 5.7 in IMDB, but how many people have seen it I'm surprised to see it? Well, if it's a chance you go, it's a good thing. 7/10
