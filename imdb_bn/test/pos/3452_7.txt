This movie predicts the Australian film Road Warrior and Desert Priscilla, and its impact on them is clear: Conversation, Location, Photography, Directions and Political Philosophy. Photography is significantly confident. The direction is stylish and the most part is well done. If you like Bruce Beersford, Peter Weir and George Miller's first Australian movies, you like "oz". The direction reminds the critics of Edgar Wright's contemporary work. The similarity indicates that "Oz" was far ahead of its time. Critics of 1967 hated it and the crowds went away - In the 1940s in Australia, there was some way in Australia in the 1940s, where the similarities were important, but the film was different from what the audience expected, especially the promotional poster. This film will appeal more to contemporary audiences: it's still weird and self-aware, but in contemporary European way instead of in the 1960s in Australia. Joy Dunstan (who later appeared on the Australian TV series "Prisoner") plays his role in less raw emotions than his contemporary Jackie Waiver, instead the character of Donsten in this movie shows some of the apparent strengths of Australian women. Kylie Mingag is playing Australia's TV series neighbors Charlie Mitchell and her career has improved further. Men will also enjoy this movie, which presents different types of old problems than in America or even in other mid-sixties movies of Australia. In particular, Bruce Spence (who later became the Helmph pilot in Trainman, 'Road Warrior' and 'Thunderdome' film in 'Matrix' film), Tian Maiden in 'St Star War III', and a permanent role which supports the rest of the central and firm cast. This image is valuable for Bruce Spence's only performance. 7/10 For some minor continuity problems.
