Well, where do I start <br /> <br /> Another critic said, you know that when you look at the real shot, you are for real behavior - the minute and minute of the movie spent a person standing on a traveler <br /> <br /> I will not repeat the wonderful summary of Robin's story. However, I would like to say that this movie hugged me more than any film. I sat on the open head, and on the edge of my seat all the way. Camera work, soundtracks and * excellent performance (especially Tony Sourvillah) that takes you to the screen and lets you look away. <br /> <br /> It's Italian, so of course everyone looks gorgeous, but it is simply an exercise in the cool style of any way. It is a film with many people to talk about fate, loss and love. Go to <br /> <br /> and see.
