I've searched for this movie for years. I have great memories of first acting and singing this movie. I never knew because the movie was unexpected because of the activities of the Gershwin's family - he was involved in trying to suppress American classic !! I just hope they will release the film and enjoy the American people. <br /> <br /> Sammy Davis, Jr. is his best-seller in this film. His only other performance was the same as 'Ana Lucas' - I want another horror movie that will be released from DVD. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The first rate of pergument and base, selected all stars. Hope you can see for yourself one day.
