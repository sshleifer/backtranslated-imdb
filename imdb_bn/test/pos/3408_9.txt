I was a history teacher and overall I was satisfied with the movie. My adolescents enjoyed it on holiday. Is it 100% accurate and it's a little sad in the places? Yes ... but my kids went away from the computer and spent four nights to play the station. <br /> <br /> The scenes of war were impressive and we have completely filled the whole historical character. Stand out as Lloyd Bridge as Jefferson Davis and Holbrook as Abraham Lincoln. We all thought that the Bent was evil and charmingly brilliant to Philipp Casanoff. We all thought Charles Harry and George had stolen the show. <br /> <br /> We'll enjoy the movie again!
