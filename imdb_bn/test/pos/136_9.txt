I did not expect much because of a strong criticism and as a result, I enjoyed a great deal to enjoy the movie. Compared to earlier films, shafar colors and less stunning compositions of shots, in my opinion, allow fiction to take the focus. Although a vampire religious conflict was common, I felt other things were not. For example: <br /> <br /> how its power is often expressed through interaction with her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ <br /> <br /> I've heard and read a lot about the techniques used in other movies. Of course. However, I think that these strategies are used to emphasize what is happening in the scene and I think he does this good work. I do not need a director to use new strategies. The techniques that I have used are used well and properly, which I think is the case with this film. <br /> <br /> I recommend it.
