I still can not describe what to feel when getting it by fnac site. This is a rare movie, so spoken and known, fans find it difficult too, but the past and present disaster is devastating: now I have a DVD with my best DVD. As I did in Atlantis, I saw another rare assortment movie bought on the internet, I saw in this house, all the lights in my DVD and TV were closed, and with the experience wondered. I do not know what to expect. Sadly, I saw a movie by Lucas Bean when I had never seen it before, when I was always frustrated. But it never came. There was no exception in this movie. From the beginning, I realized that the person who created a movie like this would be the first to be bigger in the future. And so it happened. It has won many awards (with the highest award in my country's film festival, which makes me proud) and it shows that the film is making a lot of big issues. This may be the most original of the war after I have ever seen, originality and artistic feelings hit the Mad Mac. There is no problem with this movie: its film is gifted as well as performances of actors. I am surprised that at last I have seen all the films of my favorite directors and almost all of them are copying (Joan of Arc still waiting to buy my DVD). Most of the style and dedication of this movie, which is my favorite director of Louis Besan: clean taste, nice framing, music excellent use (I'm surprised at the first feature-length Scherzo of Larry Scherzo) and most of its work is the highest. Great achievement commitment. Gaumont did good to betting in his boy-genius, who later changed the relationship between France and Europe and their public relations in Europe. Let us hope Basen will start working on a new director project. I would be happy to be the first one. Until then, I recommend this film to anyone who will learn a lesson to make good movies with a little money. I love the film's atmosphere, which, through its black and white paintings, gives the world even more gloomy views after Holocaust. These movie films work with the worst magic: showing in pictures that we can not explain by word. And I'm with people who wrote and commented on this movie: Good choice! Those who see it and their lives change a little, have a great hug in their minds.
