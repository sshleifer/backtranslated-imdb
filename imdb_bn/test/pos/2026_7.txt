Rock Star is a "beautiful" movie. Everyone is beautiful Even those who are not supposed to be even nice, are really nice. Chris is a wonderful man who learns a lesson in life. He goes back to his girlfriend Emily, who is very beautiful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a good movie, despite all the fineness. Maybe I just used all the angst of x general music. In some ways this movie was Rock Star's performance and was not difficult enough to be credible. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlbar's performance is quite good. Jennifer Aniston played well in her role, but it was incomplete. She was a beautiful girl. <br /> <br /> Check it out. If you have watched a rock concert or spinal tap, see it.
