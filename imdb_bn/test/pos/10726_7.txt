I remember going to drive inn with my parents and sisters. I was grade 5, and still a child, and after 4 years the drive was closed, but the film is still linking to my memory. An adult movie, which finds a baby entertaining. It is a sign of excellence. Hoffman is Hollywood's best actor, and this film proves that. I like to throw Billie on an ice cream scene, and I remember myself the SCTV version of the film Eye Factory. Remember Joe Flairty's cry. If you like SCTV Skit, please email me. No bad movie, it's a dad, and a story about his son. Touch and intertaining, I talk about Hoffman Killroy, and love the part where the streets change. Price of a second watch. 7/10
