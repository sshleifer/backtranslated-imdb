It was wonderful. On Thursday night, as a librarian and participant of the New York Library Association's Vlogity Fund event, I had the privilege of watching the pre-release screening of the new film The Kite Runner. Concerned about child actors welfare issues have been delayed due to the release of the movie. I am grateful that the NYLA event has been allowed to go as planned. About the movie, I think it has been done efficiently. It had a great impact on me, I think, as a Clockwork Orange from Stanley Kubrick, although it is a little graphic - though much less. There is no comparison between horrible, violent violence and rape shown in A Clockwork Orange; and minor violence in the reality of the Kite Runner; The effects for the subject and the human mind are comparable only. (I wrote more details about violence and child rape and how it was handled in my MySpace blog.) My overall idea was that the film was extraordinary; One of the best made movies I've seen is one. The picture of flying birds flying to Afghan boys is mostly caught by an artificial beauty and grace of unknown world. The issue is very serious, and this movie carries the emotions about the subject matter that has destroyed Hollywood without "Hollywood touch". Although the curtain in Cinnamon was a clear bit of symbolism (to me). Finally, I must mention the superiority of the sound track. The poetry of Rumi Rabindranath's two main characters ran away from the country during the Russian invasion - under the terrible conditions - really showed the power of those poems. Anyone viewing the subtitles that I see in the scene, and I just want to see the beauty of that language. I do not know which language quoted by Aamir, his usual Persian Persian dialect is similar to Rumi's original Persian language. Also, please quote the word on the cut line every time. I found it a deep, distinct word, even though the librarians with me did not notice it. I can not help, but it is surprising that the kites actually make the word "cut" or understand the vibration / noise of the horse's flyer experience during the competition.
