Lol <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I started with my review 'Lock'. I used to always see this image as a child; And even then I sensed it all silliness. Low budget, awesome acting and hair scripts were back then clear. I saw it again yesterday and could not just laugh. It's very bad it's actually good lol. Like other critics, it is not taken seriously. There is no one to see this movie and said that the makers did so. Soundtrack is so funny, every time I hear it smile. 'Climax' is just a smile riot This is a complete battlefield, explosion and total chaos in New York ... so ridiculous you can not help but look at it. <br /> <br /> Another sunny moment <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - Carefully (and slow) keeps the target and does not hit the LMAO. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> - It is clear that Kersie is used to lose loved ones ... when her new girlfriend is only settled shortly there are a few dates. The acting is so bad that you can not blame anyone that the carcass is just crazy to destroy Karl ... he goes down, looks at the murder and goes away. <br /> <br /> Again, so bad, it's good. <br /> <br /> *** *** Among **** stars.
