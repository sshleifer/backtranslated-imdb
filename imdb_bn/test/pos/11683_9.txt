If I guess what you know about this movie, I am also forced to come to the idea that you will probably see it despite what you say. If these rings are true - read - you can find some matches with the least part of this review. If you are uncertain, or are not completely sure that what happened in the early 1970's and in the early and early 80's in the Shari'a and colonial youth music culture, then perhaps you will have to read one of the reviews which may be the motive instead. <br /> <br /> Although I did not grow up in California, the American Punk scene was the first song scene I really lived in. At the height of the hardcore I was submerged from 1979-1981, everyone had the band and the band and the audience in general were among the general public: <br /> * Rejection of similarity <br /> <br /> * Due tolerance of differences and Enjoy <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No, though there were classes or groups who do not want to be intolerant, those who talk or enough "sloppy" work. And often these few slogans had a specific amount of undesirable credit, who tried really hard to live in the fascist image of anarchic, self-reliant, angry young police-hate. <br /> <br /> While the Penelope Spirits' excellent call-punk documentary "Western civilization humiliation" interviewers with birds presented a very narrow view of our Gulf region, enjoyed some of us, interviewed with the band, the club owners, The promoter and even the security person at least represent my own perspective and the memories of the 'scene'However, this is possible for those who communicate with East Bengal about those estimates that these estimates can enjoy the film without their challenges. Unfortunately, this is only the fault for those who promote, believe or feel comfortable with stereotypes - not filmmakers. Do not blame the messenger. <br /> <br /> The music presented here is not all - even not the most. This is not an illogical element, but it is strong, objectionable, quick and less concerned with technology than raw power. <br /> <br /> For me, Ron Reyes was far more valuable than this power to sing, singing X, Fear and the first black flag with Circle Xerox. As much as I like the germs, I saw the Derby crash for the mess - and the nice guy - he kept me a little cold. Nevertheless, Derby was playing drone with his pants Tarantula on the "shut down" background and after drone. X interview is also great. <br /> <br /> Spirits' direct documentary style is full of wild pans in the musical parts and zoom supplement. During the interview, framing is very nicely used to provide a context for what is being said. Considering her experience and budget, Spiris may have had this picture with anyone. <br /> <br /> Recommended for those who really love this movie and those who have forgotten those few years. Before the Imanik Punk, the lesser, lower-directional rebellion was enriched by another stream of musical mainstream and stereotype became more important than the basic philosophy.
