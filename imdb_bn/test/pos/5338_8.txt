If you do not see the movie yet, you like the comedy, go out and rent it at least! It won, animation oscar, no events! I did not see any other Wallace and Groot movies (actually I think I saw each other), but humor is very different ... and some would say the British too. A good way, of course! <br /> <br /> This story can only be an excuse for all jokes, but it is not the most comprehensive, but it still works (by the way, my nephew is coming one of the great surprises, I do not, for him, Kodu; ). I think, after you take a look at this one, you will go out and seek out other W & G movies, that's out there. Have fun!
