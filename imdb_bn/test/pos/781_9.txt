I saw this in the middle of today's expectation - if Tirt films are picking something and it usually publishes a good sign, I'm not usually a fan of Julie Walter, generally dislike her comedy roles (sorry for any fans, but it's a Personal thing - I can not find anything funny in the comedy). <br /> <br /> Although it was amazing - everyone has an amazing performance, but the difference between Green and Walter is exceptional! This kind of arrival movie is not something that I like to be very fond of but I can not make enough recommend to it - and look at Rupert Grint as he matures into a fine delicacy actress - Sunny, a lot of rock, great time and a nicely painted film. .
