This Blake Edwards movie is not sure if it wants to be a comedy, a play or a musical. Julie Andrews has uninterrupted presence, enough reason to see this comedy-drama-musical-espionage. Julie is beautiful and throughout the film, using her many talents. Rock Hudson seems tired, but as Julie's romantic interest she is much more than fine. Add original appeal to the first World War and the airplane. Overall, the film is very entertaining. The DVD release is edited by the original edition (Black Edwards) version. Recommended, this is the only version that Edwards will allow; However, Turner's classic movie has recently shown the complete (theater release) version. Recommended.
