This is a decent movie. While the time for me is a little bit, it packs many steps, whales, prosperity and emotions in that frame. Matt Dillon and other major characters do a great job in this movie. Emotions and intensity were believable throughout the film and the era. This is not a genuinely costly Hollywood celebrity action movie, but it is indeed a very satisfying movie for the price. This evening was great on my evening. This movie is a direct acting action movie, with great acting, story and direction. I would recommend this movie. Character character was good to develop and you believe that the real event really happened. Because I believe this movie was made with a cheap budget, performance and quality were very much.
