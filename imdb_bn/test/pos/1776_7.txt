Operated by Jacks Turunur (Cat people, Out of the Daemon, Dame of the Damon) and Philippe Dunne (how my Grill was Hello). The main character of Captain Anne Providence is based on the true woman-pirate Anne Bonnie who lived and traveled through the 18th century Atlantic. <br /> <br /> The image begins with the sea war, where Anne (Jean-Pieters) pirate ship attacks a trade ship on its way to South America from Europe. As a result, a handsome French officer Pierre La Rochelle (Louis Jardan), who was captured, collected valuable resources. Anne ends up falling in love with her and apparently her feelings are reciprocated but she only discovers with whom she has a beautiful young wife Molly (Debra Patgate) when she sets her free until she loves only. Ann started their revenge plans but ended up making an unexpected turn of luck instead of making a great sacrifice to save them. The 'Black Bear' pirate movie Clayich also made his appearance here, this time starring Thomas Gomez. <br /> <br /> Although the innings is probably not less than the review of the pirate movie. Clich√©s, it is still featured in the beautiful scenes and sea battle sequences, in his artistic moments, in Technikolaar and in some aspects of the film, and most of them have touched the touch of personal touch with Jack Tornur. 7/10
