The non-Gatto Nell Survello, or the Nightmare concert, is more familiar to English-speaking audiences, it is the horror film director Lucio Fulci (directed by Manueli Lucio Fulcci) who goes to lunch after filming a very important and violent scene, but he gives a steak order and has a terrific view of cannibalism. . The extraordinary outlook, hallucinations, and dreams influenced her mental state and started to begin, Phulasi decides to find Professor Egan Schwartz (DVD El Thompson) for support and communication for psychological help. Schwarz claimed that Floris could not separate the imagination from the reality and agree to his help, but Sherz has more terrible motive motives because the serial killers begin to brutally kill prostitution and Flachi thinks that he might be responsible. <br /> <br /> This Italian production was co-written and operated by Lichio Fulcissi, who also starred in the film as well as the great film director Lucio Florchi, which does not really look like much effort, Yet Un Gatto nel Cervello is nothing more serious And I like that alone. Phulasi, John Fitsimmons, Geovani Symonelli and Antonio Tantari script are nothing but the excuse of threadbars for editing the many poor footage from other Italian movies together. Its purpose is quite in my mind and in your view if Fanny is familiar with one of his fans or his film, there is a certain attraction to see the foliage on the screen, in the end it has ended like going out of the money because it is a policeman that tells the killer And it's too. Another incident of this incident, when two police kept a white sheet on the assassination of the dead on the field and then they went there without any police presence, that means I will leave the body in Italy in Italy, this is a field itself? It continues along a good speed and if you like your pride, you will have to see it, even if you do not like it, you hate it with hate, it all depends on your nature, so the people you love are so fond of you. <br /> <br /> Director Fooli was not the most artistic congratulatory film producer, and his footage seems to have been shot for flash, flat and television, footage of the other films (7 total) matches the 'Fool's shot' stuff and it is clear That has pieced together from these different movies. If you hit the jackpot, people break through chains, they enter through the smell of the flesh, the mouth melts, there are some deceptions, there is some bursting throat, somebody is born in a body, a tongue is snatched, no one is hiler On wheels move, it has lots of iron, someone is removed with their hook, there is a body full of rage, who has a body The hand is cut off, someone drops the head. And in their eyes, the piano carries a cow's death by the wire, as it moves away with a throat, there is the spread of thorns, blood circulation spread around the circle, and some cats may be eaten in the brain and there is more. Some special effects seem to look a bit fake and look. It is seen with an estimated budget of $ 100,000, it is quite cheap, it does not have any visible style or artistic ability, but why do you want to see when you can see a Nazi orgy sequence and wall from wall? This act is terrible along with Falaki. <br /> <br /> If your Gate-Hound is like a Gerto Nail Survola like a top movie but if you are looking for something a little more material or indeed any substance then this is not for you. It's a movie that divides people into the middle, if you love it or hate it.
