I have seen this movie and anyone who is with Marines or a branch of the service can appreciate the film's accuracy. This is a must for collection. Jack Webb does an excellent job as a hard drill instructor. My father went to the Marine Boot Camp in Camp Penalty and said that the movie is so accurate that he is back on basic training. There is a line in the movie where the Jack Webb character gets mad from the boot to open the sand rash. Well, give me the telephone, there is nothing but sand fleas in the camp. I have there and can appreciate it. In fact, the Las Paluj, which came out of the camp, means the city of Flas in English. To understand what I'm saying, you must watch the movie. Anyone in WWII film, all fighting drill started right here with Sgt. A must be collected for you
