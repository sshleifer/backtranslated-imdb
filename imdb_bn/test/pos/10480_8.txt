If you find that the first 30 minutes of this movie are so slowly you wonder why you see it, do not give up. Also, the Danish language is somewhat new to most North American people who can not see and hear Danish movies. However, as the film progressed it has been better and better and the visitors are rewarded for its patience. <br /> <br /> Because of being a fan of the movie "Out of Africa", the film has expressed interest in me, based on a short novel by Ishak Dinsen (Karen Blixen), the main character of this film. <br /> <br /> Food - Babette festival - amazing. I'm not a chef, but I was fascinated! How the story explains, also changes, I think how much you read in it and depending on where you stood religiously. If later, how you look at the definition of "validation" can affect how you can explain this story. <br /> <br /> In any case, it is a fine film, but if you are doing diet, do not see it. .
