Of course, when I saw this movie in HBO, I was somewhat uncertain about the plot, but seeing Dustin Hoffman in it caught my attention. Sincerely, I'm not interested in watching old movies, but for a long time it changed my perspective. Seeing this provocative movie, I did not experience the difficulty of touching my seat again, my tears suddenly grabbed my cheek, and then, I gave up a heavy breath to realize the effect I've seen. Krormer v. Kranar was actually one of the best classical plays I've seen for a long time, even I could not imagine myself how it touched me. The story was firmly emotional, but is not associated with such. Characters were not unreal for their role; They make them like viewers, which they make as their position just like the role of Merle Strip in the film, she was a mother, who admitted her wrong in the truth, but then she was confident and confident in building a confident attitude to fulfill her wishes. Dustin Hoffman was very wonderful, how can I play this role seriously, and suddenly I can not guess what might be completely different in a different role, then it performs well. Although I have already seen movies long ago, when I came back to my house and stayed in the lounge and spent time taking pictures and bought time for it, my experience would be another perfect moment when Krrummer v. Krummer took notice of it.
