I hired this movie from the video store last night. It's being new and not released here long ago, the rental was only overnight. I, my little Sis, and my older brother usually hated watching this kind of movie and saw it. The movie started once and we sat there for a while and we all started to laugh historically. Even my brother This movie is ridiculous, I actually laughed. Whatever the movie is funny ... even if I feel funny but sometimes I can not laugh. But this movie ... I laugh. My brother finally thought that it was the "best" movie he saw. After about 2 or 3 hours I ended up watching the movie again.
