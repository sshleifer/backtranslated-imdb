Warning: If Coen Brothers or David Lynch defines your taste in the film, ignore this review and proceed. Yes, I borrowed "One Line Summary" from the book about President Ronald Reagan, but, among other qualities, this film emphasizes the personality that character is running in the lives of the honorable people. This picture is full of honest, modest people, and they have authentic honesty. In a word, they have "character". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not know WWII history, you probably do not know that the arrival of Captain Correlli on the island has led to mussolini, The average audience might think that the romance was of "whirlwind" variety. That's not so. The romance gradually develops, which gives both dignity and money. It may be time to become a director at the deliberate pace of the movie. <br /> <br /> Some reviews criticize Italian accent. The Italian-speaking family of my family assured me that her pronunciation is very good. <br /> <br /> The history was right. Yes, the Germans turned against their Italian allies, who were initially reluctant ally from the beginning. If you find this disappointment, keep in mind that after the French language of France in 1940, the Mediterranean cruise of France was abolished, not immediately after the French diplomacy, it would fall in the hands of the government of the Vichy or worse, the Nazis. <br /> <br> The Italian script as a literate and Sanskrit was a praise for the educated and Sanskrit civilization. <br /> <br /> This image was nicely photographed and the story was lyricist. The script was not worried, it was not tricky, but there was a situation where confusion and cleverness were not needed, and they were not suitable either. <br /> <br /> The story is flexible, and the message is lifting. Characters are honest, bold, sincere, sympathetic, and customizable. This is a nice little film. 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
