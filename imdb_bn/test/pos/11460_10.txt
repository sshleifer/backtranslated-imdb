I remember seeing this image in the theater and liking it. I stumble over it on the net last night and saw it again and saw it better with age. For those of you who describe the first 80 seconds as cheese, if you materially compared it to the horrific flickr of the last two decades, it is better to compare it to its unique horror sub-style movies, which makes me think that action / horror <br / > <br /> <br /> This image actually provides the product for its budget (or worse in this case). The film has actually developed some characters and enough history is enough enough to fix the atmosphere before moving in front of the characters in front of the characters. The film has a few laughing lanterns and it's a fun horror flickr giving the perfect mood. If you compare the NOD in the horror films of the contemporary big budget as "I'm Legend" (Vincent Price version is a lot better), this movie really stands out. Modern horror sticks are almost completely influenced by CGI. Most plots or characters are at devel and are completely expected. This movie mastered special effects from beginning and the characters are 24k plastic. If I'm taking 80% of these dangerous cheese, I will accept the 95% current entry in this section. <br /> <br /> Again, the closing note of the NDD has reminded me of beautiful Jil Treshetty and why I have not seen his movie horror or otherwise. Jill you have a great opportunity to read this - I think you have to be superb and have more movies. Finally, if you like the action horror flicks, perhaps you'll love it too much.
