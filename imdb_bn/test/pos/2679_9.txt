I just started watching this show. Ireland's Irish television station RTE1 Afternoon afternoon at 12.30 pm (26th July 2006). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Today's episode of Takeoek (July 26, 2006), Kerry launches a new job and invites his friends to the house and goes on to produce some coffee and wants to have a friend who wants to have 'outside' friends Comes up and shows her 'stomach hair'! And when he licks the plate goes out of the dinner! But another interesting episode was the second week when the old man (the father in Bango) won in Bingo and that episode made me excited with laughter, especially when they came out and took the fridge back and the father was standing there and thought it was new <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know how long we can run it on Irish TV or at any stage (year is recorded) but I It's not going to end soon because I'm really enjoying it <br /> <br /> Some great writing, some great characters and comedy plays (by the likes of Caire, Doug and Caery Kerry) have been distributed in some great fifth lines and well- Somewhat sticky and sometimes near sign (kids send out in the room!) But I think this is a winning sitcom of US and very funny.
