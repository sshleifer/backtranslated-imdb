Attractive cartoon "DVD's Lost Skelton" is included in the DVD. I especially like the way to use color in the background industry - very artistic for Colombia, whose cartoon section usually had very little budget (and the results seem like this!) <br /> <br /> I wonder, however, how a particular .. um, finger gestures ... ever got the sensor past. Imagine, the gesture of question is much less than today's day in 1937. You think that along with animate, some have noticed, but - the visually visible scene has seen three times! And based on the context, I suspect that his entry was deliberate, some animators could only see if they were watching sensors!
