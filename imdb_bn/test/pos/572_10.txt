You know, before watching this movie I was a little sympathetic to being caught in a criminal case. If I had been arrested and accused, then I think that they might be "guilty" <br /> <br /> <br /> I've made this opinion for years. Once you are working as a detective in some of Sydney's more painful areas, you see a good friend of mine. He often complains that his bloody attempts 'bleeding heart' was damaged by the lawyer and the magistrate. He "crooks bang in the morning" and they will "return to the streets by noon". It took her toll ... they dressed her down. He argued that I did not think ruthlessly collecting creative proofs, "where they belong" to keep the badies ... good ... "acceptable". <br /> <br /> My argument about the rights of innocent people is not valid. "Will you ever be arrested and charged with serious crimes?" He argued and despite being a legal citizen, the weight of his argument believed me that he was right. There was no vacancy for me or my family or friends who were accused of killing or committing serious crimes. <br /> <br /> Hmmm. Just as mentioned earlier, this wonderful illuminated documentary has changed it all. <br /> <br /> I send him a copy.
