Hard Justice is a wonderful worker movie! The whole movie is nothing but shooting! Those who say they do not shoot in the way they use it. Well, this one is really hard core! David Bradley is really good and takes a pounding of his character movie. He gets hit with a rod a dozen times, runs behind and is in a coma for three days and then wakes up again, beats, builds, restores and is ready for more action! Its character is incredibly tuff! Charles Napier was also very good, and he stole the show controversial! Vernon Wells was good! Professor Toru Tanak was given the brief recognition and recognition of the judge! As for the action, it is really awesome with all gunfight terrorism and a huge stand like the scene has been closed and the vehicle is flying in the middle wind! There have been many such things in the 95 minute run time. For fans of action you will be blown off with all the energy of the fire and will have to offer this movie! Hard Justice is a movie that can not be easily detected and if you live in a video store and you see it for sale, why is it a big cookie and a plus box in this movie? Believe there is a ton of action! You can find some good deals at eBay, Half.com, Amazon.com's Z-Shops and Market Place Sellers and see! I strongly recommend that an action movie fan who shoots EMS and films and frustrates on other movies, which look like a real non-stop action flick but fail to deliver it to get hard trial!
