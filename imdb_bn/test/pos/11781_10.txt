Violent hardware war is finally out of the DVD. The HWT has achieved its nuances in the parody classic, and it is not only a 20 minute minute riot, but is the staple in the low budget film production class, where many movies are derived and lived by the state of culture. With the DVD, we do not get the chance to review the original parody (4Q2, Cinnamon-Ban Head, ballistic toast, et al) that Arnie F. did in 1978, but there is a lot of additional material to display Foselius intelligence. The Antic SideShow is a dead-parody that is very interesting, but at the same time gives a statement about the compatibility of ignorance and greed. The director's commentary is also violent, such as animal characteristics that parodies take a movie on the talk show circuitry and are actually based on taking public opinion access circuits on HQ to talk show circuits. I'd like to take Arne, Michael Wiese and Crooke to take parody of contemporary overblown and overbudgeted targets - as well as any movie that pops out about 100 million dollars on this day of Hollywood - not so clever films like Spider-Man or Men in Black Parody!) But an extra, extra, excessive, and extra-precious features. <br /> <br />
