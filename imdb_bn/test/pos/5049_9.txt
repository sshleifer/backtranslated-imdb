In order to be able to use "realistic" in my summary, I do not know that many older people do not go near me because of the famous Maestro, blind people, etc. - I'm never old enough. These minor problems, the relationships between the characters of this film and those expressed in the emotions were completely realistic and genuine. In fact, although we are still not 30 years old, in the relationship between the main character and his wife I can see many characteristics of my relationship with my wife. For the young people who do not die (There's a great line in this movie, when two best friends are talking about the death of the youth, and one of them says - and I'm sorry, we missed our chance - we 'just have to keep it stuck) , We'll all be all these characters. I know that many filmmakers choose to go * away from the reality, as opposed to being * faced *, but they can enjoy memories of our death - and the importance of completing life - that this film.
