This is a movie that you love or hate. I love it If you search for mysteries, great influences, actions, perversity, hostility, etc. you will not find it in this movie. It is a good movie, sensitive, positive, uplifting. The film's hero, Coach Jones (played by Ed Harris), strength and integrity, and Radio (Cuba Gooding, Junior) is a mentally challenged person who finds ways to contribute to his world. I think I did not find this movie as a "sensitive hogwash" because it was very real to me. I know this good man I saw those jocks who feel fun to pick up junk. I've seen standing to stand for weakness men's weaknesses. I've seen those high school football seem to be serious business. I've seen people who know what's really important in life. None of these people knew that I could be a man. I do not laugh; I cried. I felt good in the movie, remember that people like me like coach Jones and Radio If you do not have people like you, you might not like the movie. If you do not like a movie that looks good in human nature, you hate it.
