Cool flick Enjoyable to visit. Hope to see more from Fred Carpenter soon. I really like location settings with all New York references. It was interesting to find that all eventually unfolds. The Susense Factor was effective and played, although kept simple, was effective in filming characters. This movie has a lot of free little tricks that all make well. I think the acting actress has done a great job in her role. The cast and direction in this film seems sewnlessly sewn together and the shooting quality is quite impressive. The film is not without its soft moments, it gives a great sense of balance.
