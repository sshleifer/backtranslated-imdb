Haggard is not required to grade, because it was not designed to be classified like Oscar-winning films, and it was never intended to achieve the Oscars (of course). If you only see left and some bran stuff that looks like fast-shot shots, it comes like a movie that is more than just Kaki or Jacques (though it's great). For pure enjoyment, I can definitely give this picture 10; Smile like the trill movie of the falcone, until almost every scene hit me in my face. If you do not see it, see it and then buy it. Personally my favorite character is Brandon (Falcon), he is so smooth and natural and random that his ridiculous, he makes great (with performance figures), and loses a gem mountain bike? The haggard is definitely a movie that the overall humor is only rivaling by anchorman and napoli dynamite.
