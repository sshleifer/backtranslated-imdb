I'm not sure that this movie is called children's drama or fiction film. When I first saw it I could not finish it at all and it was just the only part of the movie which seemed lacking depth and kept me a bit sad for a while. Then I saw it a second time and realized that how wonderful the act was and why it did not understand why it was a little concentrated at that time. <br /> <br /> Young Majlows and Woods should have made outstanding performance <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, Bobby dropped much more than what happened to Bobby - what did he kill?, did he run away and really did those fantastic journeys? Or was it a fairytale story to prove a point to Hons? <br /> <br /> <b r /> but this is not a happy ending that we used to do with children's children. It's probably not because it's not just that. <br /> <br /> To see even more classical finishes, visit the official Elisa Wood site where you will receive the first draft draft script (probably by the original author) at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Hans Geimmer's music note that I Best Soundtrack I've ever heard, a mix of childhood and dark feelings throughout the film. If you can, hold a great CD. <br /> <br />
