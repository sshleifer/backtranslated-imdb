I finally managed to get a copy of Dario Argentine's opera, and I tell you ... that was the time !! This was the last Argentine movie I did not see yet, and I'm a fan of most of his work. I think most of his work is extremely important for the horrible genre, but some of his films are frustrated (e.g. Phenomena). But the idea of ​​the opera plot always appeals to me and it turns out I was active! I enjoyed every shot in the opera and ultimately the movie fascinated me for the first minute. Among all the Argentine films, Opera went straight to number one and I hope I can encourage this man to encourage as much as possible. <br /> <br /> The above script and plot idea is rather simple. Especially in Argentina's earlier film Phenomena, it had many ideas and it became a mess. The opera plot is frustrating and cooler, but at the same time it is a great ridiculous comment - almost clear - to the opponents of clear violence. *** SPEAKER *** A young opera singer (Gorgeous Cristina Marsillach) being stalked by a terrible sadistic murderer. During every genocide, he saw his eyes wide open. They have needles attached to the eyelid and when they close them they become fragmented. *** Last speaker ***. This simple - yet effective - idea, adds Argentine Ravens, classic pieces (and curse) of Macbeth and many terrible things like Opera buildings and the entire atmosphere atmosphere of music. Particularly the appearance of extraordinary ravens and extra value. Old masters like Edgar Allen Poe already knew that these black birds have many mystery hanging around them and Dario Argento also knows it. <br /> <br /> Voices and Gore have been very well presented in the Oppep and this creates a true Argentine picture. My opinion with Profondo Rosso is his best second. I really hope many of you recommend this movie. Especially for the fans (Italian) awful business, it is an absolute must! Favorite "Rewind" - Cissin: Argentina shows her visual talent where Betty's friend is shooting in front of her eyes while trying to see who's in front of the door.
