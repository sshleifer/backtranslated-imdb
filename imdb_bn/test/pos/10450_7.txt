I always liked this movie and I'm glad that it is finally available in the DVD so viewers can see what I mean them all these years. The story is about Gary, a high school maiden (Lawrence Monson) who works as a delivery boy at a pizza place and he quarrels with his friends David (Jo RoU) and Rick (Steve Antin). Gary Karen (Daine Franklin) is a new girl in school and one morning she gives him a ride and till this time she is completely in love. The night that he saw Rick with Karen at a party, and now he is jealous of his best friend but is not telling anyone in his true feelings. <br /> <br /> ***** SPIRIT ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Rick asks Gary, if he empties his grandmother, Gary makes an excuse to rick alone Karen Can not get But one night at Gary, Rick Bragg had nailed him to the football field and Gary became angry. After a few days, Gary attended Rick and Karen's debate in the school library and she asked Karen what was wrong. She told him that she was pregnant and that Rick had dumped him. Gary helped her to take her grandmother home and pay for her abortion. Finally, Gary Karen says that she really feels about her and she seems to be acceptable to her feelings, but later on her birthday party, she goes back together with Karen and Rick. Gary Drive Without Girl! How this movie actually holds true realistic. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by Boas Davidson, who acted as a pretty action film director and he fixed these two things. Movie At first, he ensured that there was a lot of undesirable nudity so that it would be marketable to the youth, which usually goes to this movie. Secondly, he finished the film with Karen, the young Gary, and I think that in the audience, men try hard, and they can get drunk even if they do not win the hearts of a girl. Yes, this movie is stupid and exploitative but it's funny and sexy. Actress Lewis Moritz stole this picture almost as Carmella. Maritz was always a popular "B" level actress and you can remember him "One Flu Over the Kaku Nest". It's a very good soundtrack and like the story is going to be reflected in "Fast references High on Fast Times". But the heart of this movie is Monsoon and Franklin's two very good performances. Franklin needs nudity, but he still saddens a young girl who gets dumped at a crucial time. She is always a good actress and her natural charm is very clear in this film. But it's still the story of Manson and you can not feel for this man. When the movie ends, it's your performance that is with you. It is a tough job acting that only makes a teen sex comedy. Even the teenager-teenager-teenager-teenagers try to get sex, but the film still moves to achieve what they want. Hit underrated comedy bullseye.
