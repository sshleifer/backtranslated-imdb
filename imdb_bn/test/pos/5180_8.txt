This is a cool movie. This is an easy story about a writer that is not coming back to her home town to start her story, but instead she has been involved in friendship with a strange old man whose life represents perhaps the underlying state of the author - it is a museum incomplete concept, old equipment And "vain" people <br /> <br /> There is no big movement in a great situation or plot. It's a movie about internal changes. Stuck in their lives which are not very developmental, major people help transform each other, stop dreaming and achieve something or at least change and give their life the desired and long-awaited new direction. <Br> <br /> From filmmaking, I can only think of a weakness that can be considered as a feature - not much of our character description or internal detail insights. It is very descriptive of thoughts and facts, and we should think about their real feelings which are hidden but you can still see them, and for this reason work your own mind, try to find them, to understand the impressions that are made by humans. , And it does not empty at the bottom - the actors certainly hold some internal states correct in their character. It is near real life where you do not know a person that most of you do not fully understand and it surrounds us and puts us in front of our own feelings and preferences. <br /> <br /> The most important thing for me is to know about this simple, almost flat story after your own life, your own dreams and acquaintances, later on your thoughts, whether there is one or we have caught regularly and delighted, at 100% Or just dreaming about it, we can do more and if we want to move somewhere, rather than letting ourselves and others "I will do this one day" stories instead of I do not want to rhythm - if the finger does not really happen, or "I am where I am, there" is actually easy to change habits changed? At least this impression has left me and it was very timely for me, which makes me realize this famous film from a distance. I definitely recommend someone who loves meaningful movies for the heart but those who need the event and activities should stay away from them.
