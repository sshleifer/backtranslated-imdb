I love this show. I hate before the end of the season because it feels good before it starts again! I followed this program from this pilot, then started from college where all the birds ran away and their sister K.C. saw the wings with her now. This show can not wait until Monday night! I am also very happy that Cappa and KC finally came back together that made me crazy !!! As Ivan and Rebecca, I hope they will come back together, which they think will eventually end. I was just looking at Cast's main part and I was so disappointed that KC Cartite (Spencer Grammar) daughter of Chris Grammer !!! Which makes me so amazed and another big argument that she was born in the year of my birth and I was born on the birth day of my birth, and I did not see any source in her whole time!
