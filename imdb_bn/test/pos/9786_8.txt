Milo is an adopter and underrated horror from the late 90s, but the feeling and atmosphere of the storm of 80 is even more. It looks like a group of small girls, "doctor" Milo's father, a doctor in the office of a gynecologist, and Milo with a Milo (yes, a gynecologist and some other ...) as a reward for seeing what's in the zeros. Hmm, his first patient and he lost him. Now Milo is a weird little boy who always wear a yellow rain slicker, rain or bright, and he's funny .... But that's not all about his kinky. These girls go ahead faster for adults and one for them is planning marriage but tragedy strikes and a girl from outside the city likes to replace her friend instead of school teacher. He does And then the strange thing started to happen again. Of course a rain slicker which involved this small kid. It's not too violent or graphic, but it's a unique verb that you can not find on many modern horror flicks and it's good to see. One wonders why it is so difficult to find a good horrific flyover this day and age. But it is one that is criminally overlooked and your time must certainly be valued when checking. 10 out 8
