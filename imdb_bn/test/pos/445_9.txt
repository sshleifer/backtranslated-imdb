This film works a lot in different dimensions. This is a very nice couple, a social commentary on old age and nursing homes, a love story, a musical instrument. I saw Uncle Frank several times, and every time I saw it, I'm not sure who would call the first - I lost contact with my parents, my wife, a friend. . But it's a way to remember the most important relationships in your life - and want to repeat the continuation. Many sunny hopes, and probably some tears if there is any sound of vibrant characters hit here. I'm sure they will be.
