Scandinavians are pretty good to laugh about the atrocities of my life. <br /> <br /> Here, film production is incredibly impressive, every piece of framing, every piece of paper, palette of colors, hoods of each muzak snippet or street cleaner was there to increase the emptiness of the world's peace. <br /> <br /> In fact, I thought that my sense of vacuum was found in his absurdity, it was not really funny and related. When Andres tells his boss that he misses the children and sees that the man is smiling and halfway away from the door, the sad but true reflection of working with the people, spend 7/8 hours with them, to see more people than you love, but Finally they do not give an enemy about your troubles deeply and you are the same. <br /> <br /> It could be a film Coens they were born in Oslo and Minnesota. I think their humor is more aggressive and the film is more covered in the past but they have the same technique and their movies have the same intrinsic sense that the life is quite inconsistent. <br /> <br /> I'll stop before. Talk to yourself in taking a bus to the Wintry Desert.
