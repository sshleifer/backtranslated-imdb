This year I saw one of the best movies. I took me to a new time and place. It seemed as if I was there with many trials and triumph over judgment. Jamie transforms himself into Fox. During the film, he was Ray. Also, Kerry Washington, Sharon Robinson and Regina King were fantastic. The movie was well cast and directed, the music was superb. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie four (4) times with the different people and last time it was enjoyable. I would buy the DVD as soon as it released. This is a movie which will be seen over the years. <br /> <br /> Thank you for a great experience.
