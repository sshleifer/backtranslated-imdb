Dr. Da Vinci Code is us. Introducing Robert Langdon and his craft to solve puzzles, Angels and Demons show an old puzzle by providing a huge puzzle with an 8-hour limit. <br /> <br /> Award winning actor, Ron Howard has done a good job of managing a story that is easy to follow and easy to take. The Da Vinci code has put a lot of angle around you in such a short time that a quick bathroom break will make you somewhat confused. I did not feel this feeling with Angels and Demons, this plot was straight ahead and the work retained its level of interest. <br /> <br /> Cardinal Strauss (Arman Fair-Stahl) was my favorite character in the film. Catholic Church's status, Catherinejo Patrick McKagan (Ivan McGregor) was very good in his role and was associated with him, yet you would choose the parties in the role yourself. Tom Hans does not have plenty of time because the film focuses more on the story than the character's development, and it was good with me that my first movie was well known. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I Il Jura's character, Vithoria Vetra, could be unnecessary female assistant in the discovery, because her line was a bit limited and it seemed to be later. He initially played a somewhat important role, but he soon chased forward to become Langdon's "familiar" partner. <br /> <br /> The plot is an organization that has sought to retaliate in the past with an improper Catholic Church (several of them) in a most artistic manner. Some men in the church are abducted and the execution is executed at certain times until the church itself is a final end. Dr. Robert London is impressive and Tims has been brought to help discover the related issues with the beautiful Basilia Vetra, who saw a colleague dies in the hands of the enemies of the church. <br /> <br /> Music is relevant and beautiful to painters, I could chime about these menial things but what Angels and Demons absolutely works is the conclusion to conclude it. It was a wonderful surprise when I saw a movie at the end and I was amazed at how I was a defender when it hit me. Like anybody else I appreciate a great wrap up and this movie wraps it quite tightly and it drops a fantastic bow. <br /> <br /> This movie will blame your Catholic principles if you are religious and uncertain. I can say that the Davencius code portrays Catholicism as a disguised disguised group, Angels and Demons portrayed them with many lighter brushes. The good men in the church are those who are suffering for the sins of evil and confusing men who are shown as a collective and even few who have infiltrated their modern rank.
