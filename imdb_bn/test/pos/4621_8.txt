Yes, 2:37 In some ways, a rope off from Gus van Santos Elephant. This is the cause of suicide among some students who are facing their problems. Yes, it is full of clich√©s, but that life. You can not deny only those vague men, disabled people or popular students, despite their popularity, there are problems in the real world. <br /> <br /> But that's not all, what is this movie? It's not about high school life. This is not about the suffering of life. <br /> <br /> If you look beneath the surface, what is shown under soap-social relationships will face some secret, thought-provoking criticism of our society. <<br>> <br /> Why are people committing suicide? Do we really understand their motive? Or we just realized, after that it was too late? And why is it always someone, would not you expect it to be? <br /> <br /> This movie does not answer this question, but it raises. And it does so in a very acute way. The way it guides you, whose blood it can be, which you see in the very first time. You are following the way of some students, everyone has less or less good reasons for ending their life, only to be forced to see the terrible thing at the end. <br /> <br /> Do you know who it is? Will be Or were you caught by surprise, like real life? <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < We are always so specific at our own problems, we forget those others who forget. Someone may be a colleague, a friend who does not want to live anymore. But, if you do not open your eyes, you will never know it until late. <br /> <br /> This movie is well supplied. It may have some errors, but when it's over, they do not matter anymore. You see the reflection of society, or you are blind to reality.
