The bridge play about a reporter explores some of the security warnings taken at the nuclear power plant and runs a beautifully interesting movie from the end of the 70's. It's not surprising, but it's strong, well played, especially Jack Lemon, but Douglas and Fonda were good. It was an excellent good screenplay and the direction of the bridge was difficult and suitable. This is certainly not one of the best movies of 70, but it's even better. Its the first episode of Michael Douglas and Lemman .--- IMDb rating: 7.2, My rating: So simple, strong but not extraordinary ... This picture is tough, but not awesome 8/10
