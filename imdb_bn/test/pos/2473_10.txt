I can not believe this one missed. Created in a budget that was created in the 1970s, you will probably be able to create an indescribable episode of a TV soap, it is intense, like 90 minutes of knife making film. You will find outlines, plots, etc. elsewhere on this site. But consider that the whole thing was shot using a single handheld, 16mm camera ... all the conversations have been corrected ... no actor has appeared before the camera is in front ... it sounds like a recipe for disaster. Instead, what we find is that Hippies V. Police are running in the desert of California, which has happened in 'which is not fair'. I'm on behalf of that person. The only problem is, the director forces you to change your loyalty and by the end of 90 minutes we are still not sure who is there. Bright ... pretty bright.
