This is one of the best days of the doctor. We have cyberman, cyber transformation unit (small children may be scared) and the doctor is one of his outstanding works. Bravo David Tenant Good view as it was a movie, some exciting scenes on the streets, attack on cyberman's base, and originally kept the 45-minute movie separate from us. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Cybermen, this will not be disappointing. With a final build up it is a final one. <br /> <br /> The doctor must also be careful with young children watching this, a war of death is an evil enemy (Daleks, Cyberman, Master, Sontarans, Davros, Otone, even MACR).
