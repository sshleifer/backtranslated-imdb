I had the pleasure of meeting these two chairs (which of these?) At the Atlantic Film Festival, which was interesting because he laugh at us much differently than the rest of us. <br /> <br /> This movie is about three teenage girls who provide enormous energy for sleeping with the 30-year-old man in the last summer of their youth, despite many protests. <br /> This must be a clock value , But the humor has created a completely different demographic (Girl 18-25) than the person I'm living in, so instead of laughing the character's anti Se was shaking my head. Despite this, the story makes it very entertaining for the sake of making it so laughably strong enough.
