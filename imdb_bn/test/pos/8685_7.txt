Allergen 4 comments that Mr. Paget's "exaggerated dance (this movie) is the most loving in the history of the film." Of course, a very big DG. Even Debra Patgate does not have the biggest boyfriend dance. The nude singers near Fridge Lang's "The Indian Grave" make this template perfect template. Dancing is the most erotic in history. Well! Where do I start? Salma hayak acting as Santanio Pandamanium in "Dasak to Dawn" (1996); Jamie Lee Curtis "True Lilies" (1994); Jessica Alla in "Sina City" (2005); Rose McGowan of "Terra Planet" (2007); Shila Kelly "Blue Eagana A Dance" (2000), Baha, Baha, Baha <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not make me wrong. I love the sequence and included it in my "Cheesecake Dance" series on YouTube. I think a claim like "the most lover in film history" is really going out of a very fragile limb.
