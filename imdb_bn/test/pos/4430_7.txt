I hired this picture because it was a documentary and highly rated. It is also a research paper that is trying to find out what his biological father wanted for architecture. Except for anything else, the underlying theme of this movie is that we have a bright, highly acclaimed, potentially gifted architect who has little respect for anyone outside or outside. <br /> <br /> He is a broken family tragedy. There was more like a foster devotee than her surviving children, which could only have negative consequences on children. She said, Nathaniel, the film's maker and the son of Lui Khan came across, is fairly stable and weird, if not bitter. Louis Khan was more interested in his interview than the personal problems of his family, but I saw the mix of themes make the image interesting. <br /> <br /> I think their opinion of the art for her home - artistic, non-practical, and generally appreciated by so-called critics.
