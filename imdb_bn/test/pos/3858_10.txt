Aristorcats is a sunny film that many people have not seen. It's obviously not that many reasons it's just got 6.8. There is nothing wrong with this. This is my favorite Disney classic, which has already made a lot of fantastic movies. Beauty and animals, like Snow White, and Peter Pan. Why is Aristarchat so high on my list because the movie is so funny I hate to say it, but I do not blame Edgar for what he did. I'll probably take care of them I will destroy some old bags that I worked for so many years, decided to give their wish to the cats only. I also killed them. I do not like cats, so I do not blame. I think Aristorcats are so funny and cute. There are many ridiculous characters like AdGraw. Aristarchat Disney is my favorite of Disney, and it's the ultimate. The cat is out of cats. <br /> <br /> Aristarchus: **** / ****
