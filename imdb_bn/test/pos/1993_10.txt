Who would see this picture? Whoever accepts Acid, Philip K. Dick reads, he thinks the basis of the matrix was better than the special effects, the interest of philosophy, or his interest in the feeling of reality. I laughed loudly in this picture, that is so unheard of and so spot-on. This picture is great. This photo is cool. Compared to the matrix it is a long shot (I do not sleep in Existenz, for a kick off: action / special effects films stupid me, and a valid philosophical gloss, matrix exactly what). Existenz is gross, it's annoying, and it's fun. David Craneberg has done some of the cone stuff (Robid) and Genius (another way of verifying the videodrome, such as the Stephen King adaptation dead zone). But this is my favorite one all the time. I can not remember the last - which is a good thing, that means I can see it again. Or maybe I have never seen this picture. Perhaps it is a replacement memory. Or maybe it really happened to 'my'. I do not know. At any rate, it is now completely hidden in my overall illusion, and I'm happy.
