Since 1941, what I like about this feature-length animated film is the best feeling in the early 1940's. It's music, clothing, automobile, day-link building etc. You feel that you have returned on time. <br /> <br /> Here we have seen some reviews that it was difficult -Loc film was released a few days before Pearl Harbor attack. Wow, incidentally and frustrating days, nobody will be interested in going to movies for a feature-length cartoon, I'm sure. Very bad, because people have missed some nice animations almost 70 years ago have really been affected. The colors are beautiful, the drawings are good and the story is associated with bugs managed by Hoppati and her beautiful girl "Honey" and it is involved in making losses on the way-after-and-after-happiness. Not all of them find a grasshopper that they can live and worried about their trumpling. <br /> <br /> There is a nasty villain - "C Bagli Beatle" - and its two cows. Those helpers ("swat, the fly" and "smack, the mosque") are comedians, complete with their Brooklyn-ese accents! The story is a familiar one where a nasty elderly person wants to marry sweet little things and uses unreasonable ways to strengthen his hand. The good man, in the meantime, has stacked against him, but very end, certainly prevails. My favorite part - This is worse than what - The good guy "Happi" has temporarily got electrocute and he is dancing in black and white. That was the nice animation! <br /> <br /> You know, this is a good thing that I did not see as a very young child; I was scared to play outside and these beautiful bugs-people squash! You do not know the grass that is under your feet (or who)!
