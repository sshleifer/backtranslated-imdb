I do not see the basement to be very good, it does not find the film with some great characters. It is about a young mental nurse named Nurse Charlotte BL (Rosie Holotik), who is going to start an isolated mental asylum. There he was different with different types of character. Geraldine Masters, who is in charge of the shelter after the hospital owner. Dr. Stephens killed one of the patients with a dead body. My favorite character in the film is Mrs. Challenging (Reach McAdams), a very funny little lady, Alison who is a nicophomanic, and Sam (Bill McGee) is a young black man who wanders all day long. Its a world of its own all the time. The film was a very low budget film but was still a really great film. I know that it was on the 'Video Nostes' list in the 80's, but it does not seem that it was so poor, it was a bit annoying sense of allotope, it's a great picture recommend !!!
