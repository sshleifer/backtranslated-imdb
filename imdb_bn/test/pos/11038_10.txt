This World War II Popeye Cartoon had a great view of it and it was fairly average for its artwork. It has been gripped very nicely, some great angles, good detail and ... well, lots of interesting sights. <br /> <br /> In his little boat there is a pop near the sea and in a small Japanese boat running accidentally, it is with two boys. (Incidentally, why "Japs" were always impressed with stars, round glasses and teeth teeth?). <br /> <br /> However, this harmful Japanese sailor Popeye would like to sign a peace deal. Oh, boy, globilize Pope, "Admiral will wait until you see this!" Among the scenes of that great artwork, I was pointing to the above, we slowly see that the small Japanese ships are really great destroyers ... and Popeye deep. "Why, you're doubling J-Pensis!", Crying out to our silner man. <br /> <br /> How he comes out of the situation is fun.
