I never knew that the TV stations started before they liked handsome men like their journalists - despite the male's IQ - but when it came out "Broadcast News" it was clearly a problem and the film is a good job to really look it up. The film does not interfere with the intelligent but nervous reporter Haroon Altman (Albert Brooks) and the producer Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), the son of boyfriend Air Head Reporter Tom Grunique (William Hart), a love triangle. Perhaps the best line in the movie when Tom Tom said something like this: "I really do not understand what I'm reporting." And in the era of Fox News and like these things, a movie like this has become more important. <br /> <br /> I certainly recommend to all. Also playing the supporting role as an anchorman played in Composition Prosky, Lois Chiles, Joan Cusack, and Jack Nicklson.
