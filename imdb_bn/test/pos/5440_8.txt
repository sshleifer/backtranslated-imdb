This movie is a fun story about corruption in the entire American system. Those who do not vote, their voting relationships prove proven in machines that the Kamblian ends up voting in the Oval Office. Politicians are such a joke that we need almost a single angle to represent, because we have been smiling all over the world. Buschum has become the way of life for Americans and soon after leaving office, the only thing left is to remain. Strangely the only person of honesty is someone who is not even elected to the position and ultimately tells the truth. The story is very fine and if you go to laugh then it's not happening. Many pages for thought. Overall I enjoyed it.
