The sharker machine was found by Bart Reynolds as a narcotic police, who had failed in a purchase and sack which was not his fault, but some people were killed, he himself had been booked in a vice-squad in Atlanta. <br /> <br /> As hard as the beat beat, but it has its fringe advantage. One night after a roundup of working women, where a book is in their hands, the boys ask for surveillance in place of Rachel Ward. He is an expensive item, serving both the notorious Mobster Vittorio Gassman and Law and Order's proud voter candidate Earl Holman. <br /> <br /> Their surveillance even records a murder and the rest is with the sharks and their new colleagues <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! It was originally known that Clint Eastwood was given the image. <br /> <br /> Look for some good performances by fellow Vice-copier Barney KC and Brian Keith and by Henry Silva, Gusman's crayon brother who works dirty loves the organization and his work. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie, a mixture of the Witch Harry and Laura. Why Laura? You will see the shark machine for that reply.
