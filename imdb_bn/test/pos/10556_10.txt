This is what a great movie. I found it to be a teenage girl's single father full of joyful unexpected pain. And it is well set to a tropical island paradise'as. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieux shows his special European map in this story about a divorced girl's divorced father. They have a holiday together and she started adding excitement to the island in many unexpected ways. But you will see this movie for yourself to see the ridiculous situations they have found for yourself. <br /> <br /> There are some classical classics that all teenagers will see. This movie should be added to the list. Along with Dirty Dancing, Feris Beller's Day Off, Bill's Teddy's Great Adventure Tours, Rocky Harr Picture Show and Anime House, My Father's Hero needs a film studio. See it as you were a teenage girl and you will be rolling with smiles. Check it out with your teenage daughter and laugh for a few months.
