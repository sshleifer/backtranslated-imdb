Its primary basis is based on American Civil War but it is ultimately a love story. We start at the beginning of the war where the main characters (Kidman and Law) are conscious of each other and have a clear attraction, they leave a fight to fight if they have a passionate kiss. For the role of the main boxer's character in this film, Kidman's return to his struggle and his struggle to survive until his struggle is over. The failure to convince it is because of the war character, we do not see enough of this relationship before the war - it is hard to believe that 2 people were so interested in each other that they had so little contact. All the other fine is fine, Renee Zellweger and his senior parents and his entourage are lovely additions as threat to the gang pursuing the desert. Make sure it's a long film but it's great to keep interest and cinematography. It's not a fair effort but it's worth a watch but worth a lot.
