It has been recorded that John Ford created the "big, blockbuster" movie so that he loved "small" movies so much that he loved it so much. Wagon Master with young young Ben Johnson does not have the best of his small films, but definitely his best. Location shooting, wagon, complex work with horses, and Indian involvement in plain land All the trade marks in Ford. Like many of his other films, Eisenstein, this film has great Russian-influenced effects. Supporters including Ward Bond, Russell Simpson and Jane Darewell cast cast nice and along with many minor characters, including Ford, in which his brother (plays drums). Ben Johnson went on to achieve extraordinary qualifications for The Last Picture Show, his co-star, Harry Carey, Junior Oscar. That height has not reached. Although his father Carey, Sir Ford's first film, Kerry, Jr. became a leading Western leader, most of her role in supporting career. For the fans of John Ford, and for Western film fans, this is a must.
