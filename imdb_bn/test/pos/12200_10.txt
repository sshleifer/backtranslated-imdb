Surface TV was one of the few truly unique show of last season. I can honestly say that I am correcting my schedule so that I can see every episode. Tons of work, mystery, science fiction, etc. <br /> <br /> The story was a boy who found an egg surrounded by a sea creature. The same sea creature saw the brother of the main character and the female character (the ocean). Most people think it was a deadly killer device but one of the raids raised by the eggs was very friendly. <br /> <br /> Only NBC has terminated the problem, so now we will never know ... hopefully it will be sorted by cypher or some other channels.
