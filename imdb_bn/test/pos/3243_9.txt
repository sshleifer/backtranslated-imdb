This film is not my bug, but overall it's a great watch. Brian Brown is nice when I do not like him but his whole gang is a great job. Jimmy is a proudly wannabe gangster who does not think a thing is right (Speaker: pondo money, ackos car and bumbles around a bank robbery) but still comes to the top. <br /> <br /> The two know what it was at the beginning of the kids but they are nicely related to some stories together. <br /> <br /> All the beautiful pieces in the Australian movie 9/10
