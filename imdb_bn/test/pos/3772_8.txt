So this is not an award winner, so what? Have you ever wanted to see a movie that was simply silly? "Villain" and this list may be at the top. My husband says that "Jackie and Hyde Tuggetner Ajen" is one of those movies that "if you are there and do this," you would think this fool at the cocaine of 80. Culture is a riot I think the whole film is just fun. Nothing is sacred; Hospitals, Plastic Surgery, Howard Hughes .... There are ongoing gags that you have to watch for praise. Not to say that this book can not be followed, but in reality, many well-meaning movies are also taken to freedom. I recommend this movie to the old "Stoners" among us. We can be more efficient now, but we can still recognize and laugh many people (many?) In the old days.
