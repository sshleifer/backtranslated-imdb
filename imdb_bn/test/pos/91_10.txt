NFBC honored the film in honor of the Canadian Dynasty in Montreal, the 50's, 60's and 70's. My fifth grade teacher played it in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and in 1986 I was able to celebrate my return even from the serious mouth injuries. I am a Canadian fan of 29 years of 30 years of age. On 1-10 scale, I give this picture 117. All hockey fans should see it because I hope it will be held in the hockey hall of fame in Toronto and will be shown at the Bell Center in Montreal or at Rexal A Edmonton. Place. See this picture with your family. This is a great movie. I recommend both books in French and English To go to the hubs.
