One of my favorite non-MGM music, it's a classic!> Rita is the best form of hair, leaps her beauty out of the screen. Gene Kelly showed her dance skills and introduced her lively and innovative danceography to the musician, which will eventually change the musicals as a corograph. Phil Silvars is the perfect second art, and Eve Arden inspired the film with injection of many classes. <br /> <br /> The structure is so dramatic that why it should be thought, in this era where major broadway shows have not been adapted to the movie, Cover Girl Theater.
