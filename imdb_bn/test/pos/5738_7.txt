A group of thirteen-year-olds decided to take a free school where their 27 years ago, took part in a horrific genocide party. Unfortunately, the person responsible for killing them is still hiding the hazards of the schools condemned and they are not happy with their presence. <br /> <br /> This image is not like the most modern tin slash. It's a lot darker, a lot more suspicious, an angry murderer, and I like it. From the point of view of film making, it is not great. Acting down the average. The authors were quite bad and some of the revelations of American films were randomly blurred, there were some stories that did not understand (like ... "Have you seen Scrum 3?", A girl asks, yes, I have, and by the old school's door. There is nothing to walk about, so it is not related to this movie). But, hey, it's a slasher flick, those funny parts. Also, the underwriting of characters in this movie was widely displayed. There were six main characters (including the Security Guard) and, to be honest, only three or four are really used. Two letters (Token black guy and any other girl who was not important enough to get the label) very rarely said: Among them, I'll estimate a total of five or six lines. Also, girls (one after the other) were not well enough to separate from each other. They could have repeatedly replaced each girl in the film and I could not see the difference. However, pacing, good work starts from the beginning and rarely gets closed. The atmosphere is well-used and the direction shows some really cool moments. . . Although, the overall look is a little cheap-looking, which I guess is, low-grade camera equipment (and activities). The end, even though the idea that I was going to take, I liked it very roughly. It felt without explanation and felt enough to make it effective. They spend a lot of time running for a search, they can spend a little time in concluding that it was not thrown at a random event for a perfect reason. Modern are infected with horror films). However, ignoring some annoying things and trying to focus on the first 98% of the film instead of finishing, it is actually a good modern slash, which should be examined, especially if you become Spanish and / or a fan, the atmosphere is awful. <br /> <br /> Obligatory slash material: <br /> <br /> - Violence / Gore: Blood and gore is a good bit, done factually, but not buckets. Violence is not very good, not excessive, but rather brutal at points. <br /> <br /> - Sex / Nudity: A little bit, and with the hottest girl in the film <br /> <br /> - Cool killer: Well, It seems, but this guy is quite mischievous. His vague smile was frustrating. <br /> <br /> - Terror / suspicion: The sensation is at the top. . . Very good, very good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Boys and half women are reluctant <br /> <br /> - Classic quotes of the film: 'multiple trophies.' <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 7/10. Maybe it might expand, but fans of session 9 only want to test it for the same voice and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
