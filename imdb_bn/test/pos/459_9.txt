"Journey" is a romantic version of the cold war. She is trying to steal her former love, an English woman (Deborah Care), Hungarian scientist (Jason Roberts, Jr.), in Hungary during the Hungarian Revolution in 1956. He is trying out 13 other international people who are trying to get out of Hungary via a Austrian border on a bus. <br /> <br /> Of course, the bus stopped for Russian security checks. Russian Officer Incharge (Eul Brenner) was attracted to the English woman (Dobo's Care) and delayed the visit. Of course, a Russian official knows about the truth as a British citizen as a British scientist, but he decides to arrest the scientist because he is waiting for an English lady to come. Of course, this sounds all weird, but it's a fun movie to watch. Despite the romantic flow of dialogue between Mr. Brenner and Miss Care, they seem to be inappropriate in the situation, the film has become respectable and attractive. Some overrides of good acting shameless dialogue Perhaps, some people involved in the Hungarian rebellion will not appreciate this film; They will consider it a piece of fluff. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite Yule Brenner role. He speaks with his own, virtual voice and is very interesting, especially when he becomes weak. After the creation of "The King and Eye" in 1955, he collaborated with Dobo Kerr for the second time with Eul Brenner. They create a very attractive couple. Very bad they did not work again. This second sexy role was Miss Kerr "From here on eternity". Miss Kerr was wearing heavy winter clothing throughout the movie, yet, she was very nice and passionate. <br /> <br /> In his first film, Jason Roberts was led by Junior the Fine Supporting Cast. Some examples of international cast were recognized, for example, Robert Morley of England However, the rest of the actors, I have never seen before or after, the movies were just great. In the background, it was interesting to speak Hungarian lines as a girlfriend to see Santa Barger. A few years later, in 1966 he was in a film, "Cast A Giant Shadow", with his bride Brunner as his main female. She is still working.
