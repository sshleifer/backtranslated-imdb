I was totally amazed how good this film really is, because when I first saw it, I was very gently pleased! But I must say that I'm still very disappointed that Donald O'Connor has not given a bigger and better role! She was an enormous talent. <br /> <br /> There is a great chemistry among all the main cast members and Matouos were never funny. <br /> <br /> I am so glad that I made this picture, we are going to meet Lemon and Matthew team for the last time; Great use keeps their talents in a vehicle that keeps them in. Brent spinner proves that "data" from Star Trek is not his only good character, which he can play. <br /> <br /> The story is really quite simple but comedy and characters really works well and I laugh freely throughout this movie and I highly recommend it.
