Thora Birch paraphrase: "I like this movie. It's just the opposite of what I hate in a movie." <br /> <br /> This unclear movie was intelligent for very original and intelligent release, opportunities for any success would require a costly promotional campaign. And nothing is spectacular where an age story is coming - where instead of focusing on character development, there is a limited target audience. Has anyone heard a mature teen movie? <br /> <br /> But if you have the opportunity to watch it or if you can take part in the DVD for a DVD, you can make it even worse. "My teacher's wife" is not a revolutionary, but there has been a lot of work for it and it's going well for repeating. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Jason London He is assisted by exceptional work from throwing his supporter. Todd's calculus teacher and love interest as a title in the title role of Tia Carr√© (he can act). Christopher McDonald as a excellent self-parodying performance teacher Jake sense and Alexandra Lee Todd's best friend and Jeffrey Taber as his father. <br /> <br /> Anyone has commented before, because it is a "mature" teen movie because romantic relationships fail publicly - at least by the traditional blessed lasting value. Even Tod's parents are indifferent to each other, his title character and his mother (Leslie Lilies) on her screen screen on its literal screen (a device that provides comedy relief with each successive appearance). London-carrot romance has unexpected kisses and is much more reliable than you can find any old woman's story. <br /> <br /> But the real power of the movie is the relationship of the three buddies to build. There is no exaggerated melodrama here, only three people who are examined on each other and alternate between faith, subject to all the dynamics that three young people can bring. They actually manage to close a "credible" three-person relationship, perhaps the first in the history of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do you know again? I'm just a child.
