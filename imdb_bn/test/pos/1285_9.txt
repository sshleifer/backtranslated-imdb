It has been seen in the DVD three times - once in a while, once in a sequence, (in the beginning of Noor, at the beginning, in the middle and end of the story), and once the director's commentary is going on. Pretty nice The story of a bare bone, the most big budget overblown features being released from today, called with more flash, strength and substance. <br /> <br /> I think this is a more successful film than the next Memento, which has turned me into the first place. In the next film in insomniac, you can not wait to see what he will do with a big budget (and big box-officer bigger).
