When this show came to the first wind, I saw it once or twice, and thought it was another "fatty, skinny wife" show that began to fill the networks. It's "OK" on the primary philosophy and I did not see it again; However, once it was released syndication once, I used to take several episodes (only because it was twice at night), and I'm telling you, the more you see this show, the more fun it is. Once you see how great supporter characters are connected, this show laughs loudly to you. I see each new episode is more creative than ever before - they will only see it a few times, they will not notice it. The lines of writing and story lines are much more sophisticated than the first ones (it is far from "Jim's"). Above all, Kevin James is violent, incredibly charming, and a talented comedic actor, cast supporter. Leh Remine has enjoyed excellent time, and one of the interesting characters of the Paton Oswald Spence show. And of course, Jerry is as brilliant as Styler Arthur. I was surprised to read the comment I was the worst part of the show - this show is so great why its a huge part - this ridiculous plan (going out of the crazy father's character) is a smile on her delivery And yelling - the best part when they labeled him as a child "Lemon Is !!" Looks like screaming. The episode, in which she got her to a doctor to get her medicines (for less pressure on Doug), guest star Willam Hart decides that Arthur has never been legal because he decides. The last part of the episode seems to be funny, as it is the tip of the therapy that strikes his childhood soul, it is one of the most creative scenes seen in a sitcom. It seems strange to protect the show, because it is very intrinsically - even though "friends" were sometimes fun and "Raymond" has some great episodes and characters, both of them lack the creative touch of "Queens King". In most of the ages, in most of the season, there are curious jokes, and throughout the medieval period, "Queen of Kings" raises the stroke of sitakam and shows the real anecdotal talent. Critics of this show certainly do not find it - or have not seen enough show to show it, because with real humorous and creative sensitivity, anyone has to laugh loudly while watching. It is the other two favorites in my ridiculous tone, "Seinfeld" and "The Office" with equal course of course. It's Arthur, Cramer's, and Michael Scott of TV, who keeps our watch and laughs aloud
