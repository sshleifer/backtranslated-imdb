This DVD will be treated indifferently by the festivals of classic rock music fans around the world because the rush is not right. It is a shame that most of North American and British music journalists have missed the opportunity to enter their original band, because most of North American and British music journalists have to remove frustration. In the past four decades each good representation is here and the song is a catalog! Our "2112" term with high power, custom-challenging pieces, magical "trees" and songwriter "Tom Swar" is from our recent album "Vapor Trills". The music style is almost flawless, the stage shows are spectacular, and Brazilian fans simply sing soft ladders (at one point they can sing with a device!) Each band member plays at a level that refuses to perform the art of artistic craftsmanship. If you suspect try this machine for the size of "La Villa Strangyatou" or "Size Method" - and yes after a drum alone (which can be trusted). <br /> <br /> Sound and vision production prices are so much more enjoyable to experience the rush and you can also boot a documentary and multi-angle set piece. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful performance and tribute to Canadian rockbars and all the classic classic rock fans. A copy of its own.
