A great movie After the ad was more good movie. And believe it was not very inspirational. I really believe that anybody who comes out of the film at the end will inspire one way or the other. <br /> <br /> It was very small at the beginning, but quickly got up early. I laughed I smile some part very hard. Actually above average, nothing special, but average then average. I can safely say that this was the second funny movie to be released this summer (the first best Clerk 2). So after all that it is a 7/10 (a high seven, but a total of eight).
