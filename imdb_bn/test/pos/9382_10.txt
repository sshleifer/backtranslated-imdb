"Death bed: bid it's watson" is like being awake to hospital, two days of suicide <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, but weird stimulus. Some of these annoying but often humorous lessons of this municipality, morality and supernatural doctrine are similar to the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Literary genius is closely related to dark adult fairy tales - Writer Angela Carter, a short annoying story of Unico <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jarna or ETA. Hoffman <br /> <br /> <br /> There are many recognizable elements of the past, but it shows a completely unique and original storyline. <br /> <br /> As a story, the dead Bad is an amazingly easy yet original <br /> <br />, will be directed to complete only one thousand free releases. This overwhelming film has its technical flaws but has lifted all of them through a cast of beautiful non-actors <br /> <br /> and lost the strange position - a truly independent 1970's classic. <br /> <br /> Death Bad is also a unique, isolated, 3-dimensional personality - shows a deep and continuous stratification of dream images and ideas that it lends to the framework of building a "fun-house". Flashbacks and historical times during times of interrupted times, its terrible black humorous bed, rich but still symbolic symbols used in its illustrations The most entertaining, emotional heartbeat image, the screenplay artist, has been trapped inside the frame of his own image forever and is loving with the "gifts" of the murdered victim as a gift of love by the soul of a tragic bed. - Unhealthy response to "artists trapped" and surprising material / metaphor - POE or malarama is not surprising, but it is the same. <br /> <br /> Anyone who evaluates the soul of an independent movie and longs for multiple levels of symbolic experience, or "deceiver <br /> <br />" seeks the supernatural concept of beauty, and Gothic-awful blurred low budget absorption film This completely unique vision made will be excavated. A simple and fun film with delicious deep emotional undercurrents. Highly recommended. *****
