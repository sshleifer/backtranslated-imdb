While I was actually portraying this film, I was 13-year-old camping near the McClowd River near the bus. For the afternoon, the campusite was released to my family, when they heard the Vincent river fluttering. Little Tuvia ... the fact that they dragged him, he actually started floating beneath the river. And if the stunt guy can make a net, then 20 pounds of water falls down around 1/4 miles. <br /> <br /> Anyway ... I saw it at the time, but I did not get it. After a few years I saw the movie and actually understood its meaning. It is quite a powerful film and certainly a fine work by John at this young age. His movie career really took off as expected, but of course he got success on TV later. I want to see it again because I was available in this movie.
