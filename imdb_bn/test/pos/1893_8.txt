I was fortunate enough to have a midnight screening on this movie tonight. I would say, I was expecting an awesome movie with bad acting and a mediator plot. I was totally wrong. This movie was not simply incredibly entertaining, but I love everything about it easily. Bruce Campbell was amazing as before. The biggest surprise is none other than Ted Raymy, Sam's younger brother. He played the maximum amount of crazy doctor henchman. Somewhere in physical comedy and clever dialogue, he did nothing but shine. But I can not really ignore the magic that Bruce Campbell did. Although I think Ted Raimi has stolen this show, but Bruce did what he did on the big screen. Sketchy Nadly American businessman and sad victim, somewhere he showed the same power that he always showed incredibly attractive to viewers. The film often hinders praise from viewers. The crowd was clearly excited with every small celebration of the crowd. <br /> <br /> This movie could not be the Oscar ingredient, but to my good, it was amazing. I would highly recommend this to the Bruce Campbell Fan. Also, anyone who likes the cam-sci fi movie, please do yourself a favor and see this. It can not wait to come out of the DVD. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
