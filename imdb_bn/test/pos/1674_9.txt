What is involved in robbery is one of the best movies in the world. Then the robbery itself, a silent, thirty-minute nail-bitter that has never been overcome, then perhaps the most spoken example of the disrespect of thieves in the thieves, which apparently begins to manifest, and to us, the unknowns are the greatest allest movie <br /> <br /> It was first seen in 1955 when it was a difficult and uncertain film and it is as difficult and impossible as it is today. (This shows some terrific cruelty of Dusin's previous "Brute Force"). There is not a flabby moment or duff performance in the whole movie, and one of the most thrifty closing sequences among the Diesin CD clubs is the Milius and Parisian back streets, and no one else is in Paris with the final drive removed by mortal people. No movie A classic.
