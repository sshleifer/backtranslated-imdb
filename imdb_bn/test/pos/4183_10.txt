This movie is similar to most of the songs, it is not included by a casual observer or unknown It's awesome and, in many ways, before its time. <br /> <br /> The picture is funny, annoying and rarely compelling. <br /> <br /> The song is amazing. <br /> <br /> This unfortunately is not the word "candy pop". Search and rebellion band words <br /> <br /> The head alone should keep Maki Rock and Roll Hall Off Fame. <br /> <br /> Someone will tell me why these guys are not there?
