"Haile the Umman" is one of the most important films of my life. I have seen twice in the day and kept looking in my eyes. <br /> <br /> The composition of this silent film is very much visible to viewers; Unfortunately the only surviving print has been scratched so badly that most people will not see all the way through it and they will miss the burning Monkey below the rough. This image can use a digital recovery to help bring its beauty, but I suspect it will be available from anyone else, because its main theme is the spiritual restoration of the family unit in front of Christ and these days are not politically correct. But it is a powerful theme for those who have been hurt by their heart-broken family relations. <br /> <br /> Cast is nice, especially Florence Weidar, who literally flashes like Judith; As an ancestral master, Belamie nan, a poor girl who gets pregnant and is thrown aside; Theodore Roberts Crutch is like an old dominating father who, through pride, destroys all around him; And the handsome Lloyd Hughes, such as David David, was afraid of his father, but he really had his own life. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie especially for Christmas viewing. Do not apologize for being patient and you can see it completely despite its disaster.
