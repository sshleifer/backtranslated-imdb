Halloween: Curse of Michael Maywers is probably the best sequel to Halloween Flickr. Jamie, the serial killer Michael Maire's niece, gives birth to a child from Man in Black at the end of Halloween 5. A kind of nurse helps Jamie escaped, but mothers quickly hold him and kill him. Jummy's baby was found and rescued, Tommy Doyle, one of the children of the original film, Jimmy Lee Babyset, and mothers reached Haidfield and started to stop living in the old house of the Strong Dynasty. The film is Michael's temple, Man-in-Black identity and complete Dr. Lumis / Michael reveals the myths of Michael Maire's storyline. I highly recommend this brilliant masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Michael: The Curse of Michael Mayr's Strong Graphic Violent, Rated for Short Grief, Short Sex, Language and Short Nudity
