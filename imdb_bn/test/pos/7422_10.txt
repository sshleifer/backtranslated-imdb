Terry and June, in my mind, with the great Seed James and late Diana Kupland, this room is blessed with the best of all time, but Terry Scott will miss the sadness even after he died in 1994. I have all of the press up to the DVD and I'm looking forward to getting all 9, will also be nice to watch the DVD "Happy After" <br /> <br /> June Whitefield is still strong and Terry Scott always keeps my memory <br /> <br / > Terry Scott Rip is not a lot of comedy today, I can think that the legend will be on the list and yes middle-bits are in some people's widescreen but I do not think I think it's something to celebrate. Terry Scott's life will be shining
