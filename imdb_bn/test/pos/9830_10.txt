Random Heart is a very well-directed, well-scripted and completely cast actor for the primary role. Harrison and Christian have stopped together in almost every scene and wonder, how they find out how these characters are involved in this terrible situation. Acting very talented from both of them. I believe many people do not understand what the movie is, they do not get the point of the movie or they can not understand the situation like them. <br /> <br /> (Please do not miss this next section yet you have not seen the movie yet) <br /> <br /> I love the end, which binds a whole wonderful movie. These two good people were actually relieving to see how eventually the happy one could come. <br /> <br />
