Ah! When the good actors take the element to the band! If you are thinking of this movie as a strong police thriller you can be frustrated. Although the conditions are very true for life, the plot reaches the most expected clip and you can see how the actor goes ahead before taking you there. Offenders and secondary figures are really stereotypes at many speeds. Most conversations are simply silly. <br /> <br /> But! If you like to love this movie, if good actor loves to rise above this type of stuff and make some of it! One-note of Democratic Fallon characterizes the character depth and the way Sam Elliott is nothing but fantastic. Elliott has never been seen that you will be happy to feel like a person who is portrayed outside of his usual harmful Stoic Stance. And, in his first fifty years of this film, he looks fantastic! Through his bare chest view everywhere hope of middle-class men! Esai Morales does an excellent job of elevating his role as Diet. Falun's interested beaver is the new police partner. He could play Robin directly to Eliot Batman, but instead he breathed truth and emotion into the role. He did it despite some of the lang lines. <br /> <br /> Paul Sorvino is having fun watching! He played the bright police captain. She knows slumming in this movie and thinks it's doing a ball. He makes it fun for us too. <br /> <br /> This movie is a plot-in-the-plot-in-platform but it creates great performance! Sam Eliot fans must definitely get this one because it sucks a stick to spread her legs and is more than just allowing it to do!
