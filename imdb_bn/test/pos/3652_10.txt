I saw this at the Philadelphia Film Festival. This was the most wonderful movie - I saw it several times. The fascinating character of Ishar is an open, explored and full of love (as has been commented on in the movie) - painted by the absurdly beautiful Camille Natta. The accompanying music is happy and transported, the image of the soul. <br /> <br /> Each character seems to be contradictory in any way - and their interactions (w / contradiction) make for a great story. Said the story. Hanal was the most cunningly worked as the Old Man - I wanted to keep it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> All and all, a nice film. let's see.
