James Franco is completely calm in this movie. Not only handsome and charismatic but in reality, openly and indifferent. Some people in Tristan screening were behind the backs and slayers and the whole of Jumeys Dean, but I do not think it's true. Blind spot positive positive of its splendid talent. In this film he carries himself with different types of weight. This is a unique performance. Bittersweet and really moving From the line of his journal you cut like a knife. You feel a sharp intellect watching behind his words. The voice is everything. He carries through deadly beat of actions and mysteries as well as a scary hanging. I liked a great deal of other two actors too. Blonde girl is totally gorgeous and irregular in the man stoicism of her twisted hard guy. Some lugs looked a little sketchy but this is really a mini point. The film is completely rigid and cool way around Franco's way.
