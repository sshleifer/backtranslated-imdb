Maybe big budget, celebrity or Scrum's endorsement, Urban Legend or I did not know what I did last summer, but there was a lack of three films on Campfire Tail: The real horrors. <br /> <br /> This image is a well-documented urban legend less than a year ago and less than the urban legend. It was curious, efficiently scripted and logical, which I know last night did you dream about. Finally, it keeps its focus and scrambles die in blazing and dies. <br /> <br /> The most thrilling of this movie is that the writers and directors who have achieved it are scary. The stories of teenage stories around Campfire were unknown (but of course) horrible in the expected class, which was waiting for them in the woods, but the stories were really shocking where the movie was shining. <br /> <br /> The first order is pure, fast moving urban mythology. It's based on a popular legend and the director plays it with style and speed of this activity, it makes it even more exciting because we know what's going on. <br /> <br /> The first campfire story is directly in front of the thriller. Based on another popular myth, we really do not understand it at the end, because it has got so good in the story and because the action keeps our attention. Being a trilogy thriller, it unknowingly reduces our fears and has a number of well-done "jump" sequences that do not feel cheap or hesitant in movies such as schemes or urban kingjacks. <br /> <br /> The second story is more mysterious. This time, although we do not know what is still happening in the letters, and it provides horror. <br /> <br /> The final story is the element of the occult ingredient and uses a strange / troppy atmosphere to visualize the audience. Because we can relate to letters and their condition so easily, our fear comes from their intensity and they can not explain. These three are true ghost stories. <br /> <br /> I did not expect to enjoy campfire tales while renting. I think that if I do not like his much admired, big budget opponent, how can I like it? <br /> <br /> True, though, this film has been successful, where others are far less than signs.
