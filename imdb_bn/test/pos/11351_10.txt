I will not bore you with stories and plot lines, so they have already been presented many times on this page ?? I have been coming from a movie since coming. Beautiful, elegant and restrained, with a descriptive speed match. A film with sensitivity and understated attributes is rare that this time plots plots. Beautifully decorated photography, rich in luxurious colors, and lack of good sound, each frame is filled with an air pull. Settings and locations are used frequently, but movies always manage their new life, always there is a basic propo, light consistency, or a little obvious to the audience so that we live in letters <br /> <br /> <br /> The act reminds me of "bicycle thief", not style, but you have forgotten that you are watching two actors involved in their crafts. Every gesture has the meaning behind it and almost every movement has given importance to the characters, relationships, feelings and internal interpretation of the interior of the two lovers. The conversation is sparse, but like the rest of the movie, impressed by money. Meaning, soundtrack is contagious. It used to be a story telling device used here. And although this movie comes from Chinese sources, even a song that was sung in NAT King Cole Spanish provided the film with a finer meaning. Orchestrated soundtrack is repetitive, but the repetition makes it comfortable. It is in conformity with the story, and is not a medium of music protection, or to invite listeners to feel at a particular plot point in a particular way. I do not recommend this film to anyone, I fear that most people will be faded by the cool stream of the story, but I would suggest someone who is looking for alternatives to romantic scholars that the world fills multiplexes on our behalf. I must say that I have taken this picture completely, and watching it at night after night. The story takes time to present itself and shows the repetition because only a few of these films are open for such a detailed explanation. A very nice movie.
