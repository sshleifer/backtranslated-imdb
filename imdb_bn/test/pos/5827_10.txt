What a great show! A very underlying dramatic show. There is no main character, and each character's main character (s) is characteristic of each of its characters (s). I think Verne Shillinger's best character of the show is He is a tough, bad guy and an Arihant who makes him a real bad guy captive above is very familiar. There are many killings in this show, I think it is very harmful to kill Shoke, but I must admit that why this program is so big. I think some letters have been slightly closed. At the beginning, but some sure still made their mark. You can not compare things like the Prison Break at this show, they are completely different. I think some of the actors are very good and undervalued and what they should do for them. A great show, my favorite. A show that should be considered for great years.
