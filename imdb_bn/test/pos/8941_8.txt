A different Woody Allen thought about this movie, so if you do not have dry humor, dark humor, or a hug of the back, then perhaps you can do something else. If you are, it is playful with some nice twists and flowing natural conversations. <br /> <br /> The story is very compelling, not like the ruins of most trains, from which you can not close your eyes, but close I mean that the best possible way. Curiosity is enough to attach plenty of twists, enough sense, and the characters are neutral lovable. <br /> <br /> I had a great time with this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a rate of 8.3 / 10 ... <br /> <br /> Finder:.
