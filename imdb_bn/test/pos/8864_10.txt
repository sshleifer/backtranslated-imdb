This is one of the biggest films I remember, I look forward to watching TV, I'll forget myself by confronting over 12 years of age, and then I will live a life of horror films. It was a genuine film and it was indeed realistic effect before the CGI that stands as evidence of living. <br /> <br /> Set an isolated base in Antarctica, this version is the original version (Than from another world). American scientist discovered a decimated Norwegian base a few miles away. Everyone is dead, and half of the family's remaining residuals of some unknown thing can give any answer to what happened to the residue of the smolder. Thing is brought back to the American base, and very late, scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. Things melted and closed, killing someone and something beyond just his way, but absorbing them, wants to do whatever anyone else wants to do. Then the film turns into a bright paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, someone can be thieves, and nobody believes in anyone. Gone is the power and security available when people bend to a monster in spite of their differences. Group splinters and fear supreme rules <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I could work without open skull like a dog hole, but my The favorite animal lover is: kill all the people you want, but leave alone cats and dogs. Because of the combination of sanity and reason quickly, people are adopted by the aliens. The power of this movie is in his panooya and although I like the original version, I like it; The real threat is inside, and it is harmful for anyone who does not see it or can not be easily identified. When it is forced to hide, its anger is huge and the results are horrific. <br /> <br /> It is also one of the best movies, including The Fog and Halloween. All actors have strong, realistic performance and special effects so powerful that they stand as their main character. There is nothing for any girl in the horror of this film. Do not miss it.
