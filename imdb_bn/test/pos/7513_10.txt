Patty Chayevsky had many successful scripts and drama writers years before tackling sticky issues. In this 1971 film, he played Sinclair Lewis and A. J. Cranie (Arrowhead and Citidell) respectively looked at critics in the world, though his goal is central to a special stage: a modern hospital in Manhattan. Chiveski's views are quite straightforward: hospitals can be better for the public, or are they the money-making organization where people often die due to inadequacy. <br /> <br /> A person who has recently been in a hospital many times (and will be back again soon) I find a very timely and rewarding mock at the hospital. George C. Scott Block, head of Manhattan Surgical Center, a headmaster's hospital. He was told that when he just started his day, a visually blended mixture between the second year's residents has died at night. It seems as if he was impressive and impressive while he was sleeping on the bed (he was chic with a nurse), and someone iv. It should have water with glucose (later it is found that he has received an extra amount of insulin in Ivy). Soon Scott finds out that whenever he travels to another member of the staff, a heart attack or a boted operation dies. The key to all these things came to the hospital ten days before the patient for regular check-up and lost a kidney, almost lost another kidney, and now is in a comotose state (Bernard Hughes). <br /> <br /> Huez's daughter (Diana Rig) wants to bring Cometos father back to her house in Apache Indian Reservation in Mexico. Scott does not totally oppose this idea - in the end, the error in the hospital almost killed Hughes. Also, Scott is enjoying a middle-life crisis with his growing doubts about his marriage and family collapse, and what his truly successful job is about. It just did not look at a case like Hughes. The regular staff of the hospital (Scott, Stephen Eliot, Nancy Merand, Starkard Channing) are overworked and over-measured and are fighting with chaotic staff (identified by Frances Steinhagen in performance of a pinch). The local community opposes the hospital's expansion plan - but when they come to "negotiate" with Eliot, they are divided among themselves (militant black panthers vs. local clergy versus women and local clergy against contraceptive clinics for miscarriage). Rig (who fell in love with Scott in the film) became more convinced that leaving the madness of the city is understandable, and Scott was also a toy about this idea. <br /> <br /> Scott played the height of his film, what a chicken with ANATOMY, Haster, DR. Strangelyov and Patton are under the belt of the hospital before they are ready. He and Rig asked each other to register their reporter (he prevented him from being killed due to his disappointment). He can not speak any work that should be done in the hospital and the word "summary line" screams to the wind. While he was relieved of how well his education was good for the doctors studying with him later, Scott is not entirely sure about it - however, he fully accepts his responsibilities, which dumps others to others. Rig was the height of his international reputation (if not his ability) - he was like a few years old Mrs. Peill, but he was recognized as a brilliant talent in Britain at the time. As the most sexiest woman actress of that period. <br /> <br /> Supporting actors are also good. Huygens has won as a religious gentleman and suffers from Eliot Hospital, in addition to claiming insurance information from cometos patients in Medicare / Medicaid / ER (Chicken STEHENGEN). My favorite characters are: Richard Dysart Dr. Eloil Eloewel is a Butcher who has found a real house for himself on the Big Board of the Stock Exchange, including himself for the Tax Incentive. Reminiscing his acting like an ethical type of leader in the LLLA or heading the Law Agency or as friend and doctor of the Melbourne Douglass, his greedy Dr. Eloewel sees the other side of this emotional actor's side.
