I first saw Korean version of Dairy. It came across a simple love story which flashed nicely since the beginning. I have seen three times waiting for my copy of the manager's cut. <br /> <br /> Then I got the DC and saw it. How nice! I've never seen this first real director's cut. Wondering how to edit both versions! With the love of the background love, DC is equipped like a hardcore thriller. It moves slowly in comparison to the Korean version. The variation in both versions is so harsh, it seems like two completely different movies. I thought, I will go to see the movie again, it will make it harder for the added scenes. That was not the case. I was really watching a whole new movie as it felt. <br /> <br /> When you have more than 20 minutes on the DC version, you will be pressed to specify where and where you have changed. Cut in 2 seconds here. Add a second. A complete view has been added here. Another there to remove. In both versions, scenes have been added, excluded or cut-up and reordered. In some scenarios, the entire lines of the dialogue are replaced or reinstated - when the view itself was bound. Even simple sound effects have been added / removed from every common version - have a big impact on the mood of the movie and sometimes changes the outcome of a scene. What comes across across a flexible moment in Korean version is a sad, sadber one. Leave the room for the last interpretation of both versions. As far as I can say, both versions have a different ending and thus they were done. <br /> <br /> I think most of the people will achieve the director's cut and the film will look beautiful. Decent, but a little long and annoying In that case, look for the Korean version. The same movie, but different feelings. I think there is a deluxe 3-DVD version that includes both types of movies - not sure. <br /> <br /> praises each other so that I can see Daisy more as a pair of my other favorite Korean cinema. Alone, I want to say that the Korean version is a beautiful love story that I want to see once in a while. The director's cut, I will meet once or twice, then again, as I find the pacing dull out. But they are going so well together! In order to consider the best experience, I would like to say the first Korean version clock. Then see the director's cut for help to fill his gaps that you were curious about the director. <br /> <br /> The film is the real star of the film.
