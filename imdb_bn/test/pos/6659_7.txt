This movie worked for me because I saw this film in the opposite form of 'Gone with the Wind'. Farm owners instead of farm owners. Scarlett fights and connives for what he wants; Ada becomes frustrated and rides herself up to Ruby, (Rene Gelweger) shows saving the day. Sorting, in almost a round. The officials trying to get their family back, instead of going to the desert, list and go on. Even the love story was opposite. If the producer and the author tries to succeed with it then it succeeds with me. <br /> <br /> Here are two things I do not like about movies, others think they have done well and I like enough to recommend it to friends. First of all, I could not see the attraction between Inman, (Juda's law), and Ada (Nicole Kidman), and he was strong enough to believe in returning to him. Inman said that he only wrote a few times, where he often wrote to him. Second, some or someone is almost killed or killed in almost every scene. I must say this because it was full, but after the second scene I knew something or someone was going to die in the next scene. I want to be surprised to see the next scene, it does not know what will happen before. <br /> <br /> I think all the performances are done very well, the best of the Zelgars. He has received credit for it. I thought he played very well with the hill girls. She must be part of her homework in part. Jelvisger even said in the film that he was smarter than the man. I think that was true. The law was going well with him to return to Kidman, with whom he had done well. I had a lot more powerful love to go through all that I had thought of. Now he showed many emotions in his face during his trial. After the other two, I liked acting Kendman's part could do something with him. When he was frustrated, he did not express much emotion, I do not know how the piece was written or how it felt. He still did a good job, I just thought the other two were good. <br /> <br /> I liked the scene with geljars, kidneys and cock, although it was one of the scenes described above. I thought the 'home guard' came back right away. Although we could not hear a lot about them, they were part of that time. I thought the scenery was beautiful The film was all necessary for a good historical romance.
