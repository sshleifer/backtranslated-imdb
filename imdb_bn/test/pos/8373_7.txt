He starred in Athell Andrews, a singer who forced his producer consultant Duke Davis (Ralph Cooper) to leave the branch for a long time. Davis had to be fraudulent to take money from him for his fraud, so he would not be sorry to do this. Then he teamed with Doc Dorondo (Lawrence Kryner) for medicine groups across the South.

And for a long time as a Louisiana resident, I would like to take two players' notes in this film: As a female dancer near Monroe as a subscriber of Joel Fluuelan Tonic and a sexy dancer near Mary Bryant's musical craft of New Orleans. So only for Lane Horn alone, Dook is worth watching at least once.
