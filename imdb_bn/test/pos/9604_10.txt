Since 1991, I have submitted two comments about this show ... and no, ITV has not even made it for the general release. However, recently I had a way to keep a copy to see whether I have contacted ITV, and this was their answer ....... <br /> <br /> "Unfortunately DVD There is no plan to release this program on video / video, but purchase copy from our visitors' requests, their email address is: viewers.requests@itv.com ". <br /> <br /> Hope you enjoy the opportunity to enjoy this classic short comedy again now. <br /> <br /> <br />
