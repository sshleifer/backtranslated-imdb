A chick flick that guys still loved - yes! Wonderful. Now I'm having fun, enjoy my daughter's company, and I do not think I can not wait till the end of the movie! Light - but funny Great stuff. Do you ever miss the DVD excess It's a great "blind date" file too. Smith would do this well - though even played light - he pulls it all well to the trough. The film is a little slower in the pacing - do not expect too much action - smile is there - and the message - but the time is a bit slow. Use the following moments to visualize or kiss - it will. The last thing it makes worth remembering moment. Everyone hopes to have fun with a light heart - and watch out for some great developments of supporting actors - they make the film. The plot twists are predictable - but it is a date move, so get the refills of popcorn from the kitchen - and do not break him. Count on more dates after this movie - if he wants to see the next key in the line. Remember the tips of the hit !!! Enjoy <br /> <br />
