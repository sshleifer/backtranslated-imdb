<br /> <br /> This is a dog show's longest documentary documentary that I have seen for a long time. A very long time. Well, face it, never Does that part of the charm? In fact, the idea of ​​creating a problem for a movie about a documentary mocking about an event that most people think is strange at first. Even if there was no big smile, anyone would laugh at the thought. Any film that tries to score some new scores in my proverbial book. I like dogs too!
