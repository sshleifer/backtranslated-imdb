As a link from YouTube, Walt Disney saw The Skeleton Dance on Saturday's Morning Blog, I used the same source for a Columbia cartoon unit to see a remake done in Technicola and see the same man-animated by Weisers. Colors have been practically used here since the previous black and white colors, and many new gags - such as a continuous false note of the skeletal band players, when someone loses their head and closes others or when others are fun-loving with others before they are fun. It's got a little repetitious around the end. Still, Skilton Freelix is ​​old-fashioned for an animation buff, who wants to compare with the previous comparable symphony.
