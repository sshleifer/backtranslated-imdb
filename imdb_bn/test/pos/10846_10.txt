The adaptation of Sarah Waters's novel Andrew Davies was excellent. Characters of Nan and Kati were illustrated by Rachel Sterling and Kelly Hawker respectively. There was total joy to watch the whole series. Whether it's straight or gay, everyone imagines everyone across the board. I wish I could be a signal!
