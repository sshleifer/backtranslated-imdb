Cleopatra (delicious Monica Baluchi) is challenged by Caesar (Alain Chabat): To prove better than the Romans to the Egyptians, he pledges to construct a fenced castle for Caesar within three months without any delay. He called an arm architect Nimberbis (Jameel Debbazi) and gave him two alternatives: If he completes his mission, or if he fails, then crocodile becomes the food. Numerobis will seek help for Panoramix (Cloud Rich), Asterix (Christian Clavier) and Obelix (Geraard Depardieu) (with Ideas). This movie is very fun, especially in part where Obelix and Paternal Red Beer are run. However, the screenwriter and the director must have mentioned that French is not universal as English. Therefore, jokes with words (for example, in Austin Powers Movies) do not work well for strange French people. French languages ​​and individuals in French languages ​​must definitely like this joke, but they do not give any idea for me, which can not speak French. My vote is seven.
