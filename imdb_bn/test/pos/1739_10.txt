It seemed as if I was very young on Saturday night, I had the best show ever made it. Then, I grew up, Dr. Who never went to the air, and nobody ever knew about it. Then I found out there is going to be a new series. I was a little nervous about it. Will I live in the hope that I was running around from childhood? Will they screw it? What milk do you eat? Would his assistant suck? What do they Will he and his assistant build a closer relationship? Yes, no, no, no, no !!! This show is wonderful !! I love the new assistant. I love his assistant. I love the show And I found myself excited on Friday night, waiting for the "new" episode. I now see 2005 episodes, just as I live in the United States, so I'm behind you a bit. I hope the next Dr. is such a great!
