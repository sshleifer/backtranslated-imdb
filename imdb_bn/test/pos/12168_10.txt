Three stories depicted by three different filmmakers are both gay and bi-sexual, and together with their struggle, it can be so insightful that it is a complementary one! <br /> <br /> "Pool Day" is the curiosity of teenage age, and the mutual attraction between an older person and a younger boy. A story about experience and weaknesses! <br /> <br /> "The Non Friend of Dorothy" has a general disagreement that many gay and bi-sexual people enjoy in their life: anyone who is deeply interested in heterocexial. Sensely tested, this story has left me feeling! <br /> <br /> "Disco Years" shows no other version of a no-win situation: Getting involved with someone who is not confused about their sexual orientation, but also being open as something other than straight is afraid! A very powerful story for us to gain experience of betrayal by the hands of sex and fear! <br /> <br /> <br /> Three of these stories will appeal to someone else with sympathy, but they will mentally empower them by considering homosexuals, bi-sexual or inquiries. Each story is raising its own unique means!
