I'll marry the daughter of Nicky Finn. Never boring, always positive thoughts, good with animals. Well, a critic wrote, a little more peryoakide, lipstick, and eyebrows (only Madonna can stay away with it). But I love Nicky Finn, she is not your ordinary girl. He happens to be things, always exciting to be around, and always honest. Sure, he steals, but he does not steal or kill (unless you can do his job). He knows that any rule can break and which one must abide. He knows what to take and can be stolen. If you need a favor from him, he is 100%. Bottom line: He knows how to enjoy life. Nikki is always loving (for which she has a way with wild animals), and fully devoted to those she loves, and who loves her. <br /> <br /> Who is that girl? She is the girl for me.
