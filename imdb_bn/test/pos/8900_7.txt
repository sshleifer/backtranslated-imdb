When I was young, I was a fan of the classic comics, and I saw everyone. I never heard of this film during the War of Liberation but last night I saw it with my kids. I think comics are good enough to add a lot to the story of this movie. Some changes that I thought were a little lucky (the nephew's 'modern' dance and the daughter of the Viking Chief - almost everything about him), but I mostly found it quite fun. Most importantly, my children see this reaction, ensuring that the film has satisfied its target audience. As a family movie it works better than other Asterix titles I saw. The names I found were not found in the same appeal as they were. Overall, an enjoyable family movie, regardless of whether you're a star or fan.
