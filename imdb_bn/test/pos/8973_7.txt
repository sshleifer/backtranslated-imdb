Well we definitely see and I and many other people were actually bad hope. There are also some good parts of it which I do not expect that it has still failed in other areas. <br /> <br /> The first act was more than the average off. I love Philip Simmur Hoffman in this movie and I love Tom Hans. Hoffman was glue to this movie. If this is not for him, then this film will be reduced and will take the rock down. Her performance was stunning but there was no meaning absolutely necessary. He has given a better actor, which most other actors can easily turn his character into one click. Tom Hendes has really given a nice loose performance and is not disappointed but he certainly does not influence. I could not stand Julia Roberts was involved in this movie. As I've ever seen, he was as big as a miscast. For one, he was a bad actress, at least to me, he was young for his character and was also stupid for the character he played. <br /> <br /> The instruction was average to me. I'm not really a big fan of Mike Nicholas movies and I'm not really impressed with each other in this way. I was not able to stand as it was made with a Hollywood, cartoon touch cap. The worst part about it was that he finally tried to make it a really meaningful movie. I love meaningful movies but when a movie does not want to look at two scenes and does not show anything that tries to justify the rest of the trash spread throughout the film. Mike Nicholls seems to have done a lot in his recent track record, it's something like that. <br /> <br /> An interesting part of this movie was writing. The dialog was put together very well and was able to allow the story to play. What was written above this writing was able to really take up to an average level. In many scenes I saw myself laughing by writing myself. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < If the majority of the scenes are good, then the film was good but not much more than that. I have not glorified everything done in this movie America. It is clear that the United States provided arms against them during the entire war in Afghanistan. This movie kind of show we are very responsible for that. It shows that in a short time, which may seem to be good, there may be some terrible mistakes in the future. This movie was a good original message but it just did not provide it. Overall it was entertaining though.
