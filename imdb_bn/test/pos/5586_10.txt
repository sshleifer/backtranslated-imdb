This movie seems to have been ignored by everyone. Someone will bring it to VHS and DVD It's a great movie and one of Brooke Shield's best ones, which was terrible. <br /> <br /> Jen Simmons is now getting more credits for getting more days. If all his films are given in VHS or DVD, then it will be great. Gene Simmons, and still, was a very good actress. He certainly had a beauty. In fact, he is still a beauty. He did a very good job on TV. She is much better than many actors today.
