I again like to play Linda Blair in an actual "horror" movie. Most of the "Exorcist" movies (which I like) have been disappointed with him. What was all these nasty "B-movies"? <br /> <br /> On the other hand, David Hesslehoff, I can smile at what I can. She is not cutting a horror movie actor. David should be in "Night Rider" or "Beauch". Almost all, this is a great movie. Even for the eighties, it was an extraordinary movie. It's awful, action, and drama. This is a suspicious, and I love Linda Blair's way.
