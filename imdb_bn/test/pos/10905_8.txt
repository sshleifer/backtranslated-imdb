This movie is extremely fun and enjoyable, with appropriate, fun and experienced casts. I can enjoy this movie rather than the elements of humor, but enjoy the music of different scenes. Kevin Clayne, a good comedy, has done a great job because of the fun of many portraits, apart from the other templates, unusual Tom Ceelk. Humor is stupid in this movie, which in many scenes, especially in the starting bits, creates different amounts. Joan Cusack is also fun and exaggerated; And the same goes for the other casts. This movie contains many elements of stupid humor and if you want to laugh it's enjoyable.
