The three shorts included in this compilation released in 1959 are chaplin classic, and there is nothing wrong with them and there is nothing to criticize. Frameworks associated with bridging sections are also good for chaplin scores and shorts for these movies. This compilation problem is a minor, yet annoying. The shorts were printed to fit the 24 frame p.us fit. The speed of contemporary film, where the shorts themselves p. 20 frames. Shoots These results are not a very scary motion which is not very interesting, and still was an irrelevant solution at which time the optical printing technology was limited, it is not only accessible that the current DVD version is unnecessary, showing movies such as dirty in 1959 and still print is expanded. DVDs are even a separate recovery version of the versions available on these DVDs, and this would not be a problem to recover the image, but this did not work. <br /> <br /> A little curly has made much more space in my article, but I again say a minor quibble, although it should not be too much to experience, it crashed one point from my rating. Shorts are still '10' worth.
