Although this movie starts with normal: some mistakes, spacecraft crashes, people are disappointed, etc. It still stops and offers visitors some new ideas. Reddick has a poor ass donkey criminal and has fixed his eyes so much because he is able to see in the dark crew of the ship which he is able to see and because he gets inside. Cutting into the movie is very good and emphasizes the mystery that anti-hero and male shroud shrouds: "Riddick." The story of Pitch Black has already been mentioned that it is a bit irrational and unhappy, but the film has been mixed with some wonderful elements of clipping and cutting, which has been added to the story and it still supports very well and later with a hybrid feeling of hunger for satisfaction and more Left Win really works well in the role of Diesel Reddick and although his character is a strong, strong survivor, he still decides the morale at the right side, but this does not mean that his decisions do not turn into him at the very end ... why are already Destroy a perfect reputation? All this is perfect though a very good movie. This story seems very immune to the surface, but it is enlightened with enough originality to entertain it below. In some scenes it is slightly better than average. It may be described as a civilized film, and it is evidently mixed with some minor Saif-Fi stories with some minor moments and a curiosity hero, as well as a recommendation for radicals.
