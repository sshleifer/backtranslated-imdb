I saw last week and sketches about the Korean cities were fun. The tongue is very tongue and political climate suitable. Full points for the author and Spike for that. The part that he created translator can be dragged into the rickshaw and Korean words can be closed by spike. This is a bold attempt by Fox. It's a brilliant show and I hope it pulls. My wife and I regularly try it and although it conflicts with some programs, we now see it in MySpace. I hope Fox dedicates complete resources and makes it every day. I can not wait to see Bobby Lee on his show. People like Jonard Abidallah are walking right behind listening. Also Mary's mother looks pretty as her wife.
