After the start of the program in 1958 and for the first time, I was a regular visitor. I remember that I was "Show to Beaver", "My Three Sons", "Og and Harriet", "Dick Van Dike", "I Lucy", "The Real Macquois" and so on. I am now enjoying the first season of "Donna Reid" in DVD and saw the first two episodes. Don Ston is shown with an intelligent, well-established, problem-solving, quiet, mother-in-law, like June Claver and Lucy Ricardo. At Episode 2, I especially like how Mrs Reed became a surrogate father, in sweat and boxing gloves for trading in his dress, teaching his son how to protect himself against a lot of physical abuse. Although none of the mothers I grew up with myself, did not meet Mrs. Reed's ideological criteria, but at the end of the day, refreshing to see good behavior and intelligent decisions. Acceptance of indecency, selfishness and indifference among today's neighbors. I tell Jeff and Mary Stone to their parents that it is okay to violate their neighbors, to leave the dog out of the hole all day, or to tell their mother "shut up" in a supermarket in front of everyone.
