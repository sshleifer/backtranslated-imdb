This movie is a real step at its best, it is not good anymore. This is a movie that you can just jump back and watch some good stop shooting and killing but there are some nice lines to go along with it. There is a bad guy in my liking that is breaking into this old couple's house and he is stealing any TV or anything and he goes right to them and shouted "I'll be here any time !!!" And before he jumped out of the window, he was "Anytime !!!" yells I mean, it's just around the classic stuff that you like, you can try to stick to the sticky Will Smith, or you can see Master Charles Birston !!!!
