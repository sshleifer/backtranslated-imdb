I found myself lucky to have seen an amazing movie with two lucky actors. "Krormer v. Krummer" was great for me because I think I can relate it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, my parents are divorced. Although I was bigger than Billy in this movie, I felt his pain and confusion. Two parents who you think are happy and hated each other until the worst. Through this film, actually, I think it was as my parents and I had a lot of trouble like my sister and me. <br /> <br /> Return to this movie, it was a good one. Yes, it is dated and Meryl and Dustin are very young. But I would suggest this for a lot of people, because I think most of them can be related to most cases. Funny, sad, happy, and wildly taking away moments by these great actors. This is a good movie and more than 7.5 credits are eligible. <br /> <br /> 9/10
