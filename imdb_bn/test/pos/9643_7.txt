When I type these comments, I see a DVD of a movie I received from a mail-order dealer, and I keep it very well in view of strong characters, trustworthy situations and well-established steps. It might be 45 years, maybe 50, since I saw Hell Sandy, but the scene of Sterling Holly's death is a scene of a deep impact on me, which many other commentators have mentioned here. In this scenario I still could not achieve the scene, but for any other comment I can promise: Once you see the scene of Sterling Holly's death in this movie, you will never forget at all. Judging from the extent to which the film holds firmly, I look forward to living in its memories in the scene - as one of the biggest death scenes in the history of the film. The price of the movie was viewed for a moment, but in addition to this it was the first-ever debut submarine drama.
