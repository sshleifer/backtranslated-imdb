*** SPEAKER *** *** SPEINERS *** Wow, Joanna found an accident. After walking on a young boy accidentally, he called for help, so angry observers were just going back to the crime scene in a group. It is understood - this is too much for it to handle, and it blows up the scene. Fortunately the child does not die, but seriously injured and a coma. So the biggest struggle in the life of the young man begins: can he be silent or speak? He does not do it at first, but eventually he realizes that it is living with such a mysterious secret. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> And gradually a detective begins to question the behavior of this woman. She wants to tell the truth, and she does not want to escape from the crime scene, but it is not saying that the entire city hates you? <br /> <br /> You do not select bias about this image. Joanna is a very good role model, though she has made some wrong choices. You feel for him, even though you know what he did. His journey is such a good presentation which can happen to him if someone can go through a man. <br /> <br /> Margaret Colin is absolutely brilliant actress. He's a TV series now and again amazing and in films like The Independence Day and The Devils himself. Here its performance is so realistic and impossible that he operates solely through our entire movie. Finally, I wanted to see more of her. Lisa Bidlow also provided some helpful assistance as a gentle, wealthy detective. <br /> <br /> To upload it, if you want to see a movie that you might think after a long time, it will say "This is reality", then you do not want to miss it. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10
