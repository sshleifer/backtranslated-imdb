Rita Hairstyle These fun, curtains and gingerly kelly performers make up the delightful music screen. Rita plays the Nightclub dancer Rusty Parker who dreams of being a successful Broadway star. Unfortunately, his career did not get any place in Danny McGuie's Night Club. When one of her fellow dancers says that she will enter a cover girl competition, she will follow her dream. He reminded the publisher of his grandmother, who deeply fell in love many years ago. But when she finds this success, her boyfriend is not happy about it. <br /> <br /> I have never seen Rita before, and I am very happy! She has a scene presence and is a very good actress. Here are some good numbers, not the best of any music, but they are good and good for listening. I did not like the character of Jean Kelly. He must support his girlfriend! But anyway, perhaps my only criticism about this movie is. Cover Girl is a magnificent, fluffy film - perfect escapism. Due to the power of Ritter Hairstyle, not everyone's ideal film, but a wonderful movie. Great movie, really impressed.
