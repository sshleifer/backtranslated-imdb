"2001: A Space ODC" is set in 2001 and the main character is HL. A computer. OK, a computer that completely discusses and thinks itself. It was created in 1968, and by 2001 2001, it is thought that computers can speak. If this was in 3064, a talk computer would have been in that passion and made its own decision just as moronic as this would be considered. There is nothing in this movie that promotes any kind of emotion. It stimulates two reactions and is called one: sleep. It starts with nothing, but a good shot of a pitch for two minutes. Then, we see the first shot that there is no light in it "man of the order". So, if there is a chronological order, then blackness, the birth of the world? <br /> <br /> does a huge consolidation come from a place during "Man of the Man"? From the ground, from the sky, we never know where we came from, but it is for one reason or another. Monkey goes to Appes! Once they find this unit that only humans can create, but to catch it? People have not yet developed. So, who created it and where did it come from? What is the purpose of this? Monkeys find a tool. Monkey monkeys use bones to fight an opposition group. Monkeys with weapons now dominate the group because they used their mind to gain an advantage. More advanced monkeys, and more importantly, smart and more inventive monkeys, they are grouped and the group is reduced. <br /> <br /> We quickly entered the place after a few thousand years, where we see classical music almost floating spaceship bunch. We can see the visible effects of the earth, the moon, the sun, the universe, and a film created in 1968, but we can look old. The score is legend. Cinematography spectacular The edit is violent. Countless shots of boxy looking space ships, for what seems to be the outer space float, an infinite amount of time. We do not have a lot to talk to the ship board once. The next hour Kubrick shows different shots of outer space life. Kubrick shows us an astronaut's life, which is very annoying, and we get the full message. Spaceship is looking at the interior and exotic heavy and old. Remember how the first cell phone looked? Not only me but in 2001 it looks like the future. All the characters have clothes and hairstyles like 1968. Chairs are bright red color and weirdly shaped, because we all know, in the future, we are going to be sitting in a strange looking chair. Computer screens are suddenly watching and it is obviously before the HDTV, because the transparency is frustrating. All TV sets seem to have been since 1968, so it's not all the future. Like all the movies for over 20 years, they look terrible and helpless. Just because this is irresponsible, we should not say, "Well, how do you feel like this?" No, I do not want to. Just like I do not think computers will talk to me in 2032. It's not going to happen, and if someone makes a film at this moment, it will spend 30 years and talk, your own thinking computer, I want to smile at it stupid. Just as I gave "2001" <br /> <br /> HL the most vivid person, shooting ?? I just called him a person. HL is a computer, but his life is more than any neutral character and he really feels alive. HL is the only thing that is animated and when people take care of their job they think that people are taking care of him. "Reading" the lips between some of the HL Dave and Frank conversations, and "see" that they plan to stop him. Here the only dramatic part of the film enters - a red light and a spaceman trying to get a greater spaceshope. Oh, the drama. Once HL thinks he has his hands, Dave returns to the spaceship, proves human skill. Dave HAL Termination Income HAL, who slowly pleads for his life as he fades away, seems to take forever, like all others. <br /> <br /> The final work is tedious as the first two. Once again, the apes appears that the monolith appears at the end. It does not come anywhere, again. Then, a baby is born in a placenta-like shield overlooking the earth from space. What is the cubic? Is it about conversion? Dave is a child? Are people evolution again? Kubrick says these people end up and start ?? Anything that is looking aliens? Maybe I'm trying to find out what these crazy directors are trying to say, but more I started thinking about the idea about me and ending. There are many questions in the null, especially for merge purposes. If you can do it through the film then it should spark some thoughts. <br /> <br /> Finally, fight the movie where he wants to go. The first task and the third task is strong, but the second thing is often going on, like going on a place that seems like an eternity. There are some playful elements in the movie that give you some excitement and some thoughts will stir up. Once the film begins to understand, the last thing becomes better, even if you are still not trying to say Cubic, which I do not.
