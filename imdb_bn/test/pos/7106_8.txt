Dr. Dracula (John Carradine) Go to Edelman (Onslaw Stevens) who believes that everything can be cured by science. He wants Adeleam to heal his blood pressure - Adelman agrees. Then Lawrence Talbot (Lone Chaney Junior) popped up looking for a cure for her twist in a vairobol. Thread Frankenstein's giant has been discovered but not really anything. <br /> <br /> Very ambitious plot for a public horror film in the 1940s. Trying to heal monsters by science is an interesting idea. The film also has a beautiful set (the castle for the doctor's house), a large amount of atmosphere, very well managed (great use of shadows) and has a great effect. <br /> <br /> Acting is better than all the carriages - he tried, but I could not accept him like Dracula. Also Lionel Atoll (as always) as the Police Chief It is quite forgotten and derided as a stupid film but I think it is very good. The last time the universal monster was taken seriously - the next film was "In 1948 with Abbott and Castello Frankenstein". This is a great movie but the Act is more on Comedy. <br /> <br /> There are only real errors here for 67 minutes in the luggage and there are some spaces: Dakula beautiful milla (Martha O'Driscoll) when he is being cured? And why the doctor (and how) can get his Frankenstein in his palace? Yet this small complaint. Recommended.
