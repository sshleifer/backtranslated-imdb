Born is an experience of course, and that common experience is out. Using color is interesting and at times, frustrating. What happens at the screen is quite difficult. Your view is a sudden change in color and tone, hidden by road characters and random cuts in the sky. The sound is very hunting and a welcome addition. It really helps nihilistic and hopeless tone that smothers this film. <br /> <br /> What happened is that "the theory of rape of environment and rebirth" seems quite right to me. But I will not spend a lot of time paying attention to money, it is essentially essential. It is clear that the director does not want to explain anything. He simply presents it as, and if you have a meaning that you want to search up. <br /> <br /> I'm not walking on a park walk, but I got fascinated by the opening. It's really like watching a person's worst nightmare. What we have seen is sometimes tragic and unpleasant, but there is a supernatural dream of beauty. If you are an art-house / experimental fan and you have not seen it yet, then prefer it. I doubt you'll ever forget it. I'm not sure that I will.
