First and foremost, I want to say that before considering this film, I consider myself as an acceptable person. Anyone else took care of others, praised others, did not face any trial against others, and in this film (I think) my life or outlook has changed dramatically. When I saw it, I did not know what was about it, I knew that it was a banned relationship, but the other because I was stupid, and when I saw what was happening in these two wonderful images, I was shock, Confusion, confusion and surprise. For the first time I saw, I was blind. Their love, their intimacy, with their connection, their relation with the people is blind from their purity. I saw it a second time, because I finally realized how ambitious I was, telling myself and others, "Oh, I accept all kinds of people and do not try to judge them" while judging this wonderful and amazing insightful story, I have a fear I think. The second time I saw this movie, I opened the eyes which was closed for the first time, and I listened to my whole life, but only two people were seen as part of the banned relationship. And I like it, I like the story, I like a slightly broken but distinct individual person of the film, I liked sharing feelings, and I liked the strong ties I created. This is a really open-minded, well-crafted film that made me cry, and I hope those who are going to read it and see the film will remember that everyone is loveable, no shape or form does not appear ....
