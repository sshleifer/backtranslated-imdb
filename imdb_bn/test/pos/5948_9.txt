One of the two new Osos 117 films is a kind of humor which is both intelligent and foolhardy at the same time, which I find very ridiculous. It really reminds me of the classic Pink Panther movie with almost leading people as well as Peter Sailor on Jean Duardarde. And Steve Martin completely destroys Clausu, the day is very bright. <br /> <br /> Oppositions against movies are obviously an incident for the complete lack of humor and understanding. <br /> <br /> Whether you enjoy or hate this movie, it actually comes to some kind of humor. I can not wait for the sea!
