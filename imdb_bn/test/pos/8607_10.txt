It finally bothers me forever that this movie (which I consider to be a wonderful composition and I do not use that word lightly) should be identified with "not a qualifier with Michael Douglas!" Not only the titles are the same, but they also mention the same thing - radioactive fall that rains on the remnants of the first nuclear bomb attack. It is not a cheap metaphor in Imamura's picture; The entire movie is about physical and mental fallout, from Hiroshima and the war itself. The collapse of a couple and their big niece became more serious, the ironic images became stronger, and every night from the old watch, they gradually threw it out of the door of the heroine to the deity. (These, instead, a series of the Selgicomic episodes, which are carved by a shelled senior man who is forced to attack a motorcycle that can reach the city). The bombing is shown in pieces of flash pieces which are coolly scary. Yet, "black rain" ("NTMDM!") Can be seen repeatedly even though it shows the compassion of Imamura for his character. I repeat: A masterpiece.
