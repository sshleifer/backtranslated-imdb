Although this movie may not be the next Evil Dead (Hell who knows it, it's gone for only one year) This is a look. Do not expect a $ 10 million film. cuz you'll be frustrated. Hope, hope to have fun, enjoy and enjoy the experience. If these movies are not very bad budget films, then much better than many. I've seen a movie that has spent 10 to 20 times more than this movie and has made 100 billion times worse. The extent to which this movie was tried, weighs the set weight of a set set by a limited budget. The movie is meant to be entertained, and this movie sure that. Actually this movie can open new doors for you to watch the movie. It is available at Netflix without your local video rental store. So, watch it then watch it.
