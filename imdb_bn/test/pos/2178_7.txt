This film was certainly not very sophisticated. No, the humor was really stupid that I was thinking about it. But, when I think this, I was still laughing - a decent comedy would not be too deep to prove. <br /> <br /> <br /> as well as the film. She is the oldest grocery store Butcher. Most of the store's counterfeit things have happened and I think that according to the order of the coffee grinder I laugh at all - you only have to see it yourself. <br /> <br /> However, Fatty's girlfriend is forced to go to a girls' school and because she can not stand in that part, she pulls up and enters the school. Arabakol is a ugly woman! So, for the stupid and unreasonable fun, watch this movie. It will not change your life and it's a little bit of a picture, but it's also fun.
