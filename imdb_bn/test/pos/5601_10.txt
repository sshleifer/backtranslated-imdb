Martin Donovan had promised to play Jesus, genuinely, enough to see the picture. Definitely suitable; It is tricky and fun without overdoing it. The low-quality filming was probably an appropriate effect, but it became very slight, and the last was more sound like a PBS program than Hartley. Still, there are many memorable lines and great moments to test hard for me.
