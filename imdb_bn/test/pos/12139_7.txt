I agree with all Strenghaughs mentioned in another review, but there are some absences that keep the crime drama or film continuously firm and limit it to a drama drama beyond the bounds of "ingredients" that it creates. Movie Silent - The silent movies of the great movie do not tell / can not, but this is not. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> Wildly set up in this picture is wildly finished <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> moment But children are not shown one way or another. Do not cry, or do not ask their father, children are good actors and my father's responses to me are important but it is a big mistake. Their response to the heart and the kids of this story is mostly kept blank. They are really just no one, they seem to not see anything in the next scene. <br /> <br /> There is a bond between such a belondo and ventura letters. Belmondo says that he knew the deceased partner - but it can never be interpreted and does not dramatically affect Belmonds or anyone else. Belmondo romantic usage also straps credibility, although it is also played firmly. Ventura's character only gives Belmondo the opportunity to include the strangers in their escape plan. She does not even think of comment or notice. Another gap <br /> <br /> <br /> I ended up, and I will not loot it, the screen is closed for the last time to know what happened. I think this is trying to make life feel more true, but again, with this mistake, the screen is closed and the plays close. <br /> <br /> What is the hint of not dealing with these problems? I do not know, in addition to the aim of the film, the audience is restricted to what a crime melodrama wants - recommend some deeper elements, then proceed to ignore them. <br /> <br /> There are many recommendations for this bad movie, Ventura is very good, but very bad it can be a great drama and criminal story - like IMDB is the best film of all time ever. This film was potential. Although done in the United States, it probably will sink the film, but it will be a good remake in the hands of the right director, although it is doubtful that Ventura's performance may be top. <br /> <br /> So look at the full value but as frustration
