This exhibition is there with the best comedies made in Australia because it makes us so beautiful that many of our public wants. Check out some of the best Bit Advertising Road exams in the show that will make an advertisement in real life. What really is really about the show is that it's the original and it's a guy who likes them and likes those who do not like them. There are plenty of bits in this show which can be trapped by some of the ones I have already mentioned, such as road test, where ten questions in front of prominent celebrities like Hugh Jackman and Beach boys are promptly asked. As we have learned from this week's current issue like that of Chasers Emmys and has been from the beginning. Overall I have a thin show rate of 98%.
