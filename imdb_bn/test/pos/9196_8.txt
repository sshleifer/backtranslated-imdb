First seen on 10/28/2007, 8 out of 10 (Dir-Jesus Pons): The homeless couple's simple, sweet stories and their daily holidays in everyday world live without ceiling on their heads. The movie starts from the story (played by Isabel Ampudia) with the woman in the story, but she did not know what she was for and how long she was there. He runs through Sebastian Harrow, runs across the story and protagonist hero of his boyfriend, he as parking car for change. They clash together each other in the old prison without warming each other and giving them nothing but a small mattress to occupy them. He is a addict who tries to fix from one fix to another, but like a person, he has strange, attractive attraction, which we finally get. He also has some kind of sexually transmitted disease, so sex for them has come out of the question but it does not seem to be a problem for them. He asks the same questions as this man and without changing him, which is not available anywhere. He earns around the window of the shop and holds it in a bucket. They ate a bakery roll every day and considered it a banquet. Isabella's character is a dream of a normal life but it is not expected that it can happen and most of it does not seem so that she does not expect to fit into that role. Both characters come from highly broken houses and hence the visitors have sympathy for them despite their imperfections. Apart from leaving most stories, Isabella's character became worse and worse in his drug addiction. It is a wonderful composer conclusion to illustrate this for the enjoyment of the public, but overall it is an extraordinary independent film which is a relationship between the great festivities that makes you interested in the end.
