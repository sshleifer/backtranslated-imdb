Michael is most likely cutesy for Hollywood too much for action movie fans and intellectual rush but I think it is available both both cutesy and formative, despite being extremely fun and very touching both of it. <br /> <br /> When three suspects are sent to investigate an individual claiming to be an angel, they find that they end up in pursuit of him on the Grand Tour of the Midwestern side of the country to find that it is their own heart which needs investigation. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is suitable for all ages without a "family" movie, and a good movie or special someone to share with the whole family. <br /> <br /> "Michael" is not a great movie, but it's definitely a good film, a sensitive film, and a good price to watch. <br /> <br /> KWC
