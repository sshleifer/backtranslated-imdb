Thank God for the Internet Movie Database! When I first got this movie I saw it before going to bed every night and every time I got something different from it. But no matter how I cut it, it came boring. Black and white and all the twitching really freaked me up. You look at the uncertain screen of what you see, and when you feel that you found it, it becomes clear and it is completely different. Imagery is very annoying, twitching and straight razors do not sit well with me in any movie. Still, I have seen it at any time, I have explained a bit differently (there is no dialogue, I know), so I decided to check the IMDB for the plot summary. The boy threw me for a loop, I had no idea he could be God. Now I'm going to keep this in mind and see what happened ....
