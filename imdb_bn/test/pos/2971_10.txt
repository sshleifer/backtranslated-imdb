When I first heard of this movie, I noticed it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I've noticed music by Elton John, so I figured I had nothing loose, so I got it. What a surprise !!! The movie was extraordinary. It was true love all about me. Characters (Paul and Michelle) were not luxury, there was no money and sometimes there was no food, yet they were still happy. I've suggested this picture to all my friends, but they all criticized my taste, even told me names because the film depicts two small nudes. I think the movie has made it more realistic. The cinematography was fantastic and it came only to showcase the great power of the director, Luis Gilbert
