Well, it should be said that Monster Man is a huge mess of a movie, but somehow different styles and a clinched plot come together that I can make one of the most enjoyable modern horror movies I've seen in ages! The two biggest styles of film mixed are a 'road trip' style teenage comedy and a 'Texas Chess genocide' style is deadly, and the other often goes way differently; Directed by Michael Davies, thanks to the fact that continuous change in the tone means that we will never be sure where the film will be taken. The things start worryingly as we are launching two letters, irritating in different ways. Adam is a warm virgin, when the hearty mouthed a greasy big "a hole". They're both both high school students driving across the desert in the presence of both the chick wedding. After some weird events, they pick a hut-hikka, and then pursue them with some riddles in a giant truck for unknown reasons ... <br /> <br /> The idea that somebody is following is otherwise a Rarely rooted in big cars, but the way the monster truck is used is one of the biggest assets of the film. The truck looks very scary because it is very disturbed and rust, and it makes the incandescent movements around the screen exciting and suspicious. After a while, you start using characters and once entered the Aimee Brooks fray, start to look at things. The film's teen comedy side works well, because Justin Ulrich always provides some entertaining lines of dialogue and the scenes of the Dirty Virgin and the hot female hit-Hicker are quite interesting. When you think that the movie probably can not get any messenger, the thing is strange in the final third. Without destroying things, it can be said that Monster Man shows such last features that are not likely to be seen, and along the way, it is a wonderful thing. Suddenly some people might think - but actually I thought it did a great job because it fits in with the film that does not really fit here ... Above all, this is not a great movie in any way - but if you're innocent Looking for entertainment, Monster Man should hit the spot!
