This image was made in the area where I grew up and now live. I personally know most of the property owners in various locations used in the film. As a teenager, I worked in the adjacent areas of the road showing Ron Pealman, Jonathan Fur and the car about the car. I said that Jonathan Fur and Ben Alison NC resident. I was lucky to see it local. It was one of those people who helped provide locations for movies and live security as a living room (1938 Greyhound). There was no reverse gear on the bus, and during the filming, the driver missed several times his suspension and had traveled a few miles away to return at the right time. The details of the technical issues were enjoyed for me. During the WWII, this film is properly illustrated in this region. A good job film and I anxiously wait for DVD availability.
