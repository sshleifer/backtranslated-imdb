For the third time I tried to see this picture. In the last two times, I started to be so sick of being so sick and "wonderful" that I just stopped watching. However, now I'm a little old and more compulsive, I forced myself to watch all the movies and I was very surprised that I really liked it. So, I see the film in a similar way when I see swimming in the sea, when the water temperature is 70 degrees (about 21-22 degrees Centigrade for all metric-lovers there). Definitely, the water is very cold and flashy, but if you force yourself to stay in the water, then you will use it - so resist the desire to hurry straightaway !! <br /> <br /> The film starts with a long exchange between Flin and her daughter, playing a rural Patty Brady. Someone might make conversations very clever and respectful, but others might find it hard to get them, since these moments are so beautiful and beautiful! On the one hand, it was a fantastic performance of Flin, because it was difficult to imagine playing or acting in real life, especially he wanted to be faithful to a woman in this film - now the work is going on !! Sometimes love says divorced couple, Flin and Parker, and revisit their mutual desires to worry. Since they love each other as well as their drunken children, it seems like a preview concludes that they will tie again. However, there are some serious problems standing on their way: Lucile Watson (who runs the character of her normal over-version and controlling mother-in-law), Flann's girlfriend (lastly, she is Iral Flin and she is divorced, so you lucky she should have a girl) And a marine (played by Forrest Money). <br /> <br /> Unexpectedly, it ends at the end and is happy after all. However, despite being formulas and predictive, the film is a winner because it is so much fun to watch. Flin, despite his reputation as Action-Advanced Hero, is very good with comedy-romance and it's so much fun to see him. Also, this movie is always visible to Chewing Koodles Saakal - he's going to be very nice and sweet in a film that is perfect. And, despite the sweetness, the film is a pretty good writing. The bottom line is that the movie is destroyed. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you watch this movie and not force yourself to drag the movie into the unfortunate sweet sides. Once you've earned it, the rest of the movie is a photo that's valuable to you.
