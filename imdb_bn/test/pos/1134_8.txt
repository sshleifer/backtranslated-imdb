So when I first saw commercial advertisements for Greek, I had a few questions about how they were going to reach Greek life, if they were going to abandon the sacred brotherhood and secrets of sorority, if they were going to focus on a forum on brother and sisterhood or sorority came, Or most college kids think of Greek life as a huge party. Thankfully, it covers everything. The plot of the story was great, it does not want to be loved by anyone, you love, hate, you want to be someone, and of course a crazy roommate! <br /> <br /> Believers are one of my first faces, and I can tell the truth that they hit most of the dead on the nail. <br /> <br /> I love one of the biggest things covered in the morning. The relationship between the rusty and his crazy roommate. It is difficult to move away from home, and force someone to stay in a small room, then come out to find out .. You do not have anything in common. Perhaps the worst nightmare of fresh mums tied in every college <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There was a common girl. What was her? Oh just that .. Ivan is all about himself. Rebecca and Ivan were soon "a matter of" in the season, which seemed quite sympathetic to you. Her character develops, and her relationship with Rusty becomes more and more loving and adventurous. <br /> <br /> Capi is the most fun loving character and absolutely insane. One of my favorite episodes trash them completely in the strip club, and Rusty Kesca calls them to call for hostage. I like how I've tackled gay man's problems in Greek homes, Calvin was a very real emotion character and I respected him because he stuck in his values. So Jane was fairly crazy, but she really liked the rusty. It was wonderful and I started to question him from the beginning, but of course, I would like to work between him and his roster. <br /> <br /> I must wait for the Greek return. It leads you to the truth of Greek life, something that many people see in the past. The biggest thing that is known for frats and sororities is parties and drinks. Greek is a great show, and the letters are easy to relate.
