I think this is called South Gothic. <br /> <br /> This is Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Ricci, and also featured a role in Justin Timberlake. Timberlake works well, I am not surprised to be surprised, I do not expect him. <br /> <br /> When you lose and can not find the way to your home - it is a black snake. <br/> <br /> The people of this movie must have lost in different ways, psychologically and mentally harmful, betrayed by their faithfulness and love and filled with much pain. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson has played a blues singer / musician - whose wife traveled with his brother and now gave him his child, to marry a child he wanted to live with him <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> When the young man is victim of sexual abuse - it has become a self destructive nymphomaniac; Allow people to treat him badly. <br /> <br /> The story is in the cover of these two characters. This is a love story, but not the story of sexual love, among them - old black people and young white women. <br /> <br /> This is different from most Hollywood movies. <br /> <br> I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10 stars
