Here we ignore the disrespectful Charlie Chaplin's serious issue of semism and his past in order to deal with serious issues of general intolerance. He portrays two letters - sweet, innocent Jewish sailor - a war veteran, and the raving and ruthless tyrannical, Adenod Hinkel. The Jewish civil war in this country is not safe for a long time, because it relies on its temperament in the day or week, because of the sharpness of Hankel and its armed lip, who regularly object to its residents, or leave them. They are repeatedly in their midst, but their former commanding officer, Shultz (Reginald Gardner) is made friends, because Hennkel seems to be quiet for some time until he is often condemned in the camp. He wanted the Jews to seek refuge with the Jews, especially repeatedly, and the skilled young woman, Hannah (Palette Goddard). Who will be able to live their lives to get rid of Hawkel and his Chronicles? We do not need to guess too hard to know the answer; The horse is a dead pigment for the dictatorship, and he came out of the picture as well as Shulz in the entire military gear. In the country of Henna Australik, she escaped with friends from a number of guests, where Mr Jackell (Morris Moskovich) cousins ​​have a farm and they can live peacefully for a while. Right now, Henkel has been arrested by the Armed Forces, he is considered to be infamous repeatedly. Subsequently, Skelej was taken to the podium to create the lecture for declaration of Austrian victory. In the ensuing ten minutes, Chaplin denies himself the pure, tolerant, love and heart of liberty, and greed and hatred. Albuet Chaplin's production began in 1937, which may be furious. He was aware of the harassment and harassment of the harassment and said that he was quite familiar, he never made the film, because he probably believed that the situation would be intensified. He has an outstanding supporting actor: Reginald Gardner, Henry Daniel Garbich, his partner-day-camp, the all-time amazing healing, Pallet Guards, Jack Okty as the dictator Napoleon, as the contestant to be the victor, the best European actor David Gorski (Leo's father). Maurice Moskovich, among others. The scene that he did with dancing with the world, only with a musical instrument, with its intense inspiration and brightness, as well as at the end of the film, the Pallet Guards were laughing with his tears. I've seen this picture before, but it's always something new for me. Last evening, when I was finished I sat in tears. I defy anyone that did not move by it.
