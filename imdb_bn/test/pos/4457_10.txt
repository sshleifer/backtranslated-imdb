The name "Lucio Fulci" graphic depicts pictures of death and images of the conviction between fans. Thanks to films such as "Zombi 2", "Living Dead City", "The Bound" and "The New York Ripper", Phulasi is known as one of the most important managers of history. And in the next few movies, until the release of "Zombi 2" in 1979, it certainly justified his fame, but the quantity of blood in flowering films and the amount that he knows does not contain almost anywhere, in fact they are mostly free. More traditional shock and work depends on the boring image. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some are different, shunning them often are very incredible. After the continuation of the killing of children, many people tried to uncover the truth of the killing with Andara Martelli (Thomas Milan), in which they happen. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary movie. It is very good with an excellent cast filled with so many favorites of Italian exploitation film. It also has a solid score as well as many creative camera movement courtesy or Lucio Fulci. But the real attraction of the movie is "Druking to Durning No". About twelve-year-old children are mocked by people with disabilities, visiting prostitution and being offered sex by an elderly woman. It contains some very quoted commentary on the middle class and the Catholic Church. This is for reasons that "do not get disconnected for the first time" were blacklisted in Europe and it has never been shown in America. Nevertheless, "Do not torture a docking" as well as Lucio, as well as the Gayo film, has become a significant achievement for Phosphian's best work. I can not really recommend this one, check it out.
