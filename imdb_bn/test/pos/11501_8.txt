This picture is based on a true story. The novelist who carries the same title is Inner Mur Gourmundson, a brother who was mentally ill. I made this film very mumbling, the main character's path fell ill, after determining how he tried to live, and how he friends of psychological organizations, all of them are very convincing. There are several fantastic fun facts in the manuscript. Its title gives away nothing about the story. You must understand it ... and listen to the music, which is moving and turning your heart and soul backwards and the film is going on. One must look for each one.
