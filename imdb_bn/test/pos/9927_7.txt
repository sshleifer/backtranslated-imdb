It does not matter how bad this matter is, the film is not as good as it is. Perhaps I was confused by numerous countless reviews at IMDB, but I have hoped for a lot more ... <br /> <br /> Sure, the idea is good, violent scenes and cameras- Excellent, fantastic Dario's imagination is exciting, but the film "Dirt" has been made by some mistakes which I think is inappropriate. After all, am I one of the few people who think that heavy metal music plays the most intense scene only to separate the atmosphere ??? During the "needle" scene, it was intense, with a variety of music (Gobinee ?????)! ... instead, the soundtrack destroys any chance for tension ... Second, the final kill scene and the last few moments of the film are simply stupid and stupid. I do not want to say "amateur" because I like Argentine movies. Finally I feel empty Talk about a final impression! This is rarely done in most of Dario's picture! However, by admitting, Susariya is also suffering from a final finish (though most of it is bright). <br /> <br /> In short, watch this movie, try to create most of its best points, but as well be prepared for some bad ones. This is not a perfect movie in any way.
