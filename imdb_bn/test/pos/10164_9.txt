I kept the second version of "The Man Who New Too Much" in my top 10 hitcos movies. Together with "frenzy", it is probably the most controversial film among fans of Hitachi. I say, "Rebecca" is considered to be a lot better than that, which has earned a lot of great value. <br /> <br /> There are many impressive scenes in this movie (most of them are mentioned in other reviews), but this would be expected from some of the hitcoaks. Things take about half an hour to really start, but that time is used to prepare for the following events, which are confusing mysteries. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the strange rear projection but only the weakness of this movie is played by the main villain, Bernad Miles, who is a rather flat and undisputed character. Thankfully, there is a horrific killer in the form of Regi Naldar. And Hann, little boy, is not annoying like most of the older movies.
