There are many 'Top 10 Listings' which can easily fit "The Dead" - the best screen drunk, best adaptation to the music, best written for movies, the best use of poetry, the best screen lecture, the best collected cast and, finally, , The best film ever made. This was the last and greatest movie of John Houston, adapted by James Sonny's short story from his son Tony and set in the evening of Epiphany's Feast of Dublin in 1904. This is a setting, essentially, a setting of Morkan sisters, and a great deal does not occur in the conventional 'dramatic' position. They entertain their guests; There have been singing, dancing, sending, and talking a lot, but seeing this movie, you can not imagine anywhere else that you want to be rather than this company. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's almost 'too much', much more. It's about stabilizing mainstays, love, harm and regret for those who like it. In the last scene of the film, Bertell de Arcy, (Frank Patterson), sang a song, 'The Las of Oghurm', which is involved in the mind of the Géréille, Gabriel's wife (Angelica Huston), (Donald McCann), her first and perhaps the greatest love ghost , A son who died with all the certainty of broken heart at the age of seventeen, and suddenly Gabriel realized that he He never knows his wife and he is not the great love of his life, above all. Emotionally, these scenes are incredibly strong, first, Greya describes the situation of her boyfriend's death, and then Gabriel's voice highlights his own feelings. This awesome movie, Houston and McCann delivered nicely to the solidarity. <br /> <br /> But all the performances are remarkable. It plays the highest sequence and when it makes an actor stand out on the other side, the screen gives us more favorite, genuine or tightly drunk than Donald, or delivered the poem with the passion that Shawn McClory, ("The Quiet Man" Man), here comes the translation of Lady Gregory's translation of 'Donal Og'? Yoga has been added, of course, that Houston itself was near death when she finished this work in my life, which seems to her mind. Death may be its central theme, but seeing this movie is a lifelong experience.
