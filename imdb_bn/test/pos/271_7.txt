The third entry of the "Stepford" franchisee, but apparently three-dimensional TVs are incredibly vague and difficult to find, while Blockbuster Remix is ​​usually popular and very popular with the original and Nikol Kidman of the 70s. I did not see the first 80's "Revenge of Stephough Wiese" or "The Stapford Husband" of mid-90s, but this "The Stepford Child" is a very interesting and very entertaining little movie. It is essentially the exact same film as the original; Definitely less mysterious yet many cheesier and incredibly nt degree 80's. The main difference here is that it is not only a freedom fighter, but the city's rebel and satirical children carry the licensed "Stepford Treatment" of the local Manas Association. For some reason, the scene tries to keep Stephen's mystery up until the film's end, although there is no possibility of seeing this sequel before testing the original, and perhaps everyone knows about it's denial. Harding family packs all packs and grisly from New York to Stephen to prepare small and peaceful communities to move. Especially father Steven was excited about his new life, because he had already lived in St Stephen and always wanted to return from his first wife, Mary and David, their new wife Laura and adolescents, know very little, died in mysterious circumstances. The city is almost perfect, with neighboring neighbors and model students, and especially the modern young people face huge problems. Modernization of the place and the local youth of Stanford, due to clash with the overwhelmingly urban colonizers, especially the men's association members, and put the family relations under much pressure. David School meets Lloyes's last "normal" girl and falls, but when she turns domestic Domine on the night of night, David can convince his doubtful soil to secretly investigate Stanford's horror. The "Stanford kids" may be slowly and steadily slowly and gradually gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually and gradually, like the charming 80's thriller, the modus behind Stanford's secret mystery is gradually gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, gradually, The operation has been detailed in more detail, and I think the horror fans of the original film and Lovers will appreciate it. At least, I did. The overall plot still does not make much sense and the script is shiny to the illogical aspects, but it is a compelling source and undoubtedly one that reveals the atmosphere with anxiety and fear. Performance is more than average. Especially the hateful and objectionable members of the men's association have featured commendable characters and even Tammy Lauren and Randall Battincoof of teenage players. Recommended without hesitation!
