A few years ago I saw this repetition of the 60th classic with the Mini Cooper for the first time and it seems like it's a lot. Now, about two years later it was shown on television and I just want to know that I would love to see it in movies. Well, the answer is yes. <br /> <br /> This picture is about a group of robbers who will make a final work in Venice in Italy. The plan is flawless and execution is perfect. They do not have to escape and work for the rest of their life. But there is a problem among them that did not take them into consideration: No one likes to share looting in their own position, but they want to keep it for themselves, even when it means killing the rest of the members. But all but one survives and they are out for revenge. A year later, in Los Angeles this time, the surviving party members have made a smart and terrible plan to steal behind gold and retaliate ... <br /> <br /> Your own story must of course not be too original, because it The original 1969 is a re-establishment of the film, but there are plenty of offers to forget about it. This is a common hest / action movie, but it is certainly one of the better ones. The action is very nice, landscapes and the real eye candy in Venice, the story is fine and special effects are stunning. Even acting is very good, something which you will not see often in an action movie. I have admitted that I really liked what I saw and I paid it well for the 7.5 / 10 film.
