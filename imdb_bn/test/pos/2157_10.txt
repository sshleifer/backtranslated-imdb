Hard Justice is a wonderful worker movie! The whole movie is really nothing but shooting and war but it has a very good vampire plot! People who say they are not firing and do not kill the way they use movies. Well, this one is really hard core! Don 'The Dragon' Wilson is excellent and his character is really great in the movie. Nicholas was very good and he stole the show with reason! She really perform as a fantastic villain! Melanie Smith was good. I think this very fine looking actress is very underrated. Michael Cavanaugh was good. This film was really cool to see Vince Maddocco! For action, it's really awesome with all gun battles and super cool battle scenes. This photo war really was the biggest sight! There have been many such occasions during the 86-minute run. To give you this movie for action fans, all fire energy and excellent fight will be blown away! Night Hunter is a film that can not be easily detected and if you are in a video store and you buy it for sale, but it is a great buy and a plus box is great! Believe there is a ton of action! You can find some good deals at eBay, Half.com, Amazon.com's Z-Shops and Market Place Sellers and see! According to me Knight Hunter is the greatest war film ever I have ever seen and the characters are so fair If you like Dawn 'The Dragon Wilson' and want to see Nicholas guests a great performance, I strongly recommend that a film fan who likes shoots, movies and pancake films and is frustrated by other movies. A true non-stop action flick look but fail to deliver the Knight Hunter today and buy it!
