This movie turned pretty much what I expected. Of course this is sad, of course it is predictable. We all know the story. But knowing when you go visit it, it is enjoyable enough to visit. It was fun and sweet. I am nervous that they did not like children's kids or those who do not like kids or maths, or they do not wear t-shirts about maths and maths and kids find boring as a smoker. I was an outcast in high school and I did not do this thing. It goes deeper than that. Along with doing so much, how much money your family has, how willing you are to conceal your uniqueness and how willing you are to be expected to be the other kids. However, I will not get it. I do not agree with another opinion that Drew is not a genius. With Bresce, no makeup and uneducated hair, I do not think many people will be drowned on it. Even when he goes back to high school and runs them. He is still wearing "wrong" clothes, "wrong" hair and the "wrong" attitude has been considered calm. And his other "gaique" friend can be nice but no matter where, from where I came from, you can still be shameless and beautiful. (Inside and outside)
