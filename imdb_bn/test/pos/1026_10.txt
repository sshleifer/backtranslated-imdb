As a reminder for any comment on this fantastic BBC Mini series, published in 1981, it was not available on DVD for the last few years. Then, it became available, but initially only in British format (for which I bought an 'international' DVD player, which you have to hack - illegally, I can see it), but the series is now available through amazon.com - 3 discs - $ 19-21, DVD will be seen in US format, there is no hacking. There were 41 reviews, average 5 stars. This mini series is the best of Openhimar or Manhattan Project or the best produced by the BBC.
