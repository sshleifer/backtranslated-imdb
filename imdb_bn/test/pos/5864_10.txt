I kept this picture in mind that another person commented. I recorded it on it but now it was with me because it was one of the worst movies. Funny, a real bad way. I think the tag line in the box was "final frontal lobotomy". I got it from my mother, who got it from a friend who saw it was the worst / interesting movie ever seen, so my mother said, "My son will probably like it." And the woman gave it just to get it from her right. I taped on her later, which I'm sorry. I remember, the "cork screw" thing is that one of the ball catcher things .... .... the size of the yellow cones, a red "button" at the end, and when you hit the red object, it sends a ball flying. Well, they used a crank on one end and a funnel of funnel. When the killer killed him, they saw him come out with "arms" and then looked like the chicken and the net blood on the predator's head. I do not know what to say about this "Gem" if you like bad movies but it does not get worse than that.
