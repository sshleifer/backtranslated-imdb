In 1980 or in 812 accidentally I caught this little gem. I used to watch two old intelligent sci-fi movies in an old theater. Theater was full pack and (with no warning) they showed a bunch of sci-fi short spoofs (to get our mood). Most were fun, but it came and the listeners were in a few seconds! The biggest smile came when they "Rajkumar Liya" made huge cinnamon instead of the hair of her head. He watches the camera, gives a great smile and nods. That made it even fun! You have to look "flabby" looks like a muppet! It was too stupid and stupid ... but I could not laugh. Due to most laughter most of the dialogue was drowned. Also, if you know "Star Wars" very well, it's more fun - they deliberately make fun of the conversation. This really works with an audience! A specific 10!
