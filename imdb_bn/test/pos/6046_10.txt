Hey Senna Sen. I'm sorry, but there is an SGG in the army and you are not eligible to comment on a marine movie because of the Army National Guard. Because you are not a marine and you wear a uniform just because you can not be related to be a marine. We are the best, we have the most difficult training, yes we have a big head of ourselves, but when you are the best, you prefer to strat your stuff. I was attacked in Iraq and in Falujah. I fought beside the soldiers. You are not "qualified" to say something about my Marine Corps. I hate the whole "branch that's good", but you do not have the right to say that you're worthy of judging a Marine movie. Oh yes ..... we do not have Drill Instructor ....... Drill SGT. You have no idea about what you are talking about, this is the biggest formula. Yes we no longer "curse" in recruitment. Tell me, how to train someone to make better marine? How can someone make Marine better Marine? Yes it is a type of boot camp through what I do. But we are dealing with different times and people. We are training those who are smart at all over the appointment of our generation. We do not want intelligent recruitment, does not mean. And anyone who signed up to Marine in the first place, dedicated to the proposal that should be given to his country. We do not have that bootcamp strong. Mourin wants to be a killer to come to the bootcamp. They do not need to teach them that they swear to them and beat them and destroy them. At least as I feel. And yes, I say "worthy" to say I am on the battlefield many times and I trained Marine and Recruits who finally ended up on the battlefield. But then again, I know what. I just got there, that worked, T-shirt. Army SGT ....... Get a formula!
