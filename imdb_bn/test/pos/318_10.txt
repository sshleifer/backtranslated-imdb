When I was broadcasting for the first time in British television in 1985, I first saw epocalipes. After watching this excellent work, I was a shell shock and despite some close competition from the rings' choice of choice, this movie has been my favorite for almost 20 years after my first time <br /> <br /> How do I start to comment on the movie? We can I can appreciate the technical aspects, especially the sound, editing and cinematography, but everyone praised this achievement (in fact) very well in high heaven, especially Robert Duval's performance and especially the others. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Francis Ford Coppola is known as the best director, but as a director he is a genius as a genius, I had said in the past "because" because of the creation of this film, every creative brain cell seems to have burned down, but his sacrifice was worth it. . We have a script in John Milius's original unit draft which is as insane and annoying on screen, but Coppola's involvement in Scrapplell has given injunction to a narrative that actually reflects the war. Check out how Steepe started with Stirla's Billboards on all Jinggostics and Macho, who could not find the place in Green Barrett, but the story becomes even more frustrating and insane everything, so while watching the cutters postpost, viewers are seeing another movie similarly. The way the characters have gone to another level. When Coppola says "this movie is not about Vietnam - it's Vietnam" he is right. In the mid-1960s, the setting of the film at the start of the stop of the patriotic war (the Monson Trials has been proposed in the 1970s) changed the American world's view of the world and instead of the global perspectives of myself and America. <br /> This is now the insane beauty of the Unchaloopes, Films make a masterwork and Michael Cruelty and hypocrisy of politicians than urera conflict (what you did in the Vietnam War, Mr. President?) Says more about the running time. May hope to tell a lifetime. I did not see the RedWeek version, but I do not seem to see the original print that there is no absence from the story which is very basic like the really cool movies. In fact, this court can lend itself to other branches of the West, where a military officer should be kept in custody and a rebel colonel should be killed, who is running an Iranian war party or a non-UN colleague of a United Nations, who is a soldier who is involved in the Defense of Mars Going forward, though perhaps it is Jose /> <br /> The real source of Conrad's novel is with my beloved movies, and it <br is very appropriate that this movie, I took one of my hajaratama review.
