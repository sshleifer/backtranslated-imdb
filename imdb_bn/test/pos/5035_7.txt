This movie was captured on TV and I saw it again. I said to myself, this film has been long since, so why not. And again this movie makes me happy. It's so easy, so watch and so human that I do not know why some people dislike it. <br /> <br /> John Travolta Michael (his dance and every move), may be very rarely associated with this word as an angel. He smokes, drinks and he eats something like savage, but he has a big heart. On his way Michael helps all the people he meets. Dorothy Winters (Andy McDowell) found her on a song and finding the right man. Frank Quinnlan (William Hart) has made himself a good and honest man. Michael even helped the ancient Pansy Milbank (John Stapleton) - the last scene in the street is beautiful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Robert Patroli shows his talent. Gene Stapleton and Dave Garo are good, but my favorite supporter Bob Hossisin tablet owner in this movie. <br /> <br /> So here we got a strong story about people with a warm story. Interesting cast Just do not take this movie seriously and can make sure that you make fun of me.
