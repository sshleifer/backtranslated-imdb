Sadly, this movie was highlighted in 'Curio' status. I've asked that many people "You know Monkees made a movie?" Generally the answer 'no' is said to be, if you are one of those big numbers, I suggest you see it, but with the following cats: if you expect monkey style humor it is there. This is not just like TV shows. <br /> <br /> Yes, they are trying to break their TV mold, by making it fun, they are doing some fun like a young teenager. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are a Monks fan then you can recognize the jobs that you are taking on the commercialization of the band. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Best friends after watching it in 5 minutes: "This is a weird movie, man." Actually it might be good if you do not try to understand it, just come back and give feedback. It's weird, it's funny, it's a bit real, it's experimental (still) ... it's a lot. Overall, it is an experience.
