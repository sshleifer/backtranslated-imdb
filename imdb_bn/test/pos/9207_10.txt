I think Josh Dahheel is so great !! The rest of the show is fun to watch, but, I think it's handsome and sexy Josh Dühmel that makes the show "Las Vegas" really fun !! In the days of "Magnum" I love Tom Seleck, I thought he was the world's most sexy man! It is necessary to watch some of the women, especially for discouraging entertainment, only a narrowness of television shows! I need to "do something" to win a date with Ted Hamilton !! Josh Duffel is incredible and I will always have a super crash on him! Josh certainly hook !! And I'll always see "Las Vegas", why Josh Dümbell is a big reason !!
