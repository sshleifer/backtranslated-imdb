Just watched this movie on weekends, and I must say that I enjoyed it completely. 2 Italian actors are excellent as usual (Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia). It is clear that the director was influenced by the Italian filmmakers' two past films. He was initially influenced by Dino Rusi and his film Isle Sørpsø. This is the story of two young people who became stories and friends by the story. One is extrverted and the other is intrverted. They enjoy the whole day together and at the end of the day, the shy person says that their normal routine is more than life alone. The same thing will happen to Albert de Santi. Unfortunately, IL Sorosso also found a similar ending and apparently it influenced the director of On Run because he used the same technique but gave a twist. I was surprised to see that something was expected but turned out to be the opposite. You have to understand when you see both movies. Other films that have influenced the director include HOTEL after the operation of Hot Italian American Scorses. I highly recommend all 3 movies !!
