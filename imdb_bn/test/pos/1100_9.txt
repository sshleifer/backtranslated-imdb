I was surprised to see confusion about the title of this photo. It is obviously the investigation of the nature of modern love. Love is believed to be a time of love for love, but in which people have the right to put themselves first, and if it becomes difficult then they will go out and go to something else. <br /> <br /> This Generation Generation Generation has come from Generation X, commented on Generation X and finally noticed the Generation X. It is frustrating that it has turned into love that the love of childhood, the parents of Generation X, were involved in their marriage and family life, which Generation X had finally enjoyed innocent and liberal childhood. <br /> <br /> Generation X Generation Expression is inevitable, but decisions are made and promises have broken, the biggest accident is the children of Generation X. At the end of this film it became clear, and I took a week to recover from the shock I received from this epiphany.
