I do not have to say anything about how good this documentary is - it's an extraordinary part of a real true narrative. The story is simple: A white senior citizen tourist was killed by a black man in Florida, and the arrested boy is abused and only judged by the government defender and his family. It is very provocative, and the public defender is happy to monitor all of his human ways - you can not help but achieve the victory of justice and the final supplement may be expected from the real story. <Br /> <br /> It is a shame that the documentary did not see it, but hopefully you will find a way to see it. For the people interested in racial relations in the United States and for the real functioning of law enforcement laws and legal procedures, it's worth your time and effort to find your documentary. I give it a 10.
