This is a great Italian shark film, which is probably not the complete action type of shark movie, but it's a great story about a Native American, a great story in the form of an attacker in a small sea community. The film is not the real scene of the actual sharks, but it is very good that how they made it, this shark is not as bright as the film, but it shows good performance in other Italian shark films (such as cruel jaws, the last shark), they show some bad acting. Most Italian shark films are good, meaning that this is the best Italian shark movie, as well as the best Some scenes in E-film show Violent / Gore which makes this film look good so that it shows me the best film for all shark-movie-fans.
