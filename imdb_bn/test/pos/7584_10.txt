The horses of Mars are a composite animated short, sometimes playable with the eyes of evolution, sometimes playful. The story is personal, and sometimes sensitive, and supported by strong digital animations and descriptions, which are involved in the story of this science fiction story. I was fortunate to see this brief in the format of the 2002 Sandans Film Festival and remember that when the small screen is transferred, the readers will lose some of their ability to send less thoughtful stories and stunning graphics.
