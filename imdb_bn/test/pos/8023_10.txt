Watch the scene: A disgruntled student is just ahead of an empty day, a video shop with special offers of 5 videos for week rentals. This former student has usually taken a heap of suspicious quality videos for the most arbitrary suspense (looking at someone?). Occasionally the strange search made in his VCR - this is the case with this film. Everything about the movie is good, but more than that can provide all the nets very rarely - a cracking good movie. The movie release of the UK was never outside of me, especially when we consider the shit we will have to multiplex week in a week. Although I would gladly accept it, it is not an Oscar material (but Titant-Siddle-CGI-Tied Bowlers were not wasted), this is a very enjoyable movie. I am trying to think of how good / acceptable this film is to be - the perfect movie to watch while ties with your father after coming to the holidays after Thursday's Thursday Luncheon.
