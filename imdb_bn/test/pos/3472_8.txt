Let's make it clear from the beginning: I have a cavity with the mental sensitivity of the solid stone. So I consider the disabilities, social stigma, or any of their ailments, and cry over it, and it's like poorly stupid movies about it. I mean, if you have a message, you can tell it with the help of the sick or kind people. <br /> <br /> However, I liked this movie. It is about people with incredible misfortunes like personal health, but they do not cry about it, on the contrary they try to live and people try to "take care" of them by actively moving them away. Life. The message is full of life, though the end is as sad as possible. <br /> <br /> My conclusion: The sick people go play, it's a keeper. It's tragic, yet optimistic. I like James MacAye, even if he always seems to play the arrogant rebel. I say Steven Robertson has played very well. Is that he or she really have partial paralysis. :)
