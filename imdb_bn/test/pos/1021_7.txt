An enjoyable movie, without any doubt, and a very specific stage in its era and the 'style of the end' of any boy. But I want to say that after reading very positive comments here, I was a little disappointed. The time was captured, but the plot was extremely thin. The whole incident springs some of the most harmful in the history of school plays. The idea that Quack quack will only select not only one of the three star kites, but is a philanderer, risible. And without that, NADA. Sub-plots were not related to any relation that I can see near the main plot - they can be completely removed as soon as they are effected in all the main ways - which certainly indicate a basic error. When all your sub-plots look like padding, you know that a central concept is beyond its limits. Despite that, it is in the right place with an heartwarming movie, there are some good performances and you just feel everyone has felt the obstacle in the final 'cut'! That good feeling permeates the film. And that has been counted for something. A defective really pretty good movie. 10 out of 7
