It is not often that the TV series holds me directly from the bat; I added my seat to download the latest Surface pilot, after which I got to learn what I learned about this excellent series immediately. In my dishonor, despite the strong ratings and extremely favorable reviews I have rejected, it was canceled after only a 15-episode. However, I've achieved the remaining episodes, and I've seen the first 5 or 6 best televisions I've seen. Fantastic from the start, fantastic, and another reviewer commented, I love each episode with a huge finish how they love. I imagine watching it every week, I scream with tension and just captivated, will be desperately waiting for the next episode to be released. Growing, I've always heard how soon serial movies were used, to finish the rush again for the next stage with a huge cliffhanger. Well, it seems or somebody else has decided to close the case, and obviously behind this show people must see the wall text, because after the episode 6, there is certainly a chance to go for worse. I do not want to say that the episodes are actually getting bigger but the plot elements have become much cleid and I mean the final episode has deceived me. I just wish the producers of the show have been given a fair chance. * Only * other occasions that made me feel the first season of the Stargate SG-1, which is very loud, very "true", animated and made from the heart. Surface was a great series, and perhaps one day, some well-heeled TV lover will see all the emotions about canceling the show and returning the show. One, at least can expect. :)
