I thought it was an excellent movie. Gary Kole played the role of a military personality who feels dissatisfied with his wife and feels unwelcome to his wife! Above all, I thought the film was fantastic, certainly not a boring plot line! It's tragic, but I think many people can feel this way. I think he has only got a divorce and he has to move what he said to move instead of his utmost efforts, but he felt that he had no other choice, so he found his death. I think it was clear that the wife of the house of the cell acted in the wife, she was dissatisfied with the movie. I think the man was a furious extreme, but the movie was great! Definitely recommend it!
