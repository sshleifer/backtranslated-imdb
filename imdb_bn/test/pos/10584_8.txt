I just saw this image left because I really loved him, but after seeing it I did not like him much. I mean, his performance was good and I guess, but whenever it shows a completely unnecessary skate scene, I was telling myself, "All right, we know you're a professional skateboarder, can we now return to Ryan Duncan?" Don, Reyck and Brandon really made movies from my perspective. <br /> <br /> I noticed that Jenny Revel (apparently) and Miss Rothstein both were in Hogarde, but who is dating the left at that time? However, I actually enjoyed Haggard and I think this is really another movie I've ever seen. It's sort of its own section.
