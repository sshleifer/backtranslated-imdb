I just do not see so bad about this movie. I like this movie! I was the best movie of this movie series. Although Part 3 is best in the series, I still have 10 out of 10 films because it's great. I do not see what this movie hates. Who does not want to see just a little bit of the crater function. I want Brad Brown to appear in this one because it can make it even better. Those who love a little drama because ... wait I will not tell you, you just have to see it. This movie has some popular actors ... (I do not tell you because I hate him when people give spoilers so I do not want to be among them). Well guess I guess all I have to say about this movie.
