These immortal lines were started by The Jack Starr, the best-known opera, 'Deon Brothers'. The center of the plot is centered around Wester Virginia brothers (Stacey Kitch and Frederick Forest), about two blue-colored robbers who use money to open a seafood restaurant !! What follows is quite an adventure, and many comedic events ensue. The action scene consists of all the top notch and some nicely understood shootouts. The latter is absolutely amazing and a derelict building is destroyed by a debris ball! This film is now famous director Terrence Malik and wrote the first look of Margot Kidder. Above all, one of the best hidden gems of 70 and easily one of the best action / comedy hybrids was created. Hopefully it gets a decent widescreen DVD release soon.
