This movie shamefully puts the Hollywood "Tiezercars". The illustrated emotions are subdued and understated in a very comfortable fashion. Plenty of clutches with a limited role of terminal term (it is not a satirical and very early in the film). The execution procedure is totally different from any of your love stories - even a kiss was not exchanged and you still have to experience enormous current love in two leads. Initially, I had considered this "limitation on feeling" similar to the general "previous values", but it was later decided against it. <br /> <br /> This picture is so different that if you compare movies with "movie" Paradiso ", CPP will feel overtly manipulative by comparison. <br /> <br /> After watching this picture, I It is a strong feeling that Hollywood-based films love movies, (or love movies around, show greatness) or emotions and label it as "love." I am sure that we all have their own definitions and I will not say The qualities are mutually exclusive. But, I want to say that the movie will surprise you if you have any related measurements with you, you like it. <br /> <br /> It is very clear that I enjoy this movie, the film is so easily visible Considering this, I see a lot of it as a "cinematic" movie.
