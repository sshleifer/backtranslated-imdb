I always had a second life of my father and 51 was waiting for the development of Birch Street when I was sitting and seeing it for the first time. Surprisingly, the journey of this movie took me to places where I was not expected and gave me a review of the guesswork and the judgment. An amazing personal story was called tricky but straightforward. I especially enjoyed the use of filmmakers to find out the style of his mother's daily diary - very effective. I have read the previous comment and noticed that it is good to see the word and doubt that the film has changed somewhat or the theater can contribute to the poor quality of words for other writers.
