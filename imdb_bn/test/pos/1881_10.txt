Generally, I do not review it online, but Saturday and I have been stuck in rainy days on rainy days but I do not see science f fi movies and JSA: Warrior's Princess (I can not find the enemy Joxer) Space 'Outside my head, last ten years or more It's time, when someone (I) do something stupid, just pops randomly. If you make a complaint about this movie and actually post it on the internet then you have no idea how stupid you want to look? If you expect more than the Bruce Campbell (most literally) than you see why his GD's holy name is watching movies? Some people do not see the Buddha Campbell movie when they want to see some talented and intelligent, we see them so that we feel better about ourselves (such as see Jerry Springer and those who eat chanki monkeys), and can be easily entertained by psychological idiots. I personally, love Bruce Campbell movie. I'm not completely stupid, in fact, I see myself as an intellectual and a scholar (Hah, Shut Up, Allie). His films can be fun, insanely, curious, ridiculous in the brain that screams or screams with the brain. That, and he was kind of sexy on Xena: Warrior Princess with even facial hair, I rate this movie a nice 10 rating, because I can. If you can not take the available plots-schemes (if any), hot babes (skin, spandex) and madness in science files are not known if you are not known, rush out, do not see the movie (or Bruce Campbell's name refers to so much Any). Oh yes, Ted Raimi was awesome in this movie! Tede way to go! You did not do well with you. ; |
