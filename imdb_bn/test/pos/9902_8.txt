Being "checking out" is a very malicious and honest portrayal of a wicked family to be Jewish. Judaism does not play virtually any role in the film, but American Jewish culture and behavior is thoroughly sent ... it is a loving way. I discuss this picture with religious perspectives that the subjects searched for it, because I think it was interesting. <br /> <br /> I have never been a penmoon fan, so I was not familiar with Peter Falak - he's so much fun to see. Judge Reynold, Laura San Giacomo and David Pemarar were happy to see again - why they do not work even more? They all are colorful The script is terrible with many memorable one-liners I'm sure to use with my own family. See as doorman for Gavin McLeod (Captain Stubing!)
