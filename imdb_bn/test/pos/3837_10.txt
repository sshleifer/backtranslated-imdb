I really enjoyed this movie and I do not usually like animated pictures. But I was attracted to cats and story lines were charming. There is a good song called "Avivvy wants to be a cat", which makes a lot of fun. It has some comic moments and an interesting adventure. I think this film helps to be a warm cat lover to enjoy.
