The 20th animated Disney classics are often criticized as poor by "intermediate" or quality, but it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> It is very bad that you are not able to get "Aristocats". I personally see it as one of my favorite Disney classics. <br /> <br /> Despite being extremely emotional, it is one of the most fun Disney classics. It is full of moments of sunshine (some of them, violent) moments. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Edgar, Govi ​​Butler, villain in the movie but he is the perfect comic relief. She is one of my favorite Disney villains. Because he's so funny. <br /> <br /> Napoleon and Lafayette are looking at each of the scenes of Edgar and the Hound dogs, which you will ever see, especially when Adger pursues his motorcycle in the river and around the bridge, following the dogs. <br /> <br /> <br /> But classic humor does not just come from adgo or horse dogs. Other characters have their moments as well. <br /> <br /> Regarding the standard subject, it is not perfect, but remains on a higher level. Despite the death of Walt Disney, those artists remain faithful to Walt's soul and "the Aristocats" is one of their examples. They do not like them nowadays! <br /> <br /> Naturally, the legendary Disney actor voices the characters. In this case, we have Phil Harris, Sterling Holley, Paul Winchle, Eve Gabre and Pat Batram. These characters are generally cold: Thomas O'Mallley, Duchess and his three children, Mouse Rockford, Galley Cat, English Hijs, Fox Dog and Horse. Human characters include: Bright and kind of retired opera singer Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, old lawyer of the comic Madame George Hutcourt and Edgar himself! About the soundtrack, there are some nice and interesting songs in it, for example, Thomas O'Malley's theme (but I can not remember his name), "Everything is Win bit Beat" and "The Aristocats" (Morris Chevalier's song). <br /> <br /> <br /> In 1910 Paris (France) was held. Above all, it's a delightful, beautiful and very beautiful movie. A timeless classic which is often undeveloped and forgotten, but very useful. <br /> <br /> This must be the top 250.
