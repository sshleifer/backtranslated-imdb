I really enjoy this picture. It is such a view, when this nation was truly at risk for countries that fought or fought against us, such as the Japanese and the Germans. Robert Cumming and Priscilla Lane lead role was excellent. Supporters cast ... Auto Krueger, Allan Backster, Clim Bevenis and Norman Lloyd were also outstanding. The direction, speed, and the end held and continued to hold my interest. So much, I bought my own copy. Thanks to Mars for the Turnar Classic movie, they look really real classic films with these. <br /> <br /> Robert Cumming certainly did not have light weight as an actor and although I was a great fan of Gary Cooper and Joel McCracky, my two favorite actors, whose first major role was played, I did not see what role Bob Cummings Exceeded performance <br /> <br /> This is a film that I enjoy watching the repetition and encouraging others to see.
