I was lucky enough to win POD's sneak preview free pass. Only you can say, I was excited to see it from the preview only! The movie just throws! I really liked what it was about that JB had its elements. "Rock School", along with other films, he names Namibi Pambi for children and family, but this music is probably all about it. <br /> <br /> I went with my brother and sister to see it, and we basically laugh at the whole time There are some places in which I wonder what they think, because some items are a bit different, but in most cases it was great. Sometimes it does not look like a low-budget movie, so it's a plus. <br /> <br /> I was most surprised as Dave Planell as Satan. That's a sunny f-ing! <br /> <br /> I said, if you are a Rock fan and go to Jeb, KG, and / or Tennesses De, watch the movie. Be prepared for most drug references, a lot of four letter words and some empty shielding rocks!
