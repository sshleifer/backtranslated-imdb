Briefly: fight it and everyone involved in it's hell. People try to do good, but interfere in interests, allegiances and so-called duties. This picture is rarely seen in today's movie that we move in times of civil war. Simple intense images of an acute beauty. Throw the stars very well for the story of the actors and they come to life really close to our eyes. <br /> <br /> Under one rupee dollar!
