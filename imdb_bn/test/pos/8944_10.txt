When I was surfing the channel, I accidentally entered the movie in Cinemax. I must admit Christopher Walken who attracted me. And the setting I kind of like, so I started to see it. At first I had hoped for a serious drama film, and it seemed like something ... until I started moving here and there, and before that I knew that I was so light-hearted through the film. I really like it really fine and light heart, but there is a huge impact on the viewers. The plot is very simple, and so many are still far from trying to be as funny as many Hollywood "comedy", even though it almost rolled me into the room. One will have a beautiful evening rest, or look for that case anytime.
