"St. The Over Over" star George Sanders, like Simon Templar, archived the 1978 archive "The Saint". It stars Wendy Bari, Jonathan Hale and Paul Guillaume. On board the board on the way to the United States, The Saint tries to spend time with a woman (Wendy Bari) who gave him a brush. Simon is coming to New York to help Inspector Furnak, now the gangster completely refuses the frame-up; $ 50,000 was not found in his home. Gangster, Rookie (Roland Drew), of course, was not found guilty in the trial and he and his fellow mobsters paid bills for frames and attorneys representative - a total of $ 90,000. Today you need to protect yourself against a parking ticket. It was a killer rap. <br /> <br /> Rocky sent his bodyguard, Parley Gates (Gilfayle) to the lawyer's house to steal $ 90,000 from the safe. The attorney handed him a red-handed message and sent him to his mess. After a second, he died. Rocky meets a similar fate. And who is killing this group of gangsters? To talk to one of them, Saint has to talk to them so that the difference can be cleared - can they get someone before they are killed? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Paul Guilfoyle provides some humor as annoying, drinking milk drinks Parry Gates, and Jonathan Hahl is sometimes as great as exasperated but worried sick Inspector Fernack. Wendy Bari, appearing in many St. Episodes, is very good for a woman to take Simon's heart. <br /> <br /> Very enjoyable.
