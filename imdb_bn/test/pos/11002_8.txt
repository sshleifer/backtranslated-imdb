"Goths the Squire", Kirk and his crew faced a powerful superground, who did not publish the Captain, "Bones" and some growing people for no reason. I could have been wrong, but I think it's the first Star Trek episode I've ever seen and the program that made me hunger more. It's not one of the best epochs, but a tribal stone-firm firm position, putting an enterprise crew on any corner, a situation that makes it much fun to watch the show. In one sense, the most famous character of the Super-Humanodor Star Trek, one of the Next Generation's Iggett "Q" is expected. This episode is memorable for creating a unique situation. This is the first time a part of the ohura action and the story lets the viewer see what might happen when they allow a loving character when they are. Very bad show does not fully explore this iconic figure.
