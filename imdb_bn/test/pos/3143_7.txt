Perry Mason: The Case of the Fatal Fashion has received a Prize from Perry and Della Street American Bar Association in New York. I think the duty to get some recognition of an unexpired trial record. However, Della's friend, fashion editor Diana Muldouur arrested herself for the assassination of her rival, Valerie Harper, and actually a clash between two men in both Raimond Boar and Barbara Hell. <br /> <br /> Two rivals are going to look like a thing which is eddah and Louella school girls. Of course, many people of Harper loved him equally. <br /> <br /> The same criminal also ran a fashion designer who revealed the person. It puts Perry in close association with some of his allies with his trusted investigative lawyer William Mossier. It seems the designer is a public cousin, who wants to find some justice in their normal way. <br /> <br /> I did not find one thing, when Musa and gangster Robert Cloessi kept the culprit I can not believe that the police are not following the suit strongly. Certainly Clohesyy has some sources that the police do not have. <br /> <br /> But the best part of this special Mason entry is to fill Scott Baio as a young rather assistant district attorney himself, Raymond Buru, how he studied all the cases and waited to kill him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He wanted to reopen the case and add witnesses, and was prepared and ready with the former. Bor detains him and says he does not have any objection to the new witness, and after that the witness has to be destroyed in the cross examination. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br />
