When I watch this movie, I'll be excited to see Miss World's bed scenes. She has beautiful and charming body. When the beautiful lady spreads the scenes and shows her completely naked body ... I think it is difficult to resist the male .... I think that beautiful women like the Hindi Bihar make their nude scenes. At least nobody wants to keep the naked body of the body of the limited believing woman in perfect faith. I told Malice what agreed with. The film is depicted in such a way that it seems to be a kind of ambiguity in the original content. Emotions are not properly conveyed. I do not think very good performance contributes to its mediocrity. In my opinion, Tasu preferred Aishwarya Rai instead of Rai. In some of his scenes, he looks a little lively, which, ultimately, should not portray the movie. I noticed a bit of extra acting in some of her scenes. I can not help Aishwarya Rai's cranky critic :); Sorry for that. Rituparno Ghosh's 'Raincoat' is a good movie. And I saw the dancer saw the rocket; I was not impressed at all
