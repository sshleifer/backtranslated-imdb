This is a romantic comedy, so it's actually a fairy tale, but an unusual one. Instead of living in Ashes, Cinderella lives in an exorbitant fort in the suburbs, a good looking husband, who is not a princess. She finds her princess, but she is not that handsome. Instead of a fort, at least initially, he gets a small walk in Manhattan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am making the highest level movie in my mind. He created a world that I would like to move - the neighborhood of Manhattan and street life combined with life and community. <br /> <br /> I hope IMDB will link to other commentary critics. I want to know that those who hate this in other movies hate what they hate. I'm always looking for "laughs" for at least one hour or so for which laughs and beautiful places.
