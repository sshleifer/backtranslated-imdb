This show was shy when it first came. The first actress to play the girl did not fit the role, writing was missed or missed, and Damon Waines was not quite comfortable to make such a Cornbell family-friendly show. Chemistry between herself (and her husband) Tisha Kamble (they have long been friends with friends, Tisha's husband, and Will Smith) and Jada Pacquet with all of the Waiwan clan so that they resume the show. Once returned, they resurrected the girl, made the boy a lot of guts ("Boy Moyes World" from La Erique) and made the little girl genius ... (Later they gave him a little talented boyfriend for comic guest productions). The program, when the rollercoast gets a long long line from top buffalo always, you can see that you will be comfortable on your skin (especially the main authors, directors and consultants) in the Damon Wains set) and its character. Everyone once went to the show, they forcefully worked for everyone and were able to make continuous funny shows in the air. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of buffoons, many top antics, and Kyle family life often leads to chaos. They created junior to stupid, they made the greatest girl of all time an attractive, painful figure, and even the youngest girl was not saved by the authors. I think that the shark had jumped up and junior signed a death certificate when her girlfriend was pregnant, she went inside and she got married to her and introduced her parents (junior's wife's father's character just thinking about her Makes it). The show was fun ... but it was a UPN show in ABC if the reader had no idea. <br /> <br /> The reflections are fun, but I rely on it ... there was no one left to accompany him. It's really bad when it's bad. It sometimes happens to be cornball but at least he was a black man, who had a sitcom to do syndication on a major network ... who can say for themselves now? (Recently given the "brownout" in the CD split and TV network). One.
