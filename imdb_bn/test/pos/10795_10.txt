I saw it a few times and get it completely glued towards it. It's very mysterious and intense. It describes the annoying word but it's amazing. This is a movie that you can not miss any thing, but if you have eaten it in it, then stick it with you after it's over. Now, thinking about it, I do not even know what the stone wanted to see us. Just Alan Green Story? I do not think so. It was an appearance of ignorance, stupidity, self-absorption, and a guy just in his strong disappointment. Maybe he was stronger than the audience. I did not like Barry, but I was still worried about him for some reason. I was surprised that I could not get him out of my mind after the film ended. I would like to look inside the heart of Olive Stone for this.
