Emma Thompson, Alan Ricman, Carla Gagino, and Gil Belo, a dellite on this sexy copper. This movie is smart, your seats are entertaining for adults and how these ideas are on these days of predictable cartoons. Great music and camera work that adds fun to this New Orleans-set puzzle. Highly recommended. Ten stars!
