Why are many people considering Wang Kar-wai's best film in love mood, it's easy to understand. The film's tone-down appeal is a re-establishment of happy accredited territories, with a passionate finger-related view of the film, but Jering film has become a trademark without hyper-kinetic patchwork and hyper-sativated sequences, the Kara-Y film from Chongqing Express. Like SÃ¸nderborg's Lemie, it's a different type of car for Car-Yee; Where the conversation and the plot are exempted from the mood and composition, it seems that they could possibly create two fine living stories on limited emotional stages. <br /> <br /> It is a proof of the Gift of Car-Y which he is able to make a simple story so similar. Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) and Su Li-Zhen (Maggie Cheung) move the next door to each other in the same apartment building. He is a journalist who dreams of publishing a martial arts novel and he is a secretary of a shipping company. Since their last compound formula is obvious from the beginning, but here is the delight that Car-Y has unmistakably made such a journey with his Grand Masterstroke. <br /> <br /> Playing with the foreground and background plan in the way that the key to success of the movie is the use of Kara-Y's internal space, similar to Polanski's work. In the first half of the film, on the fascinating times, Leigh and Cheng have separated between Kara-Yu Shuites so that the second person is not visible in the conversation. Car-Y is concerned about the environment and space here, creating a growing mental pace among its characters. It also says that Kara-Y never likes to focus on the physical condition of Mo-Wayan and Li-Jen's husband-wife. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He manages to reveal his film. Cheung's slowly, a shot encouraging up the metaphor stairs where the same stairs are turned down the descent of Leung; Their movements compliment each other, making a sense of eroticism between shot booking and two figures. Their soul is attached but they are still physically integrated. In this scene, boyfriend displacement is both captivating and frustrating, because the two star cross lovers refuse physical termination due to their modest honesty. <br /> <br /> The other scenes of the movie set with the short slower shots of the chim, internally move through its inner surroundings, set the hauntingly beautiful score of Mike Galasso. Cheung's dress nicely pushed through his surroundings as he praised his external location. His speed gradually seems to be an inevitable synthesis between Li-Shunzen and his dream lover, which seems to be completely sub-conscious of the temptation process. <br /> <br /> If I think these two characters are like two birds freedomsomone on each other, it is probably not beyond a statement. These bonds of tight bonds are nearly intense as their relationship is external with their internal spaces. The film rarely moves into an external place and when the camera is usually learning with oval windows and symbolic bars, it always reminds us that these characters are like animals in limited sizes. Even when our lover is close enough to touch even our lovers, they bother us, together by shooting each other with a vacuum, or with a gap inside the cloth inside the cloth. Mother nature also responds to the love of their love, often expressing a soft rock on the characters after their bodies become glass to each other. <br /> <br /> Car-Yai's terrible air atmospheric shots, Leung's Lai Happy Tougter could experience U-Fai, even Leslie Cheng's Ho Po-Wing, if not to enjoy with him a catholic release experience. At the end of that movie, love was so unjustifiably tied to war wars that uninterrupted announcements of the love of the third person indicate the U-Fei's perception that his dream of seeing the waterfall will bring him inner peace, even if he did not give her back to the lover. Mo-Wan's journey ends in the boundary of a crumbling temple. His own psychological reduction is very similar to his country's political environment, and Li-Shan's absence is effective only because Kara-Yi-Wayan gives the experience of freedom. Mo-Wan has published an ancient myth and the publication of a crack in his secret release temple, he has been optimistic in his days that all his harm and heart disease in any way serve high purpose.
