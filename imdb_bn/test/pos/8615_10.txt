I surprised the commentator to the comment that he made this movie as harmful to everyone for creating "DVD Features", which certainly hit me. I admit that there is a tendency for my "meta", but I think this movie is very accessible and entertaining, even in a rugged, self-consciously clever manner that you definitely hope in a movie about filmmaking. Filmmaking (and even sex) "works," but occasionally it is astonished that it is very "remarkable" and "director", but since the director does not play himself in most cases (instead of using incarnations), we I have gone with the choice (since I'm sure he is continuing to contradict). Apparently, Catherine Braillett has achieved special skills in hard-to-watch movies, but I want to say clearly that this is not a worthy one. I've really enjoyed the conversation, the balance between the characteristic of cinematic and natural, the character of the movie and its assistant and the actor and the relationship between it. Highly recommended.
