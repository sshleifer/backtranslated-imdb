Ignore bad reviews here, this film is awesome! "Just Fix Dawn" is a great example of what can be done in a movie with a perfect budget, if you have a great idea for a dedicated crew, decent script and a movie. It's a hell of a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed more than 80 slashhers because the killer is so unique. "Wrong Turn" This movie is a bit awkward! There are plenty of blood and scares. My girlfriend was freaked out and she did not watch and flinch almost everything with me. <br /> <br /> I said, "Just Dick Dawn" is the first slash of the best 80's. I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 kids
