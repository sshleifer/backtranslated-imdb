I just saw it, a short film by Harold Lloyd, which combines his "glasses" character in Kino Video's DVD of "The Harold Lloyd Collection". He is actually an intelligent man with Snoob Pollard who has invented Bebe Daniels as his companion, who has made himself a fake sensation. He discovered that Lloyd and Pollard had "lost" duplicate rings and removed many customers. I will stop there and say that it works very hard for Harold and SnooB to enter the place and face some vague hypocrisy and wear dresses like a dress for wearing a shawl. Not too much slapstick but what was quite funny. So note that, I suggest Crooks recommend?
