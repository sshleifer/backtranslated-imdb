One of my favorite dramatic TV shows, beautiful but tragic, heart-warming and thought-provoking in many ways, it's a few years of CS Lewis's life and a great drama about his relationship with Joy Dividman. I found it to be wonderful and 'realistic' dialogue and situations to be incredibly absorbing. It all seemed 'real', even though there were 'witchcraft' moments that kept you breathing happily. The central character was Ackland and Bloom was excellent, throwing support. This is one of the dramas that seems difficult for me to criticize, for me, there is nothing to criticize, it just works so well on many levels. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
