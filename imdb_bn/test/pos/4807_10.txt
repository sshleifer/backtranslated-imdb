I have seen only about 200 'Hong Kong' photos, only to tell me this photo is my favorite favorite. The plot is not only compelling (and surprisingly in some ways, these days are rare for a movie), but the chemistry between the two main actors is fantastic Top groove! And often even the most serious H. Who Films gather a lot of humor in all the drama and action, often mood reduces, here the jokes are sophisticated and sifted in plot, and even improves character relationships. Music is very well done, and two main themes are very beautiful. With the publication of the special edition of HK, they also cleared the picture (the first release was grain) and the subtitles, the quality of the translation is still low (there is nothing new). Above all, if you want to watch a hockey movie that is not run by John Wow or you have a chunk of it, it should be at least on your short list! A really interesting and entertaining watch!
