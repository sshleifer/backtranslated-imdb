WOW, a movie will not miss a misspiece. <br /> <br /> I did not realize that when I started watching this movie I had a late night. When I went to IMDB the film did not find it after it was a stone film. Seeing it, I was gentle. Cast, especially Eric Bogosian just superbly. The best script and the camera work is always the one ... The movie has attracted me and has kept me in the end ... I did not see the courage to glaze over the fear of losing anything ... amazing how small budget films can be a lot of budget movies which are a lot of action And computer generators make special effects so it can be incredible and annoying. Do not miss this picture ...
