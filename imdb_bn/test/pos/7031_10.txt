It was an excellent movie I was watching because I was 6yrs old with my older sister. This is a movie that you can see repeatedly and still laugh and cries like it can become bored like any other movie. This is a movie that will live forever through generations of generations. I love it :) When my field is ranked from 1-10 I'll rate it 9.9 easily. <br /> <br /> It is a film about the relationship between a daughter (baby) and her first child-friend (mother) family relationship, changes in child relationship and an obsession about the world's relationship. <<br /> <br /> Live as a complex classic due to diary dancing. Thanks though you are only sorry for short comment.
