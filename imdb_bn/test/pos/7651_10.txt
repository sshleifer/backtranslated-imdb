We threw this event on Sunday morning in 6:30 AM when all the wire was flipped through channels and it turned out to be the best show! It's absolutely adorable. For our kids (and adults, I must, of course, as a way of passing my childhood year) need these kinds of shows. As a reference to another comment, this show will benefit from the simplicity of the lines and lines of the story. Dolls are beautifully beautiful, backgrounds are colorful and they are made from cardboard, foam, paint and pure fantasy, but they remind us of our childhood, when we can spend days in our own grandmother's world, the world around us Like those who are not lucky like grandfather like grandmother, this event is for you, you will be ready for the lost time! This show is also true with inspiration and cleverness and humor and absolutely fun, similar to children and adults. In other words, do not ignore this show, because you are only three years old! Spend less than half an hour with Mona, Monroe, Mr. and Russell, they will be waiting for you to be friends!
