This is a movie that you do not want to end. Characters rich in a well woven tapestry. Colorful clothing, music and characters talk about a story of people who live in a boarding house for decades, during the Civil Rights Movement and the Vietnam War. A young man is taken by a dynamic, big heartwarming woman who runs the house and these stories based on their experiences. <br /> <br /> I could not believe that it was made for television movies. It is very well executed. come. Ipatha Markarshan is wonderful as a grandmother and she has brought so much life to this role. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
