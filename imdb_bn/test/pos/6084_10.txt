I will not go to the generalization, and say this is the best love story ever, as someone said. It's okay, people feel so deeply about this film, I believe you love it ... or you just hate it. I do not want to say, the best of all, because it is very easy to create a statement for me 'wide'. However, I feel very passionate about the English patient, as well as millions of other people do it too. <br /> <br /> The prize is completely called. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with critics, on many levels, but those who chose it, I could not agree more. <br /> <br /> 9-Oscars. <br /> <br /> 41-Win <br /> <br /> 37 other nominations make this love story at the top of the bunch. <br /> <br /> From the director, Anthony Mingela, the story exploded on the screen and Mr. Peterman (from T.V. S. Sifffeld) said, "Yale, I just can not stop my eyes!" In this example, I do not agree with Ellen's reaction. But the story makes it beautiful and takes the right time, it's nice to create the case. Cinematography, (John Salley) has won multiple awards, as it should be. I have not given much attention to Juliet Binochet. Besides Harrison Ford, I love his performance in the story of "Sabrina" in some complicated relationships. But it was simply an incredibly different character for her, and as she was truly gifted, she was just shining in her own subtle and orderly manner, she was right in looking at this picture, I was really glad that she was acting and not another actress. Ralph Fianes, also portraying Count Laszlo de Almasi. I had a new respect, after seeing this one after another! What can you say without seeing this picture again? (*****)
