I saw this movie while coming out. I think what is an average movie I now realize that this director was ahead of his time. This is a great movie and great soundtrack. I saw my share of the rock movie, but it is far away from the spineless tap (which I do not like). This movie takes our 80 seconds of life to the rescue, which does not want to be anything. This wants to be big in our inner child and a * Rock Star * Yes I said it. Everyone wants to grow up and wants to be in the spotlight (weather or not). This movie only puts you in the emotional part and you can feel the excitement of Ezir. I had to admit that I was less acting but still the music and the story rolled up the credit, you had enough to keep it. Watch the price especially if you are a fan of Ole sturdy hair band.
