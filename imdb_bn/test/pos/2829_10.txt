And that's saying a lot. If you want to quarrel with curiosity, rent it, the most amazing script in the history of the film, direction and casting is highlighted. I'm quarreling I can not believe I saw it. I'm usually the big Bernateet Peters fan, I- but it tests my solution. Do not read more reviews here, if you know anything about plots, it's the best. Just rent it. Do not believe what you see .......
