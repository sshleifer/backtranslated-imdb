Really a wonderful movie Bruce Willis has always given wonderful comedic-romantic acting power in this message-and in the hope of losing the film, many of us know that we all know. A gift to everyone in the medieval period, which is full of expensive time and still seems to be empty: There is more around the next turn and it can be great, rich and romantic. Leave the latest past and go back to the distant past, and then turn off a favorite flight of your future. If we can re-live our youth experiences, if we could really remember our incidents, would we not find any special freedom? See movies, open gifts.
