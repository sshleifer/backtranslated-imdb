This movie is the best horror movie I have ever seen. Acting horror and plots leave many leaves to be desired but the doll gave me nightmares for the week. Seriously, it does not let them see if you have small children. Of course I favor a bit due to an irrational fear of dolls and midgets. Also my body double camie who makes me mini verne troyer. And some gratuitous nudity, must have a low budget horror movie course. All other horror movies will forever be counted against this in my book.
