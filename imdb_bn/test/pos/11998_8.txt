This is one of my favorite Colombo episodes without any doubt. The acting is very good, the music is very interesting, the script is impressive, and the aspects are excellent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Also, Stephen Cafrey, Gary Hershberger, Alan Fujz and Robert Kulp have a great acting. <br /> <br /> The end is absolutely brilliant and I like how Colombo described it. <br /> <br /> This is not a columbian movie, it will be rude.
