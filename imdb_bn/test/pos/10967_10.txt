John Cassett is like his first movie, probably as a shot in a shooting in New York, there is not a script with the dialogue, and Larry gives the equivalent 1959 feature of David E. E. Anthusius of David - all his actors know what to do and even when they are talking They also have the correct appearance in their eyes. In other words, it is one of the most realistic aspects of the BIT generation, its jokes are sophisticated jazzed and racial tensions. A group of black siblings is trying to get better gigs than the central dot, the average strip-club, and a sister is more light-skinned than that, in which the relationship is engulfed with a white man, which shatters on both sides. The film, however, is not about that exclusively; Cassavettes have her characters roaming around New York City (which is not many movies in 1959/1960) and her style of the story is like improvisational jazz artists on the day. The date, be sure, but the price of an eye for the film buffs; Martin Schoris named this as his most influential influence.
