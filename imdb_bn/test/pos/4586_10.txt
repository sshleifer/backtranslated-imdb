<br /> <br /> Whether this film was in the theater, I think it was "direct DVD", I had fairly low expectations, though I was a big fan of Mike Judge. The same ridiculous future is as satirical as "Brazil" and "Demolition Man", but to the next level. <br /> <br /> Then I saw the cast; Louis Wilson, Maya Rudolph and Dax Shepard, who was brilliant in their roles. Unless you say, this movie has won me in the first 5 minutes, where it shows up to low age children and is the poorest, stupid, trashist people with many unknown children and how it leads to the opposite evolution. It accepts the idea and then shows where we face this pollution of the gene pool. <br /> <br /> Sadly, I do not think it will be pictured in 500 years, but probably around 50. I saw the emergence of the threat of "light resistance" among the general population, the media and the culture. Those who prefer classical music and art are instead honored to be honored. Think of the lowest universal majority, especially Hollywood and TV (for example, "Jacques the Movie" and a reality show where they make you somewhat abusive or insulted for money). <br /> <br /> On one side of the political / social mockery, this movie is just fun! And I do not say that light; Some movies really make me "lol", but this is the one. <br /> <br /> Many jokes are sound / sight gags in the background, so you have to pay attention to some of them. Even some of them had to stop and zoom in (like "yes" and "eyes" for jockey's official ID and hair and "yes" as well). Also, the prison is carved in front of the "house for a special person", since the movies of films (like real life police) call everyone "people instead of people", etc. Again, it was just a screen for the moment ... this is a movie that you can see again and split it through funny layers. <br /> <br /> I usually see movies with subtitles and it covers me. Among the few jokers that can be passed by your ear in the mix of conversations, for example, the police are talking about changing "exposing" instead of "escaping", and there are many misconceptions that have pushed me. But again, I could not pick them up by mixing the effects of music / sound; It is very subtle but still delightful. In addition, special effects were really good for a scientific-social / social laugh. <br /> <br /> I could go, but overall, I think it's a movie that you do not think it's funny, it's probably your fun! I'm planning a lot, many people recommend this!
