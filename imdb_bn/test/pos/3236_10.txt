VHS - I saw it and loved it every minute so I now ordered the DVD that I could only have stayed in the film for a long time. Do not I think that others think that I want to nominate my mind and completely disagree with negative comments and do not allow others to harm me any enjoyment. Make up your own mind and let others shut you off! All of my Jane Austen's BBC series are but my favorite. A North Natarzer Abbey, published in 2007, is published which I will take out, but it will not stop me from releasing the playwright Abbey in the 80's.
