I do not know that this film belongs to the 'Aussie Trash' pill, unless I say, but there are no Academy Award nominees here. What should be considered that most of the actors in this film are not actually actors, only at that time the kids do not have to do anything good. There were many others who played the role of the movie, but turned them down for surfing the coast; All things taken into account, it was not actually a bad movie for her time. In some cases it is not as impossible today, in which colleague pressure is still alive and unlike this generation, without having children without mobile phones, computers and other similar gadgets. However, I have to rate this flash as an old fove which I once saw on the blue moon and would not take it very seriously ...
