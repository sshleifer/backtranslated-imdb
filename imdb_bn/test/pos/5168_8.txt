In the Christmas season, it's often a fun and sad fact that it is often surrounded by families. For this reason some people call it "children's holiday". As we age, natural feuds and progress have removed people and things that gave us special memories. John Denver plays his most lunatic role, named George Birring, a successful NYC architect and new widow who lost his wife a year ago. Her life is worn around her 9 year old daughter, Alex; Both are still depressing their losses. George is doing his best to create a special Christmas for his daughter. His boss, Thomas Renefeld (MA * S. * H, played by Edward Winters's extraordinary Colonel Flagg), who had sent George to explore a possible real estate deal in Georgetown, CO. The purpose of the trip is not telling the lie to his daughter that the purpose of travel is to enter the city on the holidays, George and Alex, rather than work, where they immediately meet a collection of liberal liberals, but the character of some rowdy groups whose main reason is that they all believe In Santa Claus. Georgetown is a photo book community that we all want to live and we love neighbors. George soon meets a love interest in Susan (Zane Kazmarek.). It would not be an ideal time for Grinch (Ranfield). But in reality, he is in the city to find out the city for the development of Ranfild and there is a beautiful blind-man near the city, which is surrounded by the dark areas of the film, the surrounding foreclosures and the reactions of the cities. Runner, and outer I did not see the movie who would not be spoiled for the end. This is a happy happy Christmas, but it looks at the best of human souls in very foolishness which is managed in a fairly subtle and believable way. After all, this is a great way to spend some of your Christmas TV hours. John Denver as Alex and excellent chemistry of Jane Carmker and Jenny James have a nice excellent job. I always like Marie Wicks' work, an acclaimed actress, and all other cast members do wonderful work with less muscular parts. This is a regular Christmas rental for my family; I rate it 4/5.
