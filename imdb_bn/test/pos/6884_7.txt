Yong-ki Jinong's "Poppit Master only scary parts" was the latest Korean Horoscope Flick which I was delighted to see. This picture hit me immediately with the title "Inhongos" in Asia, when I reviewed it online, with images that remind me of the pop master, children's play and other toys / dolls based horror Falix. But for some reason I do not think .. "Boy, this will be durable", I imagine it would be vague and funny. Toysome awful almost well done. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly, but I like it, so it was OK. Score, I was pretty like, with Acacia, and reminded me of the classic horror scores of many past. I will not go too far, but this story was strong, and I highly recommend it to a fan of Asian Horror. It's not extreme, it should not be taken very seriously, but it's really good.
