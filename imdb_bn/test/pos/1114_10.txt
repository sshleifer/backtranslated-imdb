We have our headlines all over the world as we talk about the competition's features in the Split Film Festival. In China, Korea, Canada, the United States and Australia and most of these stories indicate that the world is actually the Valley of tears. Modern love ... thats for sure. <br /> <br /> Alex Fryin has two small married men and his sons are traveling on the coast from the city and visited the graveyard and raised the uncle's uncle a long time ago and died. In mysterious circumstances The coastal village looks like an American horror movie where the village is diverse and people are uncommon mutants. However, these episodes of Alex Freien's Pastorala are not generally described as horrifying. Actually this is a very interesting drama where we are seeing relationships and horror through flashbacks and much more. In this story and the actors, we have shown a pop-up of the movie with the psychological aspects, which are some of the best-made Australian films. This is the case of the French. Always new and fresh. Unique sensation of visual intelligence and some Australian directors is wonderful good. The French movie super. The Australian landscape is something that specializes in their films, as we see in Freine's Modern Love and in the Roy Lawrence movie in Lantana and Zindabad. <br /> <br /> It seems to be the same in Alex's future titles.
