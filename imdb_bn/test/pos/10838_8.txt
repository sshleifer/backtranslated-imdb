Six years ago, the drama created quite a stir when it was launched on television - without leaving most TV news, it went under the radar; But after seeing this, I would not be surprised that it created a stir. Not particularly due to the content (though it is somewhat 'offabout' than the normal TV channel) - this may do more with the reactionary media in this country. However, these three parts are based on a book by Sarah Waters and her main focus on lesbians - although this plot has some other 'dark' parties to find sex. Our main character from Winchester, Nan (short for Nancy) is a little girl. After watching her at the theater show, she was disturbed by male drag actress Kitty Butler and soon began to take part in all of her shows - finally becoming the actor and her dreser. It is not long before it is possible to play big stage in London and get a chance to be a good friend with nan, but he wants to invite him to travel. When the nan took over the stage, the task became even bigger and the pair became a stage ... but it broke the nan's heart, taking him to audisi in London's CD. <br /> <br /> I must admit that there is no shortage of lazy and solid films in DVD collection, so there was nothing that was enough to shock me. Rather than being awakened more than that, I'm surprised to say that the film is far away; Naturally there are some lesbian sex and other elements, but it is never exploitative or over-used, and the film was not really created. The main focus is always on the story; And the story is really well done. The film is a total of three hours long, but if there is something that is not enough in the summary. Sarah Waters is probably an inventive writer, and remains attractive for the duration of the film. Strong firm as you act, but I must admit that I'm the lead actress Rachel Stirling painful and difficult to get along with first; Although the film progressed, he increased his role. The execution is a bit of a problem for a little bit of a bit and director Geoffrey Sax is a bit too irresistible for me. This story has also become somewhat unexpected at the end, which is shameful because this film is powerful in the dark moment (episode 2 is the higher point of mine for me). The film does not actually have a defined point - at least that which I can not see. Since I'm worried it is not so important; However, Velvet is a better story as tipping and saying than my expectations exceed. This kind of stuff is worth checking out for people like that.
