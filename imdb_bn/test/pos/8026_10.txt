The classic case of an excellent movie shown by the American public which is not easily as the main person of Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenegger - Adrian Quinn has done a good dual performance, just that you are dual listening to this performance of this photo than those who have never been drawn in their carrier! However, for review now ... <br /> <br /> Assignment relied on the 1970's Radical Carlos de Jacalal story, who had finally terrorized Europe for many years before arresting French agents. In this adaptation, the US Navy officer (Adrian Quinn) is on vacation in Israel while being detained by Mosaddad (CIA intelligence intelligence / militant terrorist organization) and it is a very small part of the film to see it like a real Jackal, but believe me it is a great value Does not decrease). When it was discovered, Ramirez is not Jackal, but Jack Shaw (Donald Switeland, who regularly routinely portrays the painting of his usual secretive government authority, but superbly) has named the strict CIA agent. Junkal is a victim of life, and whoever follows the sequence of events that follow, it will be fun - it is the greatest action film cliche and great acting without one-liner, and a great plot that will surprise anyone. Three leading men - Queen, Sutherland and Kingsley - were able to carry the film more than its modest budget, and someone else allowed them to wear their shoes. The comedy, camera angle and cinematography top notch, especially in action scenes with the director and his staff. It is better than hiring any person to hire. It is expected that this film was fairly bad at the box office, otherwise we could see a series of this amazing spy thriller. <br /> <br /> 9/10 They, this critics highly recommend it to all the potential visitors!
