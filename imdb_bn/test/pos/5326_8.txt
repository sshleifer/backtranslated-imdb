Before watching this movie, I read the comments of someone who does not like it very much. I have to scare me for sacrificing 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life in my life, but I am glad that I did it. Ryan Gosling is a fantastic actor, I especially like Believer. Don Cheadle was also fantastic. The film presents an interesting scene on life and death. It was very sensitive and very sad, yet it is interested to me, which can not make most tangible stories. It's subconscious about a movie you do not like, you see it. It was unique, and I do not think anyone can duplicate it. All of the young actors are surprisingly good at the subject and the passion that should have gone into it. I was pleasantly surprised.
