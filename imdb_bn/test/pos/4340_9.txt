This movie was great. It may be a true step fan to do everything. Most people have got shots and / or disgrace, at least romance sex, a hero who can be identified, rather than a pointless plot of violence at many times, eventually only stores a scene and the requesting villains for it In this movie Bronson tolerance is shown at its lowest level and it shows. Ed Loutor made a great cop and worked silently on the plot of the Braunjan without stealing his spotlight. The film is not a plot that you are annoying or too much food that you never see and watch this movie. Instead, you want to see Kersey in action and the storyline just rubs it up. This is great thing.
