Summary only hates for that movie, since the movie is okay or the average is acceptable. I made nostalgic for visiting this movie on IMDB, because I could not help myself to come back in 1994. I was a lucky person who saw this movie in the theater. It immediately became one of my favorite comedy and it took several years to make my favorite. How can I make this movie my favorite? Was it a great writing (the story was fine but the playplay and conversation was fantastic) was it the most played? Was it the mood of the film? <br /> <br /> After thinking about it for many years, I had to mix it. It is one of the movies which has no flaws and even its music. (Other movies are coming in my mind now) <br /> <br /> PS: Rajkumar Santoshi Keep balance in your play and comedy movies. Only 1 comedy is not enough. I want more eeeeeeeee ..........
