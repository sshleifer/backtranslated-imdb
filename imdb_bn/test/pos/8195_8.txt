This is a wonderful film. No, it does not match Gibson, "Brevevart", but then, it is not trying to do it. In fact, "emperor and killer" is probably more commonly (thanks to Shakespeare's production than Hollywood's blockbuster). <br /> <br /> In the third century, the King of Queens is trying to get together (in another word "win") in seven states of China. He has already been overthrown to the Han Kingdom. Now he needs an excuse to attack Yane's Kingdom. <br /> <br /> Here comes Lady Zhao. She and Raja have been friends since childhood. They are probably too much in love, but can not get married for political reasons. Together they develop a plot. He has fallen into disgust with the King and Ian will be pissed to escape. Once he would satisfy Ian Rajkumar for sending a killer to kill the king. When the assassination fails, King Yang will get his excuse to attack. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When you hear more examples of the cruelty of an old childhood friend, Whether the king really needs to be killed. <br /> <br /> You are not sure that watching a Hollywood production is a sure sign of him and the final encounter between the killer and the king. Like Hollywood movies where heroes and fame are clearly defined and the final outcome is predetermined, it is a war that can really go anyway. <br /> <br /> This is a remarkable and playful acting story. The time of Chinese history. There is a mixture of both incredible beauty and incredible ugly. But the most beautiful, Gong Lee as Lange Zhao. As long as I can see him, Ganga Lee is the world's most beautiful woman. I <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, there is a strange funny line in this film. At the beginning of Gong Li one of his servants asked, "I have a beautiful face?" <br /> <br /> Boom !!!
