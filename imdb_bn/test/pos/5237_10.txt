If someone ignores the technical difficulties of sound terminology and John Wayne, sometimes this term (1930), but this film will be considered an epic that is more realistic than almost any film. Starting from Missouri, Constesta wagon, a large Kasvan west of people and animals. Wagons are drawn down huge cliffs and riders in the wagons cross a flood river with considerable risk. Indians visit Owen and let the train go through their land. Afterwards Indians chase the train and fight them. Cyclones form a huge circle of horses and livestock in the circle, and their rifles make it with the smoky cover of circular Indians. <br /> <br /> After the war is over, the dead are buried on the spot and people and wagons depart. This view is extraordinary, with the dead as the living exit of the camera. It relates to the audience with the deceased and is different from the viewer's living. Wagoners face a large thunderstorm, including snowfall and mud everywhere. They eventually reach at Oregon at their destination near a redwood or sequoia forest. The image is about 70 mm wide screen, about 2.0: 1 ratio (in the 1930s!). <br /> <br /> I did not mention this plot because it is natural and huge work involved in making this film. Moviemakers will not work hard to produce such films or a movie. Given the technical limitations of the term, the music is going on occasionally, as when Owen leaves her daughter in search of her friend's killers. Owen's psychology, racism, little mood and complex characters, Big Trill, gives us stories of simple people facing our extraordinary hardships. I saw the best western one.
