He does not hate Mr. Graham because he's pretty, he hates him because he's having fun watching this movie. Like the hip clothing and folkcars, these flashing actors work well together. KC Aflake Violent and Heather Graham literally lights on the screen. Minor characters - Goran poisonous {sigh} and Patricia veljajas as gorgeous as cocktails. Congratulations Miramax and director Lisa Kruger!
