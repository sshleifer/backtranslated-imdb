When I went to see this movie, I thought it would be another chick flick to bear my sister. Besides, Amanda Beans' last movie was not so hot that she suspected me as the main actress of the movie. However, in 5 minutes I started to smile so hard that I had tears in my eyes, jokes were "not out there" then a second but very interesting to understand. The script was not very complicated that I did not understand the triangle of love, but it was true for Shakespeare's main game. I love so much every minute that I smiled a man and threw two seats away from me !!! Very shameful! I definitely want to watch this movie especially girls that the guys are warm hot in these movies !! (lol) so much that I can get it in the DVD.
