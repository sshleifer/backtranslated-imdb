I am playing this movie continuously this month, and I like it. I was between 60 (Oh dear), so it is nostalgic in a sense. However, it's fun projects, snappy dialogues and great performances that keep watching me. <br /> <br /> Winston's reaction to Steveby at the end of the movie is priceless. (I want to be more specific, but do not want to hide it for anyone.) Can anyone else do not play his own and still love him? For Bergman's costumes, I think he looks as frightening as he looks at his face. I think he "robbed" one time that he would appear in an evening gown. It's not all its worth, which is very bad. I first saw it when I did not like it and I still do not do it. <br /> <br /> Goldie won the Oscar for her role. People thought it was a great role at this time and yet it is a performance that I do not like others like. <br/> <br /> and I agree - I thought Rick Lenz was great in her and it is very bad that her film career was not '<br /> <br /> I hope more people will see this movie. They will like it!
