Francis Ford Coppola first completed the "personal" movie in 1969 and was released, which is the most recent film about the unknown, up and coming of The Godfather, and the film and the rest of his life career. It is apparently a road film that indulges in an isolated young girl with domestic life and is involved with a pregnant child, not sure that she wants to rob her silent marriage and hit the open streets in search of independence. He makes friends with a nice man, a former football player who is suffering from brain damage due to traumatic head injuries, a young James Kane performs unexpectedly in fine fashion and decides to "help" him even after being frustrated by his easy ways. . His attempts to get rid of him are always a failure by criminal or opportunity, and eventually he takes directly to a mentally injured police (Robert Duval), who has his own ideas. The plot is Threadbare, but Coppola does a great job in detailing the mental life of these characters and uses editing techniques to relay the story of that time on the relay, which was not universal at American times. Shots are easy, yet unusually effective, the emptiness of Moody's both open highways and the lives of the American subcontinent, which is associated with a mild nightmare provided by film scores. Coppola is eligible for credit to solve the issue of domestic dissatisfaction from the culturally annoying 60's point of view. Generally, a fairly low key key that is not expected from the audience Coppola, but its own silence, overwhelmingly a minor win 7.5 / 10
