I can not appreciate this film enough. It is a hand hold, the first-person vibration camera I love (and some hate because it makes them sick), such as REC, Cloverfield and Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br /> This is a long film for him, but I was not so attractive, because I did not even notice it. The film speeds up by showing only footage from a unusual reporter's work, it creates a real-time experience for visitors. <br /> <br /> Although I have ever made this movie "horrible terrible", I would say it's the best course I've seen. Here the fear factors are made by illustrating pictures, camera glitches, events related to each other, which lends a very mysterious and hunting tone to the movie. What is not afraid is more, but the rest of our imagination. Finishing is perfect, and you will be warned that you may have nightmares later. Although viewing a second is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Look alone in this dark, do not expect anything and you'll have fun.
