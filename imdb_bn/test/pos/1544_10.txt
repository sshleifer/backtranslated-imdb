It's a classic American made for television movies that are made to watch only on rainy afternoon. Although the script is highly unlikely, it does not take very seriously, and the mystery behind the cheek / horror film that does not enjoy good with poppy or chocolate box bid bags. A big bonus in this movie is not paying attention to superb positioning and strange events and even the strange residents living there for the residents of Lake Tamhak I! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and again.
