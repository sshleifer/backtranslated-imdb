Lloyd Hamilton is one of the most fantastic (and most interesting) of all silent-film comedians. Why did he completely forget? Unfortunately, while the Fox Warehouse was burnt in the early 1930s, most of the film's original negatives were lost. Hamilton was not as handsome or handsome as Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd; He was not a dipper like Raymond Griffith. And unlike Harry Langdon and (again) Chaplin, Hamilton's audience did not try to sympathize with. <br /> <br /> However, his films were very popular during their original release and they are happy today. Oscar Levant once claimed that he asked Chaplin if any comedian was ever jealous of him, and with Chaplin he was named Lloyd Hamilton. The screen is often depicted on Hamilton's screen - a flat-sided nose, a radioactive hand gesture, and a duck-like walk - later adapted by the Vaudville Comedian Edie Garre (Date Girl) and more accepted by Jackie Gleason. His 1950s TV character 'The Pur Soul' <br /> <br /> The movie 'The Movie', guided by 'Risky Arbaqual', is one of Hamilton's most innovative shorts, and it's ridiculous. We first saw him as the son of a country, on his way to a big city, outside his house, he told his family goodbye outside the hut. Then he moved away from the cottage, and we see that it is growing in the big city, the traffic around him! Finally, our hero ends up in a restaurant (unknown, but it is in the Montmartre Cafe) in the suburbs LA) where all the movie actors take into eating. Hamilton's bumper character is fun when meeting the three actors of clothing and makeup like President, Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt: It's fun to see if the masks look more than the originals. Finally, our boys sit on a table and hope to meet a celebrity. Certainly, there is no other than Lloyd Hamilton, entering the restaurant and sitting in the next table! There is a very well made bi-exposure shot - Joining is almost invisible - when Lloyd Hamilton himself welcomes Lloyd Hamilton as the son of the country. <br /> <br /> Sadly, the final time of Hamilton's creativity was very short. He had a dual work (opposite Ham and Bud, Bid Duncan) at the beginning of his film in the Crude Slapstick film, and at the end of silent period there was a short and burning time of the stardom in the shorts. Sound movies were not kind to Hamilton, and he quickly reduced the cast list to some unexpected first talk-time. Then he died young. Fortunately, 'cinema' is quite funny, and this unique comedians have an excellent introduction to style. I'll get it out of 10 out of 7.
