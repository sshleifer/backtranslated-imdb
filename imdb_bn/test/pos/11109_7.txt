I always wanted to see this picture and the first three-quarter proved that I did not wait in vain. But what happened in the end? I mean, do not make mistakes, I liked the film. It definitely made me nostalgic 80 seconds realistic, unique NYC which we lost thanks to Giuliani. But it is absent for half an hour!
