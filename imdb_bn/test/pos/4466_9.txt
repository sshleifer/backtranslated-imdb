When I heard about Lucio Fulci's fame as a director I tend to get angry. Often he is classified as a gifted filmmaker; he only disappoints and hates the entire audience, with images of pure Gore. Indeed, his films contain more explicit dirty and sickness like your average mainstream American production, but his films are always wide and the plots are marvelous. Not a duckling torture yet another story! This photo is a pure jewel of the Italian Shock movie! I easily dare to say this film is a wonderful composition ?? This is an old geometric geylon that includes all the bright aspects of genuine horror. The image shows an inhumane serial killer's search in a small Italian mountain city. The bodies of 3 young men have been found, terribly distorted. There are several masked crabs in the city, but each route does not come anywhere. Among the suspects is a greedy left and a horrible woman, obsessed by witchery and voodoo. Like true mastermind, Phulchi knows how to find the perfect vague voice for his film. He portrays a small town as a gastrophobic and inaccessible condition of the Macab event, which is supported by a knotty soundtrack. Fulci also develops itself as a genius fiction here. The script is always one step ahead of you and the complex plot will confuse you once. In other words, it is a unique giallo (mystery to kill horrible slash). Among the next milestones in Lucie, Gotta is not presented with extraordinary and clear (among them legendary zombo 2, The Bound and New York Ripper), although some still annoying and hard-to-watch show-sync has been shown. <br /> <br /> Do not torture dalking, the most compelling and effective achievement, Lucio Corleca has never taken over and it easily finds place among the greatest Italian horror films ever. Next to the superiority created by Mario Bava and Dario Argante. Since the beginning of the film is impressive, some plot aspects are suddenly realistic and tension is always Adrenaline-ray! An awesome fan and Italian Shock lovers will see for an absolute priority!
