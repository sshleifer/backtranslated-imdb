I wonder why I did not hear this movie before. This is really a fantastic comedy (I want to say first, but it did a great job and I hate to deny its quality). The study of a comedic character about the medieval crisis travels, the differences between people who do not have long-term unions, and the difference between the common people who can fit nicely in society, the pair of Cathie Bates and Rupert have an amazing influence on Everett. Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert; Cathy Betts and Rupepart will make another movie together. Anxious-rebellious, deadly and helpless daughter, Madi (Meridith Eaton), is a really wonderful wonderful character. If you like the Tales of the City movie then you would love this curious charming.
