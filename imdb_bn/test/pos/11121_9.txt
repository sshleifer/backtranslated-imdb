When I first came I saw fame. It was related to the High School Class 1980, which was the year of my graduation in conflict. I saw the movie between midway between high school and college and as an actor my special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> The biggest criticism of Fame is consistently with consistency, and there are some story lines that are not done or are not sensible there. However, those problems are more than the character's emotions and emotions and made by incredible music. <br /> <br /> I recently saw it again and I was surprised that I still liked it as much as I did for the first time. Fame is often compared to FlashDance, which I do not think fairly. Although Flashadence has some great music and Jennifer Beal is fantastic, I think Fame is very good compared to the development of its characters and complexity of its stories. Anyone who really loves art, it is definitely a visual movie.
