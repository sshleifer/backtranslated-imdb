I have waited 9 years to watch this movie because only the TV has not seen the advertisement. Finally I caught it and it was well worth the wait. It's much better than your very extended scream or last summer garbage because it's all fairly fast, without any drawings, the room moves to the Chess music scene. The only bad dubbing gives it a little down but that does not let you off anyway. Below is what is false - hyped and shit on. Mute witness - low budget, not all hyped and very good.
