Good drama / comedy with two good performances of Hunter and Hurt, but Albert Brooks steals each of his scenes. With a great script, this movie gets reflected and gives everyone an opportunity to showcase their talent. And although Joan Cusack is not so much, but one of the most fun scenes in the movie, one of them. Highlight the movie for me, was Albert Brooks lecture on Satan. Only a draw back space goes a little slow on it. And I was just interested in Brooks' role, not much of Hunters or Heart. I have a 10 out of this 7.
