It's built in the top-Washington thriller directed by the talented Wolfgang Petersen with Hotshot Screen Writer Jeff Maguire (who seems to have done very little work over the years, so perhaps she wears her roses). This image was an old aged secret service agent from Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich as a rebel assassin, and the spirit of consciousness, where the President's life was at risk, put one another in a huge test. The competition between unnecessary confidentiality and rival security agencies often sinking the president, which is an authentic touch This image was made when Eastwood and Malkovich were at their peak. Perhaps Eastwood did better than working here, and it's so easy for the old pro's. He has some excellent sound effects along with his bodyguard as well as huffing along with the president's car, for which he is very old. I wonder if the humor of that comedy has been added to that voice to anyone else. My 'guardian angel', whose name is Wigil, I've enjoyed this picture even more, but then there are many things in bodyguard movies. Ron Rousseau was the perfect choice for the fallen female agent for Eduardo, because he is so illogical but so gifted, and he shines. In this story, every inch of the road is drawn, and Eastwood's mental struggles are neatly shown by his general different roles to rid himself of previous security failures. With Ester, if he picked a eyebrow by millimeter, see! Of course, he is super-cool master. Malkovic has the scope for all the misery that he wants to reflect on the illustrated character, and he has taken the central fear of man to perfection. What a good 'non.
