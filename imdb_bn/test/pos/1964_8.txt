Among the best films of 1986, this film is the extraordinary role of Kripin Glover and Dennis Hooper! Reagan years were very big for young people, but this glow really picked up frustration and frustration. Managed with great scripts (apparently based on a true story), I do not really see any weakness in this. The opening shot was bright. <br /> <br /> Kaneue Reeves was perfect for change and Miss Sky was just right. Hooper also had three great performances in the same year (Blue Velvet, Texas Chess 2, and Hociors). I imagine it is following a ritual and I wonder how this image will be reproduced if it is shared. Super Staff!
