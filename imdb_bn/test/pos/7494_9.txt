This is an extraordinary good movie, with some wonderful twists, a good cast and a great script. Just a few stupid bits (this guy is a professional?) Like the street-hit-man scene but it has already been commented. Actually I've only heard a man working, it has been mentioned earlier, and has no opinion or review, it has created more entertainment. Some people may feel that it gets more score than that, but I have reason to have good efforts in low budget and cast. It makes me sick that some films are made, whose budget is equivalent to a small GDP, hip-up release, good reviews, Oscar winning directors and / or actors, and the actors are frustrated with their role of sleeping. And without an indefinite plot line and a story with such a big hole in it, Sandra Bulk can run a bomb-loaded bus through it. (In my opinion, for example Terminal, Castway, Matrix: Revolution) extra points are provided for the clothing category, especially Palin Porrijkova, who wear rubber clothes in a scene and "C * nt" back in another big letter! A sex scene bonus which is showing her sex ass and a good soundtrack is added! And with Tarantino comparisons, please do not remind me of Tarantino Flick ... and Tarantino hates almost every idea from other movies! Even if you have opinions, but are we saying that a particular movie or book is written or directed at once, can not anyone use the same ideas again? Get real This film has its own style.
