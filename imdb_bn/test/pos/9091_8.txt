When I saw the first flatlines, I was surprised. This was all the essential features of a good movie: Cast was nice, the plot was superb and in the thrillers, life was "adventurous". <br /> <br /> Kefar Sotherenland provided an outstanding performance as part of a man's leadership, portraying a scientist who believes that he can find answers to life and death by returning to life and death, and basically the secret of death "steals" " you can do. Kevin Bacon proposed an excellent performance as the more morally competent opponent of Keiffer, Julia Roberts proposed his most rigid role. William Belvedin portrays a student who plays in the class and, in particular, a sexual relationship. And Oliver Plat, another great performance, because of the group and most innocent, portrayed the voice. <br /> <br /> The story is relatively simple, yet original, and refreshing acting - definitely a stand-out movie for movies, and that sets me the standard for measuring another thriller. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
