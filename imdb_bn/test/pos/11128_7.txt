In New York, a new group of students joined High School for the Performing Arts after their success. For four years, their dreams, deceptions, successes, love and personal plays are expressed, though unsafe, Doris Finnisker (Maurin Tiffi), gay Montgomery (Pele McCracken), aggressive Leroy (Gene Anthony Re), optimistic Koko (Irene Car a)). , Aspiring Ralph Garcia (Barry Miller) and their friends until the day of their graduation. <br /> <br /> Eighteen years ago, "Fame" was a successful success, to find a place in which to show thirteen stories business, and I liked the soundtrack on this movie and the CD. I only saw "Fame" in the DVD, and now I would say it's just a great movie with a great movie, but with many defected subpages. The story follows many characters and left many situations without answers. I do not know what was the problem of the current lowdown version of Alan Parker's film, but for example, what happened to the ballerin going to the clinic for abortion? What happened to Leroy and her teacher, did she fail because of her grammar problem? What happened after wearing his blouse in the cat apartment with Coco? The synthesizer and the musician playing his proud father went behind the mistress. However, "Fame" is still a delightful entertainment for me and a civilized movie. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fama" ("Fame")
