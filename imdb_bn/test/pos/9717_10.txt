Sadly, I ask about this series that every person says they never heard about it. I remember it from my childhood (when I got out of 10). <br /> <br /> My favorite story was "A Story Short". The story of "stone soup" was sung among the big stories about me every time. And then the storytelling explains why it does not have any story, and it becomes a story. I'm always a fan of Jim Henson, and this is one reason why. <br /> <br /> I am linking this DVD to Library, The Dark Crystal, The Nevarnding Story, The Princess Bride. , The Last Unicorn, Willow and Mirrmass. All these DVDs I share with my siblings are 6, 5, and 4 years old.
