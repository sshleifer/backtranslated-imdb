I enjoyed this movie perfectly ... and I still see it from time to time. I used it in my teaching class in school. The kids seem to enjoy it, even though they were in color. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie was that heifet grew up after the death, really looking for Master Violinist to do his job! I was wondering how "up-to-date" story lines are However, the "Reform School" reference is outdated. A boy, whose father had died, and raised by his mother and parents .... Today most of the steps of our kids are progressing step by step step by step step by step step by step step by step step by step. I got very angry when his mother did not go near him and stepped up his dad against his father. <br /> <br /> Also, music selections are hard to believe. I am incredible that a child who can see from around 8, play "Minute Waltz", or the 13-year-old girl can sing an Ariy from Rigletta. Even <br /> <br />, it seems a really fun, good movie and I recommend it. I wish to come out it DVD.
