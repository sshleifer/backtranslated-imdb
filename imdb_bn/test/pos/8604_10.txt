This is a beautiful global adaptation of Masuji Ibos' novel "Black Rain". Like the book, it's very running and worried-provocative. Some couples try to see their niece to marry the story successfully. After walking with Hiroshima during the bombing, rumors spread that he was suffering from radiation sickness. Good shooting, good acting, moving, tragic, scary and fun.
