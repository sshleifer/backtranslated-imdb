I knew I would see it as soon as I saw the black traps Moan first trailer. I was not disappointed at the slightest point in the film and directed by Craig Brewer, producer of Hessel and Flow. It's a broken blues man and nymphomaniac story aiming for his goal only for him, but healing for his own ... yet it is much more than that. It's complicated and rich and it guides you to a silky, sticky, fertile blue memphis, which makes you think of the need for a bath later on. <br /> <br /> Characters (in most cases) are multiple and very well written and run. The pronunciation and dialogue are carried shamelessly. However, the chain had a weak link: Justin Timberlake I can tell him the best that he can cry ... this is a rare male actor who can cry hardly. However, Justin's Ronnie was at the flat, but as an actor he was trying very hard. I must give him another chance. <br /> <br /> Lazar and Ray (Samuel L. Jackson and Kristina Richie Gradually) are a great chemistry and respect for each other. This is a movie where it does not matter how well an actor does and the actress is on top of the task. <br /> <br /> The music was as good as you expected, especially when Mr. Samuel L. Jackson Blues sang. Phenomenal. <br /> <br /> In technical terms, I could see as far as brightness was. It's well edited, good shots, and mixed ... everything was great. The character and set designs were just fine, the casting of support letters (even Justin Timberlake and especially Kim Richards) was spot ... it was good.
