Well-illustrated, acclaimed director Hugh Hudson (Fire Rath) has created a story that brings the whole legend of John Clayton, Lord Greystoke and Tarazan to life with respect and dignity, and with an opportunity that can be seen in the Tarzan movie. Christopher Lambert made his acting debut as a young boy raised by a female Gorilla after a female friend died in Africa. Later, he returned to a foreign world, which is class and privilege, he went out completely. Once he learns what happened to the missiles he and his world are getting, he realizes that he must return. A sad but winning story is called against a background of gorgeous vistas. This must be one of those movies for the filmmaking collection.
