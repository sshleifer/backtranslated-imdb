Where it was abandoned, Dr. Hu, Rose, his alternate father, Mickey, found himself with the mystery of Rickey and Mickey's cyberman culture, the second part of Cyberman's Ark 2 episode felt more like the antagonist of the eastern part, which is real In the sense, the cursed show was felt like an episode of "Sliders", which is a right in its own right Have a great display. The chariot was quite enjoyable because I am one of the best to subscribe to any of the best, but at the same time it is comparable to the previous series' dale episode. And compared to the comparisons it seems like only a low job, it's I could just be done in one episode of this story. Remember that in the first part of the review I said that there is usually no permanent reaction between such stories related to alternative reality, it is not here, but how the overall changes are tagged and it does not really seem to hold the character. <Br> <br /> My grade: C +
