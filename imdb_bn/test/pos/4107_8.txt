It was one of my favorite as a child. My family had 8 track tape soundtrack !! My year (at the age of 20, my father took our year) to get the video of the film (my father has tapped it from HBO or something). Every summer, when we go to the beach (my mother, brother, sister and I), we live on the beach and sing all the songs of this movie !!! Love it !!!
