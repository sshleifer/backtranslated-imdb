The story itself is regular: a boy runs away from home and ends up fighting a struggle for kids in the music school. She convinces a famous violinist in school sponsors. This image is divided into 11 weeks by a splitting of shooting, and has many fun picks that the viewers can find him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> By her music and acting. There is a lot of music, classical works directed by Heifetz and the Mermembal orchestra of the leading young people Symphony, and the music is excellent. By myself, it will see pictures worth it. The management and running responsibilities were kept in the best hands: Alfred Newman's <br /> <br /> is a study of contradiction. Among the orchestra kids, most of which did not have little or no acting experience, they must be directed directed by Archibi Mayo Pagal, looking at the camera, emphasizing the parts they have, and extremely following their instructions. But due to the lack of training, the spontaneity adds attractive attraction to the photo. Experienced actors were wondering with the material they had worked with. Walter Breinen cast his role perfectly, which he imitated in real life. Joel McCracky and Andrea Leeds were the ideal fit for their portfolios. And the supporting actor was the real actor who is the character actor: Mazzarie Moyen, Arthur Hohl, Paul Harvey, Charles Coleman, Perry Ives, and Porter Hall - his ideal role - all the norms. And Bit players: Jesse Arnold, John Hamilton, Marjorie Wood, Jimmy Flavin, Dulcci Day, Lee Phelps played his normal role as police and many others. If you are a fan of character actors, then this movie will bring many memories. <br /> <br /> Overall, the picture is very enjoyable and recommended, even if you are classical music <br /> <br /> <br />
