One of the most admired films for the English patient's most admired films I say, mostly, because this film is very serious, intense, deep and really thoughtful, yet there are still some flaws. First and foremost, why, why is the modern film so long? It lasts for more than two hours and it becomes difficult to concentrate from time to time and follow extremely deadly conspiracies. I say, if the film is one hour short, it will be just fine. However, we have to have us there. Many Oscars winners, English patients are still very good. It is a deep, insightful book of man's deepest spirit, love and betrayal, war and adolescence, violence and bravery. Raffle Fiennes is a smashing superb actor. Her hero, nervous and silent, is a mysterious person, ready for everything to save his lover's life only. He is great, although half-time he is a distorted lame. He's strong link here. Juliette Binoche is as usual very believable and sweet. He added a lot to his excellent play and a plot of love story with that Sikh officer. Will Defoe, Colin Firth, Christine Scott Thomas are all here, all big and all very strong. And then the desert of Egypt, then there is deep, cloudless sky, green sky in Italy. Nature is here, even when people die, bursts of bombs, bursts of land exploded. The fight is here, too. It is clear, terrible, and bloody. Then, there are bodies, terrible beef, then nude agencies, adultery and all. I do not know what to say. The works of such wonderful actors, so much reality, make the war so cruel. This is not a movie for entertainment. It makes you think.
