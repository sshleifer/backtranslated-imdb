This was the success of Gene Kelly, and that alone makes it memorable. Rita Hayrth's love for her boyfriend and Commonwealth Phill Silvers as well as throw them in all the people, and you have real throng-ingredients that come out of it. <br /> <br /> Kelly played Danny McGuin, the owner of Brooklyn's nightclub (Brusilin always "wrong aspects of the track" in the movies of 40), whose star attraction and love interest is Parker (Rita Haven). Rita is beautiful, and even plays a dual role as Grandmother of Rusty and Rusty. Rusty, who played romance and romance of romance grandmother, starring Justin Coder Because he has the chance to succeed that he can not give him. But, Naturally, that's not what Rusty wants, because, naturally, the only person in the girl's mind is the only thing in those films. There is no surprise, but everyone does their thing well. <br /> <br /> Kelly is the first dance of her wonderful trick, as this reflects from a glass window with herself. He was the owner of such kind of dance and is still wondering how he spent all his time properly so that he really seems to be in two places in one place. The melodrama gets a little thick, and there is a somewhat void war reference that does little work but gives singing or two opportunities, but Kelly takes this image to the next level. Before she became perhaps a mega star and very smooth for her own well. The intrinsic edge of his character's cravings lends to a credible and often intelligent wind. <br /> <br /> Kelly's character Danny McGuie, named "Janadu" was named in 1980. This movie started, this is a great game for a last drama competition. Obviously, this picture refers to him a lot. Highly recommended.
