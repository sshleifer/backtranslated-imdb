This picture makes different nods of various science fiction films. Txx-1138's original dramatic version (The Big Rogers Trailer, here it was a clip from some of the original Japanese SF TV shows) seduction reminds me. Then the city's first shot of 2345 reminds Bladder's immediate attack on a billboard flying with a billboard. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The population is forced to take intoxicants the drug TheXX-1138 and looks like a cross between the main proponents, Elvis and Dan Acrooyde, it becomes a robot, much like the terminator. The last battle reminds one of the TERMINATOR 2 and the end result is lovely. Probably not one of the best SF movies, but it's enjoyable, of course, much more enjoyable than triangle like Battlefield Earth.
