In 1976, there was no CGI, I think the film was quite visible. The studio productions were very good and very wide. The background effect was very credible and they are displayed as part of the entire set. In the context of the film, actors have been acting in a manner similar to Jules Verne's atmosphere, where most of the imagination and possibilities of future inquiries were incomplete. I used to watch this movie in 1976, I was afraid of the power of man to create a machine that could probably travel to the core of the Earth. I'm still wondering on this day why we are not flying in all our cars but I digress. McClure and Cushing have fun moments, mostly on the face of each other from their facial expression, of course I like some kind of campeen. 'Monsters' preferred a bit, but the story was good, although I think any other kind of thing could be more credible under that situation. All are now quite frequently for his time and fun.
