Every show is nice Finally, why not get married or why are they like normal people why they are talking about good people, a show about something else. Shamefully it was canceled. <br /> <br /> Sickson's former Mike Schoolie and Julie Thakkar wrote or wrote that some interesting episodes of the series and mostly the similar style humor.

Well, my griping day is done for that. Now back to the Simpson. When is it? Yes! Always.
