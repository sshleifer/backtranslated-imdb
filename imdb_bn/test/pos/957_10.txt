I absolutely must admit that I like this movie. Of course, I'm sure that you know that "Malcolm's Middle" star Frankie Muniz, and so sweet Amanda Bones "The Amanda Show" have played as two friends in the children's comedy, I'm sure that we're all going back to the film Jason Shepard (Frankie ) And his friend Kleley (Amanda) going on an adventure in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Spinner Aid <br /> <br /> This Jason's 14-year-old son is lying to live daily. Jason was hit by one day by Mr. Wolf (the big bad director). Jason's English paper was stolen by Wolf and began his courage to return to the belief of his father. They fly to Hollywood to search for Wolf to bring him back. To return Franky and Amanda Wolf, all kinds of crazy stunts work, and call Jason's father what he needs to do. He stole his idea. But the end is not a real surprise, good trends and wins. <br /> <br /> The story is beautiful and the fifth class is cheerful, but do you expect it to be a PG rating? I really believe one of the best family comedy this year. Not only children of big acting, exceptional welding, well-written, but it's good fun fun. It laughs along with love with my innocent message. I'd highly reccomend it and have to agree with anyone that gave it a zero that of ten. Unemployed critics are not unemployed for anything. I give it a perfect (well ten ten votes in ten).
