"Shadows" is often praised as a successful film for American film independence. Whether it is true or not, it is a perfect movie, whose effect can be traced all the way up to today's Sun's quadruple. Here is a movie that deals with day-to-day controversies (such as racialism) and refuses to give simple answers and shows them in manipulative fashion. Also, it is related to sex without discussing Hollywood, even "graduates". <br /> <br /> Still the question is as strong as today's expression? The answer is yes. Although it is difficult to see and date many important movies today, "Shadow" is now barred from every emotional feeling when it is seen. It is related to racism as a personal matter and not political, so it is still relevant. Plus, it's a great time to act as a capsule, the 1950s beat generation, and the New York art scene probably not taken in a film. <br /> <br /> At a technical level, it is neatly disrespected. Cassavetes was yet to gain full confidence as the director and reflects the sticky performance of the film's low budget. Still, the story of the film is still strong. Plus, acting, casting and considering the inexperience of improvisational nature, is phenomenal. Around, the actors create realistic characters, despite being sympathetic to them often than complimentary actions. "Film" is absolutely mandatory watching for film buffs. (9/10)
