A fascinating and acute criticism of Russian society and culture while transformation from communalism, OKNO V PARIZH also shows in Western hostile light. A group of Russians living in St. Petersburg (AK Peter the Great's "Window in the West") found a magic portal that soon moved to Paris. Momin's film is really ridiculous, and only "weird" keeps it firmly with the viewers of her toes. The songs, the sequence of dreams, and the delicious hateful limbs of both cultures mix together to create a memorable and meaningful movie. Anyone trying to move to Russia's cultural feelings after the fall of the USSR should start here.
