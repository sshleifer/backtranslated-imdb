This documentary is a wonderful example that is an entertaining and amazing experience that can be a documentary, if it is so good. Inspiring to anyone who knows what it is like to keep the dream of "impossible" in the subject, the mark, the smart, the funny and very driven, and the dream of his dream home. See this movie
