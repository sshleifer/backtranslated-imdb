In the front, if you're tired, the first hour may be slow. The story set up is a normal retrograde motion, uncomfortable - giving our daily characters time to appreciate everyday life and situation. Once you've reached the climatic section of the story, the shifts of events will shield you: how things will change, what will be our valuable funds (portrayed silent calm perfection by veteran Czech actor Vlastimil Brodský), how his wife (played by Stella Zázvorková nicely) will behave , What happens to Fanda's favorite friend Ed (played by Stanislav Zindula) - Match with Brodsky Sidakic), and corrupt son with selfish secret program, the kindness of his parents (darkness!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Laughter smile, save Ziro Habak's insightful script. Thanks for clearing the subtitles, I was able to notify the fundamental wives for every complaint, showing an indication of 'caringness' shown / buried in the line - and the Judge Female Judge also did it. The fund is going to '76 'and the affection of their lasting (respectable) marriage reveals their rebellious arguments. Her playfulness may be contagious. <br /> <br /> It's at least 50 years old (at least 50 'old together, 101'), and children's learning lessons do not accept parents. The end of 'house for ages' means if you can speak, one will have to think again. When the movie can live a good life for us, we are slowly shouting. (Hint: Have fun to stay and see the last credit roll.) <br /> <br /> We are fortunate to be able to see a regular check film. The father and son of Sverák ("Kolya") were released with the 2001 "Dark Blue World" stone. It is better now to take it at a slow pace and a foreign jewel - praising the story of an engaging man with its subtitles, scenery, melodic scores and elegant acting. "Ottoman Spring" (sky babie leto) is available in the DVD. Enjoy!
