In Yorkshire in 1850, a boy was stolen and run away by his hypocrite on a false charge of Chimney-Sweep. She falls into a treacherous local river and is undergoing an underwater kingdom, where she makes many friends and rescues the child from the mythical water to an evil shark. Based on a book by Charles Kingsley, it is a lovely children's film, half-live-action and half-animations, a great and encouraging picture of Victorian bars and a regional enjoyable undersea adventure. This is truly two films, which are somehow complementing each other and combined a rich whole. Tony Cuthbert's animations, Jack Stokes and Mirosola Kizovich are wonderful, like Ted Skyf's photography and Phil Colter and Bill Martin's music. There is a lot of horman quality outside the water of Panda (literally) - When I'm at the top of the palace, I love it, I see all the chimneys and shouted "Blame!" At the top of his voice. Mason and Krebbins are the most sophisticated, the worst words that you can expect to see in a dress (if you want to see the true Victorian value, do not see the sensitivity and sensitivity, see it) and Whitelaw, Parate (who has a lot of voices) and Percival are all excellent . This should be a good kids movie - good old singing song, but a little thoughtful, sad and scared. High cocktail !!
