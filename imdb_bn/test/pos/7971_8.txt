An extraordinary employee movie that I have ever seen It was its first expression after seeing twice in local television in Indonesia. A combination between a constant shooting and a great fight scripture David Bradley played well. He was better than "American Samurai" here. Its skill in martial arts takes place on the average. He has been successful in seeing the war scene beautifully. Most of the martial artists are not touching and kicking to show in their movies. David Bradley could use all martial arts techniques as the throw, destroy and kick. Highly recommended for staff fans. I tried to find DVD but I still can not get it in my city specifically. Can anyone help me?
