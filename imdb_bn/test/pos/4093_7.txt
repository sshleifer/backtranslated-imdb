I have offset all the terrible comments. I like this movie. I own movies and soundtracks. I need a pickup when I watch it. Guess it is not like sound of music, but if you do not have fun in the selection of movies, it is a lot of fun for you. I adored Bobby van late (and great), and James Shigeta always has and will always be a favorite. I first saw this after coming out of the theater. I'm 100 times better than a big musical fan and this "boyfriend" Twiggy. It should not be judged by a modern musical and all that went before. It's best for the dreamers like me who want to find this place - no sickness, no war, no drugs, all bad things in life have gone away. This is nothing more than a good movie. That would be about all the movies. Shaun Phillips's title song explains the splendid and full sense of the film. If acting is the greatest, care-taker. I love the idea of ​​movie. Peter Finch, very tough actor, live olman, fantastic morning, Sally Kellman, surprisingly good voice, Michael York, generally, and Olivia Hassie, everyone is amazing, everyone believes that they are the normal rice of mills. One of them did not act like actors. They acted like real people, if I find this place, I'll work the same way. Everything goes away in the house and staying there, afraid of everything. Yes, this movie has errors, but keep an eye on it, it's not a citizen bride, it's a good musical instrument!
