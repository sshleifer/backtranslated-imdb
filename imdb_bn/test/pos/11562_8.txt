I did not see this movie in the mid-70's, but I think it is a very realistic script of the music business (there is Paul Simmons with "One Trick Tony".) Another underlying movie IMO <br /> < <br /> <br /> One of the producers that Harry Kettle believes in music, and the commercial "trip" record company wants to "work" with him. /> Since I spent my entire career as a musician / producer / producer in the music industry, I can truly reassure the film for its autobiography. <br /> <br /> If it comes out of DVD Uncut, then I want to buy it!
