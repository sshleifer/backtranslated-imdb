Last year, Charles Darwin was the 150th anniversary of the birth of the 200th anniversary and "the source of the species", so it is true that the "creation" of John Amil was released. The film focuses on the light of the life of Darwin (Paul Bettany) and his family's life while writing his famous works. <br /> <br /> I think this movie has exceeded Darwin's intense tension of his religious wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly), and her fault about her dead daughter Annie, but I still have Darwin's theory of opinion like a cart chop on religious Kurdishs Likes. As it was, due to the Creator-evolutionary debate ("yes, it is still going on") in the United States was one of the last countries named "Creation". US <br /> <br /> is not a great composition, but I recommend that I "enter the wind" recommend. I hope one day, creationism-evolution will not be a matter of debate. If this movie helps to relax the debate, then everyone else will have more energy in the film! Martha West, Jeremy Northam, Toby Jones and Benedict Cumberbatch.
