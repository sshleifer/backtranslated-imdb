I saw this movie time and time and time - every time it laughs me, it thinks me, and it lets me cry. Robin has done an incredible job of portraying Tune Marci (and I'm very happy that Kate Winslet and the other woman have turned her part). This is just one of the rolls you know that nobody else could compare. <Br /> <br /> Together with ugly circumstances this is a beautiful love story of 2 very different people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, 50/50 of the results - but if you like it, you like it and want to share it with others! 10 stars all the way!
