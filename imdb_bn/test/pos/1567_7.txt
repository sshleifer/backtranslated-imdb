There is not much of the story. A young girl stole some money from Derby Vermont's supermarket, where she works, decided to move to Florida where her friend Julie dreams of attending school and encounters a diverse couple at the highway. If you think of an adult couple from "Rosemary Baby", how do you think this idea? Bill is a ridiculous face and retirement from the army. Sandra is a former stripper who has become a truckstop whore, although we could not find it once. They are tender, helpful, and full of common sense. <br /> <br /> They take a little baby girl, Elise, and promise to travel to their wide RV, even though they are not directly "driving" "Florida. <br /> <br /> Hundreds of this image Percent mistakes can be made.All filmmakers have become the personality of the elderly couple evil.They will take the virgin Alice (the bed or whatever the handcuffed) and her body has any greaseball driver who has a lot of money and the buck The sex will be sold like this. (The hack was on the escape from Alice, many were tried before being shot for the last time.) But, the couple is really beautiful, and far away from Alice's virgin. Elise overhears Sandra with a customer , Asks about the business, and tries to introduce a strategy of his own. The bill prevents something happening and forcefully says that he is doing the job. If he does, he will not work in it, they do not talk to him, they guide him. <br /> <br /> Alice earns a few million dollars, which is more than a hundred dollars more than she meets couples. Keeps its money where customers can not find it. Alice misunderstood. She does not find very pleasant work, and she thinks she will never stop because every time she speaks of closing, Sandra answers, "What's not here, honey, nowhere." However, after talking to him after handing over his gun to Sandra, the couple gave him his money and loyally released him to continue his trip to Florida. <br /> <br /> Do you know that I am the most tragic moment in the film? It was nothing to do with prostitution or theft. Alice is waiting for her room after meeting her friend Julie Miami. Julie is after all a valid student. But when Alice invites her friend to the album to assure her friend to move to his place, Julie hesitates and says, "Well - my mother does not think you should be room with us." And you tell the truth, my roommate is not cold. I invited you, but I thought it was like seeing a week or something. Go back to Milford Alice "Alice has been silent for a long time before going down." <br/> <br /> The only shot was fired (some white frames in the film) and nobody gets hurt. Tears appear only once. Someone slugs someone else No car explodes in a fireball. No police chasing down their internship. <br /> <br /> The direction is sometimes painful. Alice and Alice have been crossing a lot of cross in Sandra to keep a pistol in their hands. There are rarely any musical score. Short men and women have nudity and it is weird, it is probably supposed to be. Alice is not illusory but she is not Babali. She plays a powerful version of Asiatic Eye, Molly Parker. Cinematography is looking cheap and colors are washed. The side is a straightforward story, with some enlightened flashbacks. Nothing is lost. And it's obviously shot around Danbury, Connecticut. I remember the city because I had entered through it after its flood and it seemed to me that the cars took all kinds of mud till the handles. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure Elise found. (I wonder the terrible question that "he has found himself.") Acting is not so bad. Judith is better than Ivy. It is definitely valuable, a cool, growing film that treats viewers like adults.
