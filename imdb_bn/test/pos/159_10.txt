If you like Chan-Ouk Park, you know what you can expect. His films are brutal, poetic, sad, and artistic, with the impression of very fierce humor. Thierce is definitely the style of the park and I like it in every second from the genre (both the songs are fantastic and creative), which mixes Shakespeare's tragedy, murderous love, gothic horror, and layered character drama. There are lots of moral ambiguity to get complex and closer to the characters. Even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy. The direction is controlled and the performance is dancing - opinions for the MR. Opportunities, there are many subtleties to take first watching. Chan-Uk Park is an intelligent, bold, consistently wonderful filmmaker. It is unpredictable - the scenes become instant hilarious from the sunny and heart-wrench instantaneously. This is the feeling for MR then near Latin Vengeance. As far as being top and ridiculous. But, like Lady Vengeance, it's incredibly rich, thought-provoking and fruitful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you like beautifully vampire stories (right next to each other) or a fan of Chan-ek Park, you should be clear three thirty. Easily one of the best movies of 2009
