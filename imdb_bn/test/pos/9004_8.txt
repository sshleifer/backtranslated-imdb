Like most of the movies that came in the past, this movie is very respectful, it really is based on This movie is different about how it is about a rugby team, a game that is not familiar with many Americans. Set aside, this movie is very rewarding piece of film noir. It reminds me of "Way Marshal", but with the feeling of a small budget and an independent film. Director Ryan Little's a great effort that brought us a story about a rebel tragedy by Shane Faris (cover back down), like Rick Penning, who has found himself in a strange place both outside and outside the field. Despite several plot-line holes, this film is a heart, which rewards visitors with good characters, which we can detect. Coach Larry Gelix and Neal McDonough have also co-starred Gary Kole as coach pairing (Rick's father). I was fascinated by watching myself in different movies, until finally I felt the feeling of faith in mankind and the future for my children, especially if there were coaches like Gelix.
