This is a jewel. As a film produces four - the expected quality is actually delivered. Some Errol Morris films that shot me with great style, arranged well and simply gripping. It's still awkward yet surprising to the point. We've got something bad (we can guess by the lack of a person's participation in the interview) but we're forced to see it, something like a car accident at slow speed. The story spreads fantasially and does not try to show the horrors of the story in front of some documentaries, and Don also left behind behind the behavior of people, thinking that why they could not save him time. It took a few hours to find melancholy that gripped me after seeing this very well-made documentary.
