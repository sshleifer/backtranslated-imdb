"Why do so many songs about rain, and on the other side?" At the beginning of his signature song "The Rainbow Connection", during the song "The Muppets Movie" Kimmits doubled this relatively easy double. Over time, questions and movies only gain profitability. <br /> <br /> I will review this movie as a children's comedy, but looking at it as a classic for every generation, love with a serious ideology and a heartwarming message that gets more warmth with each passing year. <br /> <br /> The milestones of my own life are becoming increasing on me, so I can hear more worrisome sections of the initial distance, and it is understandable that we all dream, because it can fit the soundtrack of life's life. And that's what this movie is about. It's not just a bunch of dolls - it's a bunch of power dolls to follow their dreams, which is a good lesson for everyone. <br /> <br /> And when the humor and joy of the film always seems good, they are not a fair judge in the movie. Only "Rainbow Connection" and strong emotions have to understand it. And it fits all: "Rainbow connection" * Muppate movie, and vice versa. It does not have any easy way to describe it - the existence of children without necessity.
