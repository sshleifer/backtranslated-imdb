There is not any other drama that is afraid of shit like me, these characters are not your ideal Islamic terrorists, you have a blonde-haired, blue-eyed man, which she thinks she is a converted Muslim. A well-respected businessman, who claims to be a Jew and a Frenchman who has converted to Islam, but he fully embodies the new level Quranic word. Hero of the plot Darwin, who is a secret agency FBI agent who surrounds the terrorist cell, and has to do all the terrible things of Allah to prevent him from being identified. A small taste to follow the first episode. Although it is about the Islamic terrorists, a unique way of the drama indicates that not all Muslims are extremists, who give comfort to racism, because half the terrorist cell transforms Islam, it thinks that they might have to fear. The most cool drama I've ever seen It's so cool because you never know who your friend, your husband or your neighbors are actually. Terrorists can be anywhere, any time.
