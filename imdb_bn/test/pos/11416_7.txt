I'm a big horror fan and I quite enjoyed this remix. I thought it was a good effort to get rid of these awesome remixes. <br /> <br /> I saw it with my two younger sisters and it seems that it was very good because they were very scared. On the screen shouted, "Do not do that!", "No way!", Etc. I thought that there are some nice little moments and it's good to pull. <br /> <br /> The lead role of Camila Bell is absolutely stunning and a very good actress - so she holds your attention well. <br /> <br /> Overall a decent movie.
