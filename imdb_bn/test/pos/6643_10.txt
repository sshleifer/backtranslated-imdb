Shame is unique as a war film (or rather, mostly anti-war film), it is not only involved in soldier or politics (do not believe in politics but you will see how). , It discusses two main topics, that two people may live in this stupid, decayed society. In the footsteps of Ingmar Bergman, the middle of his head, and two other serious psychological films, Persa and Hour of the Wolf, more interested in seeing how the effects of this war have generally affected the civilized people, the worst of them, and living in a cathartic way. What's important is a reminder. His two main actors are known as regular collaborators and friends, Mc Fan Sido and Levi Woolman (Renzben is unusually enough), who thinks of a musician living in a farm on a island (if not different from 'Wolf'). <Br> <br /> They look roll by tanks and some old friends already wear, but they do not try too much attention; There is a sweet scene where the couple just speaks, rather spontaneously (a shot repeatedly reproduced through the photo, which might be likely to get excited) ... then the issue with a fake film comes in the issue of guns with Rozenberg, psychiatrists in prisoners of war Unrest, and terrorism involving 'friend' in the military (Burner's Gunner One of the most delicate tasks of the universe). It is not one of the simplest movies in terms of Bergman's filmography, but it can be one of the more accessible tasks for this. His religious themes have been kept at a very low cost, even the idea of ​​believing in a belief influences the film's atmosphere. During the war crimes, it was shot in an irrelevant, fast-paced way (through great Amigo Svens Niquist). <br /> <br /> and reconstruction of the relationship between John and Eve successfully merged with the success of a chaotic battle. The lines are not very drawn to the line where too much. This image was shot correctly in Vietnam's worst period, it is more relevant for today. I could not help but with fighters in Iraq and elsewhere elsewhere, John and Iva could not see the compromise with the scene or those who were 'in-charge'. Very last scene, however, Bergman's very good one, around (acting, direction, light). This is not a picture of war (or again, anti-war, I could not find John Wayne's soul in this production) that I would suggest to friends from the bat right to preserve the friends's ring - it is more about relations with a little more glorious path, look at the effect of the hypocrisy of war . But in reality, like Bergman's "General" films, it stands alone, but the industry packs a wall for the crowd.
