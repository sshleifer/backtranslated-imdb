This movie is just good, its not surprising. Apart from providing our best performance, original plot, excellent special effects, thoughtful messages and much more, it was even universally completely invisible in the world. This is the first scientist film that explodes the immense impact and mind of the unknown space in our galaxy, which leaves the audience without the words. I'm only 16 years old, and so I grew up in a world of modern influences and 3D animation in movies. But I was really, and my entire meaning was over 40 years later, even by the quality of these effects was blown away. The visual effect was only one of the qualities of this movie, the actual Kubrick style of the camera was amazing and wonderful. You feel like you consume by the screen and sucked in this surreal world (especially the round control room or whatever you call it). Influence, the camera and the intense size of this film has captured my guards, even though I bought it and saw the rating earlier. But this is more than this movie. You can also interpret the meaning of this movie with your own wishes, although I think there are some clear facts about humanity (true qu√©bec style). How humanity at the top of its evolution is simply maintenance on the board, and so does not require computers, one of the human tools. How do we appear like children in space, learning to walk once more, losing control of our equipment of zero-gravity, breathing through the equipment as water out of water. At the top of evolution, we sometimes set out as simple primates in the last generation. Many people think that the length and the slow pace of the movie is boring? ridicules Or just a waste of time. But before you reach this conclusion, why does the Kubrick think of why it spends time with a spaceship between quiet music and space for a few minutes. It is decorated with the beauty of beauty. Beauty, beauty is not given the right respect by many viewers in many cases. Kubrick wants to show our beauty, and if we are not frustrated at it and do not relax, we can not enjoy this movie for its purpose. This is not a general movie, we just can not sit and see with some other movies, its time, thinking and need to see all the commitments and feelings. Together with all these, the moving picture makes this one of the biggest achievements in the world. 10/10 Let me know if you agree with me.
