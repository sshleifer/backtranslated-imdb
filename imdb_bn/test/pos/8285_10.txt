AWWWW, I just love this movie bit. I and my cousins ​​enjoy this movie a lot and I'm just such a huge fan !!! I hope they will soon bring the TV series on DVD. To mention it, I do not see the long-time TV show. Such as Guatemala Bar! I came from Australia where chipmunk adventures are not only known for their late thirteen years and adult years are very tragic because young children have lost. <br /> <br /> This photo is the songs I love to rock n'roll most guys / girls, diamond dolls and songs that make sure you want to cry my mom <br /> <br /> <br /> This photo is guaranteed to encourage both young people and today will get Chipmuk's adventure on Wednesday !!! 10 out of 10, such an excellent movie.
