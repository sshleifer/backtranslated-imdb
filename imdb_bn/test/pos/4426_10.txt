I have just returned from watching this Academy Award nominated Doc, and I was totally touched and interested in searching for the work of this colleague that I had never heard of before. Of course I am a man who has been captured with beautiful architecture, so I understand that others will not care. <br /> <br /> We can only imagine that at the end of the 60's, Philadelphia had some more dreamers, there was a possibility of planning, what would be a wonderful city center. If you see more about the Bangladesh building at the beginning of the film, then be patient, because it will eventually provide the highest measurement of the film. <br /> <br /> In the process of making this film, his son's personal discoveries are quite interesting, sometimes touched, even occasionally funny. Sometimes one of the most ridiculous anti-dream rants captured on camera. <br /> <br /> Finding the best aspects of this doc is a touchy music score with a nice sensitive string music. And the publisher found a main point of ear's architecture. Other architects have gathered about the spiritual nature of the matter and how Kana's houses combine the overall experience of this film.
