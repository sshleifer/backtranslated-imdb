Generally, movies are away from the "domestic drama" and for good reason: deliberately wants to pick up entertainment from a story that wants to deal with reality with them or their neighbors? The American family of all classes of divorce is unbelievable percentage of the pain and henchmen war and it is the necessary part. This is not perfection - the number one reason the average person has become a movie - this is a sad reality. <br /> <br /> Typically, divorce or custody is part of a larger story, and we influence it to understand or relate to its characters. "Crumer vs Krummer" focuses on him and asks us why we do it and why it creates such a problem. This is a challenge for both the movie and its audience: Make a real transformation that can attract our attention and then we do not feel annoying to keep the mirror from our mouth. Writer / director Robert Benton has clearly acquired impressive fashion in both the novels and avatar of this avatar. <br /> <br /> The story, as expected, is quite simple: big business advertised people Ted Crumer (Dustin Hoffman) leaves her wife Joanna (Merrill Strip) and her 7-year-old son Billy (Justin Henry) Came back Then the boys will have to learn to be active parents in the lives of the boys and as soon as possible, they bring a custody case against him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You're not much better than Hoffman and Strip. Hoffman played his main role in this role: his first Oscar win after three notable nominations. He created a thorough character, whose self-centered and quick-tempered ways evolve clearly when he learns to be a good father and the only caregiver. Strip has won her first Oscar for her first major role in the career, the screen of any woman does not get time, but with the decision to return to her custody time, the new victim must be contacted both in terms of identity. Streep does so effortlessly The young man, Justin Henry, who was nominated for the most competitive competition in the history of the Academy Awards at his age, had a wonderful performance of 7-year-old children. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Benton's earlier significant credits ("Bonnie and Clyde" and "Superman") do not refer to the strong direction of the family drama, but people can write. Many scenes give us powerful scenery that shows us more than typical family scenes. The first morning to go to Joanna and Billy French toast in Ted Meck is a classic that perfectly shows the scenes that are happening in the American kitchen. <br /> <br /> You will rarely see a story as easy as "good work in the Kramer vs. Crum". The curtains at the end or the twists and turns that the screen will keep us tightly glued. Then the film will have to depend on its talents and they are definitely like fire, which gives a new perception of the familiar matter.
