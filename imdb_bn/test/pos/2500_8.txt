This movie was a sick sweet cutesy romantic comedy, I usually dislike similar movies but this was just as cute enough to me. It was really fun at one moment (probably why I liked it) and then thereafter serious. Also, it was Allen and I always got a soft spot for him. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> She goes crazy for her to think about it and try to think about who sent it. He has shut himself off from the world, so it really threw him for a loop. Finally, almost all of them find this letter associated with it and they all get mixed signals that create some really funny moments. <br /> <br /> I said, I'm not the only one for this kind of film but I really enjoyed it and it is highly recommended.
