The plot is predictable. It has been done many times in other movies. You are competing in the summer camp this month: Richer kids vs underhairs are usually competing for "brasying" rights in camp competition, kids and consoles follow comedy, sex and "a good time"! "Are you ready for summer?" Meatballs are the first good and (best) summer camp movie feel-good comedy. Others have been posted, why it is no citizen, but this kind of movie is not meant to be. The film works due to Bill Murray's wonderful comic timing and classic one-liner. His scene with a camper where he tried to raise children's self-esteem was very good. Bill lining across the movie is very interesting. <br /> <br /> I also like this movie is not as dirty or clear as thirteen kids in the camp. The whole film contains some light sexual exploration and probably contains one or two cousins. But meatballs are the movies of young people that are really suitable for young people. It has been rated PG <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To get this crown you will have to watch a few times! When Bill Murray is on the screen or creates his classic "PA Announcement", you drag the movie. The bill seems to be carrying movies to everyone. But he does very well, when you see meatballs, you can understand that this picture has made him a star! In addition to this review, to avoid all the sequels of the meatball movie. They are horribly bad.
