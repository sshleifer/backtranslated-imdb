The game was made in 1996, but it's still good. Graphics are not hot and the actor is not worthy of Oscar, but the plot has changed, diabolic and very enjoyable. Dark stories are forced from the first movie and are all running throughout the game. We have played several people together for more than one reason: 1) Use all our minds together. 2) Do not be afraid of it <br /> <br /> Play this game and you will not be sorry about it, do not try to find an earthquake engine.
