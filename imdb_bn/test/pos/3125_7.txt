This image is about two horse traders who agree to follow a small group of Mormons across the desert. By the way, they face a deadly family who destroys peaceful people and put their pilgrimage in danger. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are no other budgets or opportunities for its other westerners. In particular, this movie does not have stars like John Wayne, but it allows taking the center of normal supporting characters. Long-time Ford's stock character played actor Ben Johnson, Harry Kerry, Junior and Ward Bond, and probably the title "The" was probably Johnson - although the other two received almost the same screen time and focus. This is not a bad thing, since the movie worked well without a big star - and it's good to see. <br /> <br /> Now I do not say that I like the movie. It was very good but certainly not perfect. In particular, as far as music goes, you probably love it or hate it. I occasionally amazed the partner of Pioneer. It has uncovered a beautiful mood, but occasionally has been mastered in the scene. I think I've worked a little bit. Besides, with their constant singing in the background, I hope Roy Rogers pop out at any time. Another minor problem is that this plot was unusually easy and the last was a conclusion long ago. However, and I'm happy to say 'anyway', though instead it is sutural and sensitive, film still works well. It was primarily due to John Ford's excellent, natural direction as well as Ben Johnson's exceptional karma. She was able to provide a nice anchor for the film. Another plus for me that I saw as Brisam Yuan the same week, another movie about Mormon migration. Although Brigam Yunun was somewhat stupid and exaggerated "slow" in his painting, the mormones were less "perfect" and real people - with foil and personality. Oh, and Brigames are talking about young people, it seems, in this era, General Zen Durwell has become a girl of Mormon-themed film because he was the main supporter of both films. He died in the age of the brigade and it was determined by Wagon Master about 20 years ago, it is some stunt! Also, if you want to see a glimpse of the famous Jim Thorpe, he has a small role where he plays impassive Indian dance beside Jane Darwin near Camp Fire.
