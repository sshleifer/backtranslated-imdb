It was shotnight on the other night, and I think it's a whip of another video, such as "Earth vs. Spider" or any other HBO horror shorts. Instead, I did not find a comedy / Gore classic. It was legally funny, and amazingly, acting was quite good. Even my wife, an entire horror-hatred, agreed and smiled at the part. Also, FX was of high quality. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film was felt like a parody of Joy Joy / Zipar Cripps, and two main characters reminded me of the pair from the Shaun to the dead. Definitely valuable, but do not take it seriously. <br /> <br /> end.
