In the wake of World War II, this story took place in Grameen Germany, some British agents in Germany were kept in the Farm Foundation. Since they are still not technically in war, it seems that both sides must realize what is coming. Both agents (Bruce Lester and Ray Milland) fled and split into the countryside. One evening, Gypsy woman Marlin Dietrich meets on, because she is preparing for the camp alone. An amazing and impressive view of them, for Milland but not for the daytime, it took sexy fertility from a completely new flat. To conceal from the Germans, Milland herself is disguised as a gypsy, but she is committed to her mission, with the identification of the scientist who knows the source of the new toxic gas, but she is also not a Nazi. Hugely Jimmy's life and customs are described in the forecasts, but the underlying knowledge may be one of the targets for the elimination of the Nazis. This picture is not a love story about a serious story about toxic gases and a formula, and a love story between Milland and Diary, although it strongly rejects the line between love story. However, they are both very good; This is the fault of a film that does not give enough dramatic reality to them or their relationships, depending on the spatial cultural differences for the suspicious laughing. However, there are some exciting and interesting points here and there, a wonderful meeting with German soldiers and gestapo agents, where Dietrich reads a big palm, and Germany's dinner party announcement of various Stripes about Germany and the various Stripes comes on the radio that Germany invaded Germany by Poland And everybody is standing and the hard arm is right Looted. Mitchell Lezon missed a few opportunities here and there, but he fully took advantage of others.
