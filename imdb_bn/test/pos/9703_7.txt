This movie is as good as the first Jacques, but a little more skeptical. I did not say it as well as the first, but it came very close. Jackass fans will not be disappointed, but if you do not like the first movie, you will hate it. The scenes that will be seen as the Jacques Classic (a well-known case with "Link", "Cabe Ride" and many others), and you will never see what you want (cone eating, semolina etc ...) Overall this movie is a good watch And I'm glad that I found it. I am not sure that critics critically critically critics of this movie will be given a rating because it was rated (I was sitting in the press division and mostly older obsessive observers), but it does not prevent you from enjoying it.
