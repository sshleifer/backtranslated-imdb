I saw this movie at the third adelaide international film festival of Place Cinema, and it was completely switched in the first five minutes. Thank you for a movie, which we ignore all the garbage, we often see in Australian movies, which are frequently rotating around) b) sex and c) for class, ya ... I say brave .... Jolie is a good movie. The producer, a shy, slightly brilliantly impressive Alex Freon introduced his film, which he spent most of his childhood and made with his bunch to the city. Apparently he had traveled mostly in Europe last year, mostly in Europe. The film created around the world is not bright and it is strange and isolated editing style, Gothic characters and visitors and visitors attracting its night-time, and not because of the guest's place. <br /> <br /> Producer Q + returns for a later ward. Someone asked him what his inspiration was - he answered "South Australia." Listen to me Another person asked him, 'What is the day of Alex's life?' He replied that he carried an old camel, he had breakfast at the same restaurant in the morning, which he had noticed for last 8 years! And he plays piano that helps him think. He does not drink football and plays cricket once a week. Then, after the question-answer session, the film ended suddenly due to the screening - so I thought that the next festivities will have to be expanded after their film sessions.
