Before reviewing this movie, I must give a confession which is a bold statement to create as a movie critic. Anybody who can read any of my previous reviews, may know that I was always controversial in the main category, "Captain America" ​​and "1985" creatures and high marks for flats such as Alastar Sim's "A Christmas Carol" and "Love Shakespeare. " Keep in mind that this confession may not be surprising: <br /> <br /> The common thing is that Christopher Lambert is probably my favorite actor. Woah, now, just do not start mad on me. Let me explain myself: I do not think he is the greatest actor in the world. I clearly admit that he is not. He is definitely not Morgan Freeman or Anthony Hopkins, but I want to say that his performance capacity is probably at least with Bruce Willis. However, what I appreciate about him is the human qualities that he brings to his heroes of action. He is just a common man who smiles and sheds blood, because he is a hero, because he does not want to be because he wants to be. I think, to be able to bring those qualities to a character (especially in the movies he's worked on), and Lambert's heroes have been crying from Schwartzensg or Stalones. Quite obviously, Lambert's letters are easy to relate to me. Therefore, he is not the greatest actor in the world .... He is just a personal favorite. <br /> <br /> I can not say the same for his movies. But I enjoy his acting more, it would be stupid to see that his film choices are going to be a bit preferred. Most of them, fairly true, terrible, and any ridicule that I have received over the years, is not because of her performance, but her bad choice in script. Keeping this in mind, I can say his first film, "Tarzan" is his best film and probably his greatest performance. As I mentioned, the role of humanity plays an effective role and it governs the importance of directors, writers and actors. It was very far from Johnny Weasmeller in the 1940s with B-Movie Action Events. Actually, I would hesitate to call it an action movie. Instead, it is a serious drama that E.R. Take all the elements of Burrough seriously, to discover his true family in Scotland, the search for Tarzan shows, that he understands that he is "like a white grape", isolated between his old family and his new one, which is an extraordinary sir in his final role Includes Ralph Richardson. In an effort to attract people, the fingers of his fingers also take place and he can not decide what he likes: his real family, or whatever he is always familiar with. Above all, it is a wonderful commentary on society, and an excellent characteristic research. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Sicilian. " Unfortunately, it does not end. But just wait for some time ... His latest career, like "Gideon" and "Resurrection", has proved that although he still has a lot of ways, he is quite capable actor who is probably able to make it. Ahmad .... If he makes his role better, then come back. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ****
