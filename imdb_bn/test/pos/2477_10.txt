Well, I enjoyed this movie, though sometimes it's too much for a stereototypical situation. In the past, if the "Park of Park" exists, I did not understand at this time, but I think the matter is not really here. <br /> <br /> You will see this movie differently. It shows how much violence you can find in our world. It reminds us that we live in a world that leads to envy and no one can escape from it. If anyone refuses to take "his responsibility" then we will be expelled from our society ... our history is made by history, we should never forget it. Indeed, only then will we accept the truth that we may change and realize that our "intellectual skills" have improved. So we can use them to find other ways to solve their problems. <br /> <br /> This word must be seen in 2 words, maybe it will help us to accept the truth ...
