I saw this movie that it was going to be absolutely awesome and all was ready for madness, bad special effects etc. But, I was glad. I've never seen that it's the best vampire movie, but it's certainly not the worst. I prefer the state of the whole alternative reality / dream that I have played in the movie. Graphics was good for direct DVD movies and I like the overall look of the film. I enjoyed the main character Sai. I usually end up hating the ladies Leeds but kept me interested in something that was about me. Yes, he made some bad decisions, but it was expected. Yes, other letters were stereotyptical, but I was also expecting it. I do not know whether I recommend this movie, but this is an opportunity and you will be pleasantly surprised. I'm putting this one in my guilty list of pleasure
