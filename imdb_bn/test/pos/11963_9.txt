In the eighties, Savage Steve Holland released three films, two of which seem to be two small, weird teen tricks. The third "How I entered college" does not measure up to "Better of Dead" and it is mainly due to John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong (except for a little camio). <br /> <br /> <br /> One crazy summer has an uninterrupted film, lots of characteristic features and a mess. I think the movies of Seyvez Steve had become Wilfied like that of the brain at that time and after three films, he entered the kids' TV. We could use more movies than her choice.
