I like this movie. Unlike other thrillers, you learn to know very well the killers. You know the two detective victims of their hunting. The killer is two high school kids. They are very smart and want to prove that they are smarter than the police, so they plan "perfect crime". We all know that this crime will not turn out perfect. We do not know if they will be caught, or one of them may be, even no one. In this case, I hope they both will leave this way, even though I do not know whether it is the intention of the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is beautifully told. You are starting to know the people involved. The character of Sandra Bullock is liked but he has his own secret that works against him. Ben Chaplin is both quite good as Sam and two kids are great. Better scenes of scenes in them. <br /> <br /> I think you can say that the movie is good and you do not think you can think. A beautiful evening with a movie, 'Mard by Dinners' is a good one.
