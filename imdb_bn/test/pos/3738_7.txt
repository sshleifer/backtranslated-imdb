Eicard Cage and Diane Lane again in the romantic love story. They are a great team, but in no way will this picture be the best, <br /> <br /> Director George Wolf has done an efficient job by using a screenplay for Nicholas Sparks novels, Anne Peac and John Romanao. These two unknown people have another story and are falling in love, then they go there, then when they meet again and start living together. <br /> <br /> Spokil but not true. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, because of fine acting and excellent production. Apart from our 2 stars, including Christopher Melonie, Viola Davis and Scott Glenn, They all give real good performance and make them very good with the given ingredients. <br /> <br /> There is a good but not consistent storm storm, sex scenes are good, no nudity and no dirty language, <br /> <br /> Rating: *** (out of 4) 82 points (among 100) IMDb 10 out of 7)
