Parvotti and the whole actor are very elegant in this beautifully protected opera, Opera Georgetown, the world's best musician. Coloratura Soprano is especially spectacular with its perfect pitch. The title role is well-enacted and well-organized. The perfect product can be as perfect as it is just perfect. <br /> <br /> A great composition of cinematography! <br /> <br /> <br />
