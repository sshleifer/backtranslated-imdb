This movie should travel more than eight gunfire, 2 kisses and 100 kilograms as far as possible. Still it still works. <br /> <br /> When I was running home from the theater, I tried to understand how I met a movie staple like a tremendous manuscript across a beach or unusual series of unforeseen pages. The whole audience stood up and shouted, "I have seen it millions of times before! And you have crossed the edge of credibility!" But the actors are so appealing and the screen is so trustworthy to fill the excess that I forgot to take care of. A friend who saw this with me that he took him to Paris so that when he left the theater he was frustrated and realized that we were still in Indiana. <br /> <br /> Overall romantic-comedy-thriller, wit and elan
