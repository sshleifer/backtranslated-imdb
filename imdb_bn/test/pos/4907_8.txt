"Four Girls" presented John Garfield as the audience, and it is most remembered about today's movie. Prior to their screen-film prison, some actors present in various films, Garfield, immediately established his cigarette hanging from his face and talking about fate with him. <br /> <br /> This is actually played by four stories girls, their widowed musician (Claude Rennes) and their various suitors, one of whom, Felix, handsome Jeffrey Lynn. He has a crush on all of them, but he is in love with Buff (Priscilla Lane). Then he meets Neer-Du-Mickey Barden, who also falls for him. When Buff realized that one of his sisters loves Felix, he threw him to the altar and married Mickey. <br /> <br /> It is a fairly well-timed story given by acting (and growing) life. Garfield has already been mentioned, but Priscilla Lane is the strongest, most striking and best actress in the daughters. Jeffrey Lynn was a new and handsome figure, and this film gave him the right foot of Warner. However, the truth will not be stardom. Like many of the era he went to the job, and when he came out, he had a bronze star but did not have much of his career. He later went into television and real estate. Cloud rains are warm and wonderful as the fathers. <br /> <br /> It was so popular that "four girls" inspired "four wives" and "four mothers" and again "daughters" brave "where the actor plays different characters. <br /> <br /> Very enjoyable A beautiful memory, easy and perhaps happy to remember, and the opportunity to see John Garfield in his first movie.
