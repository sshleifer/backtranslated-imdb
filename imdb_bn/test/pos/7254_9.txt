I worship this picture Chemistry is wonderful in the two characters of Miller and Carlisle, they give a good start to each other, making an impossible comedy doo. Allan kuming is delightful, his source for the role is definitely as clear as he is up camp. Acting is fantastic and it's a truly entertaining and touchy film. Not the greatest movie of all time, I would admit, but it is a fun thing and I would recommend to other buyers for the british flickers. Michael Gambon includes some of the best British actors, so you can not go too wrong. David Wialiam and Matt Lucas Little Britain and from Rock to Kyomos see profile profiles.
