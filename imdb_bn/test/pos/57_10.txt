I gave this picture my 10 rare pictures. <br /> <br /> When I first started to see it and realized that it was not a strong plot line, I almost stopped it. I am not very happy. <br /> <br /> This is a character-driven film, the real story, which is largely the Rachel's life "Neini" Crosby, a strong, beautiful (inside and out) black woman and how she touched the lives of many people in the Lackawanna community. > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What was the life and community for African Americans in the 1950's, before the integration and Good and bad aspects of separation and how to end This influenced the black community and changed. <br /> <br /> Along with excellent performance, all members of cast have some fine songs and dances of that era.
