Oven loves his mom ... only in this darkness, beneath her six feet beneath, smile-comedy that is directed by both stars and Danny Davito, praised the title of Billy Crystal and Anne Ramsey. <br /> <br /> "Thrown Womens of the Train" is a great comedy, even if it's not a great movie. It is very shallow in parts, and tacky on the last few feel less biological. But in most cases it is an intimate split ride, Crystal and Davito use a great screen chemistry, working their own comic works, a struggling writer (Davito is rude but unbroken, crystal block and bitter). <br/> <br /> Crystal Professor Donner believes that his former wife stole his book (unfortunately the title "Hot Fire") and can not write more than the opening line of the next book, which is not easy. He taught Tom Clancy-type fiction a creative writing class of emerging mediators, including middle-aged women, but he does not know how he is called a submarine captain. And sellers of a home furnisher who wants to write stories about his life. Mr. Pinsky is perhaps the most fun character for the happy-for-minute-on-screen, who wears a strange dress, who viewed literature as an excuse for writing his essay: "100 girls love insects." There is still Davito and Owen Lift, who called himself Professor Denner's "star student", although the teacher would not read his work in his class. Oven is a slightly unusual character to play in a film, at 30 years of age, a male child who lives with his sympathetic mother, Anne Ramsey, who called him "Lord's" and other respectful emotions. In any other movie, we will be asked to feel sorry for Wayne, but "Throw Momo from Train" throws this sad wrapper to make the sadness of our lives and hopes to go with us. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This comedy Not to be a big band with bigger gambit, Oven professor asked to showcase entertainment to help Donner to plan for our mother's death. In fact, he first went to Hawaii to kill Donner's disgusting ex-person, then his turn to kill Professor Hitschak's "unknown train train", his turn to kill Mrs Lift, <br /> <br /> Director, He does not complete his performance with the actor who talks in the dialogue, he gives some bold visual statements, to the viewers on his toes (And refrained from taking things away seriously).) <br /> <br /> It is also a helpful writer, Stu Silver, who laughs with his quote pattern. "You've got an old sized rat here." "She is not a woman ... she's a Terminator." "A little bit of murder and I'm Jack the Ripper." Those are the words of the Crystal, but some interesting lines, which only in the context but kill, Davita and Ramsey do the work. According to IMDB, after that silver did not compose another screenplay, and it was a reason for shame, for her it was her genius. <br /> <br /> The best scenes in this movie, when Crystal Ramske met, it was actually used as a complete theatrical 'upcoming attraction' presentation, as I saw a movie circulated. Oven presented Professor as 'cousin patty' to his mother and when Moma says that she has no cousin, Panic Oven loses it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When the train was playing its Looney tune vibe for all its value Works effectively at a moment like this. Of course, Davito did not disappear from the film, but it is a mystery because he did not really follow the director's promise of the director. Probably, because of the lack of performance of the main stream of the train, as 'thro wax', his eyesight is not of everyone's taste. It is for us those who are too bad and can see it and like it.
