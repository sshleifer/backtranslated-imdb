Only the Russians can say about the World War II. The biggest part of the whole conflict, maliciously, has been the least visible topic on the silver screen after the war. Although Western allies have portrayed the screenplay in nearly all possible descriptions and methods, have gone out of the way, or this work has only gone to some other older publicity films than the historical footage. <br /> <br /> There is no scope that the shotsabet can compete with the band of Brothers, but you do not want to see the screen by examining small visual effects. The soldiers who are good enough to forgive Russians less eye-catching battle scenes and you can focus on the story which is the most interesting The Eastern Front and the Russian army were much different than the nature, so that you want to create more dramatization from other people and soldiers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, but there are some rare properties that increase the overall rating. The stories that people have about the Second World War can be crushed, the real hero is not a Russian man and their leaders did not send them to their mission where they could only be destroyed. Another extraordinary myth is that it represents the enemy, who does not pick up his gun, as a common man - is a development which is difficult to try in many acclaimed movies. Enemies show how the battle of the East wall was a war of survival and how the conflict clash took the people to dust.
