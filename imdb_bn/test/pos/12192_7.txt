Despite the critics' pan, I liked this movie. Actually, I liked it better than an interview with Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stewart Townsend) better than the cruise efforts. All major players from the series were present: Talobot, Leset, Armand, Maharat, Khayman, Pandora, Mel, Marice and half a dozen (though most of them are in Camio). Marius, Lloth and Aksha were the main players (and Jesse of Talmasa). Also, despite the other reviews, I think the film and music were trusted by Anne Rice's screenplay and ethics, at least I feel it. Alayah was beautiful like Akker, places were forced (her first entrance and mini dance scene). The film did not accept the broad coverage of the book series, but I think it was a wonderful complement. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of this series, especially because of Anne Rice's style, sensitivity and treatment. And I found this film a trusted and often outstanding representation of the author's perspective.
