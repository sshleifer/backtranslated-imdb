One Life Stand is a perfect piece of film that does not deserve its credit. The IMDB rating of 1.7 does not judge it, and it is probably due to few screening compared to the quality of the movie. The film, which is well-documented in the film of black and white, believes in its shoe budget, which is well managed with the film's values. Performance is excellent, especially Gary Lewis, which gets better with each role. My only criticism is that it can be done with a lot of humor in the long run and offset the dark moments. Above all, it is a fine piece of work piece.
