A really awesome, sensitive film. Melodrama's best, great conversation, characters and writings with most comedy. A woman might be related to the story because it's a classic: You love "Mr. Right", but you have no interest with it until someone thinks incorrectly and you fall in love with the head hole. But of course, it's not easy. The characters are real and perfect for performance. The film is ridiculous, as well as each scene spread to society. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves a well-liked and melodrama-well-written painter. You can relate to every character and plots moving in the unexpected direction. A great, underlying movie.
