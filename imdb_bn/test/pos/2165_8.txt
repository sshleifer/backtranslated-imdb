Although it is a good, enjoyable cartoon, but later they did better, such as Carbaltanko. This is often the first Star Trek feature, which is welcomed with open arms and glitter, only for the present. It's really a patchwork of old bits with some nice touches, but nothing special. Let me remind a bit of the hunting trilogy at the spot and the last is priceless. Only available for innovation and good bits and of course good value. Recommended.
