This is the underlying role of the underlying Kellie Martin. Based on the real story, Fucius's efforts to save the dummy family and other Jewish people by that time are called. One of my best film scenes involves a heroic act of Fussius's younger sister. All of these visual-role models should be very small and far away from all children. The movie is well written and played. I'm a movie lover and this movie I rated 10 ratings for the IMBD ratings system. It should be kept in my top 25 movies and videos all the time. <br /> <br /> Mike Porter
