If you hope that this movie is fully operational and occupies you from the beginning, do not keep an eye on it. But if you like pessimistic movies that hold your mind for a while, you'll love it as long as you know the details. Now do not make mistakes with me, there is action and not just things are going on. <br /> <br /> This plot is basically a post-apocalyptic world where anyone can fight in his (or her) way to live. In this war they have lost the ability to speak ... I do not want to write more for not destroying the movie for you, but if you like Lem or KPK SF-authors or even want something from Ausson Scott Card, believe me this movie love .
