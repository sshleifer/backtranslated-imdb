I was surprised to see the PG rating behind the DVD case. I certainly would not like my kids watching this one. I think it will be afraid of the 10 year old shit. <br /> <br /> Plot: The girl who wanted to ride this girl was frustrated and distressed by the 'crowd'. They talk to the wonderful tombs (which reminds me of fantasy ...) overnight and continue torturing them at night. They rarely know, the dead life is coming back recently and raising the dead around them! It sounds very impressive, but the age and budget, which was no doubt, was quite small, this picture is fun on many levels. <br /> <br /> E as one of the crowd brides. I enjoyed it and it got scared my girlfriend. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 kids
