I've never heard before Silvering, then I've seen Taun Disney and love it immediately! I think it's not just for kids, and people of all ages will enjoy it. It has a great plot, great effect, and cool letters. I always love the show, and I heard it is coming soon to the DVD around the world, and I'm going to get it! I do not read books, but I wish. The show is suitable for 10 out of 10, and I hope books are just as good. Well, that's what I have to say. But I still have 2 lines to fill, so ... who do you think is the best character? The shade of mine, and my second favorite is the marina.
