A very strong drama in the small town of Faulkner, with the assassination of the South-neutral black man, is dealing with the killing of South Nader. Hacking cinematography and good stories (through flashbacks) take us through a helpless relationship between the suspect and his son's lawyer. A still strong story that predicts the sectarian bias of Sydney Poitier Movies. The killer of Porter Hall has a big role as the father of humans. Trivia: In fact, he resided in the city of Oxford, resident of Faulkner. Many residents were used as extra.
