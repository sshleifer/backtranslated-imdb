Just saw this photo another day at the Santa Fe Film Festival. I was delighted by her honesty and humor This was the most horrific film I've ever seen - for some reason I can not remove it from my mind. It can not be for everyone, because it thinks you. I do not know if people want to think so much in movies, which is shameful. The actors who played Franklin found quite a number of actors. I can not imagine playing this complex man with this complexity. Although I suppose some of the supporting letters were not as good as Franklin, but I can completely forgive - because it is an important film in my opinion. I did not expect too much to like it, but I've thought about it for a few days, it's proven to be a very relevant part of entertainment.
