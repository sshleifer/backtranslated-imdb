Describing Stalingrad as a war film may be a bit wrong. Definitely it centers on the longest and bloody battle center in the history of the world, the life, money, and material that ever happened in the most expensive theater of the most expensive war in life. Yes it contains bitter warfare and action scenes of terrible destruction. Visceral stories and stern images, though it's more than a war film, even more than a war-crying film. Instead of Stalingrad, a movie of absolute and inaccessible hell. <br /> <br /> This picture is firm with the worst kind of visual descriptions, which are personal and intimate together, where time is spent on taking a city block. , Only to have it take a wonderful attack again. The Germans portrayed the primitive form of modern urban warfare called Ratnacrag (Night Warfare) as brutal and incomprehensible. Sewer tunnels, rail yards, and debris Stalingrad's brutal bomb-stub, these characters will be fought in the building only in the winter winter of Razia. <br /> <br /> The Nazism and the way in which Germany is vilification the way that many other films from Germany and the rest of the world world. A group of soldiers in his character are trying to move along with the wind of war and make them as easily living and making it with many comrades. From any ideological hatred between nationalism and the Soviet communist, there is no grand dream of Groriaduchland in the struggle for race or ethnic superiority with the Soviets. They only fight because the enemies will not kill them and if they are not enemies then their own officials will certainly refuse to fight. Another layer has been added to this picture, which suddenly disguises the look of disguised film. <br /> <br /> Dallas Boot's land-based companion, Stalinadre's epic struggle of World War II in personal light and the unexpected perspective of the general German soldier is a tragedy as a hero and a barbarous government that will distort its sacrifice.
