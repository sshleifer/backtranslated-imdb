I caught this number of times on TV in the late 1970's. It only played late at night (last midnight). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is rejected by her girlfriend and left alone and filled with frustration. He turned a life of crime and eventually became very successful. She falls in love with a mask and a beautiful girl (Evelyn Keyes) to hide a vague feature ... who is blind! She tried to go straight for her ... but she could not escape from the crime of her life or the hate of her own hateful face. <br /> <br /> there is no budget B film. Very short (runs for just one hour), but well-made and superbly played by Lor. There is a lot more depth than this you would expect from a quickie B picture. Ankers takes the role of particularly grateful "girl" and makes her character fresh and attractive. It has sadly disappeared from the TV and has never been in a video or a DVD (as far as I know). TCM recently showed it and it was great to keep the film still retained. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
