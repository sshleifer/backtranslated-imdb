Well, the film is much better than expected. It's not annoying and it's not unreasonable. It's not really a silly romantic comedy. The situation is very unusual in the characters themselves, of course, we are still talking about a movie, but the main characters are really appreciated. Donald certainly, too exaggerated, but he is just a fan of movies, a way to prove something. The ends are not funny, it is always the same, you can usually see movies in pieces of moral pieces. I really liked it and when I talk about this particular movie, please make it difficult for me. This is a clock value. Alongside, it is better guided than other movies, the story line always stands, the characters stand. And they do not feel this miracle change and love is not revealed to them, such as Holi deity, Artifact, Zada, Jad. At the end you see it all by yourself, the movie thinks of you, you can even learn one or two things. It is not a normal hope generator, moisturizing tissue is idiocy. This is a good film, not a consolation prize for lusty women around the world.
