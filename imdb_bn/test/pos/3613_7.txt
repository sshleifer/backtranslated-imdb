Again, John Maden gave us a great movie. A simple but beautiful story in true paradise and music can not be good, Stephen Warbeck makes us happy once more and performs well ......... Why Penelope Cruz in this film? I asked myself the same questions while watching this movie. Of course, his Greek accent is not believable, he is not able to act strongly even in a scene. In the end, he did not do a good job even after a very good show, after which he finally saw Correlli and he could not face our stupidity during the whole film. However, Cage was one of his best characters; The hitting also has its great and left cast all done a great job, so the final result is a movie that is really worth seeing. This is a beautiful movie that even Mrs. Cruz could not loot. So far, I think it's the best work of Maden so no fan will be disappointed.
