I worked as the Corps of Paris Island in the late 60's, after more than 10 years after "D.I." Shot. I was in some barracks where they portrayed some indoor scenes. I knew a lot of drill instructors and employers. I think the movie is as close to a movie as it is about to show the life of the employer. Without any doubt, I think Jack Web is the best thing ever. If you are in the military you will see this movie. It was the way it was. It shows how important it is to launch a bunch of raw recruitment and to prepare it for the defense of our country. The characters that I found interesting are characterized by the most real Marine, not the actors.
