Nobody will question that director Leon Carcass is a genius, but what we are thinking is: Is he an insane genius? So much people hate this picture! I am generally accused of accusing several French directors of the first person, humiliating, annoying, annoying and provocative movies (such as the horrific recent movie 'El' Enfant 'and the pointless and aggressive' Feux Rouges'). But surprisingly enough, I really believe that 'Polo X' is an extraordinary film, which is made by a master of its skill, made with skill and passion, and has great performances. The film has more extreme length melodrama than I believe I've ever seen before on the screen. But then, Carax is extreme, we know that. In this movie how do I consider the top Trotskyte or the fantasy of fantasy and wet-dream, which trains burgor machine gun firing in a band of a breakthrough youth, rather than playing Scott Walker's rather fascinating music. The old steel barrel has its recording sessions in a abandoned ware filled with burn squatters and fire. Guillaume Depardieu is a Ch√¢teau a rich young man (whose step-mother is Catherine Deneuve, and she wanders in her bathroom when she is naked in the bath). But he suddenly 'snapped' when he discovered that his dead father, a famous diplomat, gave birth to an illegal daughter, who effectively managed Dinov due to inconvenience. That is why sister suddenly becomes a kind of Romanian refugee, with wildly obnoxious hair, expressionless face, and consistently speaking French in a little skill. Depardo then seeks to transform himself into a 'class hero' left and wants to kill or destroy his family for his hypocrisy and corruption, and scorning a huge heritage when squalor and want to live in extreme poverty. Then he began to have sexual relations with his half-sister, which is shown in a clear sex scene, which has offended many people, although I have no objection, although I think people are very excited about sex, especially in America, where apparently It does not happen. The intensity of acting and filming stops this unlikely scene like a strong experience, if depressed, hyper-melodrama. Creating an extreme movie like Caracas and numerous extreme French films that I think are hateful and annoying, (1) that Caracas is an extraordinary filmmaker and (2) he is trying to seriously investigate meaningful, extreme emotional condition, through which people Turns out against the background. Many would say that the extreme elements of this movie were unreal, but I do not agree. I believe Caracas was genuine, and was not absolutely creating an absorption picture. It is very difficult to compete with a person who goes so far and who knows, that it can be completely crazy, but I believe that he deserves the defense of this extraordinary movie.
