Mute witness is a decent, yet very strong thriller that is not worthy of getting the true attention or good comment. The movie ?? Written and operated entirely by Anthony Waller ?? A black, action-pack thriller with black comedy direction and horror effect. Any nonsense mumbo-jumbo or endless plot-twists ?? Just the mystery of the direct point. The silent witness' snuff'- handles the movie's evil subject and effectively sets Russia in the right place. *** Spinners *** Production costs are cheap because the American film crew temporarily moves to Russia for a temporary film shooting. An old hangar film is used as the location. The group's female make-up artist suddenly gets locked overnight and tries to find ways, she is recording an authentic snuff-movie recording! He is caught and tried to flee, but after he is silent, he can not cry for help, and he can not explain what he saw in the police correctly. Now the life of the girl is really dangerous, because there is a hidden network behind this lost generation and they do not want the witness to survive? *** End spoilers ***. Mute witness has many highly executable order sequences and rather bloody. Some sources of mysteries are effectively kept secret. Regarding similar topics, I would say it is obviously better than the more famous '8mm', directed by Joel Shumachar and Nicholas Cage. The silent witness's performance is not great, but the leading actress (who himself is Russian) looks really cute. Sir Alex Guinness also made a special appearance. And a very cool one, I can say. Of course, certainly recommend with fun and scares.
