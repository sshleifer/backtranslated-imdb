This art is a peace! If you like the comedy you will see it! Here comes a fun moment from the movie: "spoiler" <br /> <br /> Nicolai and Goroshkov are walking together in Paris for the first time. They are visiting the local market. And Goroscov went away: - "Look at Nikolai, how much food they have, see, one or two-three-thirty-fifty flesh! But if you want a little peace for a taste, they will not give you." The French are very greedy! "Then Gorshkov goes to Nikolai's shop on TV ... Goroskov: "Tell me, who needs all those televisions? For example, see this demon here!" Goroshkov indicates a finger at the "monster" -TV and goes: "And this maternal car ... ... he is supposed to dig a puddle, but not, he's on TV ... wait a minute ... that's me! ! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Watch the movie, you will not be sorry!
