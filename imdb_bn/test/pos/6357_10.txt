First of all, I must say that I do not speak Spanish and do not enjoy Spanish-speaking films, but two quotes are an exceptional movie. It does not matter that it's a Spanish-speaking film that works hard and plays hard. Subtitles were easy to read and the action was not blocked - play! <br /> <br /> I will tell fans of Spanish-speaking film and fans of Spanish-speaking film to go see this film. The cost of action and drama per game. <br /> <br />
