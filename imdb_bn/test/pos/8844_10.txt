I still can not believe I have added two cents to this movie! <br /> <br /> This is one of the best movies of all time. Many critics and filmmakers likewise talk about John Carpenter's "Halloween" and "best of his work". People who did not see this version of "Things" because it's okay with "Halloween". <br /> <br /> John Carpenter's work in this film is brilliant. He had already taken a movie and instead of "rebuilding" the film, he made the first book based on the book! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, "Who goes there?" In that film. There was no Hollywood sweet pie or the end of the funny type in this movie, there was no bold move in 1982. Another brilliant step. <br /> <br /> While I was on vacation, I was screening for this movie in South California. Screening visitors went wild! I carry those memories over the years, it was so much fun! We all thought that there is no way in the green world of God. This picture is not going to be a hit. But due to box office receipts, it took box office because of the "ET, The Extra Terrestrial" and "Polturgist", because of two very good family-oriented films, because the film came out. <br /> <br /> I was as a horror / thriller and real adult actor with an adult script, as a horror movie adult buff. Children do not play kids. The little Miss "Big-breasted" scream - the Queen is shouting for tie-tilations, but the real guys are in real trouble, which you will never hear. Hack, a feminist, I am not a MISS woman in this movie! And by putting someone there well for Mr. Carpenter, it really will not make sense! (If not, "Things" were actually feminine! Something to think!) <br /> <br /> I saw the special effect of the time that I have never seen before, I've seen makeup that lets me sit in some nights. What is this horror / thriller missing today. Today, the director wimp out. Today, studios wimp out. There is too much CGI and not enough confidence, too much CGI and not enough stories, not enough imagination. You leave the theater and less or less in the week - you forget the film and go towards opening the next grand film. This one is with y. This is one of the best movie trails. <br /> <br /> I wrote about many reviews that how horrible it is to pay 10 dollars for a movie now. For such movies, you give it and do not feel overwhelmed. This image is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is a "culture" movie. I see that if you are going to lead to believe in a lot more broadly than the audience, and in 1982 commercial success, it is an example of a valve film which shows good on a wrong date when it releases a valve film. After John Carpenter's film many people copied many techniques, makeup, special effects and story lines from this version of "Things". <br /> <br /> I'm going to record now and say that this movie is always one of the best movies, too under rate. Please see it in vain, please see it in the letterbox and please listen to it digitally. You will also talk about it for years as well.
