James L. Brooke is one of the directors who always sees the playful appearance of life. He is not the only producer for "Simpsons", under his belt there are some classic comedies - "Broadcast News" is one of them. <br /> <br /> Although it does not match its next attempt "It gets better as well," "Broadcast news" is still a teaser broadcasting center and very interesting, funny and diverse movies about the problems they face. There is a great comedic sequence of physical humor where Juan Cusack is running around this building, trying to run a news tape in the editor's room just a few minutes after the TV's live broadcast. <br /> <br /> This hacking broadcasting stations are not only true but also in human skill and honest portrayal. <br /> <br /> A small, fine movie with a good acting (especially from the hit), I do not always like it) and the appropriate aspects.
