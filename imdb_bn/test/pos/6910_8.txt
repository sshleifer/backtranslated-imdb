This was not the first three hours of the film - two hours, ten minutes ... last time I checked the commercials was not really a part of a movie! Probably, though, it should be a two-potter for about 3 hours a total? Yes, more will be acquired, more emotions have been able to explore. Overall, it was an interesting look of Lucy and Desi's life. I sometimes love and love Lucie but I have never read or seen biographies, I did not know anything about their life from the screen. I work because of this movie now but I'm not sure it's a good thing. Everything here really needs to know. It is essentially a movie which was not needed to be created. But it was created and because of this, Lucy and Desi are still so big and some people in American society think that the rest of society needs to know everything about our TV and movie star. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Two complaints - Acting Viv Vance Actress - Not all great cast. And switch from Rachel York to Madeline Zemar .... Wow, as Lucy was a plastic surgeon and suddenly she was a whole new person! That was not too great. But the story went away and focused on rocky relations between Lucy and Desi. No, the kids were not shown too much, and it certainly did not have any flaws in the film because as I said it was basically only in Lucy and Desi. There was more time, the story was more about Lucy's whole life, then probably the kids have more. But instead of that we did not see the likes of Gabelle and Lomber, Red Scolton and Booster Keton. Wow, I was the only one about this story that I was really quiet: his presence and influence in Lucie's life. Really clean and it is too bad to find out more that. Well good For what was best, good is done. Actually, I do not think that I will look at it again and I do not think this movie will be memorable. I love Lucy for anyone happy but not an extraordinary Luceille Ball fan, this will be an interesting watch. My grade for this: b
