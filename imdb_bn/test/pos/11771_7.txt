The first half hour of "homegrown" was rather annoying and not to be exploited, but with the progress of the film, I was interested in the characters and the plot. Most of the scenes are really scary and you fear for the original characters that you actually connect. This story is about three tenants in a secret illegal marijuana farm in southern California. They witness the killing of the farm owner Malcolm (John Lithgo), and they take weeds for themselves. The hands of three simple-minded farms soon entered the terrifying world of mafia and local interest, although Malcolm is still alive trying to please everyone. The film was a few errors and started slowly, but it is going to be effective. 7/10 stars.
