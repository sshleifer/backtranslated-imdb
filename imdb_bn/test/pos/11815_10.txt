I think when this movie came out and it had seen VHS several times. I was very happy after the DVD was over. I was waiting for the widescreen, but at the moment it will accept what is available. I love using color in the film, living with the outside scene color. The trees I've ever seen are the greenest. Most of the photos are shot in a beautiful city Minnesota Steelwater in the St Crooks River. They must have really scouted the position for filming, because they did a great job. The story is well written, and directed. I will rate it as Peter Harton's best. I'm surprised that Andrew Dintingphas (Director of Photography) did nothing more. She did an incredible job. Acting also rates up. Two actors of this type of age were surprised to drag this kind of movie. Anabella Cyrro did a great job as the mother of the dancer. Who does not want her as a mother.
