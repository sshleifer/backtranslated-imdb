This picture was seen when it was an entry at the Santa Fe Film Festival. Heavy film! One of the extreme characters of extreme extremist family, I was extremely disappointed, it was not very funny with goggles and dialogues which made the movie's overall tone lighter. Relatively "uplifting" gave hope to those who were affected by the last tragedy. Still, I do not walk to the theater ready to go to a fun party. The picture has been with me for a couple of days. <br /> <br /> Reminds memories of "ordinary people", but merging with humor is tragic. I was pretty impressed, especially by Sigre Weaver and Emil Hirsh. Every tragedy dealing with the tragedy was so tragic, self-defeating, but sometimes ridiculous. Glossy dialogue, and circumstances
