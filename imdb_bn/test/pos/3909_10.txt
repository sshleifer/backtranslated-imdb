I think this movie was quite good! All right, so maybe there were a few scenes that people might think of other horror movies, but I've seen a much more compassionate movie that has received a lot of ratings! Many movies have been rebuilt in a more modern version nowadays and there is no mistake in it, it keeps the story alive. I do not think this movie was a bit annoying and I'm just not saying because I'm a Chief Chad Michael Murray fan, but I enjoyed it. I was on the edge of my seat for most movies and my friends and I really enjoyed it and we were talking about the whole house! I will call my friends to see this picture. I'm not saying that this is the best movie that has ever hit the box office, but it's a lot better than some people. Everyone has their own opinion so if you really want to know whether it's good or bad, check it out and then decide.
