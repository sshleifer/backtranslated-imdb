CrackerJack is another classic Australian movie. Like many Australian movies like The Castle, The Dish and Sunday to Far Far Auwea, it goes to a place that was not previously searched extensively in movies, during this time it was played by lawn bowls and bowling clubs. The crackerjacket is a very slow sports movie that you can remember, such as the tiemens or million dollar bubboot, the characters involved are in their own right. This movie is a large area show in Australia's culture and the rise of popularity in Australia and the popularity of a sport. Mick Molloy presents a classic, unforgettable character. It really should look.
