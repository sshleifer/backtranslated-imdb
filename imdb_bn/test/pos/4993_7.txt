Everyone wants Duval and Jones back, come on! Telling things like the audience, Jhan and the urban are not deep ... Puhlease! Was you deep when you were young? That's the whole point: they have a lot to learn. Jahn and the city moved to utilize their furnishings of innocence and made a great promise to keep the characters of Duval and Jones safe for letters. Jane is brilliantly perfect as the early gus, and the city is primarily perfect as the Woodrow perfect. How boldly they had to take such a position in the entertainment industry. They must know that they are not really coming up to be loved, but they clearly try their best. I gave it a 7 because the edits were sticky at places and the timelines were sketchy, but it was a pleasure to see the acting. Val Kilmer was absolutely great. Another topic: I hope the audience is more receptive to the mysticism shown by Jaguar and the emergence of blue and gold macaws, but their presence has been made more effort and it is simply accepted by letters.
