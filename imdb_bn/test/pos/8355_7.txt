Well, first of all, this is not a bad movie. It's good, and I like the characters described. I like this voice of Lady and tram more. <br /> <br /> However, I would like to see more of the Lady and the tram. I know it's called 'adventure of the scamp' and I love to bite the scamp and the angle, but it's a series of roots, in my opinion, they should not be left as 'Adventures of Scamp', not 'Lady and Tramp II'. : The Adventure of the Scamp '<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There was a great deal of trump, but it did not have much time with the lady. <br /> <br /> However, the tracks are quite good, and the scamp and angel are sweet. I saw a good sign, but hey, it's not a failure. <br /> <br /> I can give it 7/10. Very good, but there were still errors.
