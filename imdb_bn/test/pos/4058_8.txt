This is actually great fun. I really enjoyed it, although it was not original, Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy were great together! All the characters are cool, and the story is quite good, plus Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy are simply amazing! Ren Rousseau has great roles in her role, and she has lots of smiles (especially when Denino Clint Eastwood and Danny Glover stripped the lines), and the end is just great. Yes, it is another run of "Body Body", but it works due to excellent chemistry between De Niro and Murphy! Plus there were some great car charging scenes! It's not really great, but I found it very fun and it's a perfect way to pass the time! However, the main villain was very weak and was not very good. It's far from the best "body" body "Cope Film", but it's still a very entertaining one, and I thought it was very nice and written !, plus the end was quite funny! It's really a lot of fun, Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy were great together, although I really enjoyed it, although it was not original, I highly recommend it! This instruction is very good! Tom Day works very well here. Keep cool camera work, cool corners and movies fast. Acting is a lot of fun! Robert Denroo is always amazing and amazing here, he was very delightful, very liked, he had excellent chemistry with Eddie Murphy. The usual awesome stuff, pulled some really funny faces, was to enjoy yourself, had some fun lines, and was a really cool character! (De Niro Rule !!!!!!!). Eddie Murphy is amazing here, as he did with his usual fun, like De Niro, probably was good in front of the camera, and he could do this stu, he was still very fun to see in his sleep! (Merry rules !!!!). Ron Rousseau is pretty cool! She was a cool character, and when she did not do much, she added many screens, and her character always appealed, she was just great! (RUSSO RULES !!!!). William Shatan is surprisingly funny here and it is not too much, and there is some good smile in the film. The main villain is okay, but the weak and rather kind of strong, yet he must do enough amounts. The rest of the cast is not fine. Overall I highly recommend this one! *** 1/2 out 5
