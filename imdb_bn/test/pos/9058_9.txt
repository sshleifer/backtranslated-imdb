I went to see this film carefully. A suicidal "comedy" does not seem consistent. I know of how a brother who tried to commit suicide and devastated the entire family was devastating, how can I be lifeless to deal with this issue. I must say - this movie behaves in a manner that causes someone to hurt "inside" to the viewer and not easily know why, or how to stop it. Although the film is not perfect, it respects the issue and, more importantly, makes it accessible to the public. I know for our family, humor has helped us through many pain. And, Max and Grace say exactly what it is - it's a suicide comedy. It's funny - and, I've realized that the characters were real and vibrant. It is extremely intelligent, yet simple. It throws it back and I appreciate that! I would give it a 9 and recommend it.
