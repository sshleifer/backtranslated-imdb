But I laughed. Many <br /> <br /> I saw 'asterix at les viking' in public screening during the World Cup. The word was shy, very bright on the screen to look right - but I still enjoyed myself very much. Some of the character names surrounded me on the floor: Esmax, Dad, Vika ... all very diverse, but in the tradition of good Asterix. Some very good jokes, but something that everyone seems to get to get. <br /> <br /> The only thing I did not like is Aststrix and Ob√©lix's voice, at least in German version. The voice actors are very familiar here, really, which is the only reason they were casted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> laughs. 10 out 8
