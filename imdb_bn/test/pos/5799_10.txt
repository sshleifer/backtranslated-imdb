It's hard to understand this movie today and in the US We have nothing to compare, really, with. Here's an attempt to compare: In the last years of Saddam's regime, a filmmaker in Iraq was able to create a movie in such a way that it showed life for the first time since it actually lived in that country. Normal young life, full suppression of terrorism and suppression. Then the picture is freely displayed in Iraq. If you can imagine an unlikely event, you may have an idea of ​​what happened to the movie in the last few years of the Soviet Union. Before this photo, Soviet cinemas were very sensors. The Soviet cinema will only show employees an ideal life in heaven. Then suddenly this is happening. Drug, random sexuality, Soviet city, harmful pollution, proletariat, each other, and ourselves, being stupid disappointed - ugly degradation - it's all there. People are surprised. Soviet women will often cry during sleep. Many would say that this is the story of their life. This is a cultural earthquake which is a filmmaker's dream to do only. It undoubtedly accelerates the break of the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Here's a review, I can see that some understand this movie. One saying it was breaking the ground because it was real sexual. To Soviet viewers, sex was comparatively a minor incident in the Soviet movie, for the first time represented the reality. <br /> <br /> Others compare it to current movies like "Good Good At Gates", as well as compare Homer Eliad with the latest John Grissam novel. They just do not compare. It was not just a movie, it was a social document and a transformed social force. It needs to be seen or you can not understand the film. <br /> <br /> Other critics see this as a movie about a dangerous Russian family. Even someone says that it is difficult to feel sorry for the sheep because he is returning to his family. The point is that the sheep and his family symbolize all Soviet life. There was no other place to go, because the family was under the block and the next town was the same. It was for most people in the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> It is a film that can be seen in many levels: As a play it marks the horrors of despair, as it is a social document, it shows the living conditions of time, it shows as a political document that demolishes the views of the people and the Soviet Union. Many reasons to go, and as a moral document, it is the control of dictatorship and the cruelty of the victim outside each other. Will nusilana. <br /> <br /> In spite of any good intentions of Little Vera System, Socialism finally shows a human toll by assaulting its victims. Thus, it eliminates the Soviet regime and thus contributes to one of the major changes in modern history. This movie has only achieved some films which have achieved. It is not only astonishing representation of history, but it has also become a force in size history.
