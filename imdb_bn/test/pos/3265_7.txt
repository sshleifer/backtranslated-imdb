It's hard to know what to do with this weird little Assalamu Alaikum - on one hand, it's an enjoyable little comedy little movie But on the other hand, it only ensures that the film does not exceed the film without any boundaries, which only stays in an indefinite 'attractive' region. It is said that Two Hands is a well-planned film that simultaneously makes many stories a juggl, which allows small climaxes throughout the film and thus prevents the movie from becoming boring. Increasing curiosity, thick Australian accents and characters help make sure that strange characters entertain the movie. This plot follows the story of a young couple who think that after taking the job from local Rajapin, he will do a lot more. He does not; The job only hurts him when he goes swimming and fools ten sculptures on the stupid seed, which is immediately stolen by a few kids while living in a shopping script. However, not all are pink for our hero; Who will face the consequences or the consequences ... <br /> <br /> The film is composed of a cast of unknown; At least, it came back in 1999, as a name of today's Hayther Laser. He does not have much impact here, although his performance is mostly a one-note variety and he does not make a very attractive lead. He fits the film that he sees Australian and na√Øve; But still, he never had the best leadership that he never saw in a movie. If you ask me, Brian Brown gave the best performance here. His screen might not have much time, but he stole the scene he saw, and this is the movie that provides him with many comedies. There is nothing to do with the best continuity, but the most shocking bank ever caught in the film is in the form of robberies. Overall, I can recommend this movie to people who enjoy comedy movies; As the curiosity is abundant, and the fact that the way of taking a turn for the bizarre is usable; But if you are not the fan of such a movie, I can not really say that two hands will float your boat. This must not be seen, but it is your thing and if you get a chance to see it ... you probably will not regret it completely.
