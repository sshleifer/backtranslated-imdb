The film is not as bad as people who want to trust you as people. <br /> <br /> This picture hates so many people? And it is not the best of them because it's Lorel and Hardy one last together? Or is Lorel and Hardy due to regular deficiency? Or was it made by Hall Roach Studios or 20th Century Fox? <br /> <br /> This film is definitely not a successful attempt to revive Lorele and Hardy, and bring them to the '50s. It sure is sure that the film is still well-respected, from its best to honest but honestly, the film makes it far from the worst of them. The most eligible 'goodbye' movie is imaginative but nevertheless is not a good entertainment and suiting farewell. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie makes it better than '40 'in most of its films. Slopstick humor is still 30 minutes <br /> <br /> As it is never entertaining, an amazing event that seems to have ended the days of slopstick comedy. It can be and has a lot of sadiq and characters, so that the film loses focus on boys sometimes. Shame, because they are still those who actually carry and make films. <br /> <br /> While creating this movie, Stall Laurel saw a poor form. He looked really sick and old, which was certainly he. She was already well 60 years ago. But after surgery he completely restored and died in 1565, before his good friend Oliver Hardy died 8 years later. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hardy and entertaining endeavor that is seen and loved by people all over the world until the end of entertaining, entertaining, entertaining quality slapstick of 3 decades. <br /> <br /> 7/10
