Yes I am an FF7 fan, but how many will see who this movie is? And so, I'm reviewing this movie from an FF7 fan perspective, and without any sadness. (I do not know if any person who played the FF7 game will review the movie adequately.) <br /> <br /> VISUALS - 10/10 I LOVE ADVENT CHILD. This is a sensible delight - a complete audio-video overload. The visuals were exciting: some credits were made that I did not think it was just about an animated feature. When action scenes came, they had more precise words, a lack of roller-coaster. The dramatic camera movement ranges from range to extent, with bullet-time effects in a very precise moment, with a detailed description of the perfect level - it's hard to blame. Animation shows great budget, style and imagery is superb, and sometimes the effects forget me that I see animation instead of live action footage. I could ramble for repeat hours of repeat myself on fantastic quality, but it simply does not have any trials. <br /> <br /> word - 10/10 the word was fabulous. The voice was not frustrating for all the characters (which did not seem foolish) and the effects of the sound were brave and sharp. Music - From the game (My Opinion) was the best game soundtrack, it transferred beautifully to the film. Most of the memorable themes in the game are present in the film, although they often use different tools to fit what is happening. From time to time there was some bold rock and little Thrash Metal music on the scene really intense, but it also fitted well with the movie's situation at the same time. <br /> <br /> Story - 7/10 The story and characters will be the main error in the movie. Both sides were not just compatible with the game - but again, it can spend 40 minutes to build these points - the film only lasts for 90 minutes. As far as the story goes away, the plot was not bad or anything, but not aspiring as expected from a person playing through the game. As a result, the plot seems to be rather weak in comparison. The game was so great with the complex plot twist and the story's development / development that the film never had the chance to compete in the same league. Rather, the film took a more intelligent view - instead of trying to expand the action and to reinvent the internal-jokes and temporarily into the big story factor itself, which, in essence, tried to restore it as a driving force. Some debates have arisen due to the lack of use of maternity - the story of the film likes to use little (though not zero) mataria and instead supernatural war power and skill. I hope that if a signal is made then it will be much more important in the film and also important to Mattiria. There were many plot holes in the film - if you think of advanced children as a random enam, it can be forgiven, but when you realize that it was based on a game that was created, the plot was very well edited. <br /> <Characters - 7/10 characters, although all in one form or another, are not miraculously illuminated for their real potential. There is not enough movie time to spend with them only. And so, all their background stories and power are not fully displayed, and in some cases, rarely (Red and Kite Sith absolutely leave no real permanent impressions). Even the cloud, which is the focal point of the film, I do not think its using enough skill to play. The problem of matria is a strong reason for this. That said, it is a joy to see back acting back, even if such a role is not that their full use of them. The new characters were mostly opposed to me - but Bad Gare Trio and the little boy Danzell - there was a lack of explanation for some of them. Anyone who is willing to use their imagination might possibly be able to fill the vacant places with some reasonable and can be done with it, but intentionally to comment on the matter, still have to comment and it is a little frustrating. <br /> <br /> value - 10/10 The replay value is great for this movie - I personally want to see it bigger and bigger again - larger screen, higher volume <br /> <br /> - 10/10 Whatever the error movie, they were not just big enough to prevent my enjoyment and I honestly think most people will have similar things. I've greatly enjoyed Advent Advent Children, and fellow FF7 fans encourage to go see it.
