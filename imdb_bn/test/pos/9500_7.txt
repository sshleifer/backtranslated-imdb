In this case, do not change your husband, on the one hand, starting a continuation of lightweight maiden comedy from Sicil B. Dimill. On the other hand, the Gloria Swansea star is perhaps the first film, perhaps the greatest actress of the silent era, and the film made her a star. <br /> <br /> While the old Dimile formula began to change, and its movies are becoming sound and less purely visual, such as Swanseon, we get the silent story style again with such an expressionist. Its character very little, but conveys the volume through fine gestures and facial expression ?? With a special talent for disdain In real life Swansea Wallace Berry was coming to the end of his catastrophic marriage, and it is possible that this fact has increased its strong performance. <br /> <br /> If you are well-versed in female talent, Dimile's usage structure and close-ups are particularly powerful here. Does he use the cinematic technique to show off the act ?? What is often holding Swanson in long-off compromise ?? And also apparently clarify the sight. For example, when we became familiar with the topless character, she was shown thrice in the dressing table mirror. Invisible from the story of his character, only important to the end is important. His first shot of his attention helped us to remember. Later, anniversary dinners, swansons and future husband number two Louis Kodi were made together in one shot, when Eliot Dester was separated from his own frame. Also ?? And this sign of a growing sophistication of the movie ?? Have many uses of feedback shots ?? For example, the wonderful view of BD when the Cody wedding image performs its objectives with the puppet. <br /> <br /> Contrary to Demil's visual explanation, Janny McPherson's growing verb verb was written on the contrary. I commented on other comments, McPherson could combine a strong and dramatic story, but like the egg he wanted to describe his themes in a somewhat rude and jocular style. And so we get these long long-philosophical title cards about the loss of married life, if they improve the story, it is simply strange because it's a story. For example, only Jenny McPherson can come up with a line like "Hiding between Christmas shopping like". Fortunately, these titles in this movie mostly introduce scenes instead of breaking them. <br /> <br /> Although the pictures he made at this time were small, but at this time, Demil developed his taste for the spectacular. You can begin to kiss him on the pretext for some of the rajjajas, like the little imaginative scenery of transparency with "joy, riches and love". After unauthorized sanctions in historical pictures, until the 20th century, he will not be able to go out with great philosophy. <br /> <br /> Do not change all of you, husband is a fairly silent picture on a fairly decent demigod, though honestly it is only the glow of glaucoma swansen which is above the average. It was curious, though it was a comedy with permission, and Swans was cast in at least part of its background due to his background at Mac Senet Skeptic Factory. He hates acting in a comedy, and here's a dramatic comparison with a comic performance. It would be understandable that he was the only good play on Demil, Male and Female, the most powerful of his support.
