I saw this time I could not count, and although it is different from the story line, the mood is still the same. These two types of diverse people judge each other, which passes through tests and years. And that the material of the prisoners of the woman was a real incident, that happened to real people. The stories are about the power of ordinary people, who tried to survive a horrible time in their lives. And it presents Australia in a realistic mode. The country is like all countries, everyone loves the area, the country and the isolated areas areolated. But it gives a stage to a family community from a stable city transformed into a jinn.
