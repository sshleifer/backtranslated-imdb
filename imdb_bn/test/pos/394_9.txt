I enjoyed this movie, which deals with stunning military disciplines of mountain men with interesting different theorems and complex love-hate relationships, with action scenes and some light moments. All the main characters are well cast. Indeed, John Wayne or Robert Mitchem might have played the role of acting, but Victor mature certainly had most of the kind of walk as a Tarzan. Samson reminds me about the role of his film, another hard, but not impossible, to save people. <br /> <br /> The mountain men of the first phase must have an immunity, as in the end of the menace of pure trap men, most of the fall of western beaver population, along with Beaver Pelt's fashion market ended 20 years ago. This story was held in Oregon before the end of the civil war. Judging by the volcano in the background of the first scenario (probably Mount Lacen), the fictional castle was located somewhere in the remote part of the Cascade, as we have not seen any other citizen. However, there is a lot of conflicting evidence that it actually happens in Wombing or Montana Hills! War of the Red Cloud, the accidental war criminals and threatened soldiers was the name of the head of the famous Suex war. In 1865-66, he ran a very successful campaign to destroy the newly built army strongholds built in Wyoming and Montana. Fort Laramie (Eastern Yoming) has been mentioned that it is not far from the fictional castle. Assiniboines plain plain is referred to as the red cloud joining. This view of the story carries a general harmony with the historical truth. <br /> <br /> There may be interest in plotting this story and remembering some similarities between John Ford's "Fort Upache". In both cases, we have a fortress commander, who was recently employed in his first frontier post with Native American problems. He reduced his opponent's military skills a little more than his canon cultivation for the development of his staff. In both movies, he pays a large amount of money for his inexperience in dealing with the enemies. Also, in general, the GreenHard Commander enjoys long experience with the Americans under the local and wants to know what he or she wants to do and does not want to do. . In both movies, a commander's heart and subordinate have a romantic relaunship between a woman very close to, which makes the commander squwch everything. Clearly, the commander must be omitted to continue the finishing of this romance. <br /> <br /> I can see some similarities with "The Muffins". The soldiers are fully equipped with the commander (as one of them admits): In most cases their "problems" or raw appointments are made, so that they can not fight with American citizens. The commander's wife is apparently the only woman near or near this castle, thus spontaneously a misfortune, with a husband who is very uncertain about the future of the army. Tropperas are also seen, in fact do not want to take military or civil discipline. Finally, we can compare this story to Anthony Man's next film, "The Far Country", which plays Jimmy Stewart. In the case, he can finally return to be a poor cowboy. But the mature character does not come with a new way to become his master. Red Cloud has made life out of the army dangerous in this region. In addition to thinking, he is emotional with the commander's wife.
