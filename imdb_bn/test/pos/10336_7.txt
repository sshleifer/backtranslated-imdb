A tactful story called with softness: The painful young Jewish girl in WWII America is a shirted German POW who has hidden in her clubhouse. They talk about their life and belief (they are against Hitler), he tears her food, she becomes his only friend and friend. All of this reminds me of a much better theatrical film "Weasel Down the Wind", where Stace Mills convicts Allan Bates, but you certainly can not defect here, which is smooth, or the performance of Starling. Mature, Krusty McNicole carries most of the photo at the age of his ex-teenager and does not hit any false notes. Suddenly, when the detainee found (and Kristy found alongside), the movie gets very difficult. His father is confused and ashamed that his child will marry "Nazi", I hear him with a quiet anger that he rarely saw (he said, "you've died to me", which can be devastating for a little girl) . The final scenery is not out of the police; There are no major reunions, no hands climaxes over hold. The girl will face the world, and thus teach bitter lessons about neighbors, friends and family. A surprising film.
