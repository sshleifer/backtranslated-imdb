A city in Japan is being taken by a terrible cruel abstract shape: the spiral. It is becoming a theme in the minds of animals from the animals to the clouds and mentally and literally. This image shows it happening to different groups of people. Some giants are meant to be captured, but nothing is definitely certain that the best BG is out of the deck. The film really progresses from the real life to really unusual events (from giant snails and crazy people) to true myths (walking dead). <br /> <br /> As a Z-American horror movie fan, it was what I needed. Perhaps it was the novelty of a different culture film, but it seemed to be a very original progress, character set and feeling new. Japanese thinks "horrible size" (Uzumaki means "spiral," I said) is old, but it was nice for me because I used to be in giant / alien / virus / disaster / unwanted movies. In an American movie, you know who is going to die (annoying / nasty / sex / racist characters) and who will survive (child / heroine / dog / cat / beautiful guy). It's not true in Japanese awful. How they would fight against evil or not, was not predictable. Also, it was a really new (but probably Japanese) color, which was going on in the Pacific classical classical day, which had a new visual effect for me. The horrific moments were severely vague, depending on a little bit, but essentially simply overflowing the facial expression (the ring) and body manipulations. These should be among the great people, with one-night ideas like the nightmare of Elm Street or Living Dead.
