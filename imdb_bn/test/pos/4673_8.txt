I do not want to stay in the film or do not want to do anything with AdWarNurn, people automatically think that the film is able to see it or suicidal itself without its chance. I really hope Norton does this job. He is a good actor and all but he fears people away from a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I found it entertaining. It was not something with a special effect of madness or crazy, but it was not a bad one. It was fun. But yes, certainly not a bad / horror movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
