For me, tempest and its characters (by which I mean pretty) like old friends Since I started enjoying the game through the first acting class (I played Ferdinand) I caught myself in the amazing world of Shakespeare. I can clearly remember that a student can think of Ferdinand's decision not to play, so I went to the stage and got the honor of playing against Miranda. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You do not know them completely - you can always find out about their character. The production of summer summer movies is dear to an old friend, who feels his heart dear: Every visit represents our memories with new memories. With Prosper's books, the ceremony and elegance of this event stressed, the industry's enthusiastic celebration. Here, we can see as spectacular mysterious views, with lovingly decorated interior candles and on the floor rocket, more than the nobles of Naples Aleister Crowley. It reconsidered me - why was Prapero fired from Naples? His witchcraft power is so clear among this generation that it makes it a surprise that it was a politics that destroyed Prospero for exile, rather the truth about his differences with his colleagues. So, in the real world, he suffered. On the right side, the wrong changes are thrown, powerful. All the volumes in this game, whether they realize it or not, work through the creation of a hell-filled hellfire of the world - always interested in fraud to keep life close to hell. But Prospero drives this terrestrial villains to its island, where he possesses his (absolute) authority. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare brought his listeners to the theater, where Shakespeare events, results of the words Shakespeare must of course Prospero - but does this adaptation of this movie really honor Prospero as being so sympathetic that the society is unreasonable (astronomical texts, alchemical symbols, magical images, etc.) Is clothing and murder should be more reasonable, or should the person be wrong? Prospero is a hypocrite, because his magic leaves him because he will not lose their value in the book Naples, but because they are no longer needed - the world itself - has become the magic of books. <br /> <br> Hamlet in Hamlet presented a game of his colleagues. The drama complains to his colleagues of conspiracy against others for their own progress. Visitors' reaction varies: When Aphelia is surprised, Claudius responds with a panic attack. This happens in the game, and then Shakespeare has performed for men of his men this time. Shakespeare watch for their response? In the storm, Prospero creates the drama that we are creating, and we live with him. How do we respond? Are you happy to respond with simple joy at the end of the day? Are you annoyed and frustrated by the curiosity of this product, which is completely given the source material? Frequently often and frequently, these little life, sleeps frequently and often are often viewed? The tragedy is that Shakespeare has created a paradise of the life of mankind on earth and unwilling to comprehend it for the weak, small-energy struggle of human beings. We have Claudius. <br /> <br /> Like a good friend, this image is not without its flaws. I completely disagree with the choice to paint some scenes in blue. Mariners dance is rather durable. But in the heart this template, and one of his many faces.
