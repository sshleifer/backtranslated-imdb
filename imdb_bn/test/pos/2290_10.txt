Restart Oscar since 1992, and this picture may be nominated, and even won. It was so good to retain its era and dual cultures that it was among American and Japanese time capsules If you want to know what was going on here or there, this movie will show you. As an American, you will feel like tagging you for a wide Japanese holiday, and at the end of the film you will be a seasonal dragon fan, as you take Japanese heritage and culture injections into their baseball, we've been involved in our culture in our own culture. <br /> <br /> Jack Elliott (Tom Selek) is frustrating, Detroit Tigers' Sluger, who deals with the well-known, Dragon, Annual runners. Yankees Japan's North, dynasty Yomuri Giants. Giants are acclaimed for their success, yet everyone with success also wants to overcome them, which rarely happens. The dragon manager appointed Jack as the final piece of winning pants and we could have been in the baseball ground, but there was more to it. <br /> <br /> Sheel proved that a good script and a character that she thinks fit can carry a movie as her television show and the Japanese cast die hard back to Mr. Takaagi was equally good. The owner of the image is aware. Other actors, who include love interest (the manager's daughter), strong and independent, together with a belief in Japanese heritage, include an ensemble cast. She is a suitable and helpful girlfriend for Jack. He even told his father that he did not see him, for which he had suffered from him, he almost sympathized and relieved Jake, at least he knows the person he loves to love. <br /> <br /> Baseball scenes are great, a pre-fame by Dennis Hesbert as a second American patriot and widely regarded as the Western Counselor of Jack. There are elements of normal fish water and you are often pushing yourself to bring itself back to a country that does not speak our language and does not practice in our own way, but copying everything we do, including our national events. Jack, while throwing a magazine, told his magazine that he learned about heritage in Japan where you can be drunk and tell your boss, and it can not be used against you and it can be applied properly. Very ridiculous Plots and mistresses are nicely wrapped, but not very nicely, and nothing ends unreasonably. <br /> <br /> This is a comedy drama: it's a pure comedy drama, even a drama good mood. Trying to carry a lightweight film was critically criticized as its league-out way way apart from the plot too deep. The conditions were fun, but one of the best movies I've ever seen, in their position, is more serious, deep and precisely against backdrop. Baseball cinematography is for love for competing, for reality. <br /> <br /> Some people say that this movie is about baseball or Japan, but more than anything that seems to be about the workplace, and how people work from different sources with different agendas, and in some way their difference is the company's Good or disassociate for the party. <br /> <br /> A really awesome movie that never apologized, it was in the theater when the way for yourself.
