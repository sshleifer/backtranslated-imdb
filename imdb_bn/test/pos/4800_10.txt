Najrin is like a child, she wants to lead a life just as Christ was taught to man. But it's too late: now the Catholic Church is in the hands of the rich bourgeoisie, the Bishop lives in luxury and does not give disrespect to the poor and the sick. For this reason our hero can not follow our hero on the request to follow him. So he immersed himself in the path of everything and his own purity, he is Mary Magdalene and a woman who attracted sex by her (the scene between this girl and her drunk). Spain (this was the last fifty years), they thought Nazrin was a Christian movie! Recognizing Luis Bonuel, it was absolute: all his works were stagnant, and an ambiguity to his "holy woman" Jesus. On the way to Najarin, only the bramble and the couch grass grow. His attempts to help the workers in the street are unsuccessful, he became victim of strike breakdown. All its words amount to nothing. At the end of the journey, he is arrested and offered a pie neapple (Bunuelian sex symbol) by a woman. Thanks to "Nazarene", Bunuel was allowed to return to Spain (where censors did not have any sources) and to give directions "Viridiana".
