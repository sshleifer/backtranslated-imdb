Fantastic Movies! One of the best films ever made silent movies is one. Bad guys, bad girls, a jewelry singer, a twisted morality, kidnapping, everything is here. Gene Services has a face that boasts bogart and the rest cast is full of character actors, who think they have brought something good. Get some popcorn and have a great time.
