After seeing this movie, I understand why so many people hate this movie. I'm not saying it's always the top 250, but it's a great movie in its genre. I know, many people are not happy to see how a legend like 'Robin Hood' turns out to be a comedy. Many people still believe that some things should not be frustrating ... they are wrong. <br /> <br /> Mel Brooks did a great job with Robin Hood: Men in tights I also watched the original Robin Hood movies, but when it was with me, it was not a good time to visit them. This is the only continuation of the sunny moments and parodies of famous personalities and films (Winston Churchill, The Godfather ...). <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone who loves to watch this movie. Those who think that Robin Hood should not be abusive, you are wrong, but you do not see it better because you'll probably be offended by it. I give this movie an 8/10.
