This short cut was in the fourth part of the "Short Film Journal" - I rented a movie from Netflix, but it was originally a monthly film series that prefers medium-sized modern movies and loves to do DVD chips with commercials. . I have tried two of the journal's DVDs so far and have been frightened by the excitement that viewers must navigate the disc to watch movies. Talk about an over-produced and overly complicated way to do this! I'm really skeptical about whether or not I'll be annoyed with the journal because of these reasons, as I see and continue to do the shorts. <br /> <br /> Now it can be because I dislike the disc because I'm pretty much disposed towards this Portuguese animated brief. This is definitely possible. However, even if in this case, I think that other reviews were very positive about this simple little film. Some artworks were really nice - I easily turned into black and white paintings in a 3D environment, which was a dust remote shot and drowned in the city below. This was beautiful and took some work. But for the story of a cat that wants to go to the moon, it did nothing for me. Important update - I again saw this image in the movie "Cartoon Nirr" on 5/9. It was a fantastic unappealing collection of art films. However, this time I saw a completely different audio track and the story of CAT and Moon with the boy made it a difference. With subtitles instead of Portuguese, it was a French-spoken narrator, who spoke English in a film style film. Although I usually hate dubbing, this time it really made the film. If you do not know the language or subtleties you do not want to understand the Portuguese version, leave a lot of favorites. Unless you speak the language, try searching for another version (if you understand English).
