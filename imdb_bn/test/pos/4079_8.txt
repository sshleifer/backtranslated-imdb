Based on the fact, this deadly drama expresses concern with some ambitious African citizens, who temporarily decide to leave their family after going into exotic ships. They think that if they fly successfully, they can improve their lives by earning enough money to send their families to New York. Unfortunately, the ship they chose for them is Russian freight ship, which has already been heavily fined for stoves on the eastern port. The captain and the first mate decide to do this work again due to the fact that their work is on the line. The tribe of blacks started their frustration in the freight carrier and finally discovered, the ruthless companion (the great performance of Shan Parvavit) was hiding and abstaining from killing. Some of them (temporarily, Omar Aipus, among them) manage temporarily. Runaway and ruthlessly shipped through the ships, if they are caught. There is a riveting film together in which viewers are grating their nails and their teeth teeth can be amazing in such a terrible event in modern civilization.
