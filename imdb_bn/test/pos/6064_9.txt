This is one of the best non-English series I have seen. It creates interesting single and double episodes of crime-solutions together with a personal perspective that you simply do not get in CSI. All of the private characters have a personal life that combines them with their day-to-day work and sometimes interfere. In addition all the characters naturally manage to develop throughout the episode. <br /> <br /> Wrestling is fantastic and it has been tapped all over Denmark, giving a good example of highlights that the royal country has been proposed. Unfortunately, only 32 episodes were made, but they were top televisions. They are hoping that they consider making more episodes of similar merit.
