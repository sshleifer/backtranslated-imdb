My friend took me to the screening of this Hollywood film and it was great! It was an amazing acting, great script, a movie silent with cool music, the whole thing was very good and entertaining. Do not know whether a release is available in the theater, but it will be a great date movie or a fun movie to watch it in Blockbuster. I like this kind of movie, less in budget but big on style and imagination. I hope Alexander Holden will get a bigger share of him in this big part, he's fantastic.
