KTL's Channel 5 remembers walking from school to school almost every day to capture giant movies, but after the film's schedule, I have not been able to run home fast. Somehow, the idea of ​​being a boy and applying to me in a very unique way of having a giant robot as a friend. Sure, I used to pretend Spiderman, Batman and other superheroes, but I really wanted to be Johnny Saxo among them. <br /> <br /> I have not seen this movie for 30 years and I can still remember it all. Giant robot can miss his fingerprint missile! Or the thunderstorm explosion touched his fingertips! Geez, I can still finish the theme song which can finally play, which sounds so tragic that I'm screaming for myself many times! <br /> <br /> There is only another movie which is magic in this movie and it is the Wizard of Oz. But I saw the child that I have been a kid since many years. Of course, the Wizard of Oz is a genuine classic where voices in space spaces are less meaningful of budgets. These two pictures should not be mentioned in the same sentence, but to a young boy it is not a high yield value or consistency that takes your heart, flying monkeys and giant robots! <br /> <br /> My cousin used a very accurate impression of the giant robot (he called it "giant robert.") If you think Giant Robot had a specific way of shooting his missiles And my cousin was cold. I repeat an endless routine for my personal pleasure to him.
