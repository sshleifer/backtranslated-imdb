I've enjoyed this movie all right, it can be very good. I'm expecting more activity than I got ... which was a comedy than anything else. Undoubtedly, it was a serious part and most of it had a good fight scene for it and it was also a few romance and comedy, and some steps and no shock. Which is hard to do with a vampire movie. A vampire hunter loses his partner and needs to be trained, his sister is going through a difficult break, but he is being followed by a wool of all things. Approved, this vampire is rather beautiful and blood is not sucking. So, after some royal vampires, it is really without a plot of another vampire that he can achieve the ultimate power. There is some problem with this movie that its plot went there and the film had a very unusual flow, and this style seemed to move a bit further. One minute action, next pure comedy. However, girls were nice, have good work, comedy was a glossy or two and Jackie Chan makes an energetic look or two rather. This film probably needed further development in some areas such as Villene, which was originally not actually searched. So this is rather good for a movie with a few good fights and a chocolate or two ... why was it rated R? I have seen that what we have created is PG-13 which is much worse than that.
