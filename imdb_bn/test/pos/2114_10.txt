After defeating the hockey piki, Grand Champion, he took auction of 775,000 US dollars. The kids pay for college education. The body said that next time he will see hockey ... it will be a sow! The children's award winning pledge to steal the pledge, promises to save him from the BBQ. The fun begins here ... Julia Roberts, Larry Mahan, George Strait, Natalie Menes, Steven Blund, Tommy Guy, Tough Headman, and many more stars create backdrop for all antics. Do not believe you actually won the auction in the auction !!! (He looks good in a blaze) Soundtrack is rich with George Stret, Natalie Menes, Willie Nelson and more tunes from Where else do you get movie star, country and western star and rudo star experience ... only in Texas ... only grand champions <br /> <br /> This "easy" little movie is nicely made, which you can watch the best movie this year.
