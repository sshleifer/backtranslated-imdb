I went to pre-screening "Rory O'Shhea was here." I hope this movie is better than me, because nice cast and strong performance. This is a movie about the friendship of two strangers. Rory is a free spirit young man who wants to be independent of his Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He can only move on to his two fingers, but he can speak in pronunciation and help his new father Michael, who has cerebral palsy and significantly unmistakable speeches. I suppose that enough to start with a crying drama. Well, that's it. But with inspirational messages and deeply moving performance. It was looking at my life for the things I had given. What should I do if I move my two fingers? I am thankful to what I am able to do and what I am doing. It might be good though it is a good flick.
