This is definitely a "must see the film" film. Excellent director Alain Chabat (acting as a cesare), "Asterix's Adventure Adventures" (based on it's French comic books), has been able to create a very good and beautiful and modern and intelligent comedy, which is a tribute animated film in the world. This movie is so funny, so jokes (both visual and spoken) that it can take you two or three screenings, before you can laugh and smile. The only drawback is that a non-French audience (or at least a non-French speaking audience) can not get all the "personal joke". It is impossible to translate many dialogs, many events directly related to comic books or to the streets of France, which can reduce the fun. However, it's still pretty pictures, amazing stunts, music, completely crazy environment and completely valuable for excellent acting. All the actors are great, but the film is not the same as Jameel Deobaz, Gerard Dermon and Edward Barre. And please do not compare this awesome movie based on the same comic books based on the horror: "Asterix and Obelik Contre Caesar" and Claud Zidi.
