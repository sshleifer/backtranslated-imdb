Violent men are a good western. Perhaps the story is not a fundamental one-big farm owner dedicated to running small rivalry in the valley required for his hometown - but the film has many elements that increase its level and make it worth watching. <br /> <br> Cast a highlight. As a former army officer, Glenn Ford (John Parish) is a reliable and now one of the small runners who has tried to stop the hard work until the hard work is done. Edward Robinson (Louis Wilkinson) always plays the helpless big man and Barbara Stanwick (Martha) as a treacherous wife among the one who is easily related to her normal average female roles (others "double compensation" and "wild flood") Brian Keith (Cole) Robinson's gunman's brother Like an ambitious man who works perfectly like his brother's big uncle Doing Regular Westerners of the 50's are villain Richard Jakele (Wade Matlock) and end up as normal. Dian Foster (Judith Wilkinson) plays Robinson's daughter, who does not allow her father, mother and uncle to arrange things with their neighbors. <br /> <br /> Rudolph Mate may bring an ideal but acceptable aspect, perhaps beautiful and spacious open scenery and a fine and appropriate music score too. <br /> <br /> The best among Western movies are the inevitable final showdown between Ford and Keith. Each person has his dual style (see the notice of the Ford) shooting his shot with the shooting of his shot on the army and aiming at the military), and then decide for his differences. It must be one of Glenn Ford's best West appearances, the second only for the classic "3: 10 Uma" he made two years later. Perhaps it is a cast that puts the film at the "A" rate and for me it enters the top 10 list of the genre.
