I do not like jackass number two. No one should be there. Especially in Jacques, there was nothing to be released. And yet ... it's one of the most fun things I've ever seen - and I can not explain why simply <br /> <br /> This new movie leaves the first page of the dust. It's so funny, so awesome and so wrong. The whole team gives them all - Jack is leading with Naxville in charge. He nuts I worshiped him, but he's crazy. And its more power. He could have sat again with his growing film career and let everyone else do dirty work, but the fact that he threw himself, often in literal sense 'came back to the world of return, so I undoubtedly respected him. The more codos will definitely go to the left margarine, which started to subside in the material and make sure that everyone around them did more than that. The left here is not the pain but the pain and the best for it. <br /> <br /> I just can not tell my favorite part because I laughed completely. I've seen most of the movies from my fingers, but there was not a 'real' movie that I've seen for a long time, which makes me feel like this. Their love or perhaps their hatred, the Jacques team has delivered my expectations above and beyond. But I agree with the left. No Jackass can be number three because someone dies and I want to surround these guys.
