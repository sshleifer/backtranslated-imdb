Another Gem in Tromso and Juliet (1996) Trauma Studios Movie Archive Like toxic avenger, tromba war, class of nouak m high, terrorism and siege. Kabukeman N.Y.P.D. This photo is an instant Troma classic. James Gunn has updated Romeo and Juliet as a medieval tragedy and modern day street punk drama. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Actors handle very well scripts. I was surprised to wonder how well they did the dialog, using a much more meaningful budget and costly set than some Hollywood big budget actors. I enjoyed this movie very much. Lloyd Kauffman will not be disappointed because you know what to expect from his movies and other tromba productions. I would rather see her film and paid actor, hair scripts, lazy director and those terrible CG Special effects <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. You have fun films with special effects on Chess, top acting and inspired guidance, then this movie is just for you!
