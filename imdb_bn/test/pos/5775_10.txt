This movie was a big movie in my mind! I saw this on television at the age of 11, and could not remember its title. If I think correctly, I believe this is a Christmas television special. One of my friends was doing this and I was discussing it a few years ago, but none of us could remember the title. But we have to remember almost the whole movie. Feel the work someone else does not remember it! Thanks for the goodness of a TV movie website, the answer to my post! Now I have fun working to detect a copy! This is an extraordinary event that you can remember as a child, but the film is clearly playing on my head even after 28 years. And I believe I only saw it once. Perhaps it was because I was the oldest sister in my family, or maybe I was taking care of the kids and working at day care center because it had been stuck with me for a long time. For the real reason, it remains in a movie that I really want to see recently !!! If someone can see it online, or have a copy, please let me know. I love to see it again !!!! Thanks a lot! Seriously, I tried to post this and it says my comments are not long enough. So, apparently I will have to type more, do you know that Melissa Michaelsen is the sister of Peter Billinglen who played Christmas Story? I know that I am not the only fan of this movie, so if anyone has any idea about what it is available then I would greatly appreciate it.
