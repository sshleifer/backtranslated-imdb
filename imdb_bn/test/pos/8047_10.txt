Here some critics have judged today's silent film by political-corrective measure. <br /> <br /> "War" was an excellent movie for many reasons, well-known by more well-known critics: Fantastic Cast, lots of steps, innovative editing and photography. <br /> <br /> its stars. Griffith stock company and this silent film fan, enough temptation to see it and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I saw it many years ago and saw it again on YouTube; It was a very poor quality print, but in a real theater combined with my memory of a good print, I can properly recommend it to the people and film historians.
