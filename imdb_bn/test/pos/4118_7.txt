This attractive film features three very good performances in the silent: Sanders, Patrick, and Blackmer. Apparently outstanding among Sanders and Patrick. As a detective, Demumming is unfortunately not nearly as good. He lacks the intelligence, strength, and cynical world view of Bogra. Humphrey played this part, we could have been a classic. <br /> <br /> Pace, position (a library), and the atmosphere is all good. But there are some plot holes. Sanders Blackmaker and Strong Organization (Nazi) He is very frightened. Despite Blackmail being mistakenly killed, Sanders can not feel any worries or remorse. Sanders then used the judgment of the Library and its residents to use the verdict that he and his men were investigating the Investigation Investigation Detective. However, Sanders' Hitman later tried to kill Deming without drawing a silencer, although others heard the prisoner, and were frustrated by the word. Eventually, Sanders injured Hart tried to kill Roberts, who invented the truth, but when he is mad, he does not go unnoticed. <br /> <br /> My most annoying thing was that a big and unexpected conclusion was lost. A smart, hard-a-nail socialism across the film Patrick is portrayed as nothing to fear. Yet to the end, he was afraid of the last surviving Nazi, a brutal goat. The police found him, he killed him. And he eventually ended up being another weak, stereotypical victim. What should this happen: Police finds the Nazi lip, but she died. He tricked him, and then disappeared - to continue his evil ways.
