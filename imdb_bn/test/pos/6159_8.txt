During WW2, flying checks for RAF added entry from Europe about the warrior pilot. It's always interesting to see America as a new perspective on the familiar facts in history. There is nothing terrible or revolutionary about this style which is an illustrated or romantic love triangle which anchors the narrative. Still, it is forced all the way through. There is a good balance between drama, romance, humor, action, and symbolism, which is neatly different from the director and cast. It's a breath of fresh air after sitting through an exaggerated and annoying Hollywood epic like "Parlor Harber". All around is a difficult production. This is definitely worth your time if you are a fan of foreign cinema.
