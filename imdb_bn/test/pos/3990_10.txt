First off, I absolutely love this movie. As a fan of Billy Crystal, I must say that I really hope for a more ridiculous situation. However, playing the role of depth and passion was very nice. His artist, talented agent Sammy, brilliantly played and played him uniquely. In addition, Giorgi Morsan (as Maximus) starred in his first film. When Sammy goes to Romania to visit his client, his world flies. He hoped that he would accidentally find a person who could change his life. The journey of Sammy and Mac is unique and ongoing, and sometimes even ridiculous. Also, the position of the Czech Republic where the parts of the film were shot were absolutely beautiful. I want to say, this dramatic comedy seemed to me different emotions. I thought it was nice and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
