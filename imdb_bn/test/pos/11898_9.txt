I just want to say that this movie was nice. <br /> <br /> I like to start from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> acting was a lot better. The director did a great job and I would like to see it again. Jennifer Tilly performed very well, the man who interpreted her father (Mani) was another great actor but I could not recover her name. <br /> <br /> I can not wait for El Padro 2. <br /> <br /> Damian Chapa feels so good and I think he is one of the most talented actors out there. Latin actors have so much love that it shows good in this film! <br /> <br /> Rent it !!! Rent it !!! Rent it !!!
