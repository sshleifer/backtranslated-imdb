Blackstone was scared all over the city because he embraced Brett Dixon's brother - and he was coming back for a revenge! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Why blackmails are coming back to why its brother lynched. He is an inferior and gunfighter's superiority, everyone is afraid of him - Mexican bandits (who fought for Geringgo, who took their land!) As well as "honest" citizens related to Bret's brother. They put him on the throne, because they thought that he had stolen their money instead of bringing them to Dallas in the security of the bank there. But this is really half the truth, as we find in this psychologically attractive Western way. <br /> <br /> But be careful, it's like a frustrating movie, because everyone is guilty and definitely everybody is bad to the bones ... However, I've enjoyed it very much and it's 8 / I got 10. Curious, less than 5 people voted for this movie on January 12, 2002 ....
