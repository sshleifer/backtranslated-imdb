I've seen it at one time, probably like most people in my age (55) 60. I understand the final product dissatisfaction by both families. But it was a great movie, it was a great opera; But as a film it's surprising. This film should be released from at least the video, other generations can achieve an understanding of great music and storytelling. Cast is sometimes made the greatest black actor, most are now dead; Only Sydney P. Still with us Please do not wait until he goes away and the film is like an old film, the waste of time is unusable. Again, this is a great movie which is not seen today very often, if it is.
