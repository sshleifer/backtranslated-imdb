I first saw it in black and white, almost in XXII Christmas, when it was shown in British television. I was totally blurred, whenever it was repeated on TV (probably two or three times, just as it happens - we used to be a video recorder!) <br /> <br /> The plot describes the return of the hospitality grapherhapper , Which lies in a luxurious US city. He has found that he does not know what he has kept, and his good insect friend (who lives only in the 'lowlands' outside a songwriter and his wife garden) is now threatened with 'human', who trampling through broken fares, Using it as, it uses it as a shortcut. <br /> <br /> Pest rooms are burst by their feet, and often burned cigar nuts and matches, and burns again and again. Old Mammoth Bumblebee and his beautiful daughter honey (Huppi's childhood lover) have been in serious danger of losing their Hani Shop from this threat. <br /> <br /> Their problems are the properties of the damaged pest progressive. Beagle beetle has. Romantic design on honey bees, and hopes that her pregnant women smack the sweat the fly and MacKito, allowing Bumbleley to give her hand in marriage. <br /> <br /> will win heroic and fearless hopes, and manage their dastardly fate, and especially her valuable honey to save the bug community from her? Enjoy classic tracks ("Katy Did, Didy Did not" a fantastic, shocking, enthusiastic example), and colorful visuals, as the story unfolds. <br /> <br /> This time my attraction has been spoiled by the best of animation and story-writing, and I was happy to release it on the video, though afterwards I found it to be in the NTSC play format. Do not remember, I immediately sent for the video, and then only bought a portable TV / video combination (completed with NTSC playback). <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed many nostalgic enjoyments ever since and even discovered that TV rights to the movie were switched from the BBC (who was not likely to show me the film at their stations sometimes), who (finally) had 2007 They showed it at their digital stations early. <br /> <br /> My grandmother (three years old) entered absolutely when we saw it together - and it was a child who was influenced by the digital era and the computer generated production! <br /> <br /> I want to fully recommend this movie for any age, and especially the youngest among the audience. <br /> <br /> Give Max Fischer posthumous Oscar!
