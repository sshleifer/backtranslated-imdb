This movie is short-lived for entertainment, but it can not be made in any country, but it is nothing but the "Colombian" marker. Imagine Colombian or socially and politically correct film topics, and who is looking for factors marked as "it is endangered", it is better than to see this movie. Someone is not a drug trafficker or a farmer and activist in war, or wing guerilla and abductional political references. <br /> <br /> Corrupt police is a person who may be a heroine of Mexican, Russian, Italian or Chinese, and a photographer from Argentina, it can be Venezuela, Peruvian or Philippine, and often in "Boldo" it changes personality or history Except for another country, except for another word, it may be substituted. The important thing is that it is very fast calculated history with images and correct performance. Its quality is about TV movies but better ones. If a movie is worthy of its ability or is not able to support the publisher's buttons, then it is a little talked about "mammata".
