Kirk and crew are visiting mining colonies in a federation in a remote planet rich in mineral resources. The Devil in the Dark Hall is a very unusual silicon-based life-form that tunnels through solid rock. Horta mine has been assassinated and, decides, must be destroyed. but how? <br /> <br /> It is difficult to continue this review with making a fool, so instead I just focus on the technical aspects of this episode and touch on its themes. Special effects are OK, but the scene with Horta is a lot of weird look. The fair average for acting TOS. The mine is a bit weird. Saturn plays the most difficult part of darkness in the darkness, and he closes it well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This great TV series has more than many episodes, maintaining an open mind and At least some people increase the importance of sympathy for others. Plus, it is a potentially most interesting, unless potentially involves plot twists in the original series. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
