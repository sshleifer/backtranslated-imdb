One of my favorite movies, whenever it was launched, even though I was missing one time while losing it at Foxtel last year. <br /> <br /> This is not the case despite the film's age and although the story has still been done thousands of times before it feels entertaining. There were one or two small children for me in the story, but I looked behind them and I saw the movie for what it was. <br /> <br /> Overall I got it 7/10
