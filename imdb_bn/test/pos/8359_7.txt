Episodes were made and President of Eisenhower was the President. Kennedy was elected president. <br /> <br /> For this episode, this is a devastating episode, if it is not sincere. The "professor" does not show a lot of range here, and the whole thing seems a little less (many of the TZD episodes do not seem to be consistent with the timing, some seem like they have emerged gradually and some have little or nothing, it spreads for half an hour, And some certainly, suitable). I hope you feel a little more tense than going back to some rooms and drugged. But overall a decent phase. In fact, when "whats" the idol itself sets the table with a pebble and a basic interest. <br /> <br /> 7 of the 10 TZ episodes considered not quite good, and some good a good deal.
