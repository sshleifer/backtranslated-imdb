My whole family enjoyed this movie with this little baby. Great value without sex, violence, drugs, nudity or prejudice. There was also no special effect of billions of dollars to try to mislead the audience from poorly written tales. A simple little family fun movie We especially like the songs in the movie. But we just heard a part of the song ... Most end credits ... Want to buy a soundtrack CD from this movie. This is my fourth bill Hilman movie and they have the same guidelines as mentioned above. Hillman Falar has no risk rating with all the movies you do not want to see all your kids. We love his movie.
