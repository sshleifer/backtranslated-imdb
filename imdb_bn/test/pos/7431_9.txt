This movie is based on the series of games: Final Fantasy. This is especially about FF7 or Final Fantasy VII. I like the game, and I'm very happy to see that it can be transformed into a movie, I love CGI, it was great Many great war scenes, actions, and characters make the movie memorable. If your game is a die-hard fan you will love this movie. Personally, I'm not a deadly fan of games, but I'm becoming one. <br /> <br /> My favorite character from the Final Fantasy VII without Cloud is to be Sid. I love Seed, I think he's beautiful. I was amazed how practical the CGI images were, it was amazing, it's game in 3D. I had a great time to watch movies, and anyway, I love the ayons, especially Bahamat, he is great! Overall I gave this movie 9, because yes, I like it. I thought it was really really good movie, and yes it got me on the list of movies. The letters were amazing, like CJ, the stories were wonderful, with so many actions and battle scenes. Based on the video game, I still saw it as the best movie.
