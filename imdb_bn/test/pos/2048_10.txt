When this movie came out, I saw Guyana Davis playing only soft, women's role ... The film was soft and there was something more than women. Great line, great action ... She and Samuel El really clicked. Very fierce for the Kiddies, but if you and your significant other are trying to agree on a movie, try it for size. Go to Zina! Go to Zina!
