Not sure what to expect from Kevin Coster and Ashton Kutcher, I was present in the advance screening of the film; Both memorable performances and films have been distributed less than. Although the underlying "ordinary" story was a bit familiar, the film was fantastic. Both Castner and Kutcher played extremely well off each other and delivered strong performance. The power of man and their respective characters are incredibly played by both; Why Coaster joined Coast Guard's Rescue Elite, why did Carter fight for Carter due to personal reasons, this scene is the most unforgettable moment of the film. The "specific" story itself shows a picture of personal self-sacrifice, and for the sake of physical training, the elite Coast Guard rescuers must go through their only job and responsibility to save the sea life. The special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and I did not see such a rage from "wandering" ... "Perfect Storm". Co-star Clancy Brown (HBO's "Carnival" - looking forward to him again), he played the captain of the Coast Guard, the captain of the Coast Guard in a strong, credible role as a leader with the precondition of his veins and the necessary ice water. The picture is surprisingly, and finally, the long-delayed exposure and the Coast Guard are respected; The audience was finally applauding.
