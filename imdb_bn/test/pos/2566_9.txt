Then you will be a big fan of this movie. It's an excellent mix of almost the same basic idea, music, spirit, and drama. I will admit, I was just worried about showing this film, I just saw the order of the white trash girl disciplined in a radiator, but I am Samuel El. Jackson is a great fan and I've enjoyed the Hostels and Flowers so I thought I would give it a chance. <br /> <br /> I'm so happy that I did. This is more than the patronage of a nymphomaniac's southern girl captured in a 60 year old black man's prison. The story was in the heart, and was very influential. <br /> <br /> Music also added a nice touch to this movie. In this style of Craig Bruya, he mixes his style from the hustle and flow, accepts new spins and uses blues. The performance scenes are at the top of the charts in the musical view of as far as it is running. She has taken very interesting flashback scenes and gives you only a whole crazy feeling in some more controversial scenes. <br /> <br /> No doubt, if you like Hostle and Flow you love this movie and if you are a fan of Blues you will definitely see this. I give it 9 out of 10, very interesting movies and it's very low rating. Shame <br /> <br /> Go out of this movie.
