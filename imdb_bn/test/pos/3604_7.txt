A nice and beautiful movie full of madrassari graduates (Cephalonia is a very beautiful Greek island) that keeps a lot of features in the novel. I think Greek sceneries add a special and magical movie. The one thing I did not like was that, the main character, like Madrasah and Pelagia, was a Greek actor but not a foreigner. I meant to try to express the Greek life to the actor, but they did not succeed in me and it was completely clear. While trying to use Greek words, their pronunciation was terrible and it was bad for the film's plot. Irene Papas is really great in his role, a typical example of a 40-year-old island inhabitant who has lost her husband and is trying to survive a single child. Pelagia's father John Hart also did a great job. He reminds me of a lot of his reaction to a Greek.
