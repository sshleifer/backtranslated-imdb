We start with all of our reviews with the following information. For the last 15 years my wife and I have seen about 100 movies each year. Recently, we were honored by accepting the passage of lifetime film at any time in a film! So we can see what we want whenever we want. This point is calculated by CRITICS for ZERO. Your local critics or national critics of Ebert are not actually different from yours. The only difference is whether they want to write about movies and see hundreds of movies. Therefore, it is our belief that if you are eligible for two hours of your earning, it is enough for us! We do not ever hear critics reading. We only care about our friends and those who do the same things like us. Well enough about that. <br /> <br /> When the film's NSC chief Merrill Strip said, "America does not torture America," the film gets huge smiles. The Bush administration has repeatedly denied that it is a lie. This is a very good movie and it can be frightening to what it can do to us, because we lose all our civil rights. They can simply "tear" you anywhere and they can tell they have done it. In this case, they hijacked a person whose name was killed in 9/11. He must be like you or me And they took him to a hideous place outside the United States to torture him and pirates. <br /> <br /> Very awesome. Well played by Jake and Reese and the whole cast.
