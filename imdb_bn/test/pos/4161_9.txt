Developed by the artists of Agnes's Guadard (Brew Travail), the Golden Door is a visually attractive voice poem that follows the journey of their black family journey from the Alice Island of New York to Sicily's indigenous house in the beginning of the century. It is a spiritual, mysterious, often weird, but ultimately deeply rewarded experience. Emmanuel Crueliz (Resirpero) is the latest film to dream about reality with duplicate reality and interviewed symbolic imagery, the last image of the Impruelle Cruises (Resiro) is like a printed painting - a film artist who represents the immigration process for our parents and grandparents. . His visit to the Museum of Eliass Island, came about in the context of Christie's "Witch, Mysterious Tour", the appearance of the face of migrants appearing in his films, and his strict policies and methods used in admission. Immigrants. <br /> <br /> Directed by the study of immigrants sent home relatives, Creials identified with poor immigrants who were able to see positive aspects of things outside their weaknesses. Salvatore Mancuso (Vinceenzo Amato) and his eldest son Angelo (Francesco Casis), America is a distant dream that they do not know anything. After climbing a rocky mountain to pray to the monks for swimming, they were rewarded after showing the post card of Salvatore's little son Peter (Filippo Puilo), which is a deaf mute, which shows the new world as a land where they can bathe in the milk of the river , Sit under the tree of money, or collect fruit giant onions and carrots. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Changes on the other side. When they got into the boat and settled in their crowded third-class steering compartment, the film's most discussed scene was visible. Using a camera on a ship that stands by the public, when the plane is dragged, the frames are divided into ships and separated by dock and separated by the dock, it is understood that they are isolated from everything they know. <<br /> <br /> On the ship, a mysterious English lady named Lucy (Charlotte Gainsberg).

The journey is treacherous with a violent storm hanging on the ship. Firing in almost the entire darkness, the passenger's journey leaned toward the boat and later, the bodies collapsed and the floor was like Totantans. Alice Island is not easy to travel through immigration processing, and in the name of "civilized" society preservation, attacking crew's methods of uneducated farmers, putting them together, performing mathematical work, and examining abusive medical treatment prove that they are "fit" . <br /> <br /> The wedding ceremony seems like auction block and young women are frustrated when they meet with weights of young men.
