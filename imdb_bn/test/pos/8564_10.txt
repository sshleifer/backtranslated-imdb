I gave it a 10 because it's the best film of its kind ... in the shade of "old house" and a good old fashion in the film T & A. I saw it as a similar movie called "swap mile" and both of them had good type ... great way to spend Saturday afternoon. Let's be honest ... this movie has more breasts, which can be imagined for a rated movie. From start to finish, they appear to appear only on screen (sunset scenes, bedroom scenes and of course, climatic football games). Also, a memorable kiss booth (Kiss me, Clutz!) Everyone has a great time playing in their roles (many playboy players, Danny Bonadusi, well-known TV and movie actors, etc.). The character of Leicester London is not known as its last name "Oahara" and the better name of the 1970s "Olivia" (or they or oh or o ... ?? !!) At the end of the 1980s, I saw this former wife (encouraging herself quite well) and she could not believe that I really enjoy the movie !! He was probably jealous !! Again, this movie is a great way to spend Saturday afternoon ... do not think too hard!
