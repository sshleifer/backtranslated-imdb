I recently challenged this movie. It turned into pretty decent as it actually goes to the B-list horror / mystery films. The two boys (one simple and one-legged ** ** take a road trip to stop a wedding but decide to play a scary, a variable tank / truck hybrid cat and mouse when they have the worst fate. They take a ridiculous whorish hitchhiker When things are more complicated, this film makes it unique that the comedy and the combination of terrorism actually work in this movie, As of. Two guys and a few well enough to the desired Chase / suspense scenes. Excellent pyasim and comic timing in this movie horror / slyasara Buffet serves more than portable. Definitely worth checking out.
