Can i say It has not been as bad as many here. I saw this movie that I had never heard before, it was strictly for Ian Maxanne. <br /> <br /> I was not at least frustrated. Ian Maxhon is absolutely brilliant and his role brings an amazing subtlety. She always watched and for my money ... a very underlying actor. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the film .... All other actors in the film have a strong, strong performance. These people did not pay a large amount of money for their participation (this was a fairly low budget movie), but this does not mean that none of them "matched" their presence. Everyone was convinced and compulsory with parts. I was surprised at the performance of the Adrian Pool, although I admired that I had seen him in the Television series of the Highlander before this movie. <br /> <br /> Plots were well read and the story is like a curiosity and real life, at the end of the film, everything ends in a beautiful little package for you. Anyone who has a clear cut, expected by numbers, connecting "conclusion" or "answer" at the end of the film ... clearly not seeing enough movie! This picture will not tell you "what is the meaning of life"! The idea is that after watching the film, you can discuss inappropriate questions with your friends from a coffee. I have done <br /> <br /> No car is moving ... there is no explosion ... no room is disturbed ... (very nice, sounds?) But the reality was that I was completely absorbed in the film and it was just A well written piece with a good hook and solid character acting by all the parties involved <br /> <br /> ****** Alert ... ****** If you are the person who is the central engine of the story A big "question" blurts me And then answer the question directly to the dislike ratike without special <br /> <br /> The film concludes this movie to enjoy ... can not.
