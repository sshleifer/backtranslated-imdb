In which film an incompetent person can behave like a person with a more realistic and extremely powerful behavior? Probably no one But no one can compare their expectations with the amazing emotional and strong performance given by two actors in this movie. <br /> <br /> Michael (Steven Robertson) lives in the house for disability. People He has his cerebral palsy, and we have been shown correctly at the beginning, there are huge problems for contact with him. So if you could talk really, colleague inactive member Rory (James McAay) can speak it normally, it's a real life. So a friendship starts off which is basically (maliciously enough) depending on the communication. <br /> <br /> In a ridiculous scenario, they themselves leave the house. After rejecting Rory, a good hearty Michael advocated an application to move to his own home. Rory, who already had a bad name with "judges", was his interpreter. <br /> <br /> But the problem will soon come. They started heartily sincerely to a girl who was showing a pub a few days ago, who wants to be her assistant to do things smaller than that. He is reluctant at first; He does not know these men, but they may feel frustrated; So hit other friends, but not necessarily a good one ... <br /> <br /> As well as mad, this movie really depends on the actors. But that's not a bad thing. As an inactive actor, you see Rory, although he can communicate properly, he is frustrated in the way he relies entirely on other people and does not have his own true life. But for me the real star Steven Robertson He works for such emotions, fitness and sadness / happiness, which really makes him win over the whole film. <br /> <br /> Excellent. <br /> <br /> Overall: 5 out of 5
