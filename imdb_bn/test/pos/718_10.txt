Jennifer Montgomery's "Art for Children's Teachers" is a stunning, annoying masterpiece. Montgomery's grassroots camar work and cinematography refers to a frustrating, raw reality in this autobiographical story of a 14-year-old Jennifer, her married boarding school guide councilor with brilliant unreasonable performance from her cast. On the phone, I've been caught in movies like Jennifer (Kaitlyn Grace McDonnell) and Jennifer's mother (actually voiced by Ruth Montgomari), the scenes of the wonderful actresses I've ever played in films, something very playful and powerful. Lesson finally learned here? "There is nothing more dangerous than a boring person who has bad art." Well, for anyone interested in thought-provoking independent movies, I would recommend an extraordinary piece of "art".
