The SF prize is not unique (although it was lagging behind), but the focus is quite different than other synthetic reality films. Especially in the early part, it is a wide-ranging criminal picture that is used on the SAF campus to tell the story of an abnormal crime, which forced the detective to withstand an invisible letter and unexplained witnesses, solve a mystery, who do not lie or be helpless . Instead of an incredible narrator, we have an unfettered world. <br /> <br /> We follow the main character's struggle for terrorism in two parts and it becomes a mental test of character in extreme situations. He knows that his existence is nothing more than the electrical pressure, how does he deal with this knowledge? He knows that there is more real world than him, but he is trapped in an artificial world, in a world where no one understands him. The problem of thinking about knowing something that nobody in the world knows or wants to believe is a true fact that many of us can recognize. This film is frustrating for me, its bold, artificial atmosphere that supports the artificial synthesis of the film world. <br /> <br /> Apart from 'matrix' or 'thirteen floor', it is slightly concerned with evoking a sense of scary for its artificial reality plots, instead it is very focused on the direction of psychology. Philosophy is so interesting that some of these philosophical concepts are shaped by the way they shape and transform the concept of the world's character. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the longest (which is not the problem) if you are employed by me like this) and runs very little on part 2 steam.
