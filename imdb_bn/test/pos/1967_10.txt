It was actually the first movie I saw in a theater, where people did not immediately leave the end credits as soon as they started. They sat for a few minutes, open their mouths in the infinity, trying to understand what they saw. <br /> <br /> The only thing that I can say is: try to watch it as soon as possible in the movie as little knowledge about it (so i)! I gave it a 10
