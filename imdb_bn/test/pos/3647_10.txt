Tweety's SEO, Sylvester has been a stowaway on a cruise ship to carry a confined bird and from being picked up from garbage cans and his owner, Granny. Oh oh! Again, Tweety and Granny get many hurdles in the cat's attempts to get birds. Sylvester also gets seasick several times. And the second time the vessel of the red vessel arrives at the ship's place in any of its vessels, then it replaces it with nitroglycerin. So now Sylvester Fire! I'll stop here and say another nice cartoon directed by this popular cart-and-bird Doara starring Freezing freelancing. Tweety's S.O.S is most highly recommended.
