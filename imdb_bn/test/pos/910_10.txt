How some Hollywood films try and are not practically successful, anyway creates spiritual connections (when they become unreal), this beautiful film perfectly manages (similarly with the same director's 'La Double V De Veronica' and the same beautiful actress) . This is a real movie, which changes the perspective of life a bit - cute and beautiful stories, efficiently operated, excellent master actors, skilled photographer. I only watched the movie during the 3rd or 4th, and still think it's the best one I've seen. And if you want to be dissatisfied with the end of 'white' - 'red' makes the whole triangle happy.
