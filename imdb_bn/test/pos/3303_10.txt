Everything is good Is just everything good? It's different for everyone but most of us love it. But not everyone knows where or where to look for real love. This story goes full gambit looking for love. Sometimes all the wrong places and all the wrong reasons. But not saying, "We are our own ship's captain", and so it goes for our lives. We are responsible for what we like in our lives. Once we have chosen them, we must stay with them. We look at this story and we like this woman that often changing their life often, we wonder, would we like the same women or would we be wise? Who knows?
