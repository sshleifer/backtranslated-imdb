Peter Lorre star as an exceptional excellent guy who immigrated to America this movie. Unfortunately, soon after his arrival, he was burned in a horrible fire and his face horribly. Since he looks so terrible, someone does not want to quell him and desperately go out of frustration, so he has a life of crime to buy a mask to hide his secret and earn enough money. Where you go from the film you will have to look for yourself. <br /> <br /> I did this movie because it is a good movie hack for the money spent on making it. A lot of twists better than the plot to keep it interesting. The film can be a common horror or crime movie, but it offers even more amazing surprises. In addition, Laur's extraordinary performance shows that he is able to do more than just supporting roles. It's a great movie and is distributed more than most of the "A-Pictures" of the day.
