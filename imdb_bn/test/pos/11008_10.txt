Yes !!!! Fascibinder and Belhaus are at the top of their play, in 1973! It's about the same subject, but in my opinion it's a lot better than the Matrix (1999), at least it is 200 times cheaper! Very nice camera work by Michael Ballhaus and at the end wonderful "Albatros" by Fleetwood Mac. Fasibinders are creating very moody tones for the whole picture. It is a shame that the movie was not released on DVD. But after 37 years they finally reached the conclusion that this TV-movie is not one of the best fascinating movies (most of the time, the best phasibindra films are cool), this is a wonderful example for a science-fiction film, without much money. Buy it !! See it !!
