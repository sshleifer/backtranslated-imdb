Because this film is not known to anybody and is more praised because of its subject matter. Due to this controversial issue, this movie has not been released any big and it is still quite unknown. <br /> <br /> Originally it's a movie about a black man with a white man friendship. Friendship does not appear to be compulsory or unrealistic, but it seems to be the real way to portray this movie. We see these different ethnics mingle with each other, as it is completely normal. Unfortunately, in those days it was not considered as normal. When talking to a white girl, seeing a black man and having fun with her as a friend, it seems that its proportion of viewers of 1957 was difficult to keep track of. <br /> <br /> Why you really understand why Sidney Poitier is always so much honored by Hollywood society and generally black community. Of course, one of the reasons why he received the Oscars in 2002 was Oscar. In his film, he often fought against discrimination and as a best example with "Night of Hit In" he often struggled with problems. . A real role model, that certainly has inspired many Afro-American actors today. But he was also a great actor. Yes, he is still alive, but now he seems to have retired completely from the film, because his latest achievement was played since 2001. <br /> <br /> This movie was nominated for Martin Ritt's directorial debut and was not even given too much movie to spend his movie. The studios were largely reluctant because of its concept and / or the first film of that record. Or perhaps it's just because MGM is no longer bigger and it has left its best days behind them. Since Metro-Goldwine-Meyer's 50s were not very famous and were not the fame of making cheap movies, although it was one of the biggest studios in the first few years before it and many acclaimed directors associated with it, who made many award-winning classic movies. Fortunately, their fame began to change again, and when the movie-logo is shown in a movie, people are no longer expected to have a lesser movie. <br /> <br /> However, even its restrictive budget and limited resources they managed to make a great movie out of this one. The film is very simple, only a few characters and a simple plot in it. The film still guides you to catch up with your story and subject, it's never promotional or anything about it. This makes the movie work with its subjects. <br /> <br /> There is really a movie that can be seen. <br /> <br /> 8/10
