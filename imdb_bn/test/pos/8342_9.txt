Dan Burgess is a wonderful guy. She must be a Christian. Dan can not get a date with a girl and thinks that all her friends have all of the fun. He is constantly bothered by unbelievers and being fun. <br /> <br /> Dan pray one night, and he did not believe in Christ. <br /> <br /> Her prayer has been answered. For a day Things get hairy from there. An angel appeared in Dan and explained his prayer is given. So, starting a Christian club Dan had all the effects that <br /> <br /> he friend-friendly Scott Park and made a difference, was deleted for one day. <br /> <br /> Dan's eyes are open. His life did not really make a difference.
