Sincerely a film with John Malkovich is generally very good. And Clint Eastwood, Ren Rousseau, John Mahoney (Fracier), Dylan McDermott (practice), and many other big actors. <br /> <br /> Clint is now old but thanks, he is a great director (thanks) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " (But not for kids).
