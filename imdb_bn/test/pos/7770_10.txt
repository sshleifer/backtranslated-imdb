This picture was great, filled with great musical words that blow your mind away completely. Lorraine Tate, (Darius Lalhaal), "West Deep", was a sharp cat with '06 cheeks and soon he met Waterloo with Nea Long (Nina Mosley), "Big Mom's House", 2000. Nina puts her heart and soul in this role, and when she meets Darius, the spark flies first and then there is a hatred relationship. The actor's entire actor is playing with this comedy, drama and a lot of love and cheating, making it a very entertaining film. It shows the very few movies in the world and at the same time how each person has his life and his fate and how he has kept them in his small corner in this big world. Great Film, Enjoy!
