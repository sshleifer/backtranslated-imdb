It reminds me that the production companies will file suits due to non-delivery. I have been looking for this movie for DVD and VHS for several years. Anyone can get all kinds of movies ... old movies, new movies ... but it targets a particular group. This movie is very nostalgic for many. I'm not sure why I can not get a copy. Maybe enough people will have to write, the copyright holder will get a source. It's about time to make it happen. Yes, it's the date, but it's the Wizard of Oz. It does not seem to be so difficult. So, for now, I will look at many copies of those copies in search engines.
