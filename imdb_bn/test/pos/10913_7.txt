The most fun performance was by Matt Dillon's Supermodel Girlfriend as Shalom Harlow. She was more interesting than all the lead actors. This image got all wrong; Even the most reliable actress of the century, Joan Cucus, was not able to raise the ridicule of this plot. I enjoy hearing "Macho Man" by the village people over off credit. The film can be left to the level of the power to remain.
