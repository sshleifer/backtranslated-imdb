I'm not sure how better it can be, so I gave it 10. The acting was nice - the main woman was so hot - playing Darwin, the chap was a deluded, impressive character that she was experiencing, showing internal instability (an example of the death of the truck driver). The storyline was believable and the length of the series was correct (i love lust, but will it end?). As Brit, I think Inks is a gang. LAPD tried their ill advised to arrest them, but other organizations were positively portrayed. My main thoughts about such programs (and also fantastic 24) - what could this be? What will it be What is happening now Probably, perhaps. <br /> <br /> I hope they will do another series, but after reading some of the previous comments, it will not be displayed. <br /> <br /> To summarize - If you have not seen it, you are not sure.
