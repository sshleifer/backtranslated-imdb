I'll always start by talking about Boney Hunt fan .... He always adds life to any character, and he does a great job of his operated debut. I must admit it is a chick flick ... but remember it's a wonderful story, it touches on many emotions and elicits all kinds of feedback. <br /> <br /> These pictures are like situations illustrated in real life like real life in humans. (If I have to restrict the main part of this movie) <br /> <br /> This is a love story .. Not just a man and a woman, but the love of family, friends, and past love. (Even pets) <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it. Good rental or purchase price
