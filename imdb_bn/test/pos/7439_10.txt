This movie is simply amazing .. Unfortunately there is no shadow in Portugal ... and I agree with a former opinion, only FF fans will actually give the real credits to the movie ... for everyone else .. I dare you to see it. The story is great, and I thought that the game ended, but the screenlists gave a great story to the god of all of us ... Naturally, it came to heaven;) But they are a little narrative of our (fans of our game) beautiful .. The ring tone is The winning song of the song of war, even some patches are very familiar, it's just a great movie, a great story, great Animation ... just a 10/10
