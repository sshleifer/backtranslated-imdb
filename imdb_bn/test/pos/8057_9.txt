To see the fantastic biography "The Fenerric City Story", I claim that American filmmakers have to enter areas that are rarely, director Phil Carlson has been appointed its director on the "cancer-based" The Oscillels TV Mega Hit Series. "City Confidential" And this picture; And it has turned into one of the most acclaimed and most adapted movies ever made. The most notable achievement for US filmmakers seems to be hero-centric-purpose criminal films or TV series; I reminded the audience that "hundreds of coins" and "hardcaster and macrocompatible" and even "untouchable" producers had to work for some production, but the moral opponents were largely devoted to the irrelevant activities of criminals rather than their bases. This powerful, fundamental and great The film has its own style, and its lesson is against the opponents and criminals In addition to being a victim, it seems to attract more attention to the victims of gang members. The film has a twelve-minute opening, in which the reporter Claet Roberts interviewed the original participants of Alabama City, who fought against his corrupt vice-gangs, due to the presence of Fort Bening across the river. Got and the area The Vice-Dense was a long-standing existence of the century, describing the return of John Patterson to Germany, where he was a prosecutor, his father, defeating for the Attorney General of Alabama, refused to join the 14th Street Victor's search, despite the fierce rage of his father's fierce violence. Patterson was the victim of his torture. There are several developed-developed characters, including Eli, who is one of the clubs and his honest boyfriend, the syndicate leader, Patterson and the wife of John, Ed Gaze, Victor's employee and Jack Ward, an honest black man. Harry Newman's cinematography and Stanley Fleischier's art directive are in B / W and it is like many movies that add realistic power to the film. Harry Sucaman's song effectively contributes to the film. Writer Daniel Mainvering and Crane Willber created an instant and readable story that is divided into sections. The section represents the empire of Vicolds from within their clubs, which shows the fate of the victim and the police picked him up at Mobarak's salary. In the second part, Albert Patterson Mab refused to oppose Tanner's leader in intelligent chariots. In the third quarter, Patterson returned and after several incidents he decided to beat his chief gun, and to revenge his rebellion, he decided to run his father for the state's attorney general. His wife is scared; And Mob Jack wakes up the ward's daughter and dumps the body at Patterson's house and warns his children with the latest caution. Some incidents have occurred with some incidents that prove the Patterson people, in which the car was caught due to small killings, and satisfied with Patterson, the investigation found that his death had occurred. Run, and he won democratic state nomination despite Mob's statist tactics - and was immediately killed. John Patterson stopped an alarming crowd to start an open fight with the 14th Street crowd and call the capital using their voices and claim military laws for Fenry City. The clubs are closed and the equipment is seized, but the girl is not murdered by a gangster inside and Patterson has to stop her by Jake Ward for killing Tanners instead of providing her with the law. Drama finishing enthusiasm; But the progress for the city is less sanguine than the drawings; Actually the people went back to Tennessee trying to come back. In this good acting class of criminal films, Richard Killy is young but very powerful like Paterson, playing it without utterance. John McIntire is very good as his father, and Edward Andrews is qualified as Bose Tanner. Among others, the girl included Katrina Grant, Eli, Jean Karson and Kathi Marlow as Mobarra Woman, John Lara as his hooliganism, as James Huntsman's young victim, James Edwards as Jake Ward, John's Wife as Ladyka Peterson and some good-character actors as townsmen and mob bosses . I strongly advise to say good news about reality and the lack of posting in this film; It's certainly one of the best directors efforts of Phil Carlson. Carlson also did "Walking Tall" after "The Scarf Mobile". The credibility of the people's confidence in the public interest can be frustrating and how easily some honest men can learn the need to fight for their rights, an honest and inspirational look.
