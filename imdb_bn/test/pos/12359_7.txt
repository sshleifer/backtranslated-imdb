Once, in Sweden, there was a poor Salvation Army sister. At the door of death, he requested, "Send for David Holmes!" However, Victor Szstrom (as David Hall) can not be found, because he spent the past year on New Year's Eve in a graveyard with his alcoholic friends. After posthumous sister Astrid Holm (edited) last year, wanted to see whether Mr. Szstrom prayed for the soul; Well, it's not. In the graveyard, the story of Sajism "The Phantom Carriage", which he heard from his dead friend Tore Svenberg (George). According to legend, the last person who dies every year must be able to accept the souls of the dead, until they are released from the day before the new year. <br /> <br /> Director Seismstra, whose leadership performance is very strong, combined with photographer Julius Jaenzon to create an eye-catching fascinating film. The great "double exposure" effect is frequently used, but does not seem overdone; And, it does not make other dramatic highlights of the film less memorable (for example, Szstrom's knit coat and the letter's leakage of the door). Perhaps you are not able to do the story of Selma Leysloff, or do not want to rush in the 1920s - which may be the reason for the end of this film to be frustrating. And, contrary to the same spiritual story, thinking very carefully about what is happening in your "Kurekelen", it is difficult to suspend your unbelief. <br /> <br /> ******* KÃ¶rkarlen (1/1/21) Victor Szstrakht ~ Victor Szstrom, Hilda Bargstrom, Tore Svenberg
