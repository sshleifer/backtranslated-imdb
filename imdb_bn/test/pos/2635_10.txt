This is a fine example of greatness which is 80's entertainment in the movie. Oh do not make me wrong, music sucked back then. I just like the metal band from the 80s. There was something that the band had to say. Forget that small keyboard shit and the 'life is awesome and I want to die' garbage. But the best of 80's best movies are the best. They were all stupid and just having a good time. That's the example of this movie! Party! Get naked! Get laid! WOOOOOOOOHOOOOO!
