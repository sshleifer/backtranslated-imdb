Mulholland Drive again proves that the master of the expression of David Lynch cinematography. During the screening last night I saw a brilliant addition to the history of the movie. Performance is fantastic, score entry, and photography is mesmerizing. In a unique and stunning cinematic experience, many elements of film making are unable to afford David's power. As I saw Mullholland Drive I could not help but with David Linch this world we realized that we are truly blessed. The film also favored David Lynch's movies, we have shown that a person's view can be realized through stunning results. We understand that blockbusters are not the only way. We understand that the true movie artist has got a chance in this world and in that we actually got a blessing.
