Taylor Huckford wanted to make this film for 15 years and eventually played the title role of Jamie Fox. Ray Charles Foxx in his screenplay is amazing. In an interview with Fox, he met Charles several times and also played piano together among them (Foxx had a piano reading as a small child and actually played piano in all his scenes). I did not see Charles until the next year, so it was very nice to have a look on how his career improved. I hope Fox will be nominated for Best Actor Oscar because he is definitely worthy of it. Music, also, incredible - it really shows a wide range of Charles music, blues from the country, and everything in between. The film gives an unsupported description of Ray Ray's life, from many women related to her drug addiction and its consequences.
