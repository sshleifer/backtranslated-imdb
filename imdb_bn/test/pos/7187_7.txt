This movie is even better than "Asterix and Obelix Conte Caesar", but it is far from perfect. Comic book adaptation is good, some movies and movies like dialogue book. But the film was created in 1968 without getting released as an animated film. For example, fighting between Nimarbis and Amonobhis It was not necessary or even credible for a little love story of Asterix. Some things like animated movies and some other things were missing ... I was cheated by the movie because the things they saw were cutting and they showed things I did not want or need to see. I know that the film must have been very difficult to film in comparison to the comic book or animated film, but what I was hoping for. In conclusion, even if the movie is good, I still like animated movies, in my opinion, a lot better.
