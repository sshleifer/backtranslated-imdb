It seems that Rob Robop writer Vendetiker has been looted. This is a very difficult horror / action movie about a man who is in an accident used in cruel experiments. Rabakop saw anyone who saw the story. See for palm gears as a wicked and pig good looking killer. Not everyone likes this highly effective, violent, and bloody horror movie, but this Canadian outing is worth finding someone who supports this genre. 8/10
