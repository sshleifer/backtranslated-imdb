The box I've ever seen is one of the weird movies. To illustrate my experience, let me use this photo picture: Imagine that you do not see anything on pinky stick and paint smoking for last month but Twilight Zone repeats. As a result, a coma takes you to the hospital, where the nurse is being attacked by Adrenaline in your IV. Your dream will be something like this movie. <br /> <br /> A man shows the couple's door. He gives them a box with a button. Click the button, they get one million dollars in cash and a person who does not know will die. I will not try to lend anything, but things from there go into a plot that is complex and complex and completely realistic that it will ask you your sanity. But hey, most of us are now satisfied for a while, and the change is good. PROS: Wonderful story, played well overall, it's not slow after it's gone once. It asks questions of human morality which is rarely asked in popular culture. Deep in this movie, it has the meaning. The special effects of summer blockbuster are not fluffy (there is nothing wrong with this); This movie was a relatively low budget and it was shown in some places. But I think this is probably one of the things that I like it very much. Cons: What was going on for the first 20 minutes was really slow. At the end of the movie, you will be so confused that you just have to sit down and remember for a good half hour. I can make sure that the movie will not get a rave reviews from your colleagues or critics; It's a bit weird and there is no explosion in every three seconds. Actually there is no type of explosion in this movie (besides popping by trying to understand exactly what the hack of your brain is right). Personally I do not think it's a bad thing, but it will be a lot. <br /> <br /> RATING: Easily a 9/10. I did not have an experience like watching this movie. The only reason I could not give it a 10/10 is that it wrapped up itself very much. Here are some of the major things that are still invisible that are still written here, because I am writing here. But overall, I had the best experience at the movie theater for most of the time. But be careful, if you can not sit back, you do not like this movie, turn around 150% suspension suspension, and prepare your brain to make some impressive acrobatics. <br /> <br /> www.
