'Is it not film' works because it is true that what it is trying to say is true. If you ignore the mobility of the plot and focus on the message, then you will see Michael as your own character. Whether we are men or women, we all came to a point in our life where we look back and want to reconstruct a situation or relationship. Do we really feel like? What was wrong Michael's desire to find Grace is completely selfish. More than anything, he wants to feel better about himself how things turned out. But even, he is a sympathetic character because every relationship is selfish. We will not be among them otherwise. After the movie is over, I'm not sure whether Michael learned something new about himself. Our best gauge on the relationship is through his friend, Nadia. He reminds me of the spirit of the movie and the two aspects of each of our stories. I found Michael out of lunatic, arrogant, and just found in the Padma. Why I like him just fine. She is a real character. If you ever want to go back and analyze the previous relationship, it's a movie for you. Off, it's a film for everyone.
