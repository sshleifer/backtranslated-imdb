Eisenstein's first sound film restored the Battle of Ice in 1242, when Russians defeated the Levinoian under Alexander Nevsky, taking interest in Russia under Roman Catholicism. Created in 1938, Nevsky can be seen as a part of the promotion: Germanic plays, their sinner (and a few hidden) helmets are clearly meant for the Nazis. During the Russian city entry, the slaughterhouse by knights appears to be a predictive warning of the massacre of World War II. The film ends with a warning: Those who came to Russia with the sword will be killed by the sword. Creates fine black and white paint (a bit of daguerreotype), it returns to the official side of Eisenstein. At the end of the 1920s, Stalin wanted to stop filming the Soviet filmmakers and made films that are more popular and runaway by the Russian public. It closed the lawsuit of Russian lawmakers and returned to Nevsky with his more accessible film. Nevsky's strong point is in its second half, which shows war itself and it is only seen as the milestone in the history of film: Sometimes (and probably not later) a battle in the screen will be so vivid. Another powerful point is Prokofiev's beautiful, hunting soundtrack (it was completely unusual using a musician to score a movie). One of his weak points: Comic Relief (two Sartanans trying to hide a beautiful Russian farmer of Russian warriors) are really blurred.
