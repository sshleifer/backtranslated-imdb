After reading this book, I was more open to the new director in this new film to give new directors new means of their medium (which is not the film, "not in reprint" in the letter). I'm happy that the Holocaust that happened in Russia (and its neighboring countries) finally got some attention. The Nazis were particularly cruel to the Russians and the Russian Jews. If you read the history and see the memnasks and memories created in the neighborhood, then you can understand this movie and why they kept silent while talking. <br /> <br /> It was certainly time for Chronicle and I hope that more stories will come out of this. Now appropriate.
