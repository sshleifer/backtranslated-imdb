This is a very moving movie about life. A disabled person has to face a country in which the fulfillment is expected, and it is hoped that it brings all in front. Great things of society should teach us that we are all human beings, and some of us are gifted with mind, heart and healthy body, there are some people among us who are not fortunate, unfortunate ones. We do not always see the beauty of the world because we are confused with our 'blind' ambitions and it is only in one light that "what can this world do for me !!!". Maybe we all want radio, loving happy people ... everyone loves.
