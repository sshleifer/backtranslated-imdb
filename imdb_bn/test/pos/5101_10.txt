I was first released at the first movie theater, when it was first released, because there were few commentators. It's really a treasure. I have not seen any other version to be justified, Mr. Chips and I do not want to. To me it stands as a perfect version. I first saw it TCM years ago and have not forgotten it. I was glad to see my girlfriend this yesterday, even though I recorded it before TCM days. There were some parts of the movie, in which we were both tear-ids, it's actually a moving movie <br /> <br /> and which movies are not for this? <br /> <br /> Beautiful, the film was shot surprisingly. The acting is top notch. And the story is fine and timeless. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite movies all the time.
