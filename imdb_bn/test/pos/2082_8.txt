This is a great small movie, full of interesting characters and situations. Although not in the same class as some well-known film of its time, it is still very visible and memorable. The scene where Zacharie Scott, who was sitting on the bus, unexpectedly steals the pilot pin from the coat lapel in his seat, horrible. It nicely defines its character - a person who is so low, he will pay some priceless value of the war experience to use as a proportion of his surroundings. The situation is undoubtedly false and the women of Fenchari's family are captured by their unexpected kisses and smiles of the murderer. <br /> <br /> I could not think of capitalizing this movie successfully. Mildred Pierce's Scott and Bruce Bennet were once again grouped, and Faye Emerson was consistent with Joan Crofford with his face bone structure and big eyes. Also, the character of Monna Freeman is not unlike the strange part of Melredrade Pierce. <br /> <br /> I agree with the previous comment that the end of this film was very thin, "a cliff for Roni was hit with a convenient advantage." In the final scene, we see Braty Mona Freeman together with a former lover for the old, smooth junky skirt. I think the script should be disciplined for her behavior and her sister should call her for cruelty, it is Instead of behaving like a normal teenage period, but it is otherwise enjoyable and orderly cine Small errors may reduce.
