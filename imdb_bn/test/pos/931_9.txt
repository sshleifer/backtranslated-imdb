And there is not much in movie history. "Rouge" seems to be a bit of a hope. Hope mankind and life. But only to say that could be naive. Kieslowski could find the right way to tell that confused judge and story of 20th century but wise model. Perhaps that old and frustrating love relationship will not be repeated - after the accident the young judge has a new couple. But what about the master of the camera? You can not miss the second of the film because you will have to face everyone. Kieslowski is quite clear that the way people love and behave in camera actors. Mrs. Jacob and Mr Tringintant are perfect. It's not just this movie, but "story of love" and "love story" that you can think of in contemporary movies like an artist's point of view. PT American public - average one- can not see these films. At least they are not in the maltin dictionary. And even baseline did not know what to say about this unique man. Abel posadas
