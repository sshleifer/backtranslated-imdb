This word was really a deep moving movie in every sense. I was a Mormon missionary myself and I wanted to finish my mission first but at the same time I was gay who was hiding. The character was like Haroon, sent home to find and isolate me, but the only scourge of Catholic family was not as shameful as it was for the main character. This movie really took me back in those days and helped me understand, a few years later, I had a family that accepted me and realized what I was going to do. After finding refuge in Lilar's restaurant, Harun and Christian, while praising each other, I commended myself to the completion of a movie. I was really moved to tears. I highly recommend this movie to those who announce this review and it will definitely buy a buy.
