It's a very enjoyable, fluffy, glamorous musical of 40's. The 'cover girl' genre made Heaven (formerly dark haired Latin Seri√®re margarita casinos) as a miracle, all American stars. It is sure to be the genius of genie Kelly as a dancer, singer, actor and dancer. It depicts the superiority and color of musical instruments. <br /> <br /> Rita Heyworth is awesome like Rusty Parker - it's her picture, and her presence is always in front. He is singing, but his dance is absolutely brilliant and he combines very well with Kelly. I think Rita was very low as an actress - she played pretty well every single scene here. Gene Dance wrote a series of screenplays (he originally gave almost complete creative freedom here), and his 'Ulter Ego' dance number was amazing. Such as artistry Study-out tunes 'Make way for tomorrow', 'Keep me tested', and, of course, 'long ego and far away'. The plot is rather slim, yet it is a moral. It is about the reputation of fast fame and fast money, and how these happiness will end in a happy outcome. It will encourage you, pick up your legs and laugh. She said, 'cover girl' is not the greatest music ever produced - it has many errors that should be resolved. Someone can say that Phil little bit of Silver is beyond a long way. Its character gets rather tired quicker. However, I was influenced by how her dance ability and she can keep up with Jean and Rita. Another big problem is that many songs are not only great. The 'cover girl' number looks fantastic, but I'm not a fan of songs or songs. 'Poor Tom' is a huge downer. I think this is one of the worst digits I've heard yet in the 40's 50's. It's unpleasant. Ladder sub-plot boundaries on ridiculous But that's only my opinion. Others may like this content. However, in addition to its results, it is a very, very good movie, today's product is much better than most stores. Dancing and singing are excellent, production value is excellent, and its mentality is contagious. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
