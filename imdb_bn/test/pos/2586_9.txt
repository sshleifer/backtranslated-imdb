Just got back to see the black snake Moon. I spent time reading reviews ... Most of the time clearly focused on ... "Skinny white girl swims in a black man's radiator" ... "Critics" I hate if I miss the point of the film. Now I think it helps to live in Memphis ... and lived in Mississippi several times. This can also help the former director of Clarksdale's Delta Blues Museum ... but I found this movie. Brawer's simple "release story" is easy to follow and stories can have different themes ... but I believe it is very influential as a "blues". It is my hope that people will not read all the promotions ... and / or different reviews ... and miss a good movie. Get skinny girls in white panties with different things ... Justin Timberlake to get past, his character Ronnis (which he plays very well) ... ... get "snake on a plane" and see how Samuel came. Jackson ... he made himself a very credible Mid-South Blues man. If you know something about Mid-South culture, you can strike as many Cartoonists ... but Craig Briver says how the canvas draws the actors how the story will tell and you will enjoy this movie. There is no one to say the last word ... so watch this movie ... and yes I got the right of critics agreed ... the music is awesome!
