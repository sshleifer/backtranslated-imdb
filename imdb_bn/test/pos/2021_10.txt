Because of Mark Wahlberg, this is the first and foremost film I love, and for the second reason it supports the finances. There is something about this movie which gives you breath and feel the feeling of feeling. Jane Aniston is great as this movie girlfriend. It focuses on Rockstorm Lifestyle that came back to many hardcore rocky days (probably on this day they just got smart). It takes through a floor of emotions and there are many subtle aspects that allow through the light. Like a diamond, this movie shines. You will not waste your popcorn this one. Semi-chick Flick but my husband is very enjoyable. Some smiles are thrown too much.
