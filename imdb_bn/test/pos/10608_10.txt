I've just finished seeing MÃ©rigold and I'll say I found this DVD blockbuster shelf. While Ali Larter's picture was my attention while traveling around to search for something new, from the appearance of it, I thought clothes There was a little above. And then I saw the cover of other Indians and it seemed like it was a kind of camouflaged movie or something like that. <br /> <br /> When I returned to the compilation section and saw Salman Khan, I took double. Salman Khan in an American film with Ali Larter in a blockbuster DVD? Because Salman Khan is like Hollywood movies like Mel Gibson in Bollywood movies, because I had high hopes for this film: it was good! Marigold is a great movie I am very happy! <br /> <br /> I think a movie, when you have an appropriate script, a talented, experienced, knowledgeable and goal oriented director, what will happen, playing two incredible actors. Cast and crew supporting lead role and just a very difficult task! There's really great chemistry with Khan and Larter, and both are shining on the big screen: they look really good together. The number of musical instruments was not bad at all, which was astonishing, how were the songs of Chess and long Indian films in these days. And you'll be happy to know what you'll be happy as you can. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the film was gradually in the middle, the scenes were good, Claymax's leading was pretty dramatic, but it was just awesome! I have a few gripes and complaints about DVDs, however. Although I like the absence of the DVD's widescreen look, I do not like the fact that much more has been omitted from the DVD. In the beginning, there are no subtitles. Now English is my first language, it's not a problem. However, when Indian actors and actresses made some speeches, it was difficult to understand what they were saying. Captioning helped. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I would appreciate in DVDs is that it is like a blooper reel or outcake collection. And ultimately, how about the features of a menu which will allow us to release the right of musical numbers? Man, some songs were really good! Next to the flip, I enjoyed watching Marigold while watching it. <br /> <br /> There is more to me about the extraordinaryness of this picture and how much I liked, but I have no time and no matter what I want it to write for what I have enjoyed it for? I hope Salman Khan will do more Hindi films as well as his Hindi movies and I certainly hope this Hindi film will not be the last Bollywood film of Ali Larter. And the director encourages Salman Khan, Ali Larter and other big names to continue the Bollywood hybrids of the actor - just make sure the scripts are real and good. <br /> <br /> 10/10 - It's a great love story that your whole family can enjoy!
