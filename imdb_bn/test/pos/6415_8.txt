* Small Speaker * <br /> <br /> Which of today's original and inspirational film makers requires a proof of Sasi Ming-liang? See this picture. <br /> <br /> Works with little change in the theme of most of the work, HOLE presents a study of isolation and loneliness - in this case, a man and woman who are above / below neighbors - and various structures of modern (real or Emotional) closes each other. Here, the woman (neighboring neighbor) tries to bear her apartment as a flood from a huge leak from above. When trying to detect the source of a plumber problem, then the floor disappeared after creating a big hole. Already detached and frustrating (some residents of both the Housing Housing projects who did not escape before a mysterious, near-mysterious epidemic). The two apartments work as one of the first growing long lines in the linked holes, but soon began to take a significance of the near-mythological proportions. <br /> <br /> Tsai's humor, and the history of the movie are displayed with a little more pressure than the normal sense - for example, when the musical number (set in the music of Grace Chang's music) is visible on the woman around her surrounding neighboring surroundings, Which explodes from the curtains on sensual, romantic romances and short bits of humor - big screen from the haywen Enasana quite memorable. And for all the ennui and isolation in the exhibition here, in the late 90s, the excitement of the former millennium is funny, weird, and this film gives an extremely interesting strangulation. The final scene is amazing. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Shuai - usually fashion - most of the usual expectations or revelations, mostly retreaters, are illiterate, unexpectedly directing Asian movies with direct perception, they focus on irrational tendencies. Most of the human minds, and mundanities are absolute. Almost everything about his character is lacking in stagnant, stagnant stagnation, retreating or the most cultural signers (which enhances the characteristic of characters), which makes HOLE - and its other movies - rather rather inhuman, but always attractive and intuitive.
