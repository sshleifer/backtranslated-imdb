I was unfamiliar with this picture, until I recently included it in a list of the top 20 spaghetti Westerns (I followed the marathon, created the last few weeks of the novel); But it was auspicious that the film had to be launched almost immediately on the Italian TV late night (for the first time, I was sure for a good year!) Unfortunately, the reception of its cable reception in the channel that was unfortunately not released recently: I recorded the film in VHS, but I decided not to keep it because of this factor; As it happened, the next day I saw the movie, I was available in a Region 2 DVD in Italy (featuring an interview with unforgettable scriptwriter Ernesto Gastei) - and was impressed enough, I decided to order it there and then even if I I knew I was not coming to DVD, for a while I had to watch a movie and some later Ekhara would allow! Here's a short bracket: When I recently bought a spot of Spaghetti Westerns in Italian DVD, I did not decide to order Sergio Solima's Face Efse (1967), because I thought it was a bone bone; However, I only learned that the disc actually has an interview with the director (i purchased) [1 966]. I think that Solima will not make similar contributions to the DVD version of her film, when she was actually considered as a face facade for her favorite work (yet another Solima Spaghetti Blue Underground Zone 1 disk included in director's talent bay was Western-run, Man, Run [1968]); The problem is that I love so much that I watched through Facebook via Face Effect through the recording of Italian TV! I have now ordered the movie's DVD - especially it has been discontinued - but I talked about the second aspect of the price of electricity (even though the disc comes in, I can test the interview of Solaima) ... <br /> <br /> Well, Rant over: The film was reviewed under Spaghetti Western and it is very interesting, really ambitious, which is JF in the old West setting. The transfer of the case! In fact, it was a memorable opening of Anthony Man's Teaser Black-and-White Thriller The Tale Target (1951) - which then tried to kill the life of U-at-life. President Abraham Lincoln It is one of the most popular Italian stars of this sub-genre Giuliano Joma, which is perhaps the most influential Western role (most of her many films have light-hearted patterns). Supporting cast contains at least one of the most notable information: Van Johnson (among some of its few and mainly undefined Italian films) In the Civil War Dallas and Fernando Rei were killed as head of the southern conspiracy - those who were just blackmailed by the Blackmail Plate but easily new American leader Johnson Vice President! <br /> <br /> Benito Stefenelio has created a good impression like a corrupted Sheriff that follows Gemma through the film, and with which he was involved in darkness in the dark - the guns rest with the floor and cigar cigar compared to their respective holsters. Room is the only light! Also included as Ram Sander's Black Saddick, which eventually destroys the image of "Lee Harvey Oswald". Stevevo Macei - who is later working as a majority of the director of Polizotaceae - behind the film's bright cinematography; Likewise, Luis Enrique Baclov has yet another amazing "euro-cast" score - which is quite different from the style of Enio Michron, which is also very different. Valerii's direction may be motto as imposing as another Spaghetti Western here but he effectively operates efficiently (the final gunfight is specifically done nicely); The film must be one of the more included entries in the subgenre and for this, the innovation of the plot line should be one for it ...
