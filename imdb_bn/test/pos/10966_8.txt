It ended with the announcement that "the picture you saw is a reformative" - ​​once you think of an emojiation, it was foolish to think that once there was a good movie, and the talent of the caste ... was again surprised. Of course, Cassavates told some people that it is not really a reform every time after his death, so ... it is a light-black black woman, Lelia, who has passed for white and her family: the name of the white brother named Ben and the black black named Hughir Brother When he fell in love with a white jarring named Tony, he was amazed at the surprise of his surprise, and he asked to know about the personal desires and losses of the three main characters from there. Hui, a jazz singer in the process of failure, Lelia was still frustrated with Tony, and Ben was extraordinary and generally fierce, with a somewhat frustrating need to disappoint him beyond the miraculous design of his existence. Overall, I think it's really about mankind versus stasis instead. I suspect that the casavets were adequately organized, and this was just the dialogue which was justified. The dialogue itself is very incapable - sometimes someone will say something very memorable, another time it's memorablely strange. What is amazing is the posing of amateur actors of their actors Cassavetes she decided to shade when she went through the acting class, whispered into the ears of ten best students, and this result ... Ben and Hughie playing guys are very good. At first I do not like Lelia, but as you progress with the film, you see a lot more, he is one of the actors who gets better by creating tension and drama - not the best with little talk. Shadow was praised as the pioneer of the Indo-film movement (made in 1959) and it is definitely recommended.
