Like a middle-aged mother, I am very grateful to see the romance of adults growing among the many problems that affect us. <br /> <br /> Diane Lan adriana beautifully portrayed and his mother tongue and conflict that wants to do the right thing for his children, still enjoys a happy life. <br /> <br /> I'm not the fan of Big Richard Gere, but he always works well with a person who is a quarrel, but he can learn something about himself. <br /> <br /> While criticizing their romance as low as romantic, romance is hardly justified. When Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman fall in love with traveling around Australia, only a conversation occurs among them, it is considered to be high romance. We get a lot more with Rodenthe here. She redeems him. She set her free. It's nice <br /> <br /> They share the deepest insecurities, teach emotions emotionally. How long does it take irrelevant? Perhaps this film was very fine that the relationships they shared in the following years deepened them - another real-life time-honored way to know a person. <br /> <br /> As I enjoyed the plot and theme, the conversation was not consistently consistent. Some lines are so true, and the other lines were embarrassing trite and flat. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Adrian's teenage daughter and her best friend, reminds us that there are many types of love, not just romantic love. <br /> <br /> It is not light romantic comedy, a romantic drama. It has a very relaxed pace that could very slow to consider. <br /> <br /> The beach is a wonderful job of the industry. See Driftwood bench in the first verandah in the pan - it's very nice. I enjoyed music and scenery, which combined to create the impact of position as the third main character. This place was far from their regular life, which allows them to see themselves and each other different. <br /> <br /> If you are old enough to grasp these themes and are in the mood for good tears - Find Kleenex and enjoy this movie.
