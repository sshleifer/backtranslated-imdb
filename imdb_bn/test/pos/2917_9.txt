After reading all the comments on this photo, I am surprised to publish the full-screen recovery version in DVD on Fox's unwillingness. Yes, the history can be a bit obscure and it is not as strong as the book, but it was made by Fox in the second film that was made in Real Scenescope and only qualified to reproduce and distribute production prices. I saw this picture in second grade and it has created an interest in my life in Egypt, 4 years ago I came to Egypt in Egypt! Imagine the power of the film with the imagination of kids, Ah? In the high school, I read the book and pledged my dream trip to one day. Now, this movie was originally made in the "old school" style, which meant that the Egyptians were represented by pink skin and blue-eyed lamps. However, did anyone see the current HBO series "Rome"? All of the old ones are old again. Why can not we imagine this day and age that actors often acting like the Mayfair noblemen in the Roman dragon are acting. An actor in Rome could pass an ancient Italian. It is said that the Amarna era of Egypt is still one of the most interesting events in human history. This movie is very interesting (borrowing a word from NEFER) for its historical information (very free! IRNN!) And its excellent cinematography and scores. I have a terrific Taiwan DVD version that I repeatedly pray over the fact that one day the true restored WideScreen version will be available. For anyone else interested in this topic I highly recommend the historic novel "God Against God" by author and consent writers. If anyone knows if you have movie buffs out, please ask me for Fox to request them!
