I have seen this photo in a while and I can only recommend viewing it. It was about 90 minutes long and when it was over, I felt it could go for hours. The theatrical stories are so realistic and you really feel at home. Movies is basically a dialog but I was not bothered for a minute. Really 18 different characters and each of them has done very well. I used to smile, felt senseless, was sad and still felt happiness. Above all, it is a film that shows different types of people in our society, how they communicate and how love changes, and these days are managed as economic things. Dating became something very similar to a myth. The whole audience loved it. So if there is a possibility, then see it. You'll love it!
