The elegant Universe brings light to the universe and the existence of many ideas. After viewing this documentary, nobody can help but to take a step back and rectify their views on everything in its existence. On both side of the string theory there is a big cast of scientists, mathematicians and others. It is constantly untested, untestable, and perhaps brought to the question as the dead wrong. Anyone who gives the closest explanation to any way to convert is that quantum physics, a set of mathematical ideas that give a good estimate of sub-atomic particles, did not make a false prediction. Not so with string theory; Many do not want to say, on-camera, that string theory is true, and so does, maintaining a certain respectable distance from the piece issue.
