Indeed, when I went to see this movie in the plainfield Indiana Rave theater, I did not expect much. I went to this movie because I thought it was a WD movie, it would be good for a laugh. Then I sat down and saw why I chose Glenn Jacobs (Why) to play Jacob Goodnight. Perhaps he is one of the most horrific people on the Big Screen (my opinion is more bad than Freddy or Jason) and this is a big advantage for other movies which attracts me in a scary movie. It looks like anyone in the house of Jacob the good night. He has a heart, no matter how rolled and vague. He feels pain, which Jason never does or something to show. Although he feels sad and pleasure again you will notice that both of you are crazy when you see the movie. After all, I have a different experience of my opinion than many bow, and it surprises me in some ways, as if living up to the end.
