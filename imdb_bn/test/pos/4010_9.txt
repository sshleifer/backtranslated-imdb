My favorite show all the time! Yes, I thought it was very cool, and Larisa Oleicik was the first crush I ever had (AAAAWWWWW). It was well written, funny - when it wanted to be serious, and overall it was simply a great display. But we could not take Nick, because after February 1996, I could not see any episode, and I probably had to think more than this event. To me it's a pestilence that is not going to say "goodbye" to someone in your love (now does not look correct!), And you will never see them again. And I still think, since I know that there is no plan to publish it in DVD any time ... Yes, life means! I'm sure it has been found (though you can find a weird episode here or there ... but I do not ever like the fake copy of stuff) <br /> <br /> So my sad life: (. .. Most children in the 7th class do not need power like Alex, their life has to be (existential - definitely), but again, how many cities have such a very bad chemical plant that are willing to "do any p There is something for this progress in the progression "? This show was fun to watch! Although I would agree Diaglos a bit better (and sometimes even slightly politically correct), when my favorite part was to kids" Tom Clancy Rainbow Six "(after no year I was probably hiding it in a series series for the same reason) a version of a child (such as a video tapes or something like that) broke the plant. Late! Then you've got a "safety team" trying to find "baby from accident" ... a very meaningful friend (at least when I saw the first show ... they seem to be more sympathetic now). Feeling sad for Olegin, it is not sure whether this type of role is considered by him or her ..... But <br /> <br /> "24" from A Aaron Peirce is also a school here As a coach or something .... b Or cool! "24" can be the producer of this exhibition to get Larisa next season. I just picked it up 'cuz jack boar my other tv hero and i just want to see the cross-over thing, lol :). Both have been set in California, so I will not dream ... I can see this now, "Let me stay with this suspect for a few minutes ... No, I do not need a car battery!"
