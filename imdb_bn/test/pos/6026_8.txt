I came across the last stop in a video store one day and it was selling for only $ 2. I decided to try it and buy it. It was quite good, I enjoyed it. The story was mostly found somewhere in the cabin somewhere, due to a fierce storm in some place somewhere. A police officer, Nancy, her ex-girlfriend, two brothers are going to jail, an old man and her lover, a black man and a couple's couple owned by the couple, and their reincarnated son that never speaks. Suddenly some killings are found and a bag full of cash is available. Everyone is a suspect. The Last Stop is a fantastic good thriller, I'll give it 8/10
