What Bergman has got here? "All these bad things in Sweden will happen to beautiful people like us?" With the Swedish language in Swedish, he was known in Swedish locations (and used by real Swedish military vehicles), which he knew in almost every other country in the European region, from the film of war - which he gave us is all confusing. Attack and counter-attacks, political lies, internal camps, faked confessions, short executions, torture, turncoats, "associates", etc. As a modern short story, it was completed in abstract, with no real name, city or country used. But the strongest group is "Nazi": they roam freely and wear some shiny knee boots. One even whips things with a riding crop (okay, it's actually a rattan). Rosenberg named after the victim couple Along with shame, they can find the tricky way to survive - and they will not do what they did? - Does the above all suggest that the title clearly refers to the true similarity of Stockholm to Nazir. In fact, what we have shown is that Sweden may have seen something that wanted to know more than German mining. <br /> <br /> The first half plays like a black comedy. We saw "fog of war" from the point of view of a playful couple who ignored soldiers around them, long coal, bombings, news reports, and c. They do not even bother to find a work radio. They are "not back to my backyard" final. They talk about wine and linberberry; Already friends are curiously curated and the number of soldiers is displayed in the city. They have not shown any curiosity about the ongoing battle around them for many years. <br /> <br /> People (von Saido) are Sanskrit, Salki and a navel-gazer; Female (voiceman) is somewhat emotional, sensual, and outward appearance. A beautiful scene in which people talk about his violin: the creator, he fought brutally, battled Napoleon war, but his own interest closed with cultural handmade in his hand - or more accurately, which owned its own warm feelings, and that Ownership Assumption Security Do not backyard my house! But when the war spreads to their disguise at the end, then the man's fatality, in good time, becomes irritation, liability, for which he ends - often in cases - such as Bergman is seen continuously and neatly. The price is definitely worth seeing.
