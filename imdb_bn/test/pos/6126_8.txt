What about "Pink Flamingos"? It may not be out of criticism or even explained because it really is like any other movie you've seen. You can get it, or you do not, laugh at it or hate (or both) roll your eyes. John Waters is a comical film maker (kept it low), mixing innocent, little comedies with a sudden attacking moment ... Well, who knows what his purpose was. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " It's like the small rivals forming its conspiracy. Certainly everyone enjoyed such things in some ways, but the subject of penance was not the title "The Philosophical Perseverance Alive". How to create a movie for watching movies for me, which creates radioactive, self-contained environments and does not allow you to enter the fun moment. His films are completely safe with each other. For example, when Cotton tells the father that she does not want to enter her town because crackers are bringing her "lady friend" to the trailer, the babies respond to an intelligent reminder and conspiracy him, saying, "The little shade is just perfect ..." at this moment , We still do not know that crackers take away their "lady friend" in her naked body to snatch a live chicken piece And cotton does not show orgasm through a cat, but this oddity is quite common and Waters understands by the characters in the fantasy world of the corrupt world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The first time we saw them, from the scene of a scene from Chaning's basement in Water Koneyan's soft office Strongly shakes, where we see that there are two women, one is dead and one is alive and the P *** ed is closed. Susan is not a victim of a cry, but she is very angry and abusive towards Chelsea, to launch a full-scale verbal attack on her prison. They both have a strange burden on the wicked situation, and she does not feel so much scared for her kidnapping because she is violently humiliated and godly mad. Channing does not leave her in her eyes for a second, and two scenes that show their confusing banner, is that two comic highlights of the film. Later on, when the film, the Divine and the crackers enter the house of Marbles and finds the abducted woman to commit to their bases, then represents the total lack of support for the brand of the helplessness of the Divine and her family, which are intimidated by Markels - there is something in which the Divine is unfamiliar, its new rival Made by corruption, and he hates it. Moreover, things do not seem like a kidnapper when the Divine doubled, she is angry that girls are being kept there and happily releases them, they reap the revenge by Channing, making them happy. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the glass spectrum, Waters sometimes reminds us of the line between his imaginary imaginary world and the "real" world. For the first time we look at someone who scoffs at a small character named Sandi Sandstone, who never heard of the Divine. On the other hand, Cookie responds appropriately by evaluating Divila's title as "alive living alive", she has revealed that she is also realistic and intelligent in this world. <br /> <br /> Player must say something about their respective role, especially the Divine, which will not miss a note. He is not disappointed in the ridiculous costume and character he once gave, and it accepts a new level or a strange "pinky flamingos". People really believed that there was such a Divine in real life, and why it is easy to understand, because while watching the film, you are not actually thinking about the movie, you are thinking about these people. Since they are doing really terrible scripts in the script, you start thinking that this is not a story but a diverse documentary. <br /> <br /> But more, "Pink Flimings" is not so much a movie as it is an event, or something that happens to you. Although its shock value has gone for me most of the time (I mostly say because ** a hole scene and chicken scene still makes me vince), I still found this movie funny and habit-forming.
