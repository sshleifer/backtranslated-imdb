I basically saw it in the UK on its premiere. I was mesmerized by it, and it was in tears across my period. I've blocked the television to keep it safe, but for years, it's tired. And the TV does not seem to show it. So true movies were copyright-owned and were happy to see it show up on their channel. This time, I've taped it onto a DVD, so I can enjoy it again and again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Terminal. Her husband has a synthesis, and, although he is loving, he is a drunkard, and after he leaves, he will not be able to care for his children. Therefore, before he dies he will have to find a new home for each of his children. <br /> <br /> Acting top notch, music is beautiful, and it has examined the wonderful time (it's still crying to me!) If you ever get the chance, you will be stupid to miss this. This is a wonderful film! One must see for everyone !!!
