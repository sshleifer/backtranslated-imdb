Many reviews have seen, there is a strong dark line for this movie. The director reminds me most of John Landes (yes, go ahead and I'm a helper about a farmer). Arkand received a gift of discovering the most intricate things in a dark, gray way, and then he is exploring the horrors of life with a light touching touch. <br /> <br /> Except exemption of cast, without exception. David is as outstanding as Thomas Gibson Moody and self-deceptive center, around which the characters are rolling around. He talks about a good nihilist, but his actions love more than his character. She is willing to admit. Gibson was a strong and fine actor in 1993. Seeing him and seeing Greg Montgomery was difficult, alone Minds' agent Agent Hatner. Perhaps <br /> <br /> is not the best view, but most of the time I enjoy, my "review scene", the part where the candy anticipates an inspector and is not seen outside the door. Since Candy's interpersonal environment goes beyond more control, David simply becomes bouncer, perky and more enthusiastic like Gaunt Genre-X "Tegra".
