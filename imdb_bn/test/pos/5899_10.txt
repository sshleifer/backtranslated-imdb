I watch this movie every time on TV. A simple brilliant film. Three men returned home from war and tried to return to civilian life with extraordinary difficulties. During the war, three opposing reverse life (executive banker became Army Corps, Soda Jarac became Air Force Captain, and lost both his weapon in high school football hero war) and now everyone will have to reconstruct his life and a new reality. In home-coming homes, with the growing children and frustrated economy with independent, working women, only adds conflicts. This is apparently close to the camera and there is a blurred conversation which is loudly aloud The stranglehold of Frederick Mar and Mirna Laoy's strange closeness and the return to her place as leader (both at home and at work) is frustrating. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is handsome, writing like a decorated captain <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After watching, "Private Ryan Reservations." The exactness and extent of how these people lived for love and for the country ... and it probably did not end on the battlefield. <br /> <br /> This is essential for a collection. <Br /> <br />
