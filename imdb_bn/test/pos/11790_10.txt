I thought the movie was a nice, playful and different kind of singular kilar with the usual rice. Kifar Sucreland was as bright as usual - I did not really see anything that she did where she did not play brilliantly. During the conversation the light was lit, and the plot was engaging. Thanks to other critics for showing the link with Alice in Wonderland - I did not pick them up. I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see an entertainment movie for Kifa Sutherlands (as I am) and those two hours. It was a shame that it was not released for movies for a wider audience.
