This is one of the reasons for my favorite James Bond among games: The missions are fun so that they have lots of arrangements, but they can be hard to find that the tools you use make fun. Among these James Bond games, James Bond's appearance is quite beautiful, you can see a lot of brosnan in that which is great and all other characters in this game look like their acting actors in movies. There is no way that you do not take good time to play this game. I like it too. Most of the game has been added, but it mostly follows the movie. Also this James Bond game has a lot of graphics for the Nintendo 64 and the game did not have any voice on the game badly, but the game is as fun as it is. <br /> <br /> Overall score ** ********** out of
