Yes Barney is astonished now, but when I was a kid it turned into a perfect sense. <br /> <br /> I did not get any idea but I enjoyed it. As a child I had to joke because someone could tell me my name so I changed it. Since I was 4 years old, Benina left Tenny in the name of Tina because I could have associated her with a different culture. I'm 17 years old now and Barney is a huge part of my life. ... my name comes from here .... I can not stop this program, I grew up with how foolish I am now. <br /> <br /> If I get blocked I do not have anything else, I have nothing else to say. They can not create the minimum 10 lines, because some people are not able to say much. OK
