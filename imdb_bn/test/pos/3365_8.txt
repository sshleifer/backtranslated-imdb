Second filmmaker of World War II comedian Cohen's second quarter (others are "Till Death Do I Part 'and' Adolf Hitler - My Part in His Downfall ') a movie version of the BBC's long-running (and much preferred) situation. Comedy. Like most of the television shows prefer this transfer, the film is in the absence of plots and it is a collection of sketches. Some of these work better than others, for example, where a high ranking army officer floating beneath a river is a memorable, supernatural moment. <br /> <br /> The joy of this movie is such a past presentation that is probably never existed and an England which is defined by the beautiful countryside and visible scenes such as John Le Mesurier, his role of big film is played. Arthur Greed is fantastic like Captain Mainvering, who is a faucet, who shows great courage when chips are down and protects the day (Climax is probably the greatest moment of character). <br /> <br /> The television series series is certainly interesting but you can not find anything better as the role of British legend.
