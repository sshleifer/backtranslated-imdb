It is a very good job to show the lives of international students during their "Erasmus Year" in Barcelona, ​​which is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe and it is an ideal place. <br /> <br /> This concept is great with different languages ​​and it maintains a real environment. There are some things about the countries, but most of them are true! Characters could not present their different countries better. <br /> <br /> After experiencing myself "Erasmus" during my exchange semester in Italy, I can say that the movie is incredibly authentic. I had a lot of experience which was similar to letters (except as I often laid out) This movie is also quite funny, but those fools are not like American college movies. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film touches some important things like changing students' work. <br /> <br /> 9/10 (I can not be very objective though)
