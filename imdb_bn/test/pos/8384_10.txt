When I thought, I heard about Castigloste Caste Caste. And I'm both from Germany and movie. <br /> <br /> The man is more than 50 years old and then he played almost in the medieval television series - even though he did not even play the main part.

He is living proof of what a great caster Tarrantino is. <br /> <br /> Ways: I think movies are a great opportunity to see as a German - being able to understand everything. And the German dialogue is almost as well written as English. <br /> <br /> Now I can repeat, what others wrote here before. I will summarize it: Finally, return to QT.
