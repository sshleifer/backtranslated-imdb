However, there is a car charger here, and it is a sandstone. Wonderful as "recruitment" to destroy Eden Queen terrorists and navy. It is rare that second or third-level actors like Queen, play an important role in the role that carries a film. Generally, such a role is given to the album-star with the box office draw, perhaps I've never seen the movie before. Donald Sutherland is as great as morally ambiguous, a bit surprised at the time, the agent that quinn recruited. Ben Kinston fines as Israel's agent The plot is very complex and has multiple story lines, which eventually turn into fashionable and we do not see it in the same way. These thrillers are paranoia and chlestropophobia, and both are depicted with moral ambiguity and intense intensity. Location is trustworthy and effective. The soundtrack is not something special, but rarely can we get all of the above mentioned characteristics, without free and / or meaningless plot development; The incredible star is rolling around; High, annoying, music video type soundtrack; An arch that hams it up; And often a cast, clothing and plots that are provided to viewers under the age of 25. It's a great thriller that certainly did not get it due to its release. *** 1/2 of 4/2
