I will pay a 10 plus this television series. The author "pressed on" and I think the best actor and actress was a bonus in the show. These characters were so real. Some might say that the relationship between the two main actresses Mrs. Taucient and Miss Potts was closed and closed, the relationship was true, when you hear the word "known" at the end of the word "known" it will not end. The program has given me a lot of life, such as historical struggle, tragedy and victory, relationship, every day situation, every family has the same status, no matter who a member, it really comes to be a wonderful family show that at the end of each episode you only Sit in the living room and tell yourself "What have I learned from this special episode?" <br /> <br /> I must say that most of the episodes were pressed and I saw myself again above. <br /> <br /> Now you know why I got it a 10+ !!
