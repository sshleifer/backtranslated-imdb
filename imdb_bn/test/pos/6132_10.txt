I saw the movie "Miniseries" on television in 1989 and it is a great movie. I want to track it a copy to see it again and again. I have seen it since 15 years and it still takes me in my mind. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, it attracts you. Characters and plot lines keep you in line. The end was pretty fantastic. The feeling and anger expressed by the boy while finding out the truth about his father is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> /> Then email me and tell me where to get a copy.
