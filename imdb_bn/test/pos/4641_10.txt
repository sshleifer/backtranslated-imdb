Midnight Madness is a movie that is unfortunately extremely underrated and unappreciated. With a flood of classic "lusty" teen / college movies, this one forgot one. As a child I would watch this movie again, thankfully it was on my video. This movie is even more intense, but it shows the most exciting aspects of the eighties. We live in this day and age, the abuse of narcotics is the "coldest" thing, it's good to see once, sometimes, a funny, innocent movie that is Midnight Madness ... if you can find it.
