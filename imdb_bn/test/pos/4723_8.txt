This movie is working on two goals: to create a political point and to tell a terrific adventure story. It is often difficult to create a political point and still a good story (consider Alan's highly political but rarely-entertaining final episode). Outside Rangpur, we found good balance between politics and stories. <br /> <br /> I already knew that Aung San Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 and knew some of Burmese's oppressive political situation, so the political message that most of the movie I knew was a drama. But I think the film has done a great deal about Aung San Suu Kyi, and often the stupid dictators tried to keep her silent. The device is very common to present an unfamiliar setting with the eyes of a character who can identify the character, but it works very well in this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the actual measurement of the film was entertainment value. Arquette was as nice as a young woman who had a sister in her remote, unfamiliar place to reduce her depression over her husband and son's violent death. She is firmly isolated and depressed. His tragic situation gives him a clear reason for his prize of not knowing the hazardous sense of his misguided vendings, otherwise it may not be too intelligent. <br /> <br /> Once in danger, it is clear that he can see through the clouds of sadness, he is trapped with no easy escape. That takes him to the path of courage where he needs his intelligence to live. The author has many achievements in order to adequately encourage him to deal with his intelligent and many dangerous situations, although he has still found enough stupid reason to get hurt in the first place. Instructions are also strong, to maintain tensions across the nation in order to be protected from the forces of dictatorship. <br /> <br /> Because of the other events of the same period, the film had an impact on me and my wife. We were preparing to travel to India, and heard reports of Western tourists hostage by a terrorist group in India. In a peaceful democratic country, it is a different matter to flee from a tyrannical dictatorship to avoid the isolated terrorists. But film and news have shared the elements to avoid danger in an unfamiliar country. That general characteristic movie has given meaning to beyond its own efficient storytelling. The film depicts the worst nightmare of international tourists.
