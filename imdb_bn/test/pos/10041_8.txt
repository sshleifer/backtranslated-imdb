Iral Flin is one of the best in the West, Robin Hood, military red tape, Confederates, Indians and Carpets boom in the fight against the mercenary and final heroic end. Never as reliable as Lady Mary in the West and do not forget de deviland. Do not try to link this story with true and real people, it does not work. Just enjoy it, since no one was ever asked to make a documentary, when Raoul Wallace and Arroyne Flin were co-workers.
