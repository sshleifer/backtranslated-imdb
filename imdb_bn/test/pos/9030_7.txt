If this is not the case, then this film will be even more famous. If it is not for Gregory Pack as Adicas Fitch, the acting will be much more appreciated here. It was not for William Faulkner, perhaps a Mockingbird to Toll was not written in his shadow. <br /> <br /> I found this movie to be sad because it showed me that one of my favorite movies is to kill a McGirdbird, as much as I thought it could not be real. Perhaps it was inspired by this same similar movie. Oh, different from "Hudunitite", but the underlying story is very famous for the white white city to protect a black man, the only "white" attorney is very well known. And written by a woman, McKingbard concentrates on rape, a tremendous treason against a woman, when the film hates a man because of the brother's betrayal, brother's betrayal. <br /> <br /> There is no depth here. Macingbird. Do not be consoled that Addicus brought with his presence. So you are left with this sadness that he is reflected in Harper Lee's Mockingbird, whether or not he intended to lift the plot from this movie. There was not much change in that ten year or so since he might have read Faulkner's books and in the album he saw his movie unknowingly in college or later he did not take much of his time. There has been no change in ethnic relations and some may say that there has not been any change yet, many years later. <br /> <br /> It was very sad, and our day was an adjective for our greetings. Where McGenbard is pushing you towards Edison's weapon and is waiting for a good time in the morning, this film gives you regret that pride from black people can be as good or equal to the white man's pride. But pride does not have any answer. Instead of <br /> <br />, the answer to the adjective is our need, we console that we are all faultless and should have feelings for us in our weaknesses, not with pride our differences are the other.
