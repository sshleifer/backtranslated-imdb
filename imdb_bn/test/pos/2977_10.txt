Very young and still famous Alton John was drawn to "Friends" through Soundtrack, which I saw at a club near Houston. I did not have any emotions and would affect the film. Recently I was brought back to the film with a song that the heart was called "season", then I found the Elton John song "Friends" that it was the same song ... It seems to be 35 years old. However, the emotions of "friends" flood came to see an old picture of your first real love. I reminded the film more of myself than giving actual details about production, plots, etc., so please forgive me for a bad review rather. I think to take a few special friends on a date to watch the movie and ultimately they were as simple and impressive as them. I find a copy and now it's both anxiety and nervous. Many movies that seem so important to me (such as "The Graduate" "Easy Rider") seem to be just silly and I do not want to read this same section. But, I'll find it and if it gets stupid, then at least I'll be able to raise my wife ... a soundtrack. When we met, we gave it to "the last tango of Paris". I work with young people (56 years old), respect my opinion but it is difficult to explain the feelings of 60 years of film and song, which reflects such strong feelings, but now it seems "old". If the process of age is a movie then I just do not understand ... "Friends" is a very special, sensitive and wonderful movie. It sure is sure I will bring back many special feelings. Buy all the way, rent or copy ... The Indies were not near the powerful style, as they are today.
