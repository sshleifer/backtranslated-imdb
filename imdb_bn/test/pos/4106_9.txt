After the film was released I went to the movies in 1973, I was 11 then. I think how much I enjoyed and wanted to live in peace, how smart I was and how young I was. I recently came across a video recorded on television some years ago. I have seen it again and are not ashamed to admit that I still enjoyed what I did 29 years ago. I enjoy listening to music, because it reminds me that one day we can live in a place where gun words do not pound in our ears and if we see our reflection - then we should be happy with what we see I call it "well liked" because I'm happy to see it. Maybe I'm still naive but it makes me happy and I'm sure it will make you happy if you look at it with open mind and enjoy it for it - a good, family movie. I have to be one of the few people who received this movie at VHS Pal Video - and DVD (self-made). Recorded from TV to video tape recordings, thin and started to wear in DVD. I still watch it from time to time.
