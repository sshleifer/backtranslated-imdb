I think it is most likely to be able to present a true tail about a helpless man to an audience; A trail that the hero will spend most of his film behind, unable to move to bed. And yet the film's functionality as a dramatic piece of success is; As a reminder of the true story and I think that if a man should have the right to die due to the will, then why is it reasonable? But the film is not a political statement, and perhaps with gratitude, it shifts away from the majority of the debate, although it includes one for logic. Furthermore, it is one of the foreign language films, which presents its original character as a shit, which can not do anything to talk to people around him, and yet they can show as compelling and compulsory. <br /> <br /> So much out of the argument out and out, more sweet but timely dramatic pieces about the film want to find something else; The only difference is that by achieving this 'goal', it means that it will be achieved without ending the life of someone else and without physically going anywhere. Javier Bardem plays the real life of the Galician Ramon Sampdro, the person who had long ago immersed himself in a clearing, which was very shallow for such activities. As a result, he was given a bed for the rest of his life and the desire for his death was the focus of his Chilean director Alzandro Amenber. We have seen many movies in our lives, in order to provide a satisfactory experience for the audience, there must be a 'target' or targets before the end of the film, but the speed changes inside the sea are mild; It is not going to fight the young, energetic, attractive heroes far away, but a real person who makes so much money with them. <br /> <br /> Even if you have strong policies, pro or anti-euthanasia, you yourself find Raman that it wants to get it at all whatever happens at the end. The picture quickly gave a speech to Raman, because he wanted to die for family members, presenting the situation immediately and presenting the subject to observers who do not know about this film. Interestingly, family members may be members of some members who are strongly opposed to their position as an 'anti' who they want to be an audience member. But the purpose of this set is to say to the audience, 'No, it is not a person who eventually endorses his whole family.' Quite simply, the film went down the street, where it was against Sampadro's family versus everyone but some Raman; Some are too young to admit what's really going on and others think that if they want to keep Raman a bit more, others can also express their opinion, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Following a story Raman is a quadrangle and it's his perspective that we see things from. It is something that can disassociate the viewers or think the movie is quite strange, but instead of a lead character in a movie presenter or movie with a movie, it is being presented from the point of view of hunting which is always the cause and effect drive. But it is not a matter of criticism and it is the director's achievement in order to provide such a method for effective methods. The film asks questions; It offers a scenario of its audience. If you were in Ramon's place: what would you do, think or dream or talk? As a result, the lawyer about the lawyer Jula (Ruda) did not have so much shots for the audience to rejoice as much as they are a very little window in the imagination of a man escapist from his accident. After a while, when he began to share some similarities with Raman and when he started stroke, he was the result of his own disease. This feature seems to be timely in the progress of their relationship and already adds more elements of the connection to the engaging friendships. For this reason, Julia felt physical pain and limitations, she is not like she can not get up and walk, but she realizes the value of life that she already felt emotionally offended. The film covers the subject of true stories and covers the subject of disciplines, although it thinks the world's drama less about a person, where he is ready to fight for what he wants, but must do it verbally. It is refreshing to see movies inside the sea because it is not just history history and it gives us insight, but alone, as a film, provides a mental and engaging level.
