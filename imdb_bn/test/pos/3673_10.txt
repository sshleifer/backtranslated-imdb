I absolutely worship this movie! I never saw it when I saw it in the video store. I saw Kathy Bats, so I thought it was something valuable, you know? I saw it shaking my head the first time. . . is not it? Then it was the last scene and I saw myself laughing so hard. I clicked "play movie" and saw the whole thing again. It's the quirkiest movie I've ever seen without doubt. But as much as I see, the more I love. It's weird and crazy and sweet and dear. Cathy Betts is unable, but the rest of the imagination is fantastic. They all are strange characters! Midget is just too funny for the word. And Julie Andrew and Barry Manilo are violent. It's just a fun, fabulous movie all around. I get cravings to see it again. Anyone is watching for it for the first time, please keep it in the end. It's good value!
