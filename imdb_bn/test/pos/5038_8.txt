Am I really enjoying this movie: a funny little film that does not take very seriously. Plot summary is available everywhere so I do not have to go in detail. Michael is not about a complex plot anyway. It just builds on a great premises and takes the viewer to a wonderful street trip. <br /> <br /> John Travolta is just perfect as chain-smoking, lady-loving, bar-boring, pie-eating angel. And who does not love Sparky? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh a little and spend a fairly good time see this. Highly recommended.
