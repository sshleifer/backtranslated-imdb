Great adaptation of Christie's novel. Wonderful aspect in the details of pure time for the time (in the mid-1970s, in the early '80s, in the early 30s, many films were looking at my choice of the 80s in the early 80's, so the worst Expected and gladly proven wrong) Clothing and set are very well done. I liked to produce this too ?? For most of the time, the frankly bright young lady "Frankie" of Francesca Anne and James Warwick's charming Bobby script. This pair will portray Christie's Tommy and Tippen, which is interesting in comparison to the contemporary book critics Frankie and Bobby with Tommy and Tipps previous characters. Supporting letters were equally good ?? The leading lady, Mrs. Revington (Miss Marapple-to-Juan H.) and "Badger" have completely played the WWI, "Bar Waste Type".
