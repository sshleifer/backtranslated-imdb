I was really surprised when I came across this movie on Cable TV a few years ago. How the story changes our land and it is a wonderful example of its hanging fighting and its requirements. "People" and the government's ambiguous desire. The actors were fantastic in their painting and I fell in love with Tantu Cardinal - that was so credible and that there was such a character in the film, like Rip Torn. The story is land, past and a love story between two main characters. I tried to figure out this picture and I was unable to detect it - but I definitely want to own it.
