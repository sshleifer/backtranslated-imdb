A quick look at the beginning of this movie seems to point to only another stupid '80's gut / backwood slash festival; Sex is equal to death and the actors are actually all boring stereotypes that you want to die. However, "JBD" supplies a lot more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A beautiful beautiful backdrop. These feelings actually increased more by the likes and letters of the opponent, which is even more moral than the cardboard definitions of the temple. Oh yes- George Kennedy is here too, and when is it not a good thing? <br /> <br /> If you like "wrong turn", then see how many methods it has come up.
