According to the critics' opinion, it was the best time to become a child in the 1990's, when the cartoons were not widely censored and the talented and creative minds were responsible for the best family entertainment to hit the wind waves. On Saturday morning, the best producer of animation was Warner Bros. Television, who was experienced in a Golden Age with Steven Spielberg, Tom Roggar and Paul Dini's dream team. Alongside the serious and bold series like Batman, they revitalized the famous Genie, the Miracle Cartoons by Luni Tunes. Anonymous was the biggest hater with his dark adult humor and tribute to Celluloid today, but the Tony Touen adventures were popular for rediscovering lonely tunes for the new generation, although still the crazy cartoon kept the age group on the violence and intelligent comedy, No matter how old Even when small tunes extend to the length of the feature with how I can spend my vacation, it does not look like the longest episode of the television series, it is a curse that often disrupts other feature-length adaptations of popular animated shows. <Br> <br /> The young Toon Gang classic cartoon characters have the young off-springs that smashed the audience in the 1940s and early 1950s, and now the cartoon comedy is learning "to achieve their tonnage". The summer vacation has started and every character has its own idea of ​​what to do. Buster Bunny (Charles Adler) and Babes Bunny (Tress MacNeille) started a water gun battle that eventually flooded the Akham acre and reached both Mississippi boats. The Plucky Post (Joe Alsky) joins Hampstest Theme Park in the world with a cross-country car trip to Hammonton Pig (Don Messik), but Hampton's family becomes more difficult than imagining. In the meantime, by spreading other stories, Elimira tries to find a cat to hug and slug Duff (Kry Summer), Fifi Le Fume (Kata Sausi) with her favorite Sankt Star star and Sheryl the Lun (Gayle Matthias) with a date Tries to go. ) A loud face folkmouth (Rob Pelen) goes to the movie. <br /> <br /> While the feature seems thin for a feature-length movie, many directors and film writers work well together in all the stories. The best of these is the unfortunate road trip of Plucky, which uses a golden comedic opportunity very well: feel sorry for someone, and even smiles in their accidents. Plagi's boring response to the bad things happening to him, with a perfect mix of script and animation, stuff a pig with a small car limited. The story of Elmyra is definitely just how much second, how innocent the innocent girl might be so afraid of in the jungle creatures. The cartoon violence mentioned above comes forward in front of Buster and Babasaheb story, which can not only laugh at the reason of the joy of the result, but also in the cold, because the rugger and probably half of the company will not be allowed to display. They do that segment. Approximately half of the parts work as parodies and tributes in the delivery, including a cute twist in the dual banjo scene, featuring the unforgettable little Tune Adventure Tourism songs. <br /> <br /> The part of the public appeal of small tunes is proven to be very intelligent because it targets issues with a sharpness that proves that it does not have the title "rental of children" that people are walking with it. In a complete section featuring Foulmouth's poor eccentricity in the movie, Yaks is laughing in a note-perfect way with an additional jab at LucasFilm's Thexax logo. That scene is so perfectly that it should be featured before showing every movie. There are a few minutes to have fun in Disney World, cinematic plot holes, and even Warner's law department. Today's cartoons are flexible and non-creative, those intelligent moments create even more treasures, perhaps it will not be another animated series that will end. <br /> <br /> After many years of watching how I spent my holiday for the first time, I can all definitely say that they do not do the right way using cartoons. Running censorship that accepts today's family entertainment, someone wonders whether such a thing will ever be made again. This review is not just a recommendation of a real smart movie, but also an application to agree with Spieberg, Rugger and Danny, and again to make our mind a witch. Lord knows that the twentieth-century children need something to do with small t-advent adventures. It's not a simple cash-grab, it's a full-fledged soul, a nice movie with Madcap Mayhem and Hilarity.
