I love this picture. Shahjad Khan's Screenplay Vella A Who At "Shut up, Robert!" So it was lovely. Whenever he gets hit during the battlefield, you can cry him. Vizu is a Robert A K. "Rabbit". I love the power of Kapoor A. "Crime Master Gogo" Parameshwar Rawal's dual role is very unusual for his screenplay as Ramgopal Bajaj and Shyampal Bajaj. Rabindranathan and Karisma Kapoor are out of this world. My brother Vahla is saying a true mimicry. "Calm down, please relax." I liked the scene where Aamir Khan kept Salman's "muscular" meat on the diet, causing irregular bowel movements to make him use the toilet.
