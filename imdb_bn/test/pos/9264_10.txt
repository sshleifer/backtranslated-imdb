I've always been a huge fan of "Homeside: Life on the Street". So when I heard that a reunion movie was coming, I could not wait. <br /> <br /> I just say, I was not all disappointed. This is the most powerful 2 hours of television I saw. It was great for everyone to come back, but Andre Brugger was the greatest joy behind, because the relationship between Pemberton and Belize was always the most powerful part of the great show.
