Looking back at Alfred Hitakouk's career, there is no real wonder how bright and visionary people can deny enough recognition for the film industry for the revolutionary. Perhaps Hitcoch was a sign of how much time was ahead of him, perhaps trying to push the envelope and sometimes did not look at the coast with the entertainment movies, but always gave his mind deeper and more attention. Hitscock's first and more undated hits are unfamiliar with a train, a perfect example of these features - it's a entertaining and suspicious story, seen more than 50 years later, but with so much cautious and intelligent design it stands today as a wonderful composition. <br /> <br /> A pioneer "mysterious thriller", a stranger unknown to a train might come in a little bit on some side, but it retains the tone of nicely drawn design that came back in 1951 (if it is possibly a little shaky). As well as cinematography and discussion, the great use of fast, careful editing really stands up the film, grasps every potential intensity and even keeps the audience's focus in the scene. If there was only one straightforward film maker, Hitakk, there was no doubt, only five-minute train observers should be sufficient to avoid such feelings; Each shot is so carefully selected and manufactured, serving all the specially innovative fashion stories forward. Sadly, there are moments in the story that are nicely going out of place enough to censify our focus from cinemography and editing - Bruno Sier is easily incredible to reach the bottom of the hole and its image is a ruthless old man growing out of a carousel, the film's most exciting and engaging Auda is what the scene is meant to be Provides great comedic relief. This is just a short moment, but they are enough to stand as painfully weak in stellar film otherwise. <br /> <br /> But what makes the train stand unintentionally is the basis of the story Hollywood Films Suddenly, after the clinic, the risk of risk of climbing under the Tricid Cliichi was at risk, it turned out to be a 50-year-old film which proves amazingly refreshing, which is actually smart and original. Sure that this is fairly straightforward, but the idea of ​​"swapping murder" is not just the one that can fly today's movies and movies, which makes it more entertaining to watch; The brilliant screenplay of the movie keeps running steps at a fast pace by providing some quick memorable lines. Nobody can help, but it is also pointing to the concept of darkness in Hitco as well as the whole humanity, in which the elderly women are bizarre and happy in the hope of the assassination, Bruno's own autocratic attitude towards death. Hits also work in dark moments of dark hues (Bruno is popping a child's balloon with his cigarette), and shooting in suspicious scenes such as iconic carnival scenes in a ridiculous, happy, easy-to-run environment, can create even more coyly environments. . It may be a mysterious thriller, yes, but it may simply be ineligible to ignore the hidden brain. <br /> <br /> Bruno's competitive image (registered with Robert Walker's boring, in the role of his latest film with sadness, but easily stealing films from his gifted colleague colleagues) is no doubt how a train makes strings so memorable, As a wonderful to see the character. Here we have an easily nicely made arched figure, all the more playful by how ordinary and unassuming he thinks. Instead of crazy mad at every possible moment and spoiling the hero, Bruno is a calm, controlled, psychological mess. He speaks of killing in this kind of abduction, but while keeping discussions with the different phisons of killing people, his eyes keep a bright glimpse. Bruno "ID" may seem to represent, because Fred will keep it in the internal, dark and uninhibited direction of mankind. It seems to be a striking and contrasting and helpless to the hero personality Guy Guyes, which is often more attractive and interesting than raising the expectations of the temple, rather than trying to do the right thing. <br /> <br /> Despite this uninterrupted message, Hit still laughs loudly and loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly, despite the stealing of Robert Walker's villain show A genre of actress Farley Ganger's genre, Gannerger's hero is still sympathetic, still less supportive We are reducing our support until the victims are victims. Ruth Roman was given excellent support, who was able to overcome Cliché, and gave a great acting as a person of more innovative and complex romantic interest, Casey Rogers, Gaier scary, impressive and firsthandedicist and Patricia Hitchcock, which he proved he was much more Only being "Director's daughter" will be empowered. Exquisite Cast (led by a simple wonder Walker) really made the film alive by adding the film to more talent than Hitachi's exciting Stylics. <br /> <br /> Everyone can be seen on the train for very little date for some observers, but released earlier in the modern century, it is surprisingly amazing to contemporary and contemporary audiences. . Again, the hitcock proves the extraordinary skill of its tension and film technique, and the only value to watch the movie's surprisingly real and enjoyable scenes. Very brightly prepared but extremely entertaining anyone who wants to take experience in the film recommendation! <br /> <br /> -9/10
