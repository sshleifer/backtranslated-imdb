This is a great example of a Hollywood movie making film, which is very excited, running and without humor, Kevin McKidd and Pala Rishi are fantastic. <br /> <br /> I actually saw it on late night TV and I can see why I missed it in the movie, it is not a kind of movie which shows the multi-screen "mega" movies nowadays, expresses regret. <br /> <br /> I'm looking for DVD. Not for those who love, special effects and current trends in a story. If you like the best selling book "The Curious Incident of the Night-time", then you will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is beside the best Scottish films as "Small Faces" and "TrainPotting". Kevin McKidd also starred in films <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended.
