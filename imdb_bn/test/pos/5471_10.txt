I'm from Texas, and my family spent my vacation with Saints on a few years ago with my brother. She offered to go to see the church with stairs. I happened to be completely blown away by the miracle that happened there. The film is fantastic - Barbarara Hirsch and William Petersen were suitable for their portions. It's amazing, absolutely amazing. If you have not seen the stairs straight, the price of travel is to see it. Wood beautiful and architectural wonders. Only the Chapel is the barrier to me! Reading about Chappell's history, and then seeing his beauty is breathtaking. Watch the movie - it's cool! Then people see the stairs!
