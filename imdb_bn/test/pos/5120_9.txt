I just saw this movie because I did not want to leave my 9th and his friends in the theater. Verily, I went to expect a good graduation - but found myself entranced by the movie. I ask that anyone will ask! Ray's mother was playing my favorite TV one year ago, a mermaid (the highest bob). He was really cute in this movie. Three main characters were all excellent young actors. See also hostage buffet and enjoyed hearing. The movie itself was quite beautiful - Florida did something so great to show up. I'm happy to end up going to this movie. And to worry, I was frustrated that I could not take them to see "Stick Brick" - I think it was even better!
