Mikehell of 1996 won the warm and comedy-fantasy, which is one of my favorite performances of John Travolta Libraries. Travolta gave Michael a record of his most wonderful and most preferred performance as Michael, whose pansy's news of "Michael Enquirer" in his house revealed a very significant presence called Michael, due to a quiet position at Pansy (John Stapleton), a solitary classmate's house. And editor (Bob Hossein) to the journalists (William Hurt, Andy McDowell, Robert Pastorile) send it to Motorlet to test it. Heart, McDowell, and Pastorlie are good enough to have a great news staff, who have taken a hard time to accept an angel while accepting them, but Trivtala's shows and she's dirty, sugar-eaten, cookie-smell, pie-loving, Loving, Michael, Michael, an angel, who is not what you think of when you think of angels. And when you and the ladies dance to "fake chain" lady will love the scene in the bar. I love this movie more whenever I see it, and this is mainly because John Travolter can win completely.
