When a stranger call is actually a pretty good movie. I have never seen the original and when I saw it I thought it was unique. When the television is advertised on a newborn baby, the trailer ends. Well, I never saw this trailer and saw the trailer. I was surprised how good it was. I walked through it one day and decided that I would buy it and now I was lucky because I thought it was a very nice movie, which is a beautiful little movie. It has received many unfair treatment, and if you are interested in this movie then do not listen to all negative comments. Camille Bell is not as bad as an actress because everyone makes her out, and she has done a great job in this movie, so all your haters come up on her own, she gets lighter and actually tries to enjoy this movie; A fun, naughty bopper, popcorn flick. If you did not see it, it is much more enjoyable than recently creating more slashes.
