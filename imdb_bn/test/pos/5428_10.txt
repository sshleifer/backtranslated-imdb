This is a great compilation. The 'Big Big Bitch' is a crazy, weird, ridiculous and ultimately touching an old married couple and their quiet life, who argue over the trunk and scrabble outside the nuclear war. Everything from this great animated short has become memorable: the eyes shaking wife, the vacuuming banquet, the husband saw the idol (watch those backgrounds!), Very verbal cat, demand game shows, anchor "informative" news, "beautiful" accordion serenade and moving and memorable The end I'm very happy that I found 'Big Big Snin', which is one of the greatest compositions of all time ever in the film.
