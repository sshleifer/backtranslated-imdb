I'm from Ireland and I thought this movie contains odd minutes or two words, where there is a little more ridiculous than Brad Pitt or other Americans. Moreover, I rarely see a British actor handling America or Canadian accent, except for Colin Farrell in the minority report. This film was a little film and it was entertaining. No, it was not the production of blockbuster Hollywood, but I'm really sick of that shiver. I had a lot of smile and a good time several times. It was definitely worth the rent. The main character is a fool on other hard British gangsters. At least that I saw it. If you hope to produce $ 100 million dollars then you will be disappointed. Enjoy it for - a small entertainment movie.
