I have been a huge fan of Jackie and Viva La Bamboo for a long time. They had a great run and I ended up hoping to finish my smile. But, it still does not. This movie kept my mouth open full time. I'm still randomly, laughing. I went to the theater with less hope, thinking it's not going to be better than the first Oh, how unbelievably I was wrong <br /> <br /> There was a big moment in this movie. If you feel embarrassed, do not like random hugs kept randomly, or you probably do not like it if you dislike the first movie. But, that said, I almost wet my pants so hard to smile. It has all kinds of comedy, mesicotic humor, toilet humor, pond, laugh, some great collapse and all cast widespread damage. Ryan's right is the left-end brand brand with a photo left that can be stuck for a long time. I'm sure you can imagine how tight this image is. <br /> <br /> There is no pain, no profit? Right? This movie has already done well, the theaters laugh so hard all over America, they will want to stay longer because they can stay longer. I know i have The film, especially the credits, did not seem to be short in spite of continuing the scenes. However, I still wish it could go away forever. Now, let's wait and see if Jacques leaves 3! Overall, a great movie, if you can overcome male nudity and some ill images. Keep your kids from this film. They do not need to look at, at least until they are older. Buy this when crew support and DVD comes in it! I know I will.
