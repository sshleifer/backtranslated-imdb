These movies were the most fun movies I have ever seen in my lifetime. I was laughing around in the pond. After finishing the film, I laugh about an hour to tell the last of the film. It's 100 times better than the first Zacass movie. I love seeing them all together again together. You do not like this movie if you do not like sticky or infant humor. If you can go with an open mind and do not take it so seriously you will laugh at your ass. None of his wonders were killed in this movie. Each scene in this movie is so original and different from the next, do not tell what you expect. <br /> <br /> Mike Weber
