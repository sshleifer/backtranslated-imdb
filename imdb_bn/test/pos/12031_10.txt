I saw this movie for the first time when I was a schoolboy. The next day I knew that all the students of our form had seen it and everyone was fascinated as I was. I think the same condition is at our school and in the entire Soviet Union. Later on every time I showed it on television and saw it more. I think that comparison of "Back to the Future" or other Saifai films is not appropriate. "Gastiaia Bud Budchevo" is unique in many ways, once you have seen it, you will never forget it. <br /> <br /> This picture is full of the successes of peaceful science, full faith in the future beautiful beliefs in our world. This is not just a movie, but a scientific discovery and prediction of achievements. The time of the movie is 1984 (the year of its creation) and the year 2084 (where a schoolboy Kolla Garcemov traveled for some time and where his friend Alisa Sedelienva came from). The year is now 2005, many discovery and achievements of the film's prediction have not yet been realized. For example, "MyLophone" (an instrument that can read the thoughts of humans and humans), Venus and Mars (which are easy to go for a picnic in the weekend), creating and launching satellites as homework for students, easy to run flying machines (which are completely Automobiles replacements), bio-bots, in a few minutes, any element or animal that has been edited in "historical identification" More color. Meanwhile, some of them have become more realistic today than 1984! Just wait for 2084 :-) <br /> <br /> The film is usually done by Russian schoolgirls and schoolgirls (and naturally!). With their innovation, curiosity, humor, dreaminess For example, look at Fima Corollivo, you can often find this type of character in every school of the Soviet Union, the same character was in my form! Alisa Cellejinva ... I myself, as well as many classmates fell in love with her first sight! However, after Alice's acting actress became a scientist - I think she was so much influenced by the movie she saw on TV. <br /> <br /> Beautiful concept, beautiful perception, beautiful actors, beautiful music, beautiful song "Precraseni delaco" ("The wonderful Far-awaay") ... beautiful, beautiful, beautiful ... <br /> The last thing I want to say is that different remixes and "new versions" songs and even the film were created later and spread on TV and on the internet. All they are not even comparable with the original. I should not even comment on them, my comments are only about the original. So, request the original and enjoy!
