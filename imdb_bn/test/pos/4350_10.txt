The Little Director does not need to fly Warner Herzeg's extraordinary body of film work is not with others. Recently, it was brought back to DVD a decade after its first US liberation war in 1997, it has not lost any energy, and its influence on the documentaries can be seen in various ways such as his recent Grizzlie Man of Hertz and the fug wars of the Academy Award winner of Ariel Morris. Like the former, it is an interesting American life in detail in 74 minutes. Like the latter, it gives a circulation on one side of the battle to see some. Yes, we saw violence and heroism, but the fog of war has brought us to one of the first warmth of the last century, this movie focuses on the harmful living that we are detained by the enemy, tortures, and ultimately win. However, in no way, shape, or form, the film is not as straightforward as my brief or as enthusiastic. Untitled Flight of Little Dighter, Dieter Dangler and immigrant German nationals who survived the barbarism of the Nazis (for example, we were not his grandfather in the Wildberg city of Black Forest, for example, voting for Hitler and being cruel for that position) after World War II Germany , And in his own prison in the hands of Vietkong, his plane On February 1, 1st January jetati hinira Laos were poop ??. When Dangler's impression of the film's title and pilot was printed, he influenced his friendly warrior planes, when he saw his city as a child, someone believed that Dingle is the central theme of the movie, this is not true. The subject of Dengler's survival, or, more precisely, its people, will be the desire of all people. Dingler's romantic life details have been very high in Hollywood and have set an attitude for interest in Hejaz. He also won a Purple Heart, Medal Honor, DFC, and Navy Cross. Dangler was pushed to live so much and the relatively objectionable people (although there is a bold dark side) remain, the center of the film and everything in Herzeg. Dieter Dangler's past 'remote barbarous dream' is completely planting the country of Herzegov, and during the many jungle scenes of Madagascan Chan, and Lohi E used to appear, in other excellent impressions, perhaps Scorsese with Martin, the best manipulation of the image and the music in the film. Tall he could be together!
