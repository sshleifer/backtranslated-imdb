You are still in darkness for them, I will not ruin this Christian, because it is certainly one of his best works, and I press on when you will see free time later! If an adaptation book is shown before viewing (or instead of) before reading, I would recommend "after the funeral" for the following reasons. <br /> <br /> I wanted to appreciate the acting of Monica Dolan. (Miss Gilchrist), whose employer colleague Cora was brutally murdered at the beginning of the film. The screenplay of his sudden, nervous, unexpected woman is actually going on, especially when he has a personal relationship with a pirate, another person who travels alone "on life journey". And when the murderer is usually being released to Pierre Daintin Fashion, the response to the publication is his best: sympathetic to Miss Gilchrist, you feel angry as a murderer ... something extraordinary for Chris Lorr <Br/> <br /> Although there are some contrasts between novel and adaptation of the movie, it is normal (perhaps less knowledge is gained in the film), incredible extravaganza of postwar England, which is entirely of high quality acting and direction, and preservation of Christie's mystery and conspiracy (If not higher) makes these inconsistencies incomplete. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Again!
