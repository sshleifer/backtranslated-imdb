It is a superb thriller from a nuclear power plant in southern California which is operated by James Bridges and starring Jane Fonda, Jack Lemon and Michael Douglas. Fonda is a TV reporter who wants to be an investigative journalist, but only to be a TV reporter. Douglas is an independent cameraman and Lemon is a supervisor of a nuclear plant. Fonda and Douglas were sent to regular appointments of nuclear power plants and an accident almost happened and they found it in all the movies. Douglas stole the movie, because everyone tries to cover it without the band and Douglas. Lemmans started investigating and finding out more about the company's profit and the safety of the plants. This is a nice movie with a nice good ending.
