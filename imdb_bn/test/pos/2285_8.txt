Not many people seem to know about this movie. Which is very bad because I think it's pretty good. It can be a bit sticky at times and may have a forecast tale. But the movie presentation is doing quite well. I think custom is good with actors / characters. Tom Seleck does a good job of playing a baseball player (go figure ... I think it's not much of a stretched part) and why Tacakura (Black Rain) plays the baseball team in Japan. There is not much about the charges. It's just a light, easy going, happy comedy and I recommend it.
