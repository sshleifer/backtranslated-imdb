It should be one of the best movies we've seen and we highly recommend it to express the injustices of Altitude. Billy with Corby / White Wolf is an extraordinary actor and really awesome as well. However, if the story is enhanced in more view of his character, then it is felt. This is a movie which can be seen over over without fatigue.
