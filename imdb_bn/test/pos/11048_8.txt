This image is suitable even though you can listen. Marie Dresler's performance (I hope I'm spelling it) is a reason enough to see this movie as a drunken old suit. This is a wonderful performance. She is a drunk stupper in three scenes for a long long time and she does the same thing twice. You can actually smell alcohol when he is done. Amazing And certainly talking about his first line of the GREAT film and talking great shes. Eugene O'Neill is the story harder and most O'Neill stories, very deep and intense. It's not light entertainment, but if you like it, the best character actors of the 30's and 40's. Some of the movies are technically unclear but all are suitable.
