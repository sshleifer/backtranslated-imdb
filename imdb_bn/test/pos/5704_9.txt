In the 1970s, the doors of history's biggest, most diverse age were opened. Some pictures were fantastic ("The Godfather", "Conversation", "Minar Streets", "Chinatown", "French Connection", "Five Simple Pies", "Gosses", "McCabe and Mrs. Miller") were not so great "The Gateway", "The Outfit", "Badge 373", "Joe", "The Taking of Pellham One to Three", "Bruce McCallall", "Castle Keep") and others were very few. <Br / > <br /> <br /> Yet everyone is a new air force compared to today's corporate Hollywood Nonsense, where each movie is given a big weekend to recover its cost. Or go straight to HBO and go. <br /> <br /> What "decades" works so well that it's suddenly and rarely to create an independent movie and It is possible to pay for the management, perhaps it is private, maybe not, with some extra exposure sometime in the middle of busy street before the police arrives. The poorer principal, suet, committee and lawyer have long been part of the "system". <br /> <br /> Comments are great, especially Julie Chris Tie and Dennis Hooper. The big director is today (Coppola, Scoris, Ron Howard, Dennis Hooper, Peter Bogodniewicz) as "Roger Common Commando". Work long hours with minimal salary. Shooting a movie under a month. It teaches all steps and trade strategies by itself. To introduce products in time and modern budget. <br /> <br /> See "Decade" for his message. And for the long and varied charts of films created by those amazingly vague years, <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> While IFC is one of the complexes to fill the lowest rating of the film in Grand Pioneer I will not complain, but I will not complain, Roger Karamen.
