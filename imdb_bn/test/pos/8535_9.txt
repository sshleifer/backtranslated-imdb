I honestly did not think that this movie would make me laugh like hell and glorify gravity, the boy was wrong! From the very beginning till the very end, the film has some great effects, including spufes from other titles like "Evil Dead" and "Grimlines". This film can be compared to Peter Jackson's artwork, although this movie is not as glorious as "brined", but I'm sure these people will create another diverse film.
