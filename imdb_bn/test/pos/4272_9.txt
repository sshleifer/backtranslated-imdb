Great show! About time is a reality TV show that comes along with the gap of generation. Contestants seem to be old in the age range, when they first came to see the movie. And others, seemed so young that parents or teachers might expect the movie to touch their life as it would touch once. Grease has really become an American icon. Grease is a fun and entertaining movie that can relate to young and old. "You want us to want" to ensure the success of more summer followers The only thing I wanted was the history of the character, then again the 50's Nostalgacha fantasy is a little better. Wait for the next show to watch ... and then on Broadway !!!
