044: Big Trill (1930) - Released 10/24/1930; <br/> <br /> Birth: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Suddenly, a western, 33-year-old actor John Wayne played west across the western border. In the 1930s, we were seeing many "first" but a few "bests". Aside from the first John Wayne film we have the first widescreen movie (though we only saw the whole frame version). Interestingly, the decision on the widescreen was largely due to the fact that the widescreen was popular: to compete with television, which was not yet commercially displayed, it was still a provocative curiosity. Similarly, this movie was very good, giving us a boring look at Oklahoma's track. The opening title cards can tell us that it is the most traditional type, about America, about land, it should live in, and a great exhibition of it. Walsh showed us some wonderful visuals from the Wagon Company that outside of the desert (when they reach a mountain, they occupy each wagon rope under one another), and we find a revenge mistress to pursue a person who killed Wayne in a friend (I Stagecoach Think of something similar in mind). Owen's solid cowboy routine is at least partially, and subsequent films will further improve. This image represents Owen's first 30 works for Odyssey, then we will not see his face until stagecatch, but once we see him at the end of the Odyssey and beyond. Kevin: Ah, our first sound western, and John Wayne's first acting role. It's Raul Walsh's Big Trill This review will be short, since I have seen it since the week. I enjoyed this movie, but it was far from a wonderful composition. The most anticipated adventure was a few surprises, such as the brains of bad people, red flakes (the top of the tiren power senior in his last ground); I thought he would sit at the end, but it ended soon after becoming Bill Thorp (Ian Keith). I think that Brac (Wayne) kills Thorpe and at the end I do not like the revenge properly. I realized that he understood what he wanted to do in the story, but why did he not like his argument when he told Ruth? I think he was much more responsible than the hundreds of colonists who were chasing a hardline. <br /> <br /> The last movie is seen: Animals crackers (1930). In the latest film period: Soup To Badam (1930). Next movie: L'oz d'Or (1930).
