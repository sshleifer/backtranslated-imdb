Tuscan is eager to know the name of the village where it is filmed in Italy. I know Villa's name: Villa San Guerlamo, want to know the exact location in Tuscany. Cinematography is wonderful and it will be wonderful inside that area. I want to know whether the location of desert shooting is also good. Traveled extensively in Europe and Africa and was interested in seeing the area of ​​books and movies. Email me with any information on any of the sites. We will be very grateful. And if anyone knows whether the Tuscan villas are still live, it would be great. I wait no info and I thank you in advance for your time.
