I watched this movie in a theater whilst on Pablo CO's holiday. I just left my biological engineering job in the hospital. I think the scruples of the real stuff that the scripts are running on the hospital <br /> <br /> The idiots who drop it on production costs do not get points and probably did not get admitted to the hospital. And do one thing for sure. Billy Jack (of the same era) was produced very badly but was an important social comment and it was a very good movie with a real social message. <br /> <br /> I found this site since I found this movie where I found it.
