I think the basic concept of a movie should be entertained or informed. If you want information you are looking for real life movies and historical movies. Sometimes this is the same one. The coin is entertaining on the other side. Hit me entertaining? Yes i did OK formula value. The boy meets the girl or meets the boys girls in this field. They get together together then get back together. However, refreshing the movie has happened. I specifically liked the bar scene with hits and whole. Allegra was delighted to see Albert romance, most of the true men were shy when they came to visit their dream woman, and my hit advice was, probably half the time I found my wife on the altar. I read this movie's first comment that this movie was considered safe and well, it has a few more smiles. I tend to disagree with so many smiles you can pack into a romantic comedy without turning into a furce. In addition to relationships there are serious moments. Everyone thought the hit was quite funny, the actors did well (I'll search for them in other movies) and hit is a movie that I'm very happy in my DVD collection.
