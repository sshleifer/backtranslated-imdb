Recently saw the greenhouse, I was browsing the video in the United States, to find some movies that were played in Real Greenhouse Theater in the city center in the mid-70s. Hong Kong Action Flick David Five Fingers is one of such pictures. The sound effects and quick jump like cartoon seemed to be a little confusing at first, but after a while I was so involved in stories and letters that I did not care. The music scores were used in movies like "Ironside" TV theme song that later Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill was in the movie. Some scenes involving heroes Maya were looking at the border with parody, but they were so brief that they did not destroy the film. After the most exciting part involved in the tournament and some revenge departments. Kung Fu is good for fans!
