This movie was quite pleasant. I kept it for a long time, and was afraid that it could not depend on my expectations. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The sunny days from the beginning (Stay up to the last credit!), it's impossible to fool and annoying characters How absolutely the movie can be so intelligent, malicious and intuitive? <br /> <br /> With its explicit matte paintings, the future of the film is remembered by the series of apps and the other Saifai movies of the era. <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie is essentially the planet of apps, but with people with mental equivalents, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Films carry, a character in which she is "bottle rocket" "(There is even a swap between" bottle rockets "even in an initial scene). <br /> <br /> Maya Rudolph is also surprisingly good as a former" painter "that was frozen. <Br / <br / <br /> <br /> Despite all its strength, a movie of "auditorium" has a distinct feeling that was taken away before being taken away from the director / editor. <br /> <br /> I can not understand for life I understand Why lam a funny movie, a modern screening, no trailer, will enter some theaters without marketing. <br /> <br /> The studio has decided that they will not be able to spend any longer. <br /> <br /> or they Thinking that this movie was a godly classic title, and was it the only way to become a true god? Is it a shame? Whatever it is, it is shameful, because Mike Judge This picture is particularly well-deserved. <br /> <br /> I am saying that this image will have the original foot in the DVD and it will be effective for its face. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the fox executives saw themselves in character, were confused, And thought it was a documentary?
