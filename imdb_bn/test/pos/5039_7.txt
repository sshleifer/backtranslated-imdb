Angels are a bit of an American emotion, but are often annoying. They are the messenger of Allah and the thirty angels are also a great warrior (Lucifer is looking for the toughest and the best, until he is thrown out of heaven). <br /> <br /> What if you do not believe? Some angels alone and you are sent to investigate the story of an angel, only one with the wings meets and the spirit of the angel is low. <br /> <br /> What is probably needed in America, being a puritan is different from being good. Michael is a strange, objectionable, female-friendly messenger in heaven who will fulfill your wishes and make you look very much for the world's touch that will touch you. <br /> <br /> Interesting, but not too much, touching but not extra sensitive, intelligent without knowing ... it's just a good easy, short comedy. See a lazy Sunday afternoon.
