Set up a continuous future detention camp in California, an English film worker, young activist and political dissatisfaction face trial according to the "rebellion law", which allows the United States government to suspend citizenship for civil rights. Emergency without the need for bail or evidence. In this case the government is authorized to detain and detain anyone who may be involved in future activities of betrayal. One of the trials group is feminist, a black panther and a singer. <br /> <br /> People convicted of a conservative tribunal prefer a long imprisonment or a three-day penalty park, where they can achieve their independence by reaching an American flag in the desert. They must do this without food or water. The armed national guards and the police will also follow them, who can be taken to the camp if every person convicted of the offender is found guilty of conviction. The reality is different; Those who choose parking parks will be killed or killed by hunting or with brutality in the hope of achieving their independence. The park seems to be a training ground for police and guardians, who must master these repression so that their open American society can be used. <br /> <br />, 16mm and in the documentary style, by Watkins, its celebration is the controversial War games for Kulden and BBC; He contacted the prisoners and the guardians, and through unconstitutional trials, he developed a political movie which was still important and relevant. Using her knowledge of the medium, Watkins has not created a shameless, uninterrupted, and finally horror film script that has completely created imaginary American political detention camps that will not satisfy its flawless construction. The actors are amateur improvising with much broad characters. Sparks fly in the trial scene, in which each case is heard that Watkins judges keep the scenes far from the jury until the end of the trial. Watkins also claims that actors often express their own opinions, which certainly define frightening and the credibility of their performance. <br /> <br /> The film is widely criticized for killing those who see it. It is claimed that this movie is responsive and evidently the cause of conservatism and warfare American social problems. While these criticisms may be valid, it is important to consider the film being working on a mythological, figurative level, and it is perhaps the fact that the film is so shiny that it encourages such heated content in its content. In fact, the most important theme for movies is the problem of polarization. The 'conservative' judges and brutal law officers are on one side and 'liberal' criminals see each other clearly without any concession for each other. This is what really looks like about the movie. The new law and park itself is a situation where the mediation between the two political positions has been lost. <br /> <br /> Concerned over the main themes of government repression and the rights of civil rights of American citizens in the United States against opposition to war and fighting against Vietnam and the people who oppose war, Conservatives still strike similar strikes during patriotic law and identity card. It also attacks a disturbing tide with Guantanamo Bay's news footage and the treatment of Iraqi detainees with the help of forces. <br /> <br /> The threat of domestic 'terrorism' is a troubling issue that the film can not fail to connect with the current attitude. It is no wonder that the film has a distraction distribution history, it has become extremely extremist due to its content, but the film is so annoying that it can be so relevant even today that the wait is nothing to do. Penalty Park is a movie that you have to fight to show anywhere and it demands your attention.
