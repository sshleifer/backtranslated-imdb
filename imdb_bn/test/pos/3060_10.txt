What would anyone say about this picture? Brooks Brooks forgot to be a brilliant comedian and when you see it, he makes a fun movie. <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw, I cried so hardly. Everything about it is fun. <br /> <br /> Although "Robin Hood: Man in Titles" is not my favorite comedy (this spot is taken by "Real Genius"), it arrives in my book. So go see it! If you do not spend sunny full time, at least you will spend drooling over Elreees all the time.
