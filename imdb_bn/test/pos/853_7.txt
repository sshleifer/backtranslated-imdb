Jungle is more of an adventure than a science fiction movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> An expedition is investigated and one of these members is sent, an American predator is suspected to be extinct which is jealous by these elephant Mammoths Is. The first one does not trust him, but when the mammoth ends, they do it. An earthquake eliminates them. <br /> <br /> The jungle is shot on the location of India and has many beautiful scenery and some good Indian songs, some of which contain songs that are continuing with the movie. Mammoths actually have practical coats and tall elephants with tall tasks. These include Rod Cameron, Caesar Romero (The Lost Continent) and Marie Windsor (moon cat female). <Br> <br /> The jungle is visible and valuable for viewing, for music. Very enjoyable <br /> <br /> Ratings: 3 stars out of 5.
