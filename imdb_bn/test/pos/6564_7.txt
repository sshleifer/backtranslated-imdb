Often when Monga is translated into live action, the translation is missing quite a bit. However, it remains a very entertaining film. Authentic is unusual and it is presented in the traditional, quiet, different level in Japanese film (O!). Special effects are less than 70s camps, but it adds to the film's comic book mind. I will not recommend this movie to everyone, if you are familiar with other Japanese horror movies like "Evil Dead's Trap" (and enjoyed), this movie will appeal to you.
