Uzumaki (which is Japanese for "spiral" or "virtual") has ever seen one of the most stupid movies. A city obsessed and then some really desperate way consumed all by the pattern of Vortex. Fingertips are cut, people commit suicide washing machines ... just wild and crazy Japanese awful. Perhaps as "ring" as mentally harmful. Generally not as scary as "The Eye", but the imagery is more sick than most of "The Eye". And not as the glory of "Anthology Story" ... but it's not like saying there is no amount of blood and neutral quantities. Seriously, you enjoy horror films and especially Asian awful - you must add your picture to this list. Some parts are slightly weird with sound effects (the story is a manga comic and it is taken from the show), but it really fits. In contrast to some of the films that make it very difficult to catch the original source ("the house of the dead"), it is completely done. You'll see the most original film ... just this year, but probably never. Recommended!
