I bought this movie from my local blockbuster for 99p. It was sitting in my video bookcase for less than a year. Then tonight I decided to watch it, the film was different from my expectation and I did not find any humor in it that I saw it was a great appearance that people have to deal with love relationships and sexual adaptation. Truly true psycho killer plots do not have any point in raising the tension until the end of the movie. I think that lesbian ladies playing a great job done. I followed his passion and what happened around him. Some people may have seen some things as interesting, but I really can keep myself in my place, love someone, but the more you try, the more they refuse. I thought it was a very moving film and well dealt with all the different sexuality. I expect something like bound and ganged: a love story, but it's a very different movie. Not for bits.
