For 51 years I have seen many television, but after weeks I did not have fun this week, as I was seeing Oz. Acting by the whole cast was nice. The writing was just perfect, each letter remained consistent during the six-year run. I enjoyed greatness and extreme violence. It can be a strange word, but occasionally, one of the stories finds out how to end the death and find it laughably. I especially enjoy the true romance and love between Beecher and Keller. Those two people really knew how to throw. I really hope that HBO will continue to show us this wonderful event again! I have seen every episode at least 4 times but I still wait till Tuesday and Thursday at 11pm. For an episode of this fun and very entertaining show.
