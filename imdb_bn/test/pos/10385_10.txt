I've never seen a bet movie like that. Not too rich for knowing senses too much for sensual perception but for intelligent perception. Antonioi is relatively versatile in his movies. Malkovich's so much biological, role is so true, the situation is so real. I've changed the view of my world after this movie. I'm an internship teacher in Tolstoy and Dostovskaya in Russia - and I'm sure Antonioi Raski feels good and funny, because I understand and understand his views. So I do not understand his less writing on IMDB. I am convinced, from Russia and our people, we love Antonio because of the positive sentiments of the romantic spirit and the surrounding reality
