Wow.This is a touching story! At first I saw Rescue Dawn. I did not like it. And now I've seen that person, Dieter Dengler, about whom this story is being told by Herzeg. Very influential A mob of data that has encountered the most reversed emotions in his life on this earth. This person has an extraordinary life LED. His story about the capture of Patet Lao / Vietkong and thus his grief may be the horrific but most impressive how to live his incredible desire to survive. On a hunting route, Deutter tells us in full-blown sentences about his terrible accident during our captivity ... He is a great storyteller and heerogg judges this courageous person as worthy. <br /> <br /> According to me, 'small data needs to fly' it's all! , Leave nothing to imagine, thus making an essential film 'Rescue Dawn'. Threats are not more real than Dieter Dengler's words. He was successful in drawing the whole picture.
