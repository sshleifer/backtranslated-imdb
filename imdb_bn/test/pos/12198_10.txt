Surface Best Tv I saw the series. The acting is great and enthralling the story. Every episode I left just waiting to see. I played Carter Jenkins well, especially playing Matt Bennet ... She is a very talented actor and I look forward to seeing her more work. <br /> <br /> I can not believe Surface has created only one season ... again the public has given me up. It is difficult to assume that a great show like this will be canceled, although great facts continue for years. The decision to cancel this show was really removed by anyone.
