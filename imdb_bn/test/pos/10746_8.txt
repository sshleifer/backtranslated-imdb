Dragon Mother (Jackie Chan) was scared, the fierce pirate freed in the sea of ​​Lo. Back to the land, he is appointed police force, where he is cleaning a local suburbs corruption and crime. Besides, he is trying to support the fate of Chinese patriots for their sympathy and revolutionary reasons. China's Manchu government is facing problems after these revolutionaries, and anyone who is standing in their way is in police force. After seeing this project I had great expectations for this movie but sadly I was a little disappointed. There are only very small steps compared to the first picture. The big end is just a good fight scene. That war scene is "place to gangsters" and its good, flying everywhere everywhere and throwing hard kicks and punches. Jackie Chan and his stunt team do not disappoint everyone here. The finishing line is very entertaining, Jackie Chan shows us why he is the best stuntman in the world. Really exciting stuff! The only bad thing in the end, the battles are very small and forgotten. Conclusion: Many fun moments, well-played and crazy stunts. But do not fight enough for a top rating.
