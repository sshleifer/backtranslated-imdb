Someone had to create the image. <br /> <br /> Wiki: Connection rules Wako proves evidence of stagnation in Texas, which led to the destruction of the branch's Davidic homestead and the alleged government cover-up. <<br> <br /> The first thing you need to know about this picture is the first thing: you can see short or annoying images. These shocks are not for value, but they explain the points about the way of death, as if you were present at the coroner's investigation. Second, you should know about this thing: two and a quarter hours, it is quite ponderous - especially if you already follow events closely at the same time. If you are not aware of any incident other than reporting in the media, or if you are the official official report of the only known story, then it can be seen.

Look at them.
