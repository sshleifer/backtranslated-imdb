It's one of the best action movies I've seen. The guinari script, Charlie / gentle mother 'Sam', was a fantastic screenplay, and Samuel L Jackson only used to laugh in all its ways with the help of a classic fishing. Of course, there were a few holes in the real story, but the quick flick kept at the end of your seat. <br /> <br /> I felt that Gina is a perfect choice for Sam's role. His versatile recent movie 'Stewart Little' as Charlie and actress is clear for her role as mother. Both Samuel and Zina were supported by David Morse, Brian Cox, sweet little Avon Zimma and new expatriates, Sexy Craig Bairko and Melina Conakardes. This film makes the evolution of strong female characters stronger and evolves evolution from traditional male / female stereotypes such as we saw Sam / Charlie (Davis) and Mitch (Jackson) after a disaster. <br /> <br /> Although I and many others liked this movie, it is fair to say that there will always be people who are not good and each one is for himself. I highly recommend this film to action fans, for her hilarious scenes and quick-action action.
