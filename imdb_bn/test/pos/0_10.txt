I went to the last few nights after coaxed this few of my friends. I would admit that I was reluctant to see it because of what I knew about Ashton Kutcher, he could only do a comedy. I was roasted. Jake Fischer's character played well in Kutcher, and Kevin Costner played Ben Randall with this professionalism. A good movie's sign it can make toys with our passion. That's exactly one of these. The entire theater (which was sold) was defeated by laughter during the first half of the movie and the second half was moved to tears. While coming out of the theater, I just did not see women in tears, but many older people also saw that none of them would cry. This movie was fantastic, and I recommend that you go see it before you judge.
