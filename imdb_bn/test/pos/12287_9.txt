I do not want to hide the movie for somebody, however, it imitates in many ways of living and if you are honest with yourself, you will be signed in at least a few scenes. <<br> <br /> Acting is not just credible, but convincing in a way that tolerates one of the characters. Moreover, it's funny, without trying it very hard. <br /> <br /> And, yes, I really believe a series has been issued here. Watch the movie, why you can understand. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended, especially if you like a movie that has real messages.
