Wonderfully good T.V. Ready for the thriller. I did not expect too much from this but glad to say it is one of its best. It features fast-paced and solid-acting and interesting events. <br /> <br /> The story is from the very beginning and you have been connected with many hits, you can not help but think the film is very interesting. <br /> <br /> The story of the character of Thiesen's character is difficult but its nightmare becomes a nightmare when his childhood friend becomes worse than his father's step. <br /> <br /> If you think it is a common disease in society, the "unknown" concept and its actions are annoying. A series of rapists does not respect the society or even their families, and this movie shows perfect illness and crime. <br /> <br /> My cow's flesh was unaware of the movie when the character of Thesene came back to the house of her disgusting husband after being released on bail. At that moment, he knew what he did with his little relative (played by the intelligent Alison Hannigan). But this is a common Hollywood scene that causes more problems. <br /> <br /> After climax scene shows Thesena after following her husband, when she is going to rape another, she calls the police, who comes in time to catch her. The closing tells us that the husband was given 99 years of imprisonment in the real life. <br /> <br /> The acting is also quite good, and Tiffany is always great and fantastic. The direction is very good.
