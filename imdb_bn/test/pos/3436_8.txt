In December 1945 a train left Berlin's central station in Berlin. It does not have much left when it comes. No train and some passengers are not. <br /> <br /> It is a black comedy directed by Peter Dal and they work for 40 seconds and photographs (B / W) such as they used to be in the period. The actors had lots of fun making it They are not many of the characters, as they were not in 40, but the story is well described and everyone has time. <br /> <br /> A deadly black and serious fun movie. If you do not think that the Swedes were able to humor it, see it.
