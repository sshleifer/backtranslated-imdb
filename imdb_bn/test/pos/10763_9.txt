I really enjoyed a lot of people. I accidentally discovered this movie, trying to find something interesting to search through my on-demand movie listings. This image is mostly classified in America, and it quickly draws your attention. Characters are smart and clear, and the story can not be confused with the usual Hollywood rules. <br /> <br /> The main protagonist Finn is a steady, but 15-year-old helpless who spent with his summer Oxford family. Donald Sutherland America's Seventh Rich Personal, Ogden C. Osborne, Father's Drama. Dean Lane Fins' mother, Ogren's friend who is a habitual cocaine user and a whore. Osbournes owns a big estate and thinks to live by their own rules. At first they seem to be impressive and sophisticated, but very rich people are different. They used to get their own way. The film is quite enjoyable mainly due to its glossy intelligent dialogue, superb acting and a story which takes an unexpected turn. This is a rated movie, so it's not quite healthy. <br /> <br /> Cast is excellent. Anton Yelchin is believable and sympathetic to the role of Finn's claim. Sutherland and Diane Lane have not been well. Incredible as Chris Grimes Osborn's grandson. Kristen Stewart is a fantastic grand girl as well. High quality movies.
