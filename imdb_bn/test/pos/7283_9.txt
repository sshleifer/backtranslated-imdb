Good movies, all the elements of a good movie were there, stories, actors, scripts, and directions. I had the edge of my seat full time. <br /> <br /> There is no question about it, a low budget movie, but I liked it more than big budget movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> Andrey Bagg is the game Martin Sanders, who is dealing with his unfaithful wife. Then a voice on the telephone and then just fear. <br /> <br /> Virginia Lustig is beautiful and brings a strong performance. He is an excellent part of the film. <br /> <br /> I like growing obscurity at the end, although we know that the main character can be involved, we look at everything from his point of view and ask: Who is the killer?
