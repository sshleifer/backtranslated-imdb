Magnificent Garuda Garbo is in the top form in his first box. He enjoys good support from the rest of Charles Baker's restless sailor who retains his heart. Miss Garbo gives a great performance, which usually works as a widow of the sea captain who returned fifteen years later. Also cast that is great actress Mary Dressler. A great movie!
