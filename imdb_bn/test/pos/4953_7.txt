Patriotism in the 1980's, and in some cases zincogam was flat, it was quite high. "Can we win this time" from the famous one line from Rambo: how many people can be felt at the time of Part II of the first blood. Iron eagles went straight to the kids, dressed in the style of the film, "We are good, your bad ... to blow up the walls and make the house go flat" to the walls of the walls, to decorate the rumba, rocky and most of the guns attract an old crowd. . Canadian writer and director Sidney J. The Fury brings out all the things you love and hate about that period. Pants kicks up to 80 songs (never die, Gypsy's roads etc), sometimes almost incredible action adventure. Iron Eagle was successful for one reason ... it was F.U.N - fun. This is the type of movie that you can turn on and sit back and enjoy the complete ridiculous 80 moments. It does not have to worry about whether it can actually happen, or if acting is true then it's funny ... and that's exactly what you can ask in this movie ...
