'Boogie Knights' used the title of Dick Digler as a metaphor for celebrities collected in America's shameful past in the past, which was formed with an unexpected increase in pornography, which has resulted in a large number of corrupt youth. His main character highlights features from various assortments of genuine actors, which involves himself in many illegal things that are cut off by Hollywood celebrities and are often exploited by the press. Looks like a long story may appear! True Hollywood Story Special Drug, Sex and Violence - American Dream. But what has happened must come down, and it is big, it is difficult. <br /> <br /> Dirk Diggler's dream is huge, as other valuable resources in his body. Dirk's real name is Eddie Adams, a California who dreams of becoming a star. He believes that God gave each person a great talent, and his gift is a rather unusual one. After leaving the mother, Eddie left the house and Joostna Hacker (Bart Reynolds), an adult film director who worked with him. Eddie eventually became one of the biggest porn stars in Horner's films, representing the biggest "actor". With the new success, the AD is said to have to discover a new alias for himself, and so Dirk Degler is born. <br /> <br /> Dedu himself is based primarily on the infamous porn star John Homs, whose life story was adapted in 2003 with Wonderland, which played the role of Waller Keller. 'Boogie nights' are better than each other, it proves that pornography-related movies can be targeted by annoying visitors: regular movie-passengers. <br /> <br /> This image was published in 1977, in the artistic era era, pornography - filmmakers truly believe that they can compensate for the low points of X-Rate features while maintaining a deep and gentle atmosphere. In this case, the film's director - Paul Thomas Anderson - employed a very artistic method for this project, which led to the unreal and artistic film about a time in American history, when Smith was indeed both unreal and artistic. Anderson's style is so deep, and so unique, we soon think that if we were to rebuild the first era. In a moment, we are unaware of the timeline that we have faced in the film. <br /> <br /> Not everybody was happy with the set of 'Boogie Knights'. Before filming, Anderson repeatedly contacted Reynolds, who asked him several times to play Horner's role. Finally, Reynolds agreed, but claimed that the film was horrific and the worst role of his career was universally denied, before the nomination for Best Supporting Actress Academy Award and suddenly stopped. One year ago, Anderson suffered headlines from Sydney / Hard 8. He liked the next headline for his film, and New Line's idea was that the ex-market was more marketable. He largely lost the war, and Anderson escaped title disputes at this time by inserting the words "Boogie Knights" into his movie with this character's face. <br /> <br /> The film's casting is one of its best aspects. Paul Thomas Anderson is here regularly, as well as a complete top-genuine cast of first-timers. To name more famous stars: John C. Rayley, Philip Simmur Hoffman, Louis Guzman, William H. Messi, Heather Graham and Julian Moore. But the entire movie is basically under Mark Wahlberg, such as Eddie, who was surprised by his role. Wahlberg, previously known for his career career and disappointing Hollywood pursuits, has all the necessary features to illustrate such a character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Anderson knows to make her listener impressive and to take full control of each scene. When Jack Hornner meets Eddie's first, Anderson Belldrop stars use a symbol of upcoming things and the hidden symbolism as intensely as fast as possible. The opening scene is three minutes, a long tracking shot to follow Jack and Amber at a night club, where most of the letters are first launched. It reminds me of Robert Alman's 'The Player' discussion about the shopping shots - It works so brilliantly at Boogie Knights, and Anderson knows what he's doing behind the camera. His style is fast in Martin Scorsese veins, where the shots quickly jeep, but never rush. Incidentally, Anderson mentions two classic squares shots - Closer de Niro 'Raging Baul' from the mirror and tracking nightclubs from 'Goodfire'. Anderson is a young, growing director who despite her age is remarkable mature in stories and aspects. Her first feature film 'Hard At', was significantly more intelligent and shocking, 'Boogie knights' even more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film was so extremist that it seems almost genuine Is. Boogie Night strengthens us with our unwanted content, sometimes limits it to pornography, it's far more sophisticated than just the trash. It's a shining, wonderful modern day composition which is brain-clear and clear as stylish as it is. Finally Anderson's Best Film and Most Important - And Most Important - The Last Decade Project.
