I first heard of this show in 2005, first seen online and then (and of course, buying) is usually a great, BBC tie-in book. Then I got the DVD; It's not frustrating! I had hoped for a long time that anyone would create a science fiction program that emphasized the adventures of inventions instead of aliens, laser gunfights and other Hollywood 'boogian' gimmicks! Thank you, Joe Eharne (your doctor works, and Ultravail - Mini series; not a bad movie with the same name)! Forced me to write this (2 years later) I saw Sunshine last night. And Space Odesi (similarly about 2/3% of the way) Fardi Kruger appeared in the same family in 2010! Space Odesky stood as a positive example of how to do true real fiction film; More science, less fiction! ODESSi (like Sanscine) also faces the horrific discovery of new planets with astronautic flaws (Joe's failed Eva, Ivan's Friday activities, spotlight with mission control) and unexpected hazard (Martian radiation spike). I could easily see it in a theater (i-mac, anyone?). And above all of it, only the space vistas jaw was not beautiful in the jaw, but the letters were drawn very nicely. I saw their interpolation more realistic (Icarus; the fool's name for the solar mission - someone who read the Icarus legend ??) than the wall-slamming heurrenians of Sansen Icarus 2 crew. Sometimes it takes an extraordinary film to force one to see a good film again. As Armchair astronaut, I would trade my passage at Icarus for the Paggas seat. However, in all honesty, Sunshine's visual, quite stunning, and quite memorable. That's why I became so strongly converted to succeed as a honest-honest-film movie. So, although this review is often a behind-the-scenes review of Sansin, I hope to read what it means; The strongest support for a BBC telefilm where the biggest budget, leakage cinematic glasses fail. Space Odyssey (here missile sound for American planets) makes the hunger for science-fiction and distribution of food. I've enjoyed a very pseudo-documentary approach. For time-lag / light-motion points, if you pay attention, they are given the address. Where Sunsin dissolves, Odesi keeps its cold. If you are considering going to the movies for another dose of SunSHINE, stay; Instead go for a true space ODYSSEY!
