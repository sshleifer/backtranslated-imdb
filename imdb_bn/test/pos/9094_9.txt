Price of the Rock alone is worth the price !! A DJ fan would love this movie (though it's a short one) and Camio from John C. Rayley, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, MetLife, and Dave Grohl (only recognizable) proves that the D Rock is hard for anyone. Even the DO ... Saskatchet / Mashroom view will become instant classic (I do not want to say anymore and accused of putting spoilers here). Supporters of the original HBO series will take a look at some of D's primary screen appearances in characters like D and Lee and Open Mike Host. I only played a couple of songs from the first album and wishing to drop 'completely sucks' from the POD album is also a shame. The other that is this rock of the movie. Follow D!
