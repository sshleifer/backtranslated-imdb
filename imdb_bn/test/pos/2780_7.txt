I have now removed many students to sign up for the exchange of Barcelona students and when they do not have such exciting time, they are frustrated. <br /> <br /> The movie was enjoyable. Obviously to see Audrey Tatou is always a joy. <br /> <br /> However, I have a very strong problem with the movie part. The lesbian roommate tells Javier that women want to dominate physically (which I bring to the problem) and she shows that she guarantees to get a woman. Javier then tried to grab a butt on a bashful married friend - who started saying "I'm married, I'm married" but who are successful in grabbing the butt anyway ?? Suddenly he shouted, "Yes, they're going on the bench of Parake Guele." I found this really really offensive. In addition it is very stereotyped. How many times have we seen the scenes where women say "no" but obviously it does not mean? There is no min. Grabbing butts / physical dominance is not going to make it right <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, suck it, slut "(or something like that). <br /> <br /> This section really destroyed the movie for me.
