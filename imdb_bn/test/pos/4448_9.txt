Easily Luciano Fluchi's most respected film, "The Torture of a Dullling", is very famous for its intense subject, horror imagery and strong story. Younger boys started to be killed and become a small Italian village due to terrorism, divorced a devoted group within the mysteries with confused and determined authorities. It was a strange mystery? Spastic Voodoo Witch? One hookers? Rich girl? Anyone else? Contrary to representation of most fan frequent violent content in the film - I consider it a lot more plotters; Memorable bleeding (involving chains and boards) only featuring a real moment. No movie abstains from positive qualities of distributing this movie. Phulasi has proven itself to find out the hell of a dark and annoying gaelbo by 'nose' in child killings, black magic, and of course a wonderful whole ... although I love Phulasi's "Liza In Women's Special Love" skin and " New York Ripper "," Do not torture a ducking ", affects the rhythm style of a moody and engaging murderer!
