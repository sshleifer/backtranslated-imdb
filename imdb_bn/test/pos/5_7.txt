I just went to see this movie because I always liked Kevin Coster. I think Ashton B Butterfly did a great job of impact. Unfortunately, even though these two actors did not perform well, some of the great acting moments were missing here. Some of the scenes were not only believable and there were not enough line support lines. <br /> <br /> Although the film could have an impact on the effects of Hurricane Katrina, this effect of film was not very short. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, a little horrible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> DVD has been viewed.
