It's fun to see a young James Cagney doing his thing. He played the weight of the chipset weight and measurement, who took his work very seriously, based on the feet of a group of infamous politicians. He is given to the world, but keeps his integrity. She is beaten and set up, but that's the problem. We do not know if he is really in danger. They say that he is a spot, but still moving around the cartoon blanche and thinks what he should do. Sometimes he is so radioactive that does not do much to protect himself. His colleagues are in the police department but nothing else is almost corrupt. He perseveres (certainly very good to be true), of course, and we pull for him. The problem for me is a lack of permanent mystery. It would have been better if its name was to be deleted. Even when he drops in the depth, it is rejected by his wife. It's still fun with imploding kind of bad guys Seeing it hard to see his tough posting of the people.
