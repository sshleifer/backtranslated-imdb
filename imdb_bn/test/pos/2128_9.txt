This movie was very cute and perfectly suitable for little girl. My nephew watched it non-stop by stuck, and as a result I saw it almost four times. I can not get enough of it. Good looking CGI images, good humor, and ballet illustrations are nice. Although the line of the story is a few holes, no little girl will rise above them, and as an adult, the film is so charming that someone rarely makes the notice. Remember that this is a Barbie movie, and although occasionally Chasey, in my experience, it depends on other high standards that other Barbie Princess films have been set up. I would suggest that someone has a girl who is always wanted to be a princess. It also teaches a good lesson as well. Everyone is special and different in their own way, and everyone can make a difference.
