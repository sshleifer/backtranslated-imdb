I really like this one really. I know, it is now widely involved in how Pliich's line of plot and movement is moving, but it was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> We have come to many to find the horrible cheese of 70s and 80s so bad that they flicks they are good. We have something that they 'good', they suck, and then we have something that is very bad, they're just bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They cross each line inappropriate until they are illusory and they Pay for <br /> <br /> I would not normally be able to give such a movie, but these girls were missing in the 1970's: Dieti, Spani-Claude and Fit. This horrible terrible horror is not wide; They look awesome in booty shorts. <br /> <br /> I find it 10 out of kids, 9 kids.
