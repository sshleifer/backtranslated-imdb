K-Pack should be a heart warming film. The story is about a mysterious mental patient prototype, directed by Kevin Speesey, and his unbelieving psychologist. Powell, played by Jeff Bridges. Both of them have very friendly ties, and Dr. Powell can not help him increase his relationship, but his mysterious patient is surprised that there is something else, who said that he came from another planet called K-Pac. This movie is very funny, and Kevin Spacey dragged a well-placed liner in its second nature. K-Pax is a smart film, and I was not sure where to go. Finally, I think about the small things of my life and we often allow surprises and magic of everyday life. I kept the theater inside a warm vague feeling, and for one day family and couples, K-Pack is a great movie, which will not be disappointed. I highly recommend this film to anybody interested in shiny, action-packed, festive fests tired more than anything.
