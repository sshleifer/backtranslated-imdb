This is a movie before people start breaking about this movie (who are playing rugby)! People have been given Hollywood treatment for entertainment, and so those who play rugby (including themselves) will naturally choose a hole in this dance drama dance. Together it draws attention to morals and ideas behind a decent movie and rugbye game. <br /> <br /> This film is based on a real team, a real trainer and his work, which directs children to the right direction in the future, and based on the true people who played for the Highland team. This is a film of ordinary film that is confused with a character and eventually finds its way through the rugby medium again in the right direction. Generally a pleasant film that is enjoyable but it has errors in its image illustration. However, I said it is a film under Hollywood treatment.
