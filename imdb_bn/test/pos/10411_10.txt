One after another why they say 80's name, "The Awesome 80's" quality television. Wonder Years, War of the Worlds (Series), V, Amazing Stories, and more, have always left us an impression of being "lucky", in that time, always find ways to resurrect themselves. On top of that, Monsters comes here! A series is quite unique in its own, and a theme fully donated - monsters. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the classic show or if you have a strong attraction for the movie, it is absolutely complete for you. You can find this rare jewel. <br /> <br /> Even new generations will be scared with some episodes of its sadness, this is the dominant influence and unreasonable use of the power and simplicity of his stories. I guarantee, because I'm 23 :) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
