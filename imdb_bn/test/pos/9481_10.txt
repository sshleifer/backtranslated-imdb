After waiting a few years for a specific collection of Led Zeppelin Perfomance on the video, finally the fans have finally been rewarded with the best concert video! There is a better "song left" than incompatibility, this video includes performances from less than 5 different places for a decade. It includes rare interviews and TV appearances. Assuming the source material used in the sound quality is amazing. And the video quality is even more impressive. It is a must for ABSOLUTE no led Zeppelin fan.
