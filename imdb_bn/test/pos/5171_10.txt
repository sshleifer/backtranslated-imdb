It was good to see John Denver again, though he had gone a few years ago. I saw this movie very heartening and sitting in the fire of a cold winter fire in a great movie, which remembers all the Christmas months. Georgetown, Colorado's scenes were fantastic and immediately wanted to move there. I have been sitting here on my own mountain in California, watching stories and intrigues. I hope all my mother and I enjoy watching this short film. Happy Christmas! See a great film for all the families too. NY and tell others about it. Thanks for the memories. We need more pictures to come out of Hollywood.
