Talking about the misfortune of Dapper, Waller, 78-year-old Czech Man, who is helplessly vomited and vulnerable to all his people who know him in his insulting way while planning his funeral, facing Walla. Centakas Hana (Broadski) shows you how children can kiss you when your feeling is felt in 78 and lift and express gratitude for that because she is walking on her street during this day on this warm and bright look. A person's creative, ridiculous, but social way to enjoy life in an acceptable way, which refuses to enter the old man's house. "Ottoman Spring" is a breakthrough, fine comedy with messages for all ages, which will make the maximum appeal with more mature foreign movie buffs. (B ++)
