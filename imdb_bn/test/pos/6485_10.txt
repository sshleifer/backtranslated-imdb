"Beat is very strong ... now we are like deaf mutants - like them", Rex Bhauras Armin <br /> <br /> I am surprised that the film is hanging together. I have to first discuss the qualities of "bit" and why you can see this picture now. <br /> <br /> Do not make any mistake, this film is in the original sense of cheesy and "bad". The story is overwhelming, silly poems, and acting inconsistent. <br /> <br /> But the churches of this movie - these components form recipes for the most interiors of the 80's cheeses. <br /> <br /> If the reference to "deaf mutants" does not cling to your interest, then perhaps it will be: "Rex Bhaurahas Armin" is a name? This is such a great name (for North American audience) that I said to myself, "The name of this fridge film is also Firgin." <br /> <br /> Good, behind the "bit" "Rex Bhauras Armaan" is so impressive impressive that "money" and "symbolism" are not so much cautiously revealed by Bert Waxman (you hate the way you hate to go Guidance consultants). I will not waste the revelation behind the name of Rex, but please do not be too excited, okay? The overall acting is incompatible (John Savage - who plays "the respected teacher". That said, is not isolated from the acting film. Why? There is a crisis among the performers of each actor that they respect the characters. So while performances may suck, you still have left the impression that the impressions are trying to do their best work. As a result, the sincerity of the actors is successful where their performance fails (which is often). <br /> <br /> In this film, respect for "beat poetry" is bad, bad, bad. But it's a good, good, good thing when it comes to entertainment. Do you really enjoy the "good quality" or "more respectful" poet - especially in such a movie? <br /> <br /> People who are bowling (think of drills they can read in our high school- "contaminate youth", politically conservative and excluded from a critical analysis, etc.), even if you Poetry or "Auntie" does not like movies ("intellectuals" posting), but certainly (and should) appreciate LUDICROUS dress in a WANNABE ART film you can do !!!! How can you enjoy the following? <br /> <br /> "Do you think of dinosaurs? The scars of a woman on the head are bad, bad woman is so sad that she washes her hands and then waits." Today's door, yes - today! <br /> <br /> Some examples of this extraordinary poetry have been generously spread across "bits." But what about the story, you ask? <br /> <br /> Well, the story is overwhelming. The beauty of this picture In addition to flash, stereootype and predictable plot points, there are really unique elements in the plot / story to keep things interesting, Rex Who? Where did he come from? The deaf mutant? Invisible angels? What Billy and Kate really understand what Rex is saying Is it supposed to understand the audience Rex and her poetry attire? (I saw the movie several times and I still have everything <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Sincerely acting and a "gang violence in mythological way" is a perfect combination that can sometimes be preserved through a movie. <br /> <br /> Bonus for fans of classic NYC hardcore: Cro-Magos creates a rare movie appearance as "Iron schools" and this is a hoot for some of their songs. I wish to include them in more concert footage, but perhaps the "collector version" included on the DVD is an "extra" I fantasize. <br /> <br />
