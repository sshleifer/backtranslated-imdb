Although the video box for copies of this movie claims that people have turned inside, it is completely false. Actually, in addition to the opening segment, the film is not even a horror movie. It is much more like the adventures of Du McLuare's adventure, the madness of the fish, and the mad scientists with its wealth. Obviously, this film is not a work of art, but it is interesting to see ... only should be careful that the start is quite serious.
