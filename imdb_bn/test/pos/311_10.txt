This movie has changed the art of film making, telling a complicated story in a powerful new way. The film combines brutal realityism with fantasy, and modern warfare attacks the technicolor's strange curiosity. The film does not use music as a collected score, but as a real part of the visual scene from the speaker, the radio etc. As the inspiration of classic pieces as Coppola literature, takes scenes and letters and keeps them in a completely different environment. That's a cute and brave thing to do. He then took a superstar, Brendo, gave him a fortune, and made him films so you can see his face. The purity required for this step is surprising, and it works nicely. This movie belongs to the top ten.
