Shepitko is not the wife of Russian filmmaker Aleem Klimov, who is more commercially known as the 1984 film Low and And, which is generally considered to be one of the most realistic fighting films, which is notable for its intense poetic intensity, but I believe it lacks even The internal complexity of greater Russian film, which is just graph  কের বাইরের ভয়াবহ ভয়গুলি পরীক্ষা করে না, তবে সেগুলি প্রকৃতপক্ষে অনুপ্রেরণামূলক চিত্রগুলি ব্যক্ত করে বা এমন ব্যক্তিদের ছোট গোষ্ঠীগুলিতে মনোযোগ দেয় যা এই মানবজাতির ভিতরে সম্পূর্ণ উন্মাদনাকে প্রতিফলিত করে, যার সমাপ্তি কেবল আতঙ্ককর। Bullets are flying and due to the acute credence of the words, the dead bodies are dying in a gunfight, where the intensity of the film does not add up full time, focuses on the face, leaving a few soldiers in the food, occupying a panic-stricken population, the hungry children with the patriarchal mothers, all Throw in an immense landscape of infinite white snow Flying Cranes (1957), it turned a Russian army back into retreat, it was often wounded when it was a traumatic event at the start of the war. Nazis of Germany are moving to the Russian countryside, who terrorize citizens, steal their food, force them to turn their informational eyes and ears into force. Under the forest cover, Russian soldiers were kept secret, but forced to send food campaigns from neighboring farms. This film follows two soldiers, from the beginning, it is almost impossible to miss, because there is still some food left in the cold winter. A healthy and fit, as Vladimir Gostyuchin Roebuck, another, Boris Platnikov such as Sonnichov, a tuberculous sounding cough and finally dies slowly by a bullet on his legs, but his partner heroically rescues him. They walk through the knee deep snow, as well as on some roads with insufficient protection against Russia's inadequate protection, along with other Russian movies, nature itself becomes their most difficult enemy. <br /> <br /> Spolar !! Everything is reduced to the point of survival. When they reach their destination, the farm gets destroyed and goes to a state of debris, and the next farm, fearing Nazi retaliation by an old Soviet collaborator, moves forward in the occupied territories. Partition soldiers consider him afraid, but they eventually lead to prisons and bring them to a nearby Nazi camp in the nearby town and help them conceal them, along with the proud and protective mother (Ludmila Polykova). Tarkovsky Stalwart Anatoly Solinstein appeared as the interrogator Portnov, a Russian teacher from a nearby academy was sympathetic to Nazi. Russians tortured and executed fellow Russians, the depth of misuse of war, and SolanTunes is brighter in cruel roles, which he is perfectly suited. From what we can see, the Nazi officers force each other closely to chat with them, even in this group, he is an outsider, rather than a master of such kind of black clothes who regularly send men to their graves. Visitors are not seen from the incident of torture on Sattnikov, who do nothing except condemnation, Raibaq speaks freely in hopes of saving his life, but both condemn him to death, although Rebecc was given the opportunity to serve the German Reich. Police Agent's mother, an elderly associate, and a child have been added to this group, living together together on the last night, where they discuss the ability of a soldier's mission, patriot, mother, a coward, or a partner. Everyone seems to be driven by a painful need to live separately, but Tatnikov proposes himself as a neutral example, trying to convince his offense to free others, where the appropriate title reflects his spiritual liberation. <br /> <br /> The next morning, a mild sunny portnabha think about them suddenly to agree to speak to mock them, but does not abandon anyone other than raibaka, who changed side to save his life, thinking his thoughts reasonably That he is alive, at least he has the chance to flee. But there is no pain? From this pain? What happened is shown with fine subtlety and poetic grace, as we witnessed the betrayal of the war without the exclusion of one shot, the death penalty was executed in a public view, where the villagers were forced to bear testimony in the gun. . The speed of the film and the intensity of the heart are intense, because it did not face any moment of fierce shot by Vladimir Ghnov (who died in the same car accident), which is fully composed of visible scenes and a large number of camera movements. It is in close range with the portrait, especially a scary young boy, who is seen by condemned men, who have created a new connection with the next generation as well as talking about something, which is spoken by Alfred Shintt mentally dangerous music. Amazingly annoying music from Kubrick since 2001: A Space Odesi (1968). The sound design of this movie is extremely advanced and unique, in which the off-screen terminorally releases raw nerves at every moment, dogs flutter, air blows, bullets fired, laughing sadly in Germany's Nazi clutter of Nazi Germany or helplessly , Which only ratchets horrible tension up to insane heights. In many ways, like the imitation of Dreer's ARC (1928), the entire dementia has been released here, you have a relentless understanding that you do not like, yet you will be forced to do any. Ultimately, the wonderful inner thoughts are expressed in a stupid manner, where the ambitions of the dead speak volumes, where the head stays awash with explosions like a blast, but only silence fills the dry air inside the grief. And a deep sense of harm.
