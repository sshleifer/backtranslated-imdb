One of the reviewers that I prefer the phrase "British Post War Urban Poverty" is the phrase. "Big Picture" ("The Antarctic Scott" (1948) and "Milan" ("The October Man") (1947) "The Long Memory" and "Peace" (1956)). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This apparently played "Eric Ambler" style plot John Mills with Dr. Howard Lattimar, who promised to meet his friend Charles (Invisible), the promised German actress, Frieda Beeldon (Lisa Danley) at the airport. Unclear "reporter" Jeff Windsor (Lionel Jefferies) is in his counseling room and offered him a lift, but when he was tracking the actress, Windsor had told him that he is already waiting for the car !!! (Some are going fishy !!!). To let Howard leave for his date And it does not seem to be anything else about him. <br /> <br /> The next night he found his body while coming out of the house, Further, he saw that his friend Charles could not resign him, he still does not seem to exist between New York and Windsor. Previously on a patient, Mrs. Ambler (Rennie Ray) who referred to him by Doctor George Kimber (Marvin Johns) Speaking of her repeated dream of finding a candle and a bronze candle with a brass base. This is a real nightmare for Howard, but during his interview with Detective Inspector Den (Roland Calvar), he denied all knowledge of the conversation - later Campstick was found at Howard's Daimler boots. <br /> <br /> When Howard falls short, Robert Brady (Wilfried Hyde-White) sees him. He calls himself a "friend" - he has a picture of Windsor that he wants to trade for a box at Freda Airport Howard. Howard returns to the flat, when Charles Ring and Howard phones, then an anonymous attacker assaulted him and stole the matches !!! Who can believe that - there is nothing to hide !!! <br /> <br /> This is a top thriller - mostly not in the same class as "October Man", but he is doing the best with John Mills - playing ordinary men caught in the impossible mysteries !!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommend.
