This game was actually one of the main reasons I got a PS2. I think today is playing Soul Edge (sometimes called Soul Blade) and I put a finger on it. <br /> <br /> I played original Soul Calibur but could not play it for huge amounts. Time. But I bought the game version of Soul Calibur 2 and it really hid me in the series and when I heard the third of Soul Calibu, I was happy. This game still gives us the classic characters of Matsurugi, Cervantes, Nightmare and Taki. However, it adds new letters like Jasmalel, Tire and unnecessary night terror. (Tales of Tales of Souls) "The Thunder of the Sward" mode is a new feature that I really like, it can be quite challenging in the later versions, but it is a good addition to the series. <br /> <br /> There are few missions in the Soul Arena mode that you have to fight a certain enemy in certain situations. (The exception is "the ultimate battle" in which you must defeat only Night Terrorism), another great touch that makes the game even more fun. <br /> <br /> In some scenes, you should do some views to get a different result, it can dodge / block an attack or get a good finish. (Each character has two ends) Above all, this is a great game and if you are a supporter of fighting in the games then I would recommend it.
