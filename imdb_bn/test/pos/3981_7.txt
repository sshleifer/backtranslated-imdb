I do not think that I have yet seen a whole-life movie where high school schools are building their own colleges, only to influence their parents. Nowadays, movies are remixes or seagulls, or plots that are used in various movies. This one has an original story line and it follows a comedy film followed by it only lightens the deal. With these good thoughts mixing stories and smiles, this is a good movie. Now I look good, but while going to the theater, I was thinking of some sexuality with some other drug / beer / fraternial party (an "American pie" whick of the word), but I was amazed. To add it, I've enjoyed the movie and shuffling through the papers for your movies next time, look "attracted" during the show. If you want to laugh loudly, that is.
