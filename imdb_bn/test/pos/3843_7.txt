After watching The Aristocats: In the special edition of two packs with Fox in the Hound, I liked these two films since childhood because I decided to buy it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This can not be a five-star classic, but it makes an interesting movie and a good evening entertainment . It's a bit darker, more serious, a light refinery from Disney Classic. Aristochet tries to be a light-hearted musical comedy, and I think it's almost successful. <br /> <br /> The story does not really matter much and I do not think that this plot is particularly strong, but it is certainly not weak. Animations and backgrounds, like Disney's 70's, have some scratches in some places, but it has a rustic, old-fashioned charm about it. <br /> <br /> Aristocats are the most powerful points of character, music, and mood. Music is very memorable - Try getting your head out 'Everyone wants to be a cat' Songs Sherman Brothers wrote, who also did the music of The Jungle Book. There was a song called 'She Saver Fate Allon' which was going on in the film, but sadly it did not become the ultimate feature. It's a shame, because I think it will fit very well. <br /> <br /> The characters are unforgettable. Voice by Thomas O'Malley Phil Harris, and is basically a feline form Baloo. Eva Gabr dances to this warm and maternal feeling and kids' voices really sound like kids and an actor does not imitate the child's voice. Secondary characters here by dozens and yet you end up understanding their personality. Adger, 'Valenews' Butler plays a similar role as Crowlla De Vill, but in fearful situations, often more humiliating than terrible to the end. Although he is a bad person, he is also of the same love. <br /> <br /> Two British Hijies - Abigail and Amilia were really cracking on my crazy (and drunk) uncle. I also like dogs, who have been debating about the 'leader'. I could go, but I will not loot it. But I can tell you, Aristocat is fun and everybody has the basic toilet to entertain without humor. <br /> <br /> The following lines - Aristocats may not be Disney's main success, even their most powerful films can not be 70s (the award is a tale between Rescuers and Whinnie's many campaigns). But it is an enjoyable spanking and entertaining sure. If you are looking for an amazing job in the industry, you might be better off to see Bumblebee. But if you want a funny night, Aristocats are the way to go. It's an impressive and lovable film and it dislikes impossible. Enjoy! (And also a movie that is not seen as a cat's fame is also good.)
