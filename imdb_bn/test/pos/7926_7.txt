This was Eisenstein's first completed project for ten years. This movie was played during the 13th century German invasion of Russians (Titanic Knights - I think). In 1938, the second world war took place near Russia and Germany's progress in Eastern Europe. There are some incredible scenes, the most notable scenes of the end of the film, and the children are thrown into the pit of fire, but it is not easy observation. The film drags and is not consistently brighter as "Potemkin" or "Ivan the Terrible". Sometimes Eisenstein clip is good. But his glow is present, and it will "definitely see" for supporters of Agentenstein and film historians. His best Russian promotion.
