This film is a good start for the beginner who has never seen a 'silent film' and who believes that quality films have started with their efforts. They do a favor for themselves without expanding their horizons. 'Silent Film' is an art form to play pantoemime, which is different from sound film and stage, it may stand on its own merit. <br /> <br /> A legendary history of the relation between the French poet 'Francois Vilan' and 'King Louis XI' with Bellevade Rug (1927). The 'Deuce of Bergaddy' will be reduced to feudalism through the 'Wilson' stimulant 'King Louis', and the King will establish the head of state and the beginning of modern France. <br /> <br />, JOHN lead by Barmi (Yes, Drew's grandfather). This is an expression for those who only remembered him for the corrosive actor 'Larry Reintele' in Diner at Ageite (1933) or Ham in the Wife Women (1940). Fit, trim with the 'Great Profile', still proof that he has a screen command. In his first American film co-starring 'Louie XI', 'Quadrupter Spider' explains the Conrad Void. These performances do not give a single duality to the Titans, each one inch. In his first film, Character Actor and Duffer Angelo Rossito have his latest, MAD MAX Bind Thunderdom (1985). There are other character actors that will easily continue to sound that are picked. <br /> <br /> United Artists did not spend any expenditure on this handsome production under the supervision of William Cameron Menezes. Dresses, sprays and sets are well done and Douglas FAIRBANKS are not exaggerated like productions. There is a touch of reality here. The DVD we saw from 'Delta Entertainment' came from the copy. Although its musical soundtrack was 'not restored' it was clear and the print was only bogged down by black-spot (dirt) and drop-out. The only major loss after the end of the rock is water. There is also a version of "Kino" which can be a good quality because they have a big restore in their prints. Check them well. We think it must be a 'must-have', especially if you do not have 'silence' in your collection. This is a good place to start.
