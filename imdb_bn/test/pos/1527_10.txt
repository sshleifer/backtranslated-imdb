It's an amazing movie and using a few actors and sets too cute. It is very frustrating - physical and mental torture (both explicit and intrinsic) is mixed with calm and even flexible stretches. So awful is always unexpected, and brutal. I'm not soft, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen. This photo message is certainly delivered with a sledgehammer. This photo I always remember both actors.
