When I first saw this movie, I expected "our boys" to be clever, and like an extended version of the TV show. I'm not back then "get it". However, after a few years, at the age of 70, PAR-TAY smoked some of the ingredients, inhaled and with a lot of towel, "Head" was late at night, after a party called "Yed". We've seen it and finally "HEAD" was able to understand what all was. It misused their own show, as shown in a song, "A pictorial image". Davy Jones writes in his Autobiology, "They made monkeys from me", he openly acknowledged that everyone in this movie was taking weeds of smoking at night. They have fun with themselves, society, everything! Great movie! Tho, as a 52-year-old granny, I'm no more "submerged", I still see this movie when I want good luck !!!
