I do not understand why everyone hates this movie, except that they only envy them that their music carriers have never stopped like Mega Popster Aaron Carter. Similar to or more young people have seen more success in their young life, yet it seems normal to make a movie. Lou Pearlman and the company have been known to exploit their pop genres, do you think Justin Timberlake's TV movie model is involved in Bihar? This movie is not big scale and impressive but it is not supposed to be. It is not trying to impress people or win Emmy Award, it was released straight from the DVD. It's just a cute little movie about a strange teenager who has got her dreams with her favorite popster; I do not deny that you know a lot about the dream at any time or any other favorite singer. It's sweet and gentle and I congratulate you about sex, violence, and pornography, which does not seem to be going on in more of today's movies. Where's stupid? Where's the line? There are dozens of plays coming out on these days because Terri is a big market for the company, at least it is more tolerant to me than the Bratz (Wuk Slutz), which is "Oh mah gaud!" Tank top and compared to Gore Fest movies like mini skirts and shawl Well, I feel the main character for the girl because I was a girl outdoors girl at Hello school, who is Harun Carter and NSW And the likes of Baptist Boys and other pop music and still do; And Haroon's character, especially the monastery, "Testphobia" will crash. If you judge this film, then you are not jealous or jealous for his reputation based on You are about to hate it and the trash is going to talk in reviews Brazil is the only reason why the only reason piyarsera krasadrasera dribble. Take the movie for it, it is not what you want. I think this film is a high note aphoristic happy ends and you want to sing.
