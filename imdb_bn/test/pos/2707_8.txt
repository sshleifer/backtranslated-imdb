The story of Karen Carpenter shows a little more about the complex life of singer Karen Carpenter. Although it fails to provide true information and details. <br /> <br /> Cynthia Gib (illustrating Karen) was not a good selection. She is a good actress, but playing a stupid and stupid Karen Carpenter. I need a strong character in the role. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A soundtrack album. Unfortunately they were not, though the film was at the top of ratings in the United States and many other countries
