It is the first feature film of Australian comedian Mick Molli. Mick wrote this photo with Richard, another comedian and actor John Clark, with his brother. Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson et al-Mick and John also played a role alongside other other symbolic Australian actors. The main grounds of the movie are that Jack Simpson (Mick Mollay) became a member of the Lone Boles Club for the sole purpose of getting a free car park near his job. The club calls on harsh financial straits and jacks to help. John Clark played the club Arch Nemesis - he tried to band together the Club "Poker Machine Slam" Jack and other club members and trying to save and save the club with a lot of fun twists and bars and Jack's last release. This is pretty cute cute movie. It's the best on Mick Molloys normal lonely humor. It is quite well written and well-played. Old Australian actresses are luxurious (Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson, Monica Maun and Arous), who break the film instead of moving at the neck, but join the kiss of the movie. There is a low layer thick language.
