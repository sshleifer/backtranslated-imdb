Muppet movie is an instant classic. I remember the scene of the freaky birds and at the beginning of the kitete (in my opinion) the opening song with the most favorite song in the history of the song. At this moment my mother always used to sing with Kimi. <br /> <br /> Seeing this title as a young adult can make me laugh. I can still sing along with my heart's desire. Like many Muppate films, there are jokes for adults (my opinion) even today. Always my favorite line is from this movie, my green, Gogli eye hero Kemirit "A movie of Life, write your own end". What i want to do Thanks Jim Henson
