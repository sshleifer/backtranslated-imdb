I've seen this movie again, I think it's one of the greatest hits of Hitkoc. For the first time I saw, I just blown up with mysteries, actions and imagery. It's the occupier's end, the fragile murderer, the innocent man created or hunted by the situation, some great position shots, e.g. Jefferson Memorial of Washington and Pen Central in New York. Ruth Roman with the daughter Patriarch of Whit and one of her hitcott films, this is a great supporting actor in Stewart Leo G Carole. At the end, the Marie-Go-round episode is one of the most nervous-vaccinations in Hitkoc's body. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Robert Walker Bruno Anthony (his last full photo) The stranger of the train, who made himself out of the life of the blind tennis star Guy Henes (Fellie Granger). Granger plays nice guy who is caught in a messy divorce. The camera shows two separate people's shoes that are open with the camera because they leave their taxi on the train. Finally, they meet and take on the story. When strangers show unusual interest in tennis stars and the movie continues, then strangers become strangers. With the arrival of two missions in separate missions with Washington, Metcalfe's fictional small town, the Bay Mountain Tennis Championships and a passenger train, the space was shifted. At the end, the speed of tennis is sown in the plot when they take the time. The cameras are volleyed and face the athletes by serving the series with extraordinary success. When close competition in the fight ends, climatic charges are performed. Hitco has love for train and it is very nice to see the pension station. Trains are featured in 39 steps, Lady Venites, Shadow of the Doubt, SpellBand, Northwest North and this movie. <br /> <br /> This classic hitcoat thriller happened at the beginning of the great creativity for the master of mystery - in the 1950s and I am sure that one day it is the Hemkak Hall of Fame.
