Scrum success gave birth to a whole new horror flicks wave. I'm hopeful, big fan like a terrible fan, and I like most of those new horror movies. BOC is a big pack. Colorful, fast paced and original. I see this movie more like opening a new triangle (such as episode 1 and alliance: like the resurrection) it brings a new twist. Instead of focusing on the relationship between little boys and murderers, we have unveiled a package about couple here. We have sweet young lovers in contrast to the killer crazy doll-shaped lovers. Very inventive!
