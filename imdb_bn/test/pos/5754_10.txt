I own this movie on DVD and I saw it almost 10 times and it's still funny. The joke will never be boring and I often smile at an inappropriate time thinking about them. The most popular hotel in the UK, next to the renowned Richard and Eddie a nuclear power plant is below. They may have a fame of a movie star when they are extremely desperately looking for cash and hidden. <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie and do not get completely annoyed or annoyed you will have to humor first. Some people will say that only hardcore fans enjoy watching it. But overall it's a great movie.
