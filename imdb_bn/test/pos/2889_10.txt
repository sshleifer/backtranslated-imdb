These guys are nice and some of the first class that they hold for the public. This band's musician is amazing and we should all be very grateful where we live in a world where the rays exist. The future generations will never be able to live such skills and see personally. Get this DVD and you will enjoy it !! Recently I was able to play these incredible musicians in Houston, Texas and was blown away. I did not miss a single show from Power Windows and I want to say that they are better than ever. Everyone should embrace these boys and teach others the true musician! Such a tight and good will not be done three times in our life again. Hope and hope they will not retire at any time!
