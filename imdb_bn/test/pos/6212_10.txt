When it came in the next part of 80, the super carrier was my favorite movie. My father tapped it for me and I saw it until my step-parent taps upwards and broke my heart. Or I'd like to know where I can get it from. I was looking for it. I believe they even came out w / a Supercarrier 2. It was not as great as the first, but I could find them, but I'd get them all. I think @ it was not bad movie. It was a very interesting movie that was a lot of work, but it had a little love story. The movie actress / actress was great. It helped me to understand that it is not just a man's world, but it is a woman's world and many similar women can do the same thing if a man does more than what he can and women too deserve respect for their duties.
