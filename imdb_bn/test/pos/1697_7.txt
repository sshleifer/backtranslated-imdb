Andy McDermott (Tom Ever Scott) A shy American teenage holiday with his friends Brad and Chris in Paris. The Eiffel Eiffel Tour protects the Seraphin Piggs (the fantastic Julie Delpy) from suicide and has a crash on it. He does not know that he is a verb They went to an underground party and were attacked by waswolves. Andy was wounded and became a Verobol. He was advised that the only way to become normal again is to attack him and kill his heart fed Verubul. This movie is a fierce black comedy movie. Special Effects and Soundtrack Excellent, highlight the band Bush song. I do not know why some readers compared London's best-in-class composition to 'Un American Werewolf'. There is nothing common in the stories (only an American teenager, Wavelov, and a city in Europe). Highly directed for the wewwolf and black comedy fans of the movie. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Umm Lobbyism Americano M Paris" ("An American Wayroof of Paris")
