I was surprised to catch it on TV on Friday, and I enjoyed it. There was an interesting movie in the presence of Bobby Phillips and in many references to everything known as "cyberpunk". I enjoyed this story, which I read ("Earth", David Brin) reminded me of the book and was fun to watch on TV. Bobby looks very good, but I enjoyed his performance as he did because he felt different from everyone else. But the greatest thing about this movie is an atmosphere described by Gibson, Sterling and others. It was fun to watch on TV.
