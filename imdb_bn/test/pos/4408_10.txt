I saw it on television some decades ago when it was first broadcast. I thought it was brilliant, and I think most of it was right now. When I am in London and around, I can not call myself in London and I do not know it well - what other than the taxi driver? Visitors once understood the evidence; Here is a group of men trying to grow in the seemingly unseen-capable and demigods situation, then the rest of the perfect joy. The characters are in good contrast, their family relationships are equally diverse, and are influenced differently by movie events. Do not think it's a documentary - it's one of the authentic plays, and knowledge characters. I have not seen anything like this film before or after. Look at it!
