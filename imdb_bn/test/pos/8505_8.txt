The first one showed me this first, so I'm not very motivated about it. It was really scary to me, because it was delayed partially, but due to some partial reason the video tipped suspense story (the same thing that helped Dark Shadow). And the cast was so right. I know Shane Bryant very little from anything else, so it may not be right to call him "good cast", but to me he is Daryan Gray. And as far as the other male actor, who fits his part well, is Seed Henry as Nigel Davenport (who is so much better in the "Big to Life" character). And John Carlin, Dan Curtis's "Repeat Player" because of Dark Shadows. As a poster is mentioned, this version provides a fairly fine arrangement for men. Dorian sent a list of John Carlin's male names, where he had a way to blackmail and the look of Carlson's appearance was very well done. (If that scene is done now, it will probably be done in a great way and it will be worse.) "Dorian Gray" When I had only one name, I saw it, I was alone, so the more famous 1945 version ( Which is well-known), it is a version of me.
