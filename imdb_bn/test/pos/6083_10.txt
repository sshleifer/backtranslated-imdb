I saw this movie during the war of liberation and was really young and not very much in the movie. It was one of the most interesting cinematic experiences of me and it actually kept a sign inside me. First of all, I did not understand the story and presumably failed to create the necessary relationships between the past and present when presenting the film to the audience. <br /> <br /> I saw it again after a few years and I fell in love with 'The English Patient', it touched me so deeply and it became the best movie ever made for me. <br /> <br /> <br /> Create incredible emotions inside you. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is so much of a passionate journey of passive music and it will not be the same without the film. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < He loves such a good man, who loves to go slowly, but Kathryn goes so deeply with Clifton, that his forbidden love opens his heart and dive. <br /> <br /> The most heart-breaking scene for me is always where Kathryn is taken from the almighty to the cave and he wears the theme he bought. He said, 'I always used to wear it. I always love you 'and at the moment, he started crying with this pain in his heart. <br /> <br /> <br /> His performance in the forgery Binocho is remarkable and in fact the Oscar is worthy. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a film that someone lives on declared itself as a movie lover.
