Okay, I'll say it. This movie has hurt me so much that it hurts. This statement may insult some of you who think that this film is nothing but a waste of the film. But most people do not find the thing that is called bad and impressive. I mean, do people really think that a movie about a killer Snowman wanted to be the best man? Just look at the "Scary" hologram in the movie jacket and find your answer. Instead, like the original Jack Frost (which I thought was fun), this movie became a very confusing journey, which was in deep depth of dialogue, bad fishing and terrible special effects. And it has been laughing to our visitors. It certainly did work for me. For example: Anne Tyler (his annoying husband): Why have you become such a deadly darling? <br /> <br /> If you are not part of that dialogue, then you have serious problems. Those who speak the truth in their right mind? Of course, some of the ridiculous words were spoken! Just watch this movie with an open mind and less hope, and hopefully you'll see so much fun about Jack Frost 2.
