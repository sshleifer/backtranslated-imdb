Very enjoyable 50's Western. I have this in my collection and recommend it to Western fans. <br /> <br /> Most Victor did a great job in mature movies and on my assumption. <br /> <br /> She is a trap who joins the border a scout. Red Cloud caught their three of their land and took their property. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But there is no depth or feelings of other characters. <br /> <br /> 50 western is my darling and it's easy to slide smoothly. Such a Western past page and probably will never be created. Enjoy one. It gave a rating of 7. Probably 6.8, but such movies have become more valuable over time. <br /> <br /> For the fans of the movie-star ... "Big Cat" "They Live at Night" "Side Street" is the most wonderful movie enjoyed. Buying and viewing Noir seems to be a way in the Western way. Not before and forever.
