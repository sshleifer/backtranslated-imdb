This is not a movie, but an experience! <br /> <br /> I did not think it would be the normal eye candy. There are several things happening simultaneously, your senses can not manage it almost. A product of sophisticated technology (we were just sitting behind for fun and discontinued our 3D glasses to dazzle magic), the music is great (it's a concert!), Disney characters are in it (and you're going to be part of their world), it's Interesting, it's a witch, it's exciting - I know it's going to be like an advert - but it's really awesome! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> />;)
