Thus, "a crazy summer" begins, the evil twin of "the altar is dead." Which movie can be worse if David Lee Roth sings the opening lines? <br /> <br /> This movie is a total explosion. Again, Curtis joins John Cusack with Armstrong, but this time Bonatite Goldwath is mixed with the combination of great, fun results. Everyone's nervous grates around Hyperactive Bobcat, Curtis "Ak Ak", a deranged military son with a pacifist trend, and Depmi Moore (with natural breast ... wow!), As the interest of love, again, legally depressed menstruation. > <br /> The story is good, easy enough. There's a smile, but both of Savage Steve Holland's films have a certain quality ... they're funny, but they're sweet. Curtis begins to muscings about how the target practice gets out of a blown doll in the beach, and how a little girl can sleep, fool, funny and touch. Full-time animations are quite real. "Boat" violent (complete with Watsamatta U most and Odie plush dolls). Overall, a funny movie, though as well as "good for the dead ..."
