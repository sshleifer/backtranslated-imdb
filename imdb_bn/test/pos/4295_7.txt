A good text play. A moving story showing its best in middle-class English. Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson have played some. Tom Wilkinson Britain's Best Actor She knows how to be fine and honest. Emily Watson is an actress who I did not know, but for her achievements she did a great job of playing a ****** wife. Director, Julian Fellow did not succumb to the disguise of Hollywood for giving some drunken film to this movie. It dramatized the English middle-class script It does not face the speed of the movie, although it is not a face-to-face picture. Plot a good twist, that is not predictable in a beautiful English country village setting. I've enjoyed this picture very well that the places were very well selected. If you enjoy movies about relationships, it's one to watch. Some tissues are good to prepare!
