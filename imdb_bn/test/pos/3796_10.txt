I rarely write reviews but this movie only demands more attention because it has been the most ridiculous abduction, which is sometimes depicted in the wrong sequence illustrated. <br /> <br /> I saw it once and got it as the most fun movie. I had the privilege to ever see. I laughed from the beginning to the end. It's embarrassing that it's not on DVD or video. <br /> <br /> You can compare his or her cinematography with its Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. This story is not nearly as complicated as the Mad World. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie is released in the near future, because in today's days it will be a shame to lose such a comedy.
