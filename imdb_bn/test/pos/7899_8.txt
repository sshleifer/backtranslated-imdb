Let's face it, tell you what to expect in a post in the 1990's Corey Falman, presumably boobs, guns and cars. Not saying that there is much more than this nude woman (I'm sorry), because it basically kills herself abnormally, and the name often refers to 'mysterious' way. I love obscure awful, and I love this film. If not you, you probably do not. But I think most people leave it, it's not so annoying that it will ruin your holiday or something. Above all, if its stupid is a good fun, a bit of body lover and an 80's childhood is your superstar in your mood, then you came to the right place. This is a cracker !!!!
