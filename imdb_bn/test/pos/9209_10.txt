I think that Venusa Marcel is the best actor to cast. She makes one of the best characters in the show. James Cans are also quite good. I love it when he worries about Delinda. Ed and Delinda are one of my favorite scenes while shooting some people. That was fun. Nicie Cox is good and she has great chemistry with Josh Duhamel. Lara Flein was awesome in the role of her guest in Boyle. I hope they will not kill him. The show is a great cast with some bad actors that you do not see on TV. I still think Vanessa Marcel is good though. He should have received an amy in my opinion. It is embarrassing to cancel the show
