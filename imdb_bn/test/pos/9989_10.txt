I was incredible in this movie. I absolutely love, even though my brother did not do so much. Special effects were outstanding, and this movie is about my favorite game; Golf The only disappointment for this amazing movie is that it is difficult to see two or more rows in row This movie is absolutely above everything else I have ever seen. It was everything I had hoped from a movie. I just liked it. Also, it was lovely kid friendly. This movie helped me understand that when you pay attention to it, there is still some possible. I would give it a pure 10/10! It was better than Baggage Vans' The Legend and the Caribbean pirate two pirate. Absolutely amazing. Love it
