Supporters of Gary Anderson Productions recognize UFO's various actors and vehicles (which were made after Dopelganger) - as well as sound effects of various Anderson series. Barry Gray's excellent music (mostly of this movie's unique) has added feelings of contact. Just because of this, I think no Gary Anderson fan can find the price of DopelGangers. <br /> <br /> Just judged as a movie, it can be said that Dopelganger is defective. It is known that there was a big problem during the production and I suspect why there is such a time-consuming plot thread that suddenly ends and the relevance of the rest of the story does not appear. Probably the time / budget limitations prevents relevance from emerging! <br /> <br /> Boringly, the special effects started out from the excellent good - better than any film in the 1960s that I know - badly frustrated. However, with these errors, the original story of Dopelganger is well-known and holds the viewer (or, at least, this viewer) across. What Anderson hopes to expect from someone is not the end, but at the same time it is like Anderson, and it must be appropriate. To find out what I mean, you will have to see it for yourself. :)
