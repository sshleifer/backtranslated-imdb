To understand the "crash course" in the right context, you must understand the 80's TV. Most TV shows did not have any points. The sitcom expelled at least 3 to 1 drama. They still knew where the lines were, so that they could overcome them. (TV shows "Hail to the Chief" was a very courageous step!) "Crash Course", created for this creation, features an all-star cast, which combines the members of the 80's Classic: "227", "Family Relations", " Who's the boss? ", Etc. Then the directors of those star films certainly had a certain feeling. Nevertheless, this film gave a fair idea about very low fares and heroism and maturity. And that's sometimes not bad.
