Although homosexuality is defective, this movie will focus on viewers on the myths and errors related to AIDS. Despite the sad content, this film depicts warm friendship between two boys and will cry and cry. Especially Joseph Josepho and Brad Renfro have played very well. Although the language is slightly stronger, and it is an entertaining and intelligent film for the whole family. But remember the Claynex ready!
