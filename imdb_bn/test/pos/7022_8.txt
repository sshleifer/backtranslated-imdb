Actual sexual desire shown by great music, great dance, a sexy star (Swayze) and a female character (a very unusual event!). You rarely see female characters who are motivated by passion and it's a wonderful change. I think that the film is very good to cope with the problems of the class, to be a teenager and to bring the ideology of reality suddenly. Of course, it's a hungry moment - it's finally a movie musical - but in all it's a real pleasure - a fun romance and politically enlightened. The movie has always been my favorite movie line: "I have watched melon."
