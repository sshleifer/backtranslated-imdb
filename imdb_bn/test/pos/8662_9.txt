Bothosom Man is one of the best foreign films I have ever seen. All technical aspects, my opinion, perfect (light, acting, direction, pacing, etc.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Its work is cold and unwilling; His relationship is silent and irrelevant, and when it is too much, he wants to finish it in front of a train. But not ending - he will not leave this strange world by suicide! Going back to a man who was feeling the same isolation and loneliness, our main character joins him to dig a stone wall in hopes of releasing a strange and wonderful smell and music source. As they break - and I do not publish it, it's all gone and the movie starts to be weird. <br /> <br /> It's enough to say that you like this movie or you'll hate it. I think it's like a magical poem - many different interpretations and all of them are as open as the next. If you enjoy a new experience in the movie and want to get away from the festivity of Huildi, try this movie! 9/10 (And I do not give it easily!) Because despite its darkness, this movie has given me a few more ideas ... some mysterious and out of themselves. Savass!
