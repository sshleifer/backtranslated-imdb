Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993) There was a lot of parody from Mel Brooks. He gave the responsibility of finalizing some of the film related to Robin Hood's successor and the legendary English thief of the English people. Curry Elwes stars as Robert Hood He is looking for some good people who will try to break the discipline of Nottingham (Roger Rees) and to seek the right hand of Med Median. Robin will also have to deal with Prince John (Richard Lewis). Well Tracy Ullman co-star Prince John personal letter Latrine who has his eyes on Sheriff. <br /> <br /> Will Robin find his funny people? How much will Prince will throw in his father's absence? Why Sheriff Robin Hates So? To find out you need to see Robin Hood: Tight Men !! Dom de louis, who played in Jersey's Duke, see the colorful camo. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
