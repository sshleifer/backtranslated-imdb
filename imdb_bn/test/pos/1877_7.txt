Or if you've seen "Evil Dead" trilogy and / or "bubb ho-tape", then you should know that its film is not worth the total. With "Man with Screaming Brain", he goes all over again. In this case, he visited the memorial American businessman William Cole Bulgaria - will we ever see that country? When a woman killed him. So, strange scientist Ian Ivanov (Stacy Coach) replaced half of his shoulder brain in the brain of former KGB agent, he "played" like Steve Martin. <br /> <br /> Yes, the whole movie is an excuse for most pure meaning. Most real humor comes from Pavel, the deceased assistant of "Evil Dead" director Sam Raimiya's brother Ted Evanov's brain. Two more men like Larry and Hardy or Giligan and captain are more like this. <br /> <br /> So understand that this is a totally stupid film, and you will not be disappointed. I like it, anyway.
