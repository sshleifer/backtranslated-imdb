Body Manukee (Roy Skider, who was strong in the role of an important leadership) manages secret secret police squad named Seven-Ups, whose strategy does not follow the correct methods of the law. Their work goes away without writing anything in the newspaper, and it gives them the freedom to reach their most wanted detective police and police. It is celebrated by a little boy named Vito (Tony Lo Bianko), who works on the street in New York, swaps information about the type of crowd and shysters with him. Did Buddy not know that Vito is searching for a scheme using names from the body of "checklist" (she has opened this book to open the notes given by Vito, but her friend did not copy the written names of her mind.) The population of the population was abducted by population Thank you for working with two policemen, Moon (always-famous Richard Lyncht) and Bo (Bill Hickman) to work with him. When this project becomes awful, one of the Seven-Ups is killed, Vito feared because he knows how to be a body when he is ugly after a person. Especially when his own person is killed. <br /> <br /> After the body was killed by his associate, the body of the unarmed police headquarters was carried out by the body of New York City in an effort to try to kidnap the abducting policemen. After the establishment of the plot, the film is not very complicated and we realize that the ring-leader who is involved in mobsters's plans Skyder was never recognized as a fine lead actor. She has emotional range and we see how she can be lost on her forehead and her friend snatches her toll. The film is increasingly visible in good deeds and creates an interesting plot of betrayal among friends, because it seems like a childhood friend comes before temptation and what seems like a smooth crime against evil-hate families, which could kill the police.
