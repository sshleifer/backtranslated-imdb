I'm not the big fan of Lucio Flori's film. Most of his 80's of Gore's films were in their moments, but often the second-rate Dario was added to the Argentine Imitation. Apart from the recreational "Zombi" (which was the example of George Romero), I did not really enjoy them. I know the Italian horror often overlooks the plot, but the stories and characters in his films have even had too many altars by standards. For this reason "surprise me not tortured" surprised me. It is actually a very well made film with a mythical murder mystery. Its possible best geology has ever been created, only Dario competes with this rivalry of Argentine. In contrast to Phulasi's previous gaellos, "A Leed in Women's Skin", it never drags. <br /> <br /> The direction here of Phulchi is quite good here. He keeps the story moving at a good pace and maintains the audience's interest. Also, the mystery conclusion comes as a complete surprise to the visitors. Plus, he added some clever touches as seemingly soul music, especially in the category of heating the boring cemetery. Overall, violence is prevented here and is only used when needed for the story. Most of the acting is well known, known faces of the Italian exploitation film of 70. Thousands of both Thomas Mellian and Barbara Bucket are great. The only weak link is Florida Balkan, whose performance is too high. The only ridiculous aspect of the picture! "Do not do a duckling torture" definitely comes with my recommendation and can be a good introduction to the giallo subgenre as a whole. (8/10)
