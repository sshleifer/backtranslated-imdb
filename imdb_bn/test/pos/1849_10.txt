I love this movie !!! <br /> <br /> This beautiful, charming love story attracted me immediately with her boyfriend's character and heart-warming romance. I was so attached to such a character throughout my life that I felt as if I knew them personally. The story is very appealing, and it brings me tears in a very touching moment. Duchovny and Driver have a very clever, pure relationship that can help you get involved. This is more than once viewed and your all friends are shown. I was just curious, why was it a big hit? <br /> <br /> I give 10 out of 10! Spectacular movie! (And it's coming from a person who thinks that nine of the 10 movies are not valuable.)
