I like this movie. It smiles so much Good acting and writing is really sharp. I would like to see one hundred films more than repeating and repeating the three Lord of the Ranges. <br /> <br /> It looks like a low budget issue and is being shot in DV, but J. Jorge and Julian Nicholson are great together. Why do you have the lowest ten lines? I'm not a critic, just a sponsor. <br /> <br /> I am very doubtful that Quantin Tarantino can write a picture without filling it with masculine free violence. This movie should be seen only in more than one screen. I laughed from the beginning to the end. >
