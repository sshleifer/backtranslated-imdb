My good and very good aspects were both reminded to read some other reviews of this movie. But overall, I say that this is one of the better films I've ever seen from any section or countries recently. More than anything else, it is avoiding the most common traps of recent international films like taking beautiful pictures of landscapes or imitating American movies like 'hip', 'fun' or tougher stories. The film is unique in many ways. For one, it is about a relationship that does not play any role (unusual, especially for foreign movies). It is a movie about two people's relationships with each other (also unusual - not a 'friend movie', no gay tension, no ego / Falic competition). It uses little dialogue, but communicates a remarkable amount. This is a simple story, yet complicated details that are easily understood by any human and universally relevant to their relevance. I could not find a dark or depressed movie (if you always look at Hollywood's best ending movies, everything will look like this), but rather a real reflection of the human emotions. For example, in Mahmud where his cousin realized, you both saw the feeling of his relief, the cousin who has gone and still apologized, he pushed him away. Who did not feel like this ambivalence - losing a friend or lover, or in any other situation? It is very rare to show such genuine human emotions in a stereotype of the film. As far as the culture is concerned, or it's a Turkish movie, I think it is a very difficult balance between a 'Turkish' film - a reality of more reality about it (a broader struggle for making it versus a Turkish city), a European one, in countries and cities More contrasts), and a universal, human story which must not be made mandatory in Turkey. In this day and age where universal culture is accepting and worshiping idols, this film does not try to persuade us as 'Turkish' and does not try to communicate as 'strict reality', or 'Turkey / Istanbul thus'. And yet there are cultural elements. I think that anyone who has compared the 'lost in translation' is pretty good. At least everyone in the United States was involved in that movie. I personally had the best mediation of it. It was considered a vague story that was supposed to face 'indecency' by people living or traveling abroad. Although the film was supposed to be fun, the characters and their motivations or crises were never clear (even 'lighter' movies or even comedies). And I found isolated abroad Amerian foreigners being treated in a typically 'oriental' story. Returning to 'distant', it is considered to be bad acting, or very slow, or there is no plot, I am sorry, but those who are saying this do not know anything about filmmaking and maybe nothing about human beings, no crime Not there. You do not have to be a movie fan or cultural savvy to appreciate this movie. This image will cost you two hours better!
