To tell the truth, I just went to see this movie because Nicholas Cage is my favorite actor. People can not agree, but they perform very well in bad and good movies. I did not see any movie with Penelope Cruz, so I was worried about whether she was a good actress. So, here I think: <br /> <br /> The movie is good (but I did not read the novel). Some moments are really thrilling and ... unexpected. Together you will find the plot quite easy. So the only thing that can save the movie is that (An experienced viewer who will tell from the beginning) will end up sadly or happily, that's the performance of both Cage and Crusoe. And it's great, great, great !!! In the next part of the film, I liked the extension of the actress (Spanish, but for those who do not speak Greek, and she even seems to be a Greek girl). Overall the movie is very enjoyable and it is a good deal of ridicule (classical music fans will surely have fun at some point :) <br /> <br /> I can give it 9/10. You should see it!
