The ridiculous movie, I had a great time while watching it. Star (Cuneyt Arkin, sometimes credited as Steve Arkin) is a popular actor from Turkey. He played the role of many tough people, in epic-sword films and romance. It was fun to see him with an international throw and gloves some real lousy looking pair. I think it is dubbed in English which makes things even more fun. (John Wayne feels good to say Turkish).
