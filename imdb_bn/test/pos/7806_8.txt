It's a fool, it's an intelligent comedy, it has some kind of charismatic work and danceography (and remember, it is deliberate), good crawl songs, good performance by whole casting, brilliant by Amir, Salman and Parse and all scripts that are very rare in Indian cinema. Comedy also (see David Dhawan, Harmesh Malhotra etc). The story is the sole purpose of the two revolts which means being rich and famous in any way. They said that when they came to know that India is coming to marry a rich NRI. The rest of the story is about solidarity and how to try to find each other's intelligence of this slander. The entire cast is fully cast from Dewan Verma to Biju Khot. The songs are properly placed and fun. The amazing package is Salman who works with the perfect time and this special work gives him the style of the comedians. <br /> <br /> If you like and watch Indian movies, then it's all a foam film that you should not ignore.
