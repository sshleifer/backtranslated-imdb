At this moment, the Loving Demew Jury is called for responsibility, where an anti-corruption attorney thinks that he is looking like a gelbird who wants to break, so there are two switches. Of course, the movie is mostly a series of gags; "Ernest Gel to Jail", most gas related to power. I really like the first vacuum cleaner sequence on. Overall, the point of the movie is just fun, and I'm sure you'll go. It's probably the final movie that you watch with a mud. It's pretty safe that Jim Varney will be really missed. Knowwhaddamean? FYI: The only other Cast member I recognized was Randall "Tex" Kobe, who played Lyle. You must have seen him anywhere.
