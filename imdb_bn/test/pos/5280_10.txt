Obviously, Ponyo can only be seen as a silly animated movie which the studio can only survive. It is far from it, and it can easily be described as an enchanting, beautiful movie experience. <br /> <br /> Miazaki is actually another excellent composition. Now, many are considered to be the lowest of their achievements in the making of the film, because they are not as part of "some strange factor". This is true - so much moral and insight into the previous movies that are not very front in this picture. Ponyo is not too difficult to understand or understand. His idea, I believe, was to create a children's film that was suitable for adults like their kids and it is not very complicated. He has done this perfectly, and will not lose any substance along the way, because of which it gets 10. Besides, the film is so strong since the beginning, and the method presented is so beautiful, it made me wonder sometimes, because I thought that I think Miazaki was created by herself. I once saw that after watching a movie I was so enlightened and not happy (another film will not be missed). Everything about Ponyo was absolutely stunning and breathtaking; There was also pure perfection of music for it. The only bad thing I would say about it was its dubbing in English. Take me wrong, they were good too, but I watched Panio almost two weeks before the national level, and I believe in some parts I hope it has some dialogues in Japan (not all) though it enjoyed the "English Way" . After all, everyone should see ponyo; It is absolutely flawless and completely in another league of filmmaking. Finally, and do not hold me in it, but I would not be surprised if he was nominated for best picture nominations, because now 10 nominations can be nominated for the film. It's just that good.
