I have seen this movie opened at NYC at ZigField. Madonna was not quite a cultural icon at the time. He had a few hits, was "very good looking Susan" and I had a ticket to see him at the concert at Giants Stadium. <br /> <br /> "Who is that girl?" Let Madonna play the real role, which is not the level of her own personality. She is better than the madcap / heroine routine you might think. Griffin Dunne has shown very well all the people of the film as a witness. <br /> <br /> The story involves a cat cat called Murray, who is a bride, who is sleeping with every bride in the bride, which means father-in-law, and a key. There are plenty of police to drive and behind their way. All elements of a sculble comedy are intact. <br /> <br /> Sir John Miller is briefly viewed. He shares a glass champagne with leadership and has the highest apartment on the top west side, complete with a rain forest and everything. <br /> <br /> It's a nice comparison compared to most Madonna movies (which I am able to tolerate). On yourself, it's not bad. 6/10. <br /> <br /> PS concert was shy.
