It is definitely one of the Mel Brooks films along with spaces. (Although at least I still will not accept it for many others to see it). It's very stupid and thoroughly fun, it's not more than a few minutes in a total two-hour run-time, where you are not entertained. Almost all gags have a great trick effect, some of them fall flat. I watched this movie after watching the spy hard and reviewing and compared these two spoof movies, I understand how high the quality of the movie is. Interesting from the beginning, no comedy is extra or annoying. The music is extraordinary, as well as both dance and war danceography. Actually, what you expect from such a movie is that ... Elwes is a great comedian, and a good Robin. The plot is usually robin hood, or less than everything from the legend (and mainly spoofed). If you like Mel Brooks, or you're just a fan of stupid humor, or you're just going to die for watching a good parody of Robin Hood's legend, but it's definitely a movie for you. The movie is especially valuable for watching HBO First Look, and in it, you also want to monitor all the credits. I would recommend it to any fans of the movie Mel Brooks and those who enjoy folly humor. 7/10
