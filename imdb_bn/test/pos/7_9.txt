Our family (and sold the perfect preview by selling the entire audience) enjoyed the "Guardian". Kevin Coast Ner and Ashton Kutcher's fictional helicopter rescue swimmer starred as Ben and Jake. After watching this movie, you can not imagine how difficult it would be to graduate from USCG Helicopter Rescue Swimming School and one day to take part in real rejuvenation. <br /> <br /> Although it was a fictional movie, it provided true credentials instead of team spirit, dedication and bravery displayed by all members of the US Coast Guard. <br /> <br /> The special effects used to create rescue scenes were incredible. You really felt that you are participating in real rescue. <br /> <br /> I think the film can be made without the "Hollywood" bar scene (you will agree if you see the movie) Coast Guard is not dirty as such behavior. <br /> <br /> Very entertaining, very action pack, definitely worth seeing. Thank you, u come. Coast Guard and Real Helicopter Rescue swimming swimmers, "So others can live" I would highly recommend this movie for everyone.
