I was very moved by the mood of this movie and the mood it created. I think it would have earned much more credit than it is I should have nominated Messiel Pfeffer, but I think all performance was outstanding and Michelle Pofiffer and Jessica Lange illustrated deep relationships and conflicts with deep emotional depth and sensitivity to sisters. Although I did not read the book, I think King Lear's modern concept is very cool. I will not look at the game in the same way again!
