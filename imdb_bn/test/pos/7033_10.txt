There was talk about this! About the creation of Hollywood Special Dick Dance, which is still in its fifty years, with many of my favorite friends, she said that her favorite is always making films. Maybe the music, dance, or melodram around Johnny Perses' plot, is becoming a dance sensation with Johnny Castle. Of course, this image was founded by Jennifer Gray, whose biggest role was on Fries Buller's day, disturbed sister. Patrick Suez was completely cast as the leading man in the heart by snatching a baby's vacancy. Dirty Dancing It has become a Broadway or West End Remnants Hit. It's a lot of love stories, music, and dance. Jennifer and Patrick can easily revive their role. Jerry Orbache is a nice police officer and Kelly bishop is better to play with a doctor as a mother. These events were held in the 60's in the Catcills, where most Jewish families spent their holidays during the summer holidays. At the end of the movie, the owner of the hotel saw Kailman, to be disturbed by the next generation. Anyway it happened! Most people love cruises and travel through Europe without summer cutscills. Those old grand hotels are becoming Indian gaming casinos. Let's bring live and good dance dance to Broadway. After all, they could do it for Footloose and Saturday Night fever, this would be a brainer! I know that this movie is such a darling that you will not be tired after 800 times. There are people who have probably seen this movie 1,000 times. The story and the story behind the great dance made me long for my 13-year-old childhood. Dummy dance can not be the greatest movie of all time in history, but its public appeal still attracts the public and repeatedly views the audience like 800 clubs, whose members have watched it so many times. I have now seen all the painful days of children and Patrick Swage as his heartbroken, Johnny Castle with his first true love. No one could imagine this big movie as a big hit with a 60-year-old music, two soundtracks and even a visit to the end of the detention. I hope they bring it to a musical broadway. For viewers it will work to be part of a film. It is not surprising that it still attracts children and even adults, especially women of all ages to watch over. Well, both Australia and London have produced the Ninety Dance. It appears that it will be on 20th anniversary of Broadway in 2007.
