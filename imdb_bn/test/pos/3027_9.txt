The joy that comes with seeing and reviewing movies is that once every time you expect a movie like this at least one movie comes and closes your socks! This movie is a terrific horror horrible horrible awesome thing that you want to be deliberately scared. Without telling the story, I would say it's a great start, middle and end that keeps you on the edge of your seat when transfixed with amazing special effects. Acting is better than an outstanding but it does not matter because one of the best horror films I've seen for a long time on the subject and how it is kept on the big screen. This is a movie that you have imagined that it started as a novel, but credits do not seem to be an adaptation, so writer Mark Protosovich must have many credits. 10 out of 9
