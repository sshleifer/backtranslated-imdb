I saw this visible, unreasonable film by Swedish director Roy Anderson's first visit. He is an experienced filmmaker who has traded his living film, has directed only four feature films in the last 40 years. This background shows: The film looks like a collection of fifty-minute Archie advertisements. There is no story to connect to these vintets, although some characters are present on multiple womens (although they have a theme below: however, the absurdity of modern life). In some ways in the film (appearances on the light white makeup of actors) are more annoying than illumination. The amount of some skits is very low (standing in the queue which a man is uncertain?). Other skits are good, though. The best rock dog dream is that he goes to Hilimun with his rock guitarist bride that goes to a house that does something like a train (you will see it for getting it). Critical comparisons of film critics like Keoton, Tuti and Kurosomky, such as the great filmmakers, seem to be seeing: The Anderson lacks their views, and due to lack of a story related to Vintetta, the trend of this movie is the deadly Masterpiece.
