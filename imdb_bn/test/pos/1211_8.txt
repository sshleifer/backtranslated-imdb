Wrestling was easy in the world in 1980. Take Hogg Hogan Roddie Piper, or Bobby Henan's Cronis or Ted DiBiase, and get more than that. Occasionally he would be a partner like Randy Savage in 1988, but most of it was about Hockey Hogan's Bobby Henan and that's how it should be. <br /> <br /> It was going to change this night, a new champion, a WWII man who had gained his reputation for the decade of 90s. It does not work. But WWW was one thing: Hulkamania was over and a new order was to be established. <br /> <br /> This historic WrestleMania, kicked out of the United States, kicks off with Victory defeated by Rick Mortel. . Coach did not have much luck in WrestleMania and was shortened down here. <br /> <br /> The next Oceanic Connection, Andr√© the Giant and Haku kept the title of the line against their tag team titled Demolition X and Smam. And lost. The new tag team won the champions. <br /> <br /> In the next match, the earthquake defeats Hercules. Hercules was another colleague who was not very lucky in WrestleMania. He m Lots of luck for Brittas Beefcake as the end of the unexplained stroke of Perfect. Well, I think someone will finish it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Defeats Seconds. Unfortunately it's not really a match. Barbaryan then defeated Tito Santana in a small match. <br /> <br /> American Dream Dusty Rhodes and Cefaire then defeated Masha King Randy Savage and Rani Shery in a dirty mixed tag match. At this time only WM female wrestling was going on. <br /> <br /> The next Rockstar, Marty Genety and Shawn Michaels, faced a speedy feat by defeating the Orient Express and there was an interesting match in the next match. There were many good tag teams at this time. Jim Dougigan then defeated Dino Bravo in a match. <br /> <br /> The next Ted Dibis gives the most valuable possession of the million dollar championship against Jacques Roberts to his winner. Roberts was confused by Virgil and allowed Ted to retain his title after playing an entertaining match and another match of the show. <br /> <br /> Later, Big Bismman, who faced Twin Towers, suddenly defeats the infinite. Following the order, Rick Rudd won a small match with hostage Sunuk. <br /> <br /> Finally, we came to the original event with the title WWE title on the line against Haq Hogan Intercontinental champion The Ultimate Warrior. After Hogan missed a leg drop, Warrior won it, behind an entertainer. The crowd was fantastic and the match was a great sight. <br /> <br /> And so the torch is passed, but the final warrior proved to be champion, WWE hoped he would be?
