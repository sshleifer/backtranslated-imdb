The best cinematic version of William Faulkner's fiction I've ever seen and I've seen most prominent people. Mississippi, the Gossette Owner of Oxford, Oxford, has really caught Jefferson and Yokonapatofa County feelings. Into dust, the infiltrator is not one of Faulkner's best novels, but it is said that it will be the crown of another's career. It's Harper Lee's good but easy to hit, a McGenbird foot hit fifty feet (I read it in the ninth grade, and it's exactly where it is). Two of Faulkner's most famous characters, Gavin Stevens and Lucas Bouchamp plays the main parts. Steven is perhaps the single most common character in Faulkner's fiction. He is a lawyer and he works easily as a narrator, because, in contrast to his other characters, Stevens is a reasonable person, not emotion (at least when he is older). Lucas Bucamp can be the most prominent figure of Faulkner's black character (he is a group out of Faulkner's out-and-out masterpieces, in contrast to other black people of M. Yaknapäffe, he refused to bow down to a white man, he is proud, and many people of white population are black One man finds a ruthless quality. One day, Lucas dies in a dead body with a recently-fired pistol There is no need for justice in most areas of Jefferson and its surroundings, and everyone is sure that the bechamp will be lined before the end of the evening or at least the next day, such as on Sunday, before being arrested and arrested. Beauchamp declares his innocence And Steven tried to help. Stevens refuses; The case seems to be open and Closed, but her little nephew, Chik Malison, because Lucas had helped him in the past, now she is willing to help her. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, Hollywood movies are not related to ethnic sectarianism at this time. Rarely disturbs the population, but instead plays the role of slave slaves. If you are an African American actress, you may want to leave and accept that role as a Mamie, a slave, a servant, or a porter, because this is your only way. In Dust-In-Antruuder, a black actor was one of the most memorable non-porter's roles ever found, Lucas Beauchamp. And the Bouchamp, as I described above, can be difficult to accept any stereotypical character, and the audience. Even today, black letters are usually simple, magical and kind. A great example that the recent arthouse struck away from heaven is a great example. Beauchamp is a kind of jolt, and he's very vivid. Although he is perhaps less than that of the novel, he is not a stereootype. He is a complex man. Juan Hernández played Beauchamps superbly. I did not see this movie in a while, but he was also present in the film adaptation of Robert Aldrich's 1955 film, Kiss Deydley, and Faulkner's final novel The River's Cinematic adaptation. <br /> <br /> All actors are great in film. Cloud Jurman Junior, who played a great role in Chic Malice, I would also appreciate it quickly. The novel takes place from his perspective, and he is the current hero of the movie. Jarna is quite an actor; He took the character (who was also present in the story of Faulkner, described, for example, the novel The Town in 1957), a decade or more before his birth, events were completely fulfilled. The next year he will play another great role in John Ford's film Rio Grande. Clarence Brown's only other film I've seen is a national velvet, a different picture than an intruder in the dust. His work here is exceptional; I really have him credit with Faulkner capturing perfectly. The adaptations of other famous Faulkner are very metidermatic (The Long Hot Summer in 1958, which I really like) or very cold (pictured in tomorrow, 1972, which I do not like; the cold misunderstanding of the cold Faulkner). Pulan (truly a different kind of Faulkner's novel) in 1955, Douglas Cork, the tornado angels, is one of the best accomplished with its source material. 10/10.
