With an opening part inspired by the music and film scriptures of Todd HensSelf (1995), David Lynch uses a failed partner, Hollywood actress / waitress, Dean Selvin's dream of frustration, myths and reality breaking ideas. Fame and his own giants and obsessed with Camilla Roads, who are involved with Hotshot Director Adam Kesner. <br /> <br /> The picture is effectively played in Diana's Yield Head; We witness his crazy distortion, his desires-fullness, remorse, obsessions and fear. Using the description of the dream to present two concepts of conflict reality, Lynch does not make the conflict between reality and imagination easy, but actively engages with them. The last 45 minutes is like a dream; And the annoying wind of isolated, unexpected ambiguity still implies, breaking the seemingly safe differences between reality and dreams, we hope to see movies about nightmares and dreams. <br /> <br /> Movies of Lynn are old and new from many movies, but ultimately unlike the director's own Lost Highway and any movie other than Blue Velvet's exception. It is constantly intelligent but not intelligent, constantly challenging the viewer to explain what is seen. Yet it is not fantastic that anyone would imagine because Lynch makes the hero sympathetic despite the killer's work - a material that was missing in all his other films except for Stret Story. He presented the pride of Diane's dream, Bati, who earned fame as a daughter of a renowned Canadian farmer. Lynch also defines and negates the equal measure that presents a critical story. Camilla and Diane really lovers or just friends? Who is the blue woman? What does he mean? Who's left behind Winkies? What is the significance of the body of the body of Sierra Bonita? What is really Aunt Ruth? Is Silenio an abstraction of hell or perhaps a movie based on self-referential fiction? Lincoln is not ready to answer the question raised, instead of presenting his "City of Dreams in Love Story" as a set of interconnected abstractions and motifs. <br /> <br /> Top rated, especially Naomi Watts Diane Selvin / Betty, who has yet to take this performance. Laura Harringe has the interest of Hurrratesac as Comilla / Rita, and like Adam Adam Throu rows up his arrogant and arrogant aggressive aggression in his role. It was great and a serious injustice which was not nominated for one of them in the academy prize. <br /> <br /> This is a film that demands closer viewing and analysis. In the heart of the film, the mystery remains in Lynch, but in half the fun, he finds consistent ideas from the ambiguity of the inconsistency presented. A closer look around is a certain feeling, perhaps an incomplete jigsaw that closes us but denies the mythical perfection of story honor. Finally, this is the original film of Lynch.
