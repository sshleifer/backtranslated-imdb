Overall, I've enjoyed the movie Scarlett. I'm a huge fan of the wind with the wind. I read the book and saw the classic movie many times. I even have a small collection of scarlett O'Hara ornaments and other things. I must admit that I am the most popular favorite book and movie with the wind. Vivian Leigh and Clark Gabelle are fantastic actors and my favorite two. Unfortunately, I could not read Scarlett's book, but I was excited to see the movie. Truth be told, the film is not near the mathematical measurement with wind and is not an actor. However, Joan Halleley Kilmer and Timothy Dalton were happy actors in the role, and repeatedly Juan made words like Vivian Leg in his sketch. Dalton also played well sometimes. It took some time for different actors, but overall I enjoyed it, like the wind fan of mine like me. There was a great disappointment that Joan's green eyes and scarlet wahrah and vivian leg were not both. I too disapproved Lord Fountain and I did not like his character. If you enjoy a live and romantic story with the wind fan, see the movie scarlet. However, do not expect to be extraordinary like the wind with the wind. It is interesting with new characters and so though it is far from it. I'm glad that this is not a remake and some incidents in this story were familiar to me in the continuation of Scarlett Wahrah and the story of Hit Bottler's love story. If it is not seen today, will you get it tomorrow? Tomorrow will be the next day. :)
