Although it's hard to find copies of this movie, if you find it, get it! !!! I believe this was away from the only music in Navy In, Abbott and Costello. Although they were plotting a little bit around, (I have never heard a version where the goat goes with him), you are still a little stupid but boyfriend Jack and greedy Butcher, Mr. Enjoy the ridicule of Decllips. Doubry little lady was memorable, this fantastic video you will go to the floor - just get up and dance like Lou Castello's song (I do not know why they did not do it in other movies.)
