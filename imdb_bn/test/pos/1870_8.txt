I again saw this title Shemaroo. I asked my nephew, who looks 17 years in the same way with me. I'm 35 years old and he 17. I liked it and I did too. It's still funny, a little baby is a bar but still very clean entertainment. Satish Shah's many roles are ridiculous. This is still better than the recent serials on the TV. But some people obviously prefer the prayer to come today. Shafi Enamadar could have continued for all seasons. She is no longer alive today. If anyone can list all the episodes here, I would like to. <br /> <br /> "Kya Ho Raha Hey" "What's Relief" "Kat Broker Boss" "Faith Belief" "30 Years Is Experienced" <br /> <br /> and title track Yay Joe Jinda Agi teaches us to live our lives and enjoys it. The common man's life <br /> <br /> I still like these things. It does not seem as fun at times but the specific episode is still pleasant.
