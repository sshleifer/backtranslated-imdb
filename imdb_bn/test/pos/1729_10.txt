All right, I grew up, but Tom did not like the doctor after unemployment. Christopher Eccleston who loves me again and I will forever be angry with her. <br /> <br /> Writing grand, acting superb, directing (was awesome in old days) just superbly. I was very skeptical about this program, and it only forced to be seen outside, but now I am a huge fan and I love it (I have a ring of "cleansing" a ring crying out). <br /> <br /> I like something about new events - 1) People really notice when the planet (Billy Piper) closes. Some old ones show that an assistant will be closed for a while, and then nothing has happened as no one comes home, no one noticed. 2) Chris loves Eccleston's Doc Rose - will not be romantic or debate, but no doubt 9 loves her and loves her boyfriend. If he wants to save him, he will destroy the world, which was lacking in the old ceremony - often a doctor would not take care of him, if he never cared. 3) They talk to a real person and think - when it shows something strange or a new one (like Alien) works like a real person - gobsmacked. An assistant from an old show, who never saw an alien, I did not like it, it would be fine and adapt immediately. I want to see the wonder of Rose's face when I see the plastic dummy come to life. He gives me that. <br /> <br /> I do not like anything about this series: 1) Nearly everything is happening in the world (London or Cardiff) and I look forward to hearing more types of shows. 2) That Eccleston has gone so fast, he really made the show brighter. <br /> <br /> But I can leave a few things - I enjoy series as much as I expect, so if I set up stuff on earth then I do not think so. <br /> <br /> Do not take this event seriously - it's fun, it's smart, it's entertaining, but it does not show a serious serious duty. It's pure fun, and pure British, and I could not get enough. Give it an open mind, and just keep your brain neutral and enjoy! <br /> <br /> ps - Do not see series 2 or later. Series 1 was brighter, the first few episodes of series 2 were good, but it would not be seen once and love for monsters. Garbage, completely destroyed the show.
