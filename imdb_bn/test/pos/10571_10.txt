I've never dreamed that I started watching this DVD that I'll make it completely fun within minutes. The story was completely absorbing and entertaining. Acting was fantastic. The biggest surprise to all is how I would be completely inspired by the love of distortion of these two young women. My initial physical face for me was a very humble, romantic, colorful, heartfelt love scene that I have ever seen in the film. I literally breathe off I could not believe chemistry between the two actresses. Without any nudity or graphic sex, they express more emotions and titles than they could expect from any American production. Bravo Writer, Screenwriter, Director and Actor
