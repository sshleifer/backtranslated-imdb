Philip Larkin lived in a way that is worthy of the greatest performance of all time, and not only measured by popularity. It shows an incredible picture of Larkin's life as the greatest unknown poet of his era - which he exactly wanted, such as his misconduct for cancer and physics. Philips dramatically displays the raw beauty in the deep depression of watching our relationship with our death and it presents us in a way that seems to have missed even great philosophers. Anyone interested in the deep observation of our relationship with life, love and death, it is certainly a must.
