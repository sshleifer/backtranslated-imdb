<br /> <br /> A good, old fashion movie has something to watch in a movie that adds lots of appeal to each picture. Thankfully, I was able to pay tribute to the legendary director of a trick of Ernest LÃ¼bitzche in the New York City film forum for three weeks of their respect. The double feature I played was Lubitsch's 1938 comedy BlueBird's White Wife and live code's classic design for living screening, which I have not seen before. I praised the film for everything in Design for Living, but I did not get a better review for the 8th wife of BlueBird. Leonard Multin do not like it. VideoHound also lowered the comedy rating. The IMDB score was not complimentary. The film was blasted by Pauline Cooyel (not surprisingly surprisingly) in her strong criticism. So, I'll go to the city the same day when I loved Blubber's 8th wife just a little and loved designs for design. Bluebergh's eighth wife (which was first shown) started, as the film sculptures took their seats and thirty songs were reduced. Adolf Zucker presented his title card with Ernst Lubitas 'blueberd's athlete Wyfe Clout Colbert and Gary Cooper,' heading the card. Then the picture can be opened with a sunny view: Cooper wants to buy the top pair of pajamas, but he does not want any part of the bottles! He quarreled with Clark, who looks for help from his noblemen and does not seem to end their argument. Write one of the most beautiful, charming and gifted personalities of the thirty films of Cloth Colbert. 'I'll take the bottom,' She intercedes earnestly. And you probably have screwball comedies 'never seen' beautifully. The picture kept my interest nicely. I saw myself often laughing. When Colbert was discovered, just before he took a family portrait, his marriage was marred seven times, the whole theater broke down in the hierarchy. When he gets on his shock immediately after bargains for money, smile (which still does not stop) intensify. And Edward Everton Horton also receives some cheerful reactions outside the script. When Cooper took inspiration from Shakespeare's Timing of the Shre, he could not control his smile in front of his wife in order to protect his discipline when he thirsted him. And one of the fun comedy scenes of Claudette Colbert's scary scene with scallions. The greatest all-time epic moment of the film came when Colbert wanted to send a boxer to her husband. In authentic sculpt fashion, he hit the wrong guy instead of throwing his friend David Nivell into a cold sleep. He awakes as Cooper is coming. To cover the situation, Columbine herself retains her fist at the moment of strong sex, asks: 'Where did the man hit you? Here? Here? Here? And then left! Find out again! The film was astonishing, from the beginning to the beginning it was a perfect joy. I liked designing for living, though I said that for the bold smile and entertainment, I think BlueBird's eighth wife was even better and more enjoyable. There is some charm to watch a vintage film on the big screen. And in the presence of others laugh, one feels so much more comfortable in themselves. Probably, why I felt what I did about BlueBird's eighth wife.
