In the first season, how to form all the elements of the Morin Corps as a team (such as soil, air, helicopter and jet) as a group. That season I give high ratings! (True, there are still many "freedoms" in the season, but the stories were more credible.) <br /> <br /> The next season was a deadly attempt to fill the top of the Melrose Place! <br /> <br /> I was at a marine station in Miramar and I think they were shot to listen to the show in the San Diego area. I came to talk with Rod Rowland and James Brolin. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rowland's character was good. <br /> <br /> The role of the Brolin was good in the first season. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you try to merge the plots like Plots in Memosas Place and Soap opera, see the last two seasons.
