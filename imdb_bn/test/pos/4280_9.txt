Those who dislike this movie think that if someone is in their love and they belong to someone else, then they must be canceled. Thankfully, humans are much deeper than nature; Loving someone hurts deeply inevitably - even though we are just fortunate of their death. <br /> <br /> This image is true of Nigel Barkin's original novel ('Way way through the wood'), setting, atmosphere and dialogue. And it is continuously frustrated by an seemingly irrational dispute which is behind many seemingly lazy lives (and the illustration of life in English highland is very accurate). <br /> <br /> I like this picture and hope it will appear soon as a UK-appropriate DVD
