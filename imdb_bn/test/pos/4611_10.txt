This is a prime example of making great movies. Richard Greene (who is doing a good job in the role) takes her to the Black Forest domain to find her two missing friends and the one-eyed mansion Bruno (Stephen McNally) is the castle, which sometimes never encounters her face. The unbelievable movie has a number of extraordinary elements (together) in a single movie - a crocodile arch; A Hulching Mutation (played by Lone Chaney, Junior); A tricky doctor (played by Boris Karloff); A leopard victim (very good work and very atmospheric); A love story; Fortress A sword is an unfortunate, one-eyed count and two of his wicked relatives (played by John Whit and Michael Pat !!!); A compelling background story that makes the film more interesting; And more! Jerry does not allow the scripts to be embedded in themselves - it creates a movie that is highly recommended with the touch of horn and the atmosphere in the making of infinite films.
