For people like me who were born in the late 60's, we can only learn about the era through cultural art, in which the "hair" is one. This is certainly a well-done tour de force. How can one understand things for a hippie culture? Probably the most impressive scene - at least for me - when the group tries to ruin the rich man. For the film's final scene, it can explain it as a symbolic form of everything represented in 60's. <br /> <br /> It is not important to interpret this film in any way, even though 60-60 may end up on their own, the movements that have been printed on them are still at the small ends. This is a time that people will not forget soon. However, I definitely recommend this movie. Milos Farman scored another great goal in the other two great "One Flu Over the Kaku Nest" and "Ragtime".
