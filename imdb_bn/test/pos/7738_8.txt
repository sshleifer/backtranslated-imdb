It looks very good even though I love this movie. It is full of issues that can make an adult entertainment, related to a big person. Acting fantastic Seeing John Cassivis and Gena Rowland as a deadly medieval couple. Who knows how much comes from their own marriage? Susan Sarandan was not sexier or more attractive than her Freeholding character, Arthur. Raul Julia is a hoot as a lively goatherd. Visible in Greece is spectacular; New York settings allow me to suppress the World Trade Center due to many shots. Fantastic score by Stomu Yamamata. I'm taking a lot of things, why is not it a great movie? It's a bit annoying and too long, inappropriate, and unbalanced humorous and unstable in the drama. Yet, it is engaging, entertaining, and deeply thoughtful.
