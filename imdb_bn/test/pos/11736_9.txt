I always liked the people who are those scratchy voiced that Western. He was a sidekick (jingles) who returned to the foot of Polyphil Billy Hikk. This is the perfect vehicle for his wonderful bragging character. He is cruel and nobody believes in him, but he is lazy and goes anyway. When you have such a person, there is no challenge because it does not make sense in detail. Of course, in this episode, he was taken to a space ship of the Alien group, who do not have any sense of humor and believe in what they hear. The sound is not lying in their vocabulary. As it comes out, it is so impossible that they can not handle him; And then, of course, there are secret weapons. See this just to see Andy.
