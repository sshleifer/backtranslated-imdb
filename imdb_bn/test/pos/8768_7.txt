The super hit Hitacho thriller with Robert Simmons again proved that he can really do a storm. <br /> <br /> This time he was caught in a terrible plot when a defense plant worker died in his best friend plant. <br /> <br /> <br /> Priscilla Lane, the girl who suddenly became interested in Kunming, increased the plot and she was from NY from California <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To destroy from the columnist. Hitako was known to play as a director on the upper coast of the society involved in a long-time career involving the underworld. <br /> <br /> Ironically, this film is very applicable to the end. When we find out what happens to the person who kills the friend of Kumings, we can not see what happened to the rest of the gang, and many of them represent the upper part of the society.
