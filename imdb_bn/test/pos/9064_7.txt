This image was originally in an unoriginal way. Although most movies work on suicide and psychological issues, but patients were always able to make them better because of the treatment and doctor's help, but in this film we follow an inferior person who loves a suicidal girl and even though she is not taking care of happiness, she is happy Do not stop, he just wants to die. It's nothing less than enjoyable that was a very interesting cute romance comedy. If you ever get the chance, it's a fun thing to test, you only have to be openly concerned about the material. Overall I give it a 6.4, I just get rating 9 ratings higher :)
