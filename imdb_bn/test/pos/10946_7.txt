This movie features two well-known Hong Kong pop stars, as my Chinese girlfriend informed me. Although it can do a mere marketing stunt to the movie, I think acting is acceptable, and they are both beautiful. <br /> <br /> The story is fairly poor. Vampirectic features and weaknesses, though used in fun ways, create some unique recreational bits. The conflict between the two girls makes me shy, and it has done fine balance together with the action scenes to create an entertaining film.
