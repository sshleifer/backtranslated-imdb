This movie must be well-formed, beginning and ending in the dark, Lily Smith / Schmitt, Julie Andrews, primarily singing "angel" after focusing on notorious spying. <br /> <br /> It's beautiful! I have seen the movie 15 years ago and recently seen it again. When critics of the 70s were dismissed by critics in 'movie wizardry', and during the lack of structure (among others), they were proved wrong. Blake Edwards certainly made a film that is almost the lyricist quality. <br /> <br /> The movie flies and moves (Ariel Photography; Julie Andrews speed) and captivates. Zuni Andrews is a spy whose mission has gone wrong to buy that account only. In the case of Julie Andrews and Rock Hodson, ignoring the cheated chemistry, one must believe that these lovers - who will be innocent for each other. And ultimately, fighting is far more important than winning. And so the solitude is maintained. <br /> <br /> There are many different roles, and the film must reach the mental dimensions not seen in the comedy. <br /> <br /> Fantastic comedians (foreshadowing) Victor / French group in Victoria), interesting diplomatic acids (remind me of the Tamron seed seen 18 years ago) and a general sense of good will. <br /> <br /> Suspend all unbelief and this film will be carried away to you. Julie Andrews stopped the war songs and because of the hunting 'wasing awaited the dark', there was simply enough reason to turn on the TV for the TV soundtrack. And striptease number, like Star's 'Jenny' number! Works. <br /> <br /> This image is like a champagne of good old age. Paramount will bring DVD as soon as possible. The same star laser disk transfers apply! Dvd Both of these are excellent pieces of Julie Andrews and then intrinsic work in the works.
