I'm a huge Tenacious De fan, and I think it's not the most fun movie in the world, but most entertaining. It's not a one-minute smile but it's not what D's purpose is. I went to the movies shown on all the HBO shows, both memorized the album, and that made it more enjoyable. Lots of internal joke from the past Tenacious D album, and the HBB show. Since I already knew the new album, I knew the 40 minutes of the film because it is a musical comedy. I would say it's the best 5 minutes of a movie and the best 5 minutes of a movie. Hand down <br /> <br /> Check out this movie now!
