Did Disney really create such a great movie, which really took you away? Growing with Disney I found to be always captivated by the letters. Every single seemed really genius and knew how to work their way through a movie. I think on Friday night and I just go on watching TV to watch their new movie. Susie's question was one of my favorite all time. I have not forgotten this movie Even until this day when someone mentions the song "Susi Q", I always remember the movie. If someone thinks of watching this movie, then I promise you, you will fall in love with it. I do not think I would ever be able to forget it. You will not be sorry to see it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately Disney movies like "Hannah Montana Movie" came out, it is sad. Has Disney ever happened?
