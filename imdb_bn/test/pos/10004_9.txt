I saw this movie in Indianapolis on 1st September 2005. I'm one of the judges of the Heartland Film Festival, who screens films for their Turing Moving Picture Award. A truly moving picture ... "Desires humanity to discover the desire and respect for the positive values ​​of life." Hartland has given this award to the film. <br /> <br /> This is the story of golf in the early 20th century. At that time, it was a high-class and prosperous "gentleman" game, and the working people could only participate in cadies in country clubs. Through this backdrop, this based-based story brings young, working class boy who brings golf to the world and brings the world's best golfers, Harry Warden. <br /> <br /> Inspirational. Against all the contrasts, Francis Wyamet (played by Shiite La Bauf of "Holls") was able to compete against the United States of America's largest golfers in the United States and Great Britain in 1913. Francis is sick, and has a child for a child. (Cady is a sunny and inspirational and every scene he stole steal.) But despite these difficulties, Francis shows courage, spirit, heroism and humility in this global event. <br /> <br /> And, we learn a lot about the primary year of Golf; For example, the use of small wooden clubs, short hole layouts, manual scoreboards, golfers scramble through the pipes in their faces, the grueling green leafy vegetables and fairways, and the game is not even canceled due to snowfall. <br /> <br /> This movie contains stunning cinematography and art direction and editing. The story is no longer more credible with a big movie star. <br /> <br /> Adds the list of top sports movies "Remember Miracle" and "Remember Titan". <br /> <br /> FYI - There is a real-moving moving website where the list of past winners has lasted 70 years.
