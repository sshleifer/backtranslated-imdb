Apparently a B movie ... B should stand for better performance and better message rather than getting big budget "A" pictures today. Modern films aimed at young women must not have been designed to encourage the depth of character on shallow self-service behavior ... or not designed to increase self-esteem of young girls who are not in line with "feminine" standards. (Above all, criticizing the fake and glaring, this movie will not help sell more products based on girls, such as * No * are satisfied with their natural features or internal beauty. <br /> <br /> Lorraine is a mechanically attracted Tomboy who Lovable as a confession confessed to a "bound" and flirt in the room. He has the same interest with Robert Cummins, humorous fate Bong bonded her due to her honesty, loyalty and good friendship, which gradually her selfish glamor-sister sister (who is her only selfish, helpless playful tendency) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I want young girls (and boys) to get this kind of down-to-earth message today. <br /> <br /> <br /> Maybe Hollywood can re-release "B" movies, try a little budget, and be content. Ray, with general profits ... What am I saying? A person who is really aware of blockbuster mentality will be willing to give up the unwanted sex for a sweet girl, dedicating in order to make sincere things in a small way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm in the 1940s. <br /> <br /> I'll rate this movie higher, but the end is a bit more casual, and probably Robert Cummins lacks sufficient indication of the change in heart. (I like the fact that B movies are small and swollen, tube well and not spontaneous, but this may require more than 70 minutes.) It is also a bit unrealistic to find that widows and small children will affect it so sudden death in their family. Or will be forgiving for anyone who created it. I mean, I guess it * beautiful *, but a little more tragic or hump has just been natural. Perhaps this family can make a deliberate choice for discussing their losses, reducing the effects of deliberate accidents and for those who are involved in death - because this is not just a conspiracy instrument that is not the real point of film. Although still weird.
