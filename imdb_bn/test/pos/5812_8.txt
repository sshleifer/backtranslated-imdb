This short series of this short-lived British TV was my first appearance, but I saw some of Hammer's horror films hacker (Dracula Hurra, Captain Cronos: Vampire Hunter) and thought enough of them to see a scene. <<br /> <br /> This first episode was in danger - not for fear but for all nudity. Was this "regular" TV in England in 1980? If so, it showed more skin than what I see in North America. There were three separate scenes showing naked women and their breasts, a scene where a man held his hand in one hand, and another scene with a man was that he was at the top of a sexual relationship with a woman. Hey, I'm not complaining. The story is a common issue: a wizard disappears in the 17th century, returning to her old home and making life hard for married people. Later, John Finch was not an actor as "David Winter", but his wife was not bad and was really a beauty. She was Prunella Gee as "Mary" The husband suspects him, okay, there is a matter and played part of this story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Patricia Quinn is entertained as a sunny witch "Lusina Jasup", who returned with an average stroke. There is a good time tormenting the couple until her and the wrong mistakes are made in the end. As a human being, I wanted to say it's fun to see two women! This starts off gradually, but once "Lucinda" starts stirring things, it gets very entertaining.
