The last film in a triangle of the bright Turkish director, Nuri Billyz Silen, whose last film was shown in the Mayas Citizen-Witch very Sihovian-honored film festivals. Unlike its earlier films, the story of 'Uzak' is set in Istanbul, which is one of the world's most crowded cities. However, in the silane film we see only small signs of that huge crowd. Instead he likes to concentrate on two letters, one photographer and one of his relatives who came from his small village to find jobs in transatlantic ships. The photographer, who we have realized - has also migrated to the city, it seems like the city is not realistic in the tradition of life. In relation to her relationship with her relatives, we look her first as carer and tolerant, but when she can not find a job, our Suburban character begins to get annoyed with sharing her personal 'space', whose holiday is confused. I will not publish the techniques I develop to remove any relatives from outside of my life in order to prevent any harm from seeing you, but it is enough that silon shows our skills that we get in the routine of the Suburbian life; Our own personal space, 'technique', can not be communicated with other people, 'strategies' (from our own experience, we believe that it is quite complex) to prevent our relationships from complex nature. </ br> </ br> <br /> Sela's picture portrays two characters of different genres and shows a clear picture of the people in the modern (or eastern city) borders. However, he does not condemn the two letters to do this work; rather, he uses the power of the cinema to underline this difference. For example, in search of new opportunities, we always see the character coming from the village in open spaces. Even in the house, she liked the balcony as her favorite place. On the other hand, we see the photographer always in spaces and usually at his home. Even though there are more than 10 million people and there are many events, many interesting topics can be discovered (or is it?) He is sitting in the house watching TV etc. His house is in his temple, a sacred place. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sure you will love the other two movies of silen, MySecContis (cloud cloud) and Kasba (The Town). Go and find them!
