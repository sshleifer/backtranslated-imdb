Detective story is not ideal for Matrix Universe. It is a strong narrator and a very rich feeling with a movie-nir-esque personal character. Rich, in terms of his visual appeal. Snowflake scenery, eating habits, it's all eyes closed. <br /> <br /> But what is the story? It is interesting, even if it seems a little from the place. A private detective hire to track agent Trinity. He finds out that he tried the method earlier, but with hazardous consequences for tenant detectives. Nevertheless, he tried to identify him and eventually succeeded in Alice in Wonderland references and hackers and chat rooms. Then things start to be interesting ... <br /> <br /> To everyone, it is completely satisfied with the little animated movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
