Anthony Quinn is a master of capturing our heart and sympathy. He harassed more work by his wife, illustrating a Romanian farmer with the average IQ below. It took WWII and Nazi his country. Soon he was digging excavation hoping to benefit himself in the eyes of his wife. Nazi has different ideas. In the following years, we publish the facts with his silly eyes, but what he wants to do is go home. Her manipulations and losers just get him more hot water. Finally, without any fault of his own, we see his image as the perfect Aryan in the cover of "Ari Spiegel". The war ended and he was brought to justice for the trial of the war criminals of the alliance. But if our peasant wants his wife to return home.
