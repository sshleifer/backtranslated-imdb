"Treatment" is a very sensitive and disgusting drama. The film focuses on two friends who become good friends. One of the boys has AIDS. In spite of Eric's enthusiasm, the boys became good friends. This film shows boys' journey to discover "healing" in Ohio according to "national inspector" and how it affects their relationship. Acting is amazing (I did not look at Anabella Saireora well), and the film is just plain touch. I could not cry with footwear scene. This is a good tearjerker. Place Kleenex nearby. 8/10
