First off - what do you think of something? In this age I saw the best movie! Second, I do not consider it a British movie in Dublin, and mainly Irish actors - Mornon, Gambon, Asling and Sullivan (Rita), Deirdre Ok. <br /> <br /> - Thirdly, I thought that dying was wonderful. She was funny through the sunny out. Michael Conine was just there to get the deadly background. He took each character he perfect. <br /> <br /> I saw that life was better than any other child actor than I ever had. She was smart as a kid and was credible as a kid and an adult (yes I know that's strange but hey ...). He even managed to upstage Caine. <br /> <br /> Iversena and Mornon worked very well together and was very funny in the preparatory scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
