For me and my wife this movie is more entertaining than all block-buster fierce thrillers / mystery / murder films. It's about real people making the best of their lives. They are just Indian and main characters are law enforcement. Realistic acting and great scenery are more for a little stimulating plot. Soundtrack is the soundtrack by BC Smith, who soundtracked on Quiet Waits and it's great. Adam Beach plays a tribal policeman, who is a little bit of accidental trend and Wes Studi stoic consummately professional detective. Supporting Graham Greene, Tent Cardinal etc, or even the commonest roles have many fine ones. We saw another adaptation quote weights in the humanman novel and we also enjoyed it.
