There is a lot of similarity between story and plot rather than San Connie, and sometimes Thunderbol. Other than the actor, hijacking a similar nuclear bomb, asking for ransom, trafficking ships etc. The same difference is only the Buddhist region Buddhist region's plot of Buddhist region. And NATO / RAF itself loads the nukes in the plane in thunder and Never Say Say Never Again It is replaced by a "Rouge arm" and the air falls above the United States and is stolen in the Caribbean. About 99% of the same. If anyone wants to dispute about this, they are most welcome.
