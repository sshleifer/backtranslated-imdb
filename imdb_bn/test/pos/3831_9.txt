I agree that one of the best episodes of this whole series - my only disappointment would be to look somewhat disgusting as Mark Lonard's Romulan Commander. My reasoning is that if you are not around for the first round of this episode, then you know Mr. Lennard as the father of Sircar, Speak. And for the second generation trackback (or the trekker - your choice) it takes you out of the scene. Yet he is an exceptional captain and vice versa, and this episode is well-written and well-played by everyone. Both parties have excellent points about the cost of the war. The value of peace and of course, one of the best reminders of WWII and later films. This is not my favorite section, but I must recommend a fan to see this episode through this filter. You will see it holds. I will never understand why Saa-Fi is so respected - in the wonderful circumstances, the best drama of establishing ordinary people comes.
