I was skeptical before going into it due to the terribly integrated trailer which it looked like an equally horrible movie. I was amazed that I did not waste my money. I believe the success of the movie is actually unclear and how the environment comes from it. Small things like sensor lights create a truly uncomfortable feeling. The shadows of the house and the bad feeling of bad can be easily told that you do not know how horror movies are, something that can happen in the movie. Acting is no perfect, no, they were bad. The main character is even believable to give the drama of annoying teen even around her. In the end, I was totally impressed with the film in most cases. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a movie that I recommend.
