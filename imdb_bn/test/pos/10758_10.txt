I went to the premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in NYC and I absolutely love this picture !!! I'm Diane's # 1 biggest fan and of course, as always, he gave a fantastic performance !! I have watched each of his movies and I must say it is one of my new favorites. Diane was funny and moving and just my breath away. Donald Sutherland was a wonderful amount of amazing ridiculous but serious. Anton Eilchin gave just an amazing young actor and a wonderful performance. After all, I recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a nice movie. 10 thumbs up !!! I will definitely see it again and again. This is the best movie of the year !!!
