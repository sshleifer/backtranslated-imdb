Christopher Nolan starred in the successful movie, it is not an intellectual issue for me that his filmography wants to see his first expression, which is returning to black and white in England, it has been done with less than 70 minutes of budget, but <br/> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , Which depicts the narrative structure and characteristic Fantastic amazing considering the ropes. As we have been told, we follow Wannabe, a writer named Bill (Jeremy Theobald), who started the tendency of his fans in the street with a habitual behavior with uninterrupted people, which can be considered as the first study, rules before starting his own, and Break them. <br /> <br /> He met a charismatic cobb (Alex Hau) who became glossy intelligent sensitivity and modes of abstinence and quickly hid himself with a quarrel with him. Breaking up and getting into the idea of ​​hunting their livelihoods, such as a female catapult blonde (Lucy Russell), who refuses every advance, works to find a candle mall. <br /> <br /> Ask a non-linear fashion, which researches how the nostrils and the curiosity prevail with what you expect and what they want more, you upload this movie for multiple views that are properly distributed. . There are enough twists that spin the film in a paved crossway, where the loose ends begin to come together, and the brightness of the stars' story begins. It is also amazing that the first feature is the cheap, which is a clever and sophisticated something that can be deprived of its own experience, along with it is involved in each stage of the production process, writing, production, and direction of writing, one After work on the project for the year the shoot can only happen on weekends. I think the examples of the humble roots of a successful filmmaker should serve as inspiration and that new filmmakers should inspire there. Now I will slowly wait for Christopher Nolan's campaign this year, whose trailer already has such tension.
