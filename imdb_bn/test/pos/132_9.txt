This film shows firmly to two women of love in a culture so deeply embedded in rituals and heritage. These are against a retreat in India which itself is struggling for independence from the same standard. This movie is both political and private, and both are not promotional or idealistic in front. It is easy to see why "fire" has created India's riot, yet sad Just like a real movie is seen by all the people of the world, not just the privilege of the West.
