"Five characters in search for a departure" should be one of the more clever and improved "Twilight Zone" episodes, because it is abstract ideas and thoughtful plans where the character identity is to be discovered and it will end as a surprise. . You are a military chief, a female dancer, a bag pipe player, a shoe, and hobo awake together at the bottom of the wall and nobody knows how they got there and they did not know who they are. So this episode starts with very interesting plays and mysteries, very quickly looking for audience interest so that the characters want to know the true identity and backgrounds. Along with this, the episode combines even more different characters with different opinions and living, and combines more different characters with the aim of abandoning it and finding identity and a very attractive target for the audience. Ultimately, I do not want to loot them for those who are surprised! As you stay away from your small shelter in the world and stay away from other people's people, you will find that the characters love differently differently in different ways. Really great and cleverly a real shock twist that makes the viewer occasionally occur when you search and seek while viewing the unexpected and cruel fate.
