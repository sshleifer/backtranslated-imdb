I started to see this show accidentally, but I love it. The main character is a wheelchair something that is lacking in television, especially for kids' shows. My five-year-old nephew (mostly children) looks at wheelchairs or other types of handicaps but after seeing Pelsweik it seems like it's a normal phenomenon. Every time he saw a wheelchair, he used to say "just like Pelsweich" and take what he's basically doing. And yes the animation is a bit weird, but if you can watch through the first season of Simpson, it's not bad. "Jenny" is actually an angel who helped Pelseaux to learn life lessons. He could walk some time because he could not walk, I saw every episode and he did not go to my flirt, he is a barbarian that he has no feeling below his spear (he mentions in an episode). For comedians, if you can get a copy of the "Nantent" episode, Lampoo boybands, you love this shot immediately.
