I do not know what the latest reviewer is talking about but this show is pure entertainment. Basically two dudes are held in a club competition to select girls in 3 different situations. They mix the scenario for every show, so it's not the same every time. 4 The judges panel is not afraid to accept it or accept the game when it accepts the game. They will break what they have done wrong, and what they did right. Some competitors are weak, some are strong but always entertaining. If you are a guy that goes out, you can relate. I saw the weak game, I saw a strong game, and this show is for real. There is no doubt.
