It was a movie that I finally thought, "Now it was 2 hours enjoyable!" I can not spend around $ 20 to feel my husband and myself "$ OK" ($$$$ with $$) <br /> <br /> I think Will Smith likes as a comic actor. Action hero She is throwing this well. His character was very liked, as was Kevin James. <br /> <br /> To laugh a lot loudly This is a romantic movie, so boys, if you want to impress the lady in your life, take her away. Women will like as much chick-flick, but I will not classify it as one. There are lots of people laughing in to enjoy men. I think this movie is such a reason why a movie is so perfect as a date movie. It has romance and slapstick. I usually do not want too much slapstick, but it was not overdone and I could not think of that scene that did not deliver that smile. <br /> <br /> I certainly recommend this movie. After the end, my husband told me, "I want to see it again!"
