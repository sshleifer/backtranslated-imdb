I adored this, but I'm an 80's kid. I like Rainbow Bright my whole childhood. I do not know if I was very interested in these days, I did not get the admiration, mine was not mine. (But okay, I bought it for me, I just brought a little guy so that the guy does not feel as good as a man at the checkout stand.) I love nonviolent drama and colorful scenery. It reminds me of a simple time before cartoons have more violence than cartoons can legally show our local news. :) Although I can be a little favorable about this. Finally, I was in Reno for 6 years in the row for Halloween ........ It is amazing that they make Reno bright clothes for adults. Hah hah
