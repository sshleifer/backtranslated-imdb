I do not understand why the critics would impose this film. This is a teen movie which is really serious, which is a rareness. I will admit that the moments are very hungry, but it will fall in love with young, it will be sad to be legitimate. Chris Klein is my biggest complaint. Although he was funny on getting American, he is not obviously ready to switch to more dramatic rent, he was uncomfortable seeing some of his "uncle's stuff". Hartnet and Sobiesky, on the other hand, show an extraordinary amount of parental depth and credibility. Though this poem is widely bound with the lovers of closing the poems, the actors do it. Instructions Some powerful images on the sports screen. Beautiful cinematography, nice music, great young actors, I was fascinated and when it comes to teen movies, I am a tragedy critic.
