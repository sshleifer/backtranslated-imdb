Probably a film that comes along with perfection once in a generation. For me, "The Children of Children" is a movie - a timeless classic which is most beautifully operated and performed. It is justified in favor of humanity and the ultimate consequence of the love of cruel injustice and the victory of faith. Each performance is a jewel, though Bobby is standing and Judy likes Garland as Dorothy before him, and Jenny Aguetter makes it impossible to imagine anyone else in our role. <br /> <br /> The best picture in the world and today's kids will be better to see it. <br /> <br /> Of course, like many young people of my generation, I was frustrated with the love of Jenny Agutter and her strong strong strength was a few days ago when I had a good fortune to meet him - smiling sweet smiles I was there for fear of being afraid to send me weak on my knees, because they did all the years ago!
