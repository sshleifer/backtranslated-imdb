At the age of fifteen, I saw the first film in the 1959 Walk in Double Bay in Sydney. I then like it and still do it. Couple casting is great - in those days the actors played "naturally" and you were "felt" for them in their respective roles. This period is a "shiny" film - its relationship is still relevant to today's world but now the sexes are in the same level, treatment of women shown in the past should not be allowed. Soundtrack music is wonderful and it is delighted that the score of the movie was released in January 2005 by the CD. Visible scenes were expired before the release - even two hours even more you want! I have registered for the DVD in the Amazon (they now have a special page). After six years of films, this film will be very good to see and scan the movie. Twenty-one Century Fox, please see your catalog of fifty-year cinematic productions for DVDs - there is a big market there. I'm waiting for America's arrival in March 2004, the Vanity Fair special article of the film, which is thought to be fifteen pages with many pictures set. Cheers
