Both books and movies are excellent for their own rights. They do little difference but that does not improve and detects from a nice script and acting. Historical environment, young girl looking lover, music is amazing background and the journey in London's homosexual world early in the twentieth century This is an exceptional movie. Just as author of authors such as Andrew Davis senses himself, he wrote this sensitive love story. Rachel Sterling and Kelly Haas are both excellent actresses and they deliver their best. The rest of the cast is very good. If 10 out of 10, I will give it!
