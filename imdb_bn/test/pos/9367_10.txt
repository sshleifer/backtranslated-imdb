The original film of 1947 is also superior to the anti-Semitism and, in virtually every division, Eliassa is better than Kazakh's GiantMan contract (the last winner of the year's Academy Award). Edmard Demittier's perfect guidance, John Packston's teaser script and J. Expert Expressionist Light of Roy Hunt is nicely inspired by a fantastic rope. Although Robert Young (playing a simple, systematic and very favorite copy) and Robert Mitchell (who has occasionally made great surprises), the nominal star of the film, it is Oscar nominated Robert Ryan and Gloria Assemble - as well as Paul Kelly, the small but important Introduction - who gave the most memorable characters in the film; As a suicide racist, Ryan was so sure that he finally cast for some time and earned a terrible role in films like Volleyys of Act (1948), Saadhgh GH (1948), The Racket (1951), Class Bite Night (1952). , Knock Spahr (1953) and Black Rock (1955). The film is also notable for its ranch's "flashback" ornamentation structure, it is a complete fabrication, which is simply shot, when the true truth is actually divided into the true realm of the true movie, from distorted memorabilia, however, even a star of the movie did not star! Also, Crossfire used primarily homosexuality (according to Richard Brooks' original source novel "The Brick Foxhole"), but this banned issue was unacceptable at that time at the office - we are crying from today's situation (at least 3 gay-themed films this year for the Oscars <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A silent note, however, the audio silent experts, James Urcini and Allyn Silver's comments are good, although I can not express their opinion that the dentistry profession has shrunk steadily after the problems of the Hew, such as Snipers (1952), The Coin Moutini (1954), Broken Lansy (1954), The Yuan Lance (1958), Warlock (1959) and Meirez (1965) have been proven enough; Producer Adrian Scott and Screenplay With the help of John Paxton's media with my rifles - Moderator, My Sweet (1944), Carnade (1945; It is expected that it will be part of the next movie silent box set Warner) and crossfire - its best. In any case, in my opinion, the next is not only one of the main films of 1940, but it is sometimes one of the best hells ever made.
