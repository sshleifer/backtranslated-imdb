Bug Ross changed my life. I heard it weird strange, weird. But it did. I'm from England, there was never been a promotion on bugs, but five years ago I went on holiday with my family and saw it on the Disney Channel. Once I saw this TV series, I wanted to go. I had a strong conviction for my parents to allow my parents to go to Wajia. I'm leaving at the age of 12 and this was my next year in summer. If you get a teenager to come to this reading camp, change your life. Life makes you long friends in Wiji. If you do not care who you are or if someone in the house does not like you, then everyone likes you in the camp. You have a lot of fun. If you go to www.wazi.com and want to test it for yourself It's so much fun I love it that it is home away from my home
