Combination of Western and Gothic horror conventions, and often as an industry film, it is one of Segel and Eastwood's best collaborations. <br /> <br /> Eastwood plays a Yankee soldier who, after being wounded during civil war, took refuge in a separate southern seminar for young women. Stay away from the world, women project their romantic imagination to them, and they respond by corrupted, male manipulation. But jealousy and dissatisfaction can raise their head, and he can find himself in a world of brutal revenge. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> My "and" Titot ". <br /> <br /> This picture unfolds a strong screenplay of fierce battles of sexual relations and a mix of horror and dreams of sex. All the characters feature both vague, good and bad features By showing it, it leaves us free to leave us. <br /> <br /> Most of the subtle movies behind Dawn Siegel Everything is far from the "invitation to body graduates" to "Dentity Harry", but his first black and white pictures seem to be good, but most of his colorful films appear to be great, dated and badly shot, 40 years ago, his radioactive "realism" Of course, it seems to be fresh and dynamic, but today when I see it, I do not think that they are standing in time exams. <br /> < "Beaglele" is a different league, mature, hesitant and strictly shot, it is not a shame as it is more widely known. During the development of technology and technology, most of the seagull energy, extraordinary action thrills have become obsolete, "The Begoll" still Visitors are reached due to its spiritual atmosphere and unique content. Well, similar to Thailand's "Black Narsisas", in my opinion, Seagel's best film - better than that of 8.5 / 10. Part horror, part drama, part erotic audition, "The Begume" is a surprisingly arty film (especially when Segal regards his films as quote, meaningless). Due to Clint Eastwood, a large part of the film artwork, who tried to pick mature stuff at the moment.
