This movie was removed more than I expected, and I was ready to cry. The acting mainly carries the film, along with Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Rene Zelger, Cast Castor performs great acting. These actors have depicted the characters so deep that they entered with me the rest of the night, and I had trouble in reducing the drama of this war. Clothing and cinematography were magicians, but did not carry with them. They did not focus, but the whole effect was added. Cold Mountain can not be my favorite movie, that title will always belong to the English patient, but it is the top five. The story itself was well developed, and remain fairly unpredictable. I could not find myself coming next to the line guess. An impressive story about humanity and war. Actually, this movie was so strong that it was rarely noticed in the 19th century. It always applies.
