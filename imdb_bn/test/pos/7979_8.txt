For a long time, it was my favorite of Batman films. It was a great feeling with the best painters and two wild characters - Catwomen and The Penguin - always-interesting with Christopher Walken. However, after watching the end, my ratings finally fall, and, frankly, I now like the last Batman: starting with the famous Christian Bell. <br /> <br /> It's still the most provocative Batman movie on the next day. Here is one of the best films of stylish cinematography Batman. Director Tim Burton is famous for his films, which highlights the spectacular visual characteristics, because it is a great example. The three letters listed above are all very different and very interesting, almost interesting. In Villains, I liked Catwomen, before and after her changed her most fun find. In other Batman stories it is not an overdone violence, but it is never bothered to see it. He worked well with Michael Keton Batman / Bruce Wayne as he did in the first film. BAD - For a movie that is based on a comic strip to read most of the kids, I still think both of Batman films made by these two Batman were very dark and prejudice is not obvious. However, unlike the first movie, there was no benefit in the name of iron, there was still flaw, and both villains made so much sexual comment. If they have not taken this film for adults as well as adults, then it is okay. Perfect gross on Danny Davito's "Penguin" spots. "Grotesque" I can manage, but who wants "gross". Some guys, in the meantime, complain about Mitchell Pfeiffer about playing Catwoman. Christiano is too dark and some cheesy shots Christian-bothered me re-considering my previous high rating of this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall - It is the most striking series for the spectacular scenes and memorable characters Batman, but a very dark side of very dark, very gross and very anti-religious bias eventually turned me off after a half-dozen appearances in this film. Sorry, but I like a kind-gentler Batman movie. After all, it's just a cartoon. Most would disagree, but I was glad to see the series being light after this.
