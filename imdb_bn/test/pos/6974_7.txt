Francis Ford Coppola wrote and managed this wonderful personal story of a married woman from her husband - and probably behind her youth's youth and excitement. We do not learn a little about the marriage of this woman that she seems to be leaving her freedom late; She has also recently learned her pregnancy, making her heart more complicated (despite her husband talking to her husband, she does not want to be a confident ifer). He completes two men on his journey: the football hero of a former college - after an accident during a game - with permanent brain damage and a sexy, striuting motorcycle police has had many problems in his own life. . Clear, clear landscapes (such as the very gifted Willamer Butler's photographs) are clearly perceived as the character. Sheryl Knight, James Kane and Robert Duval each provide firm, firm performance, especially since it is not a very popular man in conventional terms. Some scenes (such as Knight's first call home from a pay-phone, or ear on his first night, where he plays 'Simon Says') are almost intimate. Toys with coppola reality, turning jagged memories of her character into scrapbook we have been hiding in us He can run the scenes, but the editing is quite strong and the film is not allowed to be too heavy (at least two or three are very neat moments). This is a great effort - so much that the picture is shown in the festivals even after about five years. Some Coppola's unwanted packaging may leave them to bitterly end up with bitter sarcasm, but forced behind the photo and the drive almost abandoned its flaws. *** *** to ***
