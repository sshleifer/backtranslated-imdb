I have not seen this fine movie in 50 years but I am writing any comment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Embarrassing the appointment. It does not work that way. The film shows that marine people had more challenges than they ever realized, and (what could be guessed?) King-size challenge was proposed to just how many people were asked. I personally know that many people that joined the marine after seeing di. Lines at the recruitment center were so long that the marine vessels were more employed than they could manage. <br /> <br /> so it goes away. America will always have the young one seeking to make themselves the best - when the slackers and the born-losers lump along somewhere <br /> <br /> What we did not do in 2007 is a film that inspires patriotism, devotion to any kind of duty, positive values, etc. What we have is the film that inspires airheads to airhands, beer drinkers to grow beer, other negative values Display # 1 is Airhead Teen Travesty and the Bear Gazing epic Superbard is now # 81 on All Time Great Films list. Values? What does the value mean?
