Dirty Dance follows the story of Francis Baby 'Houseman (Jennifer Gray) and his family when they spend their summer summer camp in the Caymanian camp. We saw him inventing himself as soon as he fell in love with the dance instructor, Johnny Castle (Patrick Soze). <br /> <br /> This movie is full of extraordinary dancing (hence the title!) some great songs, and awesome scenery. It handles some difficult issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, here (the threatened spoiler!) Feels a happy, wonderful, good end! You know how to end it from the beginning, but that's not really the point here. The point is the journey, which is a journey that touches every member of the family. <br /> <br /> It's a movie I want to see when it comes to TV ... I do not think it's already memorized!
