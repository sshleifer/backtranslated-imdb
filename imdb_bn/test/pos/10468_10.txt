I do not know whether this movie is hiting my heart because of the warmth of creativity, love, closeness or babat cooking creativity, but when the festival starts and for the rest of the film, I often choke. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is an emotional movie, but without the feeling of love or harmony in Mecca. Please note that the plot material is discussed. Babbitt Feast tells his story with restraint and care, and it lets us discover the value of grace and love for ourselves. We need to know that Bobet Hertant (Stephen Adran) was a French refugee who provided shelter to two elderly sisters of a small community on the coast of Jutland. The sisters lead the remnant of their father's flock. He is a priest of firm faith who comes through educated self-denial. The sisters have sacrificed their duty and faith. Still remain in honor of those long dead pastor's teachings and his spiritual guidance. Yet, because of their old age, the small community has become intelligent and reasonable. Sisters what they can do. For pastor's 100th birthday, Babe wants to cook dinner to invite younger sisters. Sisters agree unwillingly, but when they order to deliver in Gabbar, they and their guests feel uneasy. They used the usual rental dry code of the community, advocates, and a soup made of bread, water and a small needle. Although Babbett has improved over time, what they are seeing now seems to be neutral. On dinner, a visitor general, Lawrence Lovernehm, who had longed for his love for sisters over the years. <br /> <br /> Do we enjoy? Belief in the old age community and the intensity of stones, wind torn cottages. Sisters have warmth with candles in small, crowded dining rooms. And then the father's artwork transformed his cock, we see Eric, a little boy helps him, serves and pours out, and looking at the old parishioners with the help of good alcohol and fine cooking, gradually rediscover their communities and love and friendship. The general serves as our unexpected guide because he is the only one who knows what extraordinary food they eat. The General told a story to his uncomfortable dinner attendants, "The famous cafe fingerprint of Paris was a story about a famous woman in Paris. "... this woman, the chef of this head, had the ability to transform a dinner as a kind of love ... a love affair that does not make any difference between physical hunger and spiritual hunger." He has also been transformed into a man who will accept him, and then he will always know the value and love that he already knows before accepting what he has accepted. An old couple kissing. Two old people think of past friendships. And all that won in the lottery for this dinner was that of Babbet, he once had the opportunity to become an artist in France, he had a chance with love and friendship. <br /> <br /> <br /> As long as he was alive to his father, so long as he was poor, he would continue with sisters. A car with his daughter returned to his estate in general. And the old guests went to their sisters' house to go back to their own hutments. They break and clear the night sky and they look overhead. They spontaneously hold hands in a circle and sing this song ... <br /> <br /> "The clock suddenly goes away forever. Let's try to serve this time with the Lord in mind that we find our true home. It is found that our real home is found. <br /> <br /> They laugh at each other. All have been combined <br /> <br /> <br /> The father is a wonderful film, uninterrupted emotions, obscure understanding, knowledge ... and, of course, a meal that leaves you in the belly of pregnancy as soon as you get out of the theater.
