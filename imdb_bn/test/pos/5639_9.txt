OK, so I'm a sucker for a good documentary, especially where it tells the story of a modern day Don Quixote. A Warning: He is still working with Coventry when he meets Mark Bockardt in the winter of 1995/96. But I'll save that story later. The American movie, which produces a long time later, represents a person who correctly depicts me, though in a deeper depth compared to my expectations or credentials. It is a very funny and very sad movie together, and is brilliantly executed. Mark has come to be his own worst enemy: Desperate by his child's ambition and optimism - which I like - his apparent artistic ambiguity and his odd financial expectations. But he is a charisma guy. Its devoted Sancho Panza is equally equivalent to the original: frozled, original, if core. Like the Don Quixote, the American movie often presents an undisclosed outlook for independence - businesses that are not particularly suitable, because of repeated failures, irrespective of their failure. This is a great movie.
