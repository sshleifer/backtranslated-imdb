I can not tell how many times a line laughs me or how many times I do not know this movie is described. I saw it in the year it released, I was 19. I do not think that night in that East Village theater was a dozen people. For years I thought we were the only one who saw it. Seeing it to others, I have found that it has been found to be violent and in spite of the time it is seeing permanent value. Rent it, buy it or steal it .... one must definitely see it.
