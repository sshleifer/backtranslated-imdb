An amazing play about "Krumar v. Krummer" is an unhappy woman who is walking with her husband and younger son. Now the husband has to take care of the child. They can know each other better as they do. But then, mother and wife come back, and she wants to take care of the boy. There's a lot of drama with some excellent bits of comedy for "Crumar V Crammer" for better measurements. Here, Dustin Hoffman won her first Best Actor Oscar for her superb acting. Most people call her performance in "Rainman", which won her second Oscar, her best. He was very good in that movie, but I disagreed with him. In my opinion, Hoffman's career's best performance is in this movie. After the scene, the scene shows us why Hoffman is one of the best American actors today. He's funny from time to time Murphy Strip is also giving amazing acting, who was still not known on the day that he made the film. Strips like Hoffman, in an effort to try to walk on her own family as her wife and mother, for her first Oscar (best supporting actress) in "Krrmor v. Krummer". Justin Henry, when the movie came out, is just 8 years old, Hoffmann and Strip's son as wonderful. He has won the Oscar nomination for his role here, and so far he is the youngest actor to receive Oscars nomination in a competitive division (extraordinary supporting actor) Jane Alexander is fined as a family family friend. She also received Oscar nomination (for supporter actress where she lost the strip co-actor). "Crumer vs Krummer" is a great movie starting from the beginning. Writer-director Robert Benton made a completely unforgettable film. <br /> <br /> **** (four out)
