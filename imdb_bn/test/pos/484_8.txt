I really enjoy this special production "Mikado." The producers added a few touchs to make it more attractive for modern audiences - for example, "Assassian Day of the Year" ("Little List" is completely updated) and ads are played across a few lines. Liberty is also taken with the setting. Clothing is not Japanese, but English in the 1920s (though some "Tititudian" girls wear 20 'inspired kimonis). This production is well known dancer with the dance styles of the 1920s and there are some extra dancers and belapps to entertain your eyes (ears) while singing. If you are Gilbert and Sullivan Purist, these changes may disturb you, but I think they are good - and I like the clothes! <br /> <br /> Felicity Palmer (Katisha) is absolutely sunny; All his scenes make me laugh a bit (the first add-on of my favorite add-on when he first opens the door - the dancer annoys him with his antics, so he scribbles on his voice, "stop it !!!") All the other main characters work well as well. I especially like Mark Richard as Push-Tusch (the hat!) And Leslie Garrett as Yam-Yam. <br /> <br /> You should remember that this is a stage production and set your expectations accordingly. There is no change in settings, though filmmakers used some film techniques from 1930 to add interest. If this product has a drawback, the stage makeup is not fixed for the close up shots with the camera. Foundation lines are often visible and eyeliner, lipstick, and blush everywhere seems to be a surplus. I saw this kind of thing happening before the films of theater, and it's a little shocking at first. However, I hope you use it and enjoy "micado" for its value - a classic, fully-present presentation!
