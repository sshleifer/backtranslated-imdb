Even after all these years, it remains for me "a perfect movie". I still think I'm sitting in the theater for a long time, stuck by this experience, overcome emotions. I'm the DVD owner (of course!) At least once a year. It is impossible and I can not add a lot about its excellence and beauty has already been written. I love so much love! A note: The author of this book - Michael Orndez - was enchanted with the film and he said that he wanted to think about some beautiful scenes that he wrote for the movie ... just as Kip "invites" a little candle and strikes beside him , And he persuaded to see Fresco of the medieval church to destroy Hannah.
