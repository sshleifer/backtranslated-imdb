The 1949 edition "The Blue Legoons" is not the original movie for the record, as has been said. <br /> <br /> This story was illustrated in Great Britain in 1923, after writing a novel. As much as I love to see the 1949 edition, I will enjoy an opportunity to see the true original liberation war of this story in the film. Guess, 1980's was coined with Christopher Atkins, Brooke's film shield, and beautiful cinematography of two young people. Actor was not so great when I watched this movie, but after seeing it a few times ... it became clear that two children are growing up on the island without adult instruction, then it will be easier <br /> <br /> Although 1949 Although I'm fortunate enough to see the "blue legoon", I can not help but am surprised if anyone can live to publish this 1932 story.
