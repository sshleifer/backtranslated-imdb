Certainly this film has the ring of truth, because it appears to be based on the actual events of the marine base. It is related to a cover-up attempted by the local marine commander of unacceptable behavior by a marine head, which killed his ex-girl friend Marine Captain. Men and women were lovers, but Captain married his boy friend when he tried to break off the relationship. He started looking at him to burn his arm in the fire. Eventually, he ran into his house, attacked him with a knife, and he was shot twice by his pistol. Civil Prosecutor suicides ruled suicide, but the Marines decided to charge the captain with the assassination. Vietman's decorated hero and commanding officer of the Marine base was an old friend of the Colonel who you saw as the main. The captain also made some enemies in his motor pool command, rejecting the progress of some men in a very boost style. <br /> <br /> The original participants of this play have enough mental freight aircraft to inspire and control. , Which is very capable of casting the cast nicely. However, the director and editor, frustrating flashbacks and visible perspective perspectives are as firm as possible to blur the event as much as possible. You are most lucky if you know where you are. Bear with them though; This is an appropriate story in the context of Captain's military trials, and it seems that every person has even his attorneys against him. <br /> <br /> judgment? Well, after all, it's rather a mystery story, so you will see for yourself. There is a kind of "peaceist" message in the film, but forget it. Sure, "hell to fight", but sometimes it can not escape. We will only need those marines, even if they are not always the best champions of internal sports. As Kipling says in his poem "Tommy Atkinson": <br /> <br /> "It's Tommy and Tommy, and Tommy is waiting outside, but it's room for Mr. Atkins, when the army is in the tide."
