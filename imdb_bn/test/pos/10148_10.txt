Exceptional entertainment from 1956's The Man Who New to Me! Those who like the original of 1934, I would say that it is a quick and intelligent. However, even though the American version (heaven forbidden!) Is a big budget blockbuster, I believe it blows the British version out of water. I think he has made more than 50 films of 10 best-no-small achievements in Hitakk, and many of them were the greatest of all times. I find so much for love: <br /> <br /> 1) James Stewart, America's Favorite Minister for so many years, playing helpless parents here is a wonderful job. He can make a movie enjoyable and can work with such a character in such a great story, he dumped me very loudly aloud to him very loudly. Basically there is nothing compared to Leslie Bank. <br /> <br /> 2) Doris Day. Yes doris day Despite all the criticism of her, I think she makes a loving wife / mother a very sympathetic person. I do not agree with its negative comments on its character; Because he is soft spoken and gentle, it is meaningless and helpless. I do not want to loot anything, but after the failure of her husband, she made an important invention by herself. He gave the story a level of warmth that was not only in the first place, and it is the way to go for those who care for this version. And I like the best Sera; I think this is the beautiful song that I heard and won his Oscar. It puts the film on another level. <br /> <br /> 3) The order of Albert Hall. I do not think it was too long; I think the whole time was created in this mysterious crossend and in this scene the direction of Hitako was absolutely brilliant. And the killer was really awesome. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally I smiled at my face; Even after the previous scene ended, I thought the rescue scene was exciting and again it was very nice to see the delightful family together. The last line of film is extremely fun. I do not think the picture has started slowly; Hitco was trying to find us like McKenna and try and he did a great job. I was not a huge fan of kids playing Hank, but I had no problem with him. Han is Ben and Joe's baby, I care too much about him; Like he did not have a brat or something. <br /> <br /> I did not find any major errors in this film and found many big and minor traits. The way to go to the hit!
