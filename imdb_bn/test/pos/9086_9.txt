Flatliners can not get much eerier than This deep, dark film was pumping across my heart. The light is dark and you'll get the mood for a death defying experience. At the age of 24, Kefar is in the top form. He is a great actor and he plays a very treacherous and disgusting role that will not forget you for many years to come. And what can you say for the rest of the cast? An all-star lineup, Julia is much more hot than before, Will, Oliver and Kevin have illuminated the thriller stage that will keep you holding your seats. It is a refreshing scene to see a truly thriller with top professional actors. You do not regret seeing this 2 hour seat bender. -JL
