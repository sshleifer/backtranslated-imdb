It is a schizophrenic patient's life, a versatile, insightful and courageous story about the people of their (and us) perception and reality. Although the main theme revolves around a misguided young girl, the story makes fun with physics, medicine, religion and even politics because it questions our perception about what is true and what is real. Kankona Senanarman beautifully said that the inhabitants of the world of Mithi are coming to us like us. In that world, she is logical and her thoughts are internally consistent, we do not seem to be proud of our world <br /> <br /> <br /> Here are some amazing scenes that are thought of watching movies Do not, these are not spoilers). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The "ghost" sitting in the brain of sweetness will take away. <br /> <br /> - The doctor determines the shock-treatments as a solution to "trust" for doing the job <br /> <br /> - The scene about the concept of Windows - Anu Book Review. <br /> <br /> - Conversation confusion about a manager looking for "Maya". <br /> <br /> - George Bush's news footage tells the world that there is no doubt in his mind that there is WMD in Iraq "(Now, there is not so much about Bush's perception, which I suspect is truly realizing the people of Iraq's WMD. ) <br /> <br /> - One of the best scenes in the film is Mithi Anu, "Charu sent this guy to kill me" and Anu rejected it Mr. Kanakona has done a fantastic job, when the strange mix of skezyfrenic brain's strange thought comes out during his world and real world collision. <br /> <br /> Aparna Sen was brave, but was not brave enough to ask a big question: almost all Mankind is confusing to believe in God? He has some scenes about prayer and sacrifice to "normal", "healthy" people. Nobody has ever seen or heard in any human history (this event / extrovert does not go enough). The final question will be: What is normal? Who is true, believer or atheist? <br /> <br /> <br /> This image makes the schizophrenic mind more complex than "a beautiful mind". It not only sees the sick person but also looks at the healthy mind and does it in different ways and illumines our own mind and our burden of our world. If the former 4 Oscars are available, then it also claims - at least one each for the story, screenplay, direction, Conkona and Shabana Ajmi. This was really a treat to watch this movie and I am happy that I bought the DVD for my collection. <br /> <br /> This story was really very well spoken.
