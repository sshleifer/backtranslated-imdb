Again, Alumni has supplied our top quality film. This director is amazing, and he is proven that he is equally talented and effective when he exceeds the style. <br /> <br />, with the help of a nice character film, dialogue and personality trick, but with a more delicate story (Raman's father's view), allows listeners to be very closely identified with the drama, create importance and all the deeper facts Emotional impact Visuals Occasionally, stunning (dream of beach beaches) occasionally, and I think Alanamber's films have benefited from the real benefit that they compose a music - it changes the changed mood of the movie in a shameless manner. <br /> <br /> Only about a brutality is more than a movie, which itself is an important thing, this film confronts the duality of a person who seems to enjoy life in real life (although it is limited in limited), And yet his desire to die The great depression of the movie is endlessly threatened by quips, which seems to be fun because they must surely give you a welcome vacation from suffering. <br /> <br /> Although obviously on behalf of solitude, this image represents an excellent job representing Raman's friends and family's numerous scenes. Raman's father was most tragic, when he said, frustrated, "It's just a bad thing to lose a child, and the child wants to die." <br /> <br /> Excellent writing, acting, direction, cinematography, music - 10/10
