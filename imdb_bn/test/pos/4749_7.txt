How do they drag the semi-final shot behind the half-hour? And then sitting in judgment - great! It seems that the DVD is scheduled in May of 2006 - almost time !! If it is possible to fully appreciate the aspect ratio of the full visibility see it on a big screen or film revival. My other favorites in this category: The original Italian work with Michael Caine; Bulit with Steve McQueen; When the CHI's age came, he lived and died; French connection with Gene Hackman; Ronin with Robert Denro; Varnishing Point with Barry Newman; Again the enemy of the state with Hackman - what is your favorite?
