Captain Corally Mandolin itself is a fantastic movie. It's nothing like a book, which can offend its enthusiastic followers. Still, it can be seen on its own, the film is a wonderful composition. Views are spectacular and acting is not too bad !! Nicholas Cage was brighter - his usual action hero is so different from the type of characters. Penelope cruz holds pretty and really holds the film together. I think this film will be judged as an indefinite project-not related to the book. Louis De Barnesi has given the rights to the film script, so the film is directed by John Madden. Go and see this movie with an open mind - you like it; Because below love and war tactic story.
