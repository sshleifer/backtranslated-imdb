This is half the movie being a top movie. The opening category, which destroys Hollywood "social messages" movies, is quite brilliant. This is a riot that started from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The second story, which represents the main characters of our story, is also really great. We've got many great comic setups, top-level performance and the dialog is really dynamic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, the film ends, which I think is the opposite of what happened earlier. My explanation was that this image was taking Mickey out of all the stupid projects and small city gossip and national tabloid sensationalism. I love that this movie was challenging because a person's sex is not determined by their hobby, idiosyncrasies, fashion sense or whatever. And then it's over and restarted all the gossip and stereootype that successfully lamps the movie in the first place. It activates activating 100% of everyone's rights !!! (Godamit!) In fact it was very frustrating what was a great story.
