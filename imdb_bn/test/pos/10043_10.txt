It's great !!! There are not many partnerships like Iral, and Olivia. Love there genuine! I'm 24 years old, but this glow is now 60 years ago that I was impressive now. Raoul Walsh is a low-quality genius, so wide in his direction, so broad, yet intimate. The mid-scene between Colonel (Flin) and his wife (De Havilland) often brings me to tears (24yr old people are not easy !!), like their heart-twists. There is a deep Christian message here, the believer has accepted your glory with you, and trust, and his honesty to make his wife come true, so that he performs his moral duty to defend the innocent civilians from some genocide. In most cases there are no films related to these problems. To view this defining moment in military and military history from inside America, anyone will have to see. Patriots, all due to the right reasons I knew that Iral was a star of Flin, and De Heivland was a screen legend - it's only my doubt that they are the greatest!
