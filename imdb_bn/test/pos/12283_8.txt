This is an enjoyable project, it is not a movie suggested for title. Good acting by Nadia Dasani, revising the role of the grade. I followed the revision of Mike and Grace incident in New York City. He leaves, but he wants to contact her. This project is the way to try to contact him. <br /> <br /> I saw the IFC. I heard that it will be released on DVD too. I like this trend of more independent projects. This is a good example of a project. <br /> <br /> I hope he finds her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
