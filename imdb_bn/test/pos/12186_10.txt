I think this movie was first seen, but it increased on me. I like the clothes and make actors, humorous, movies, soundtracks. The scene is very rich, and it moves quickly too. Every time I see it, there is something new that can be seen in my eyes. Alayah is probably the only thing that is destroyed by the sky, but it is not enough. <br /> <br /> Apart from this film, it's not the same character. You can see that character Armaan has been given a quality like Lestat because I think he wanted it. But there is no reason to dismiss this movie because it is not like books, it is interesting by itself.
