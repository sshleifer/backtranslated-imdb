At the beginning of Spolare, the film focuses on three friends, Samantha (Summer Phoenix), Chris (Nick Stahl), and Wayne (Aaron Paul). The film stars Sam and Owen as drug addicts and Chris, the track star, who takes care of them. As Chris's rise to the growing things of the house, he asks Sam what kind of drug is. Sam rehabilitates this point by pointing out and confidently and makes him everything better. Chris then caught up with Owen and they started to use. He takes character twice until he is a "full time member". After a dealer and a confession with Sam, he got back again. So for them start downward spiral. When Chris Odd breaks a promise to Sam (I want to make the movie a little strange). He died, Sam is in a college college, and Oven is arrested. So the story ends <br /> <br /> End of the spoller. <br /> <br /> Nick Stahl is amazing. One day he has an Oscar. Chris's screenplay was heartwarming. The use of drugs was as real as possible in the film as much as possible. Oron Paul, who played Oven, did not act as heroine or at the speed. Summer Phoenix was fine, she was talented but I told Nick Stahl stole the movie. His fake eyes, his slow motion, everything was perfect. <br /> <br /> The author has to show a comeback in the film. This is the main reason why people do not want to resign. Sunny scenes on the other side (mall scene and backstreet boy scene scene, Man Stahl took just the reaction of the head.), Touch, sad scene (Beat-up later in the scene between Sam and Chris in his bedroom, I bawled, and park scene.). It was realistic. Once again Chris again wanted to leak into the toilet, and Chris used it again after coming to himself, although he was clean for two weeks but the pool was very strong. It's all realistic. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie for a great cast, great music and half-truthful account of drug addiction.
