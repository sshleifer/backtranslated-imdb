This movie has a lot to suggest it. All of the pictures, music, and David Hewlett's naked butt are fantastic! For confrontation, confrontation, forgiveness, and courage are very funny and touchy - and it is not predictable, which says a lot about a movie of this day and age. However, acting medium, the direction is confusing, and the script is just odd. It is often felt that it was tried to be a parody, but I did not try it as * parody * *. And it's not a parody, well, it remains a potential movie that does not live with it a great movie.
