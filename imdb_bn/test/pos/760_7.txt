I had never heard of this movie before I was looking at local movie stores. In the recent Harry Potter installment, I was curious about Rupert Grint and wanted to see more work. "Unreasonable, evangelical evangelist Christian merciful", and I thought of reading the description of myself as a good evangelist Christian, "Oh, it should be interesting." And so it was. I found Mr Brock's story both words and images beautiful; And sad enough, all are very familiar. What it meant to be Christian, the contrast he made in his parents' interpretation of his parents was a deadly comment on how Christians saw themselves and the impact on those around them. On the one hand, our Ben's mother says, "What happened behind these walls, Ben, we are the messengers of Allah. We have seen the world as a sunny face." On the other hand, Ben's father discussed the truth in his speech at the beginning of the movie. At the end of his union, he said, "One person defeats their Christianity for the benefit of others, less than I believe in Christian religion, I believe in God." God has told us that the true faith is the freedom to choose the truth. , Way, method, way of your disposal, no result of this thing, unless you are a Christian or atheist, your heart Pony true. "If only Christians in our churches are full of meaning, but the former instead of the previous definition of what it means to be a follower of Jesus? What would that make a difference! As a Christian and psychologist, I would like to have an incomplete but trustworthy faith in a completely polished film any day. What a tragedy ?? It seems like I always have to play a role, actually, I need to rest for the freedom of those who have established me as God. I think Mr Brock gives an instant glimpse of what this freedom of Christ looks like. I recommend this film to anyone who wants a new look of faith.
