Last night I saw this movie in the Bomb International Festival of Women, and Mrs. Troche asked us to know (after screening her question), she does not expect too much distribution in the United States for her strong reason. Including all of the so-called "gay content" It was a great entertainer comedy and it seems to me that they can enjoy the same as enjoying American audiences "The Fault Monty", so it's really unfortunate and ridiculous that few shots of kisses of two sons are kept away from the mainstream theater. Wonderful cast, decent script and, of course, one of the fun movies I've seen on Rose Troch.
