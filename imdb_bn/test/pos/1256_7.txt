Children - At the age of 39, most of the life of Russell Droit was jealous - he had a great job, honored (and fearful), he had a beautiful house and made buckets of money. But everything comes at a cost, in this case there is no social life, no conscience, and there is no fear of living alone. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie, I was wondering why Disney did not send this image to Mirmax - because it is not particularly bold or intense, because it is definitely a movie for adults. It is stimulated by marketing campaigns which are clearly targeted to children - it is lumped with trailers for "Rugrits the movie" and "Pokemon 2000". (They're still not passaging?). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, some serious surrender and its Life takes stock. His guide to this journey of self-discovery comes at 8 years of age (how does he come to Rosti and evidently does not explain how I care). Young Rusty's innocence and foolish expectation give her a distinct advantage in revealing the truth - in this way she presents Russell's work as a figure reporter, "How would you lie to people and they are pretending to be something like that"? To make a good script successful, however, you need to bring the actors to life. There is no problem here. <br /> <br /> Although Willis three times. Field warnings about acting with children or animals He has been lucky again, he has falsely smuggled with Braclin, as he did dramatically with Asamat. Willis manages the balance of Russell's cutthroat powerbroker feature, being ridiculous, helpless and confused. Braslin, however, gives a dead person to each child from childhood - which is always stuck for any reason and chooses it. We also got two bonus performances: Lily is as excellent as Lelehead Russell of Tommy Russell and Gin Smart is an insightful charming Anchanger (I like him in "Giniver") as perfect. <br /> <br /> The child is charming, heavy, and real. And it will appeal to adults of all ages.
