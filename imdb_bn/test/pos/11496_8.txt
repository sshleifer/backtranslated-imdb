This movie can be compared to "comfort food" for souls. Anyone that has ever tried an attempt to save and try could relate to this movie. Many parts of it are so colorful and so many are so heartfelt truths. It's not perfect in its production or even the dialog, but the story is unique, which says a lot about modern "romantic" comedy. Louis Wilson is the best fancy, but Heather Graham did an exceptional job of my opinion. Try it out - despite trite looking DVD cover. Jolain character self-service brings many problems in our culture. The promise is really another person or for us if he asks us. Really, it's our own Through promises (to get married from a friend anywhere in the marriage) is a great feeling. For example, our sound smoke is nothing but a shapeshifting puff. Joline is like a wake-up call. We must be aware of our words and promises, which means more than us. At the same time, we will not be committed to anyone who is unable to do the same.
