As an Anglo-Irish, I assure you that there is nothing other than exercises. But I assure you that this is an Irish movie - and the last comment does not seem like an English. This image was written by Neil Jordan and Connor McPherson and Corner McPherson of Irish was also directed. Cast almost completely Irish - it was shot in Ireland with an Irish crew. Even Michael Gammon was born in Ireland - I think he is having fun in his interview about this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Now I like Dylan Maran - I have always been a fan of it, and Michael cans is a surprisingly good double law. He was great to see the Maran Range as an actor to produce several different characters during the film. I would suggest this movie with interest in the comedy - it features a fresh, playful and innovative turn on Irish feature length chocolate films. I smiled a lot. What else can you ask?
