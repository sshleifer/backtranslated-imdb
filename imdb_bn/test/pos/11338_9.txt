Like many of Wong's movies, many people find their annoying and confusing. Well I like them and I also like this picture. I went out and rented the DVD and I saw it 3 times. This is a very delicate movie which provides a drunken experience. For those who did not enjoy it ... you just lost 2 hours of life ... very bad ... muhahahahah
