Still, Dan Brown did not read the book, but I saw the adaptation of all his films. I will not read the game in order to rate it because the opportunity is not the same: In fact, it is a thriller, a race against the time filled with puzzles. <br /> <br /> Plots are very lizard, fantastic and cast nice: I was not a great fan of Hendes but he did well. I saw his jeans shirt (sprinkled with blood) because I did such a vicious search! The Italian explorer is a bright new arrival for me but I really congratulated Ivan McGregor's screenplay: his inner faith and calm are really impressive. <br /> <br /> I really like debate between science and religion. Performing tasks in the Vatican, it felt like a vacation. Finally, I'm not sure that it helps to add new conversions to Christianity. When all the gold and human appearances appear, one wants charity money and why the life of the church is dismissed for women, whereas they stand on behalf of more than half of the believers.
