What a great movie !!!!!!!! I came out of the theater feeling. The picture I saw was one of the best movies in my life. I was glued to the screen of my eyes. It is very symbolic, visually lovely, beautifully shot, and nicely told. It is basically about two people who move to the flat and live with partners living near each other, who are considered to be related to each other's partners. To estimate this, our two heroes work what they think their partners get up to. Posture cameras work, body language, and symbolic stairs are used to suppress feelings of each other. It is not a visual feast, and hard choice. Some of the stories gets a little confusing but that does not do anything. The last one is one of the most beautiful (and anti-Hollywood) finishes in my life, and apparently amazing. Movie hunting score is added to the mood. I highly recommend this film with open mind, and respect. What a fantastic film
