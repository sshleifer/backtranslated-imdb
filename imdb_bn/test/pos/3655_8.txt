At one stage, Hari Om is a familiar genre - a movie using road movies - telling a familiar story: The strange western mysterious prequel searches. But in his heart, the film almost two lives, with a young French beauty (Isa) fully and with the desire of Bollywood's rickshaw driver (Hari Om), from different cultures, they gradually lead their lives with growing attraction. Others, and today's beautiful crazy chaos in India. The difference between them can never be fulfilled, but the director succeeds in bringing the matter closer to the skeleton as much as possible without harming the feasibility of the story. The descriptions of India and its people are essential elements and in addition to the main character, the role played by the locals employed during the production of film alongside the road between Indian cities and villages, while filming, is played neatly and firmly. A big negative for this viewer: A keystone cops move closer to the conclusion of the movie, because Hari threw a bombshell to collect a gambling loan. But Jesus and Harry farewell scenes are cruel and unforgettable.
