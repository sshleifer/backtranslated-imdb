Like the previous commenter, I saw it in the 1980s and sometimes will not be able to pull the memory of graffing stories, superb acting and dramatic score scores. It certainly has some of Sam Waterstein's best work. She and writer Oppenheimer have been portrayed as just an injustice hunter - which she was - but homemade, alcohol-friendly, and snobbish, rounded instead of a stereotype.
