I was lucky enough to record this wonderful wonderful drama, when it was originally broadcasted at the Masterpiece Theater. I liked it but lost it. Then one day, it is found again when going through the old tape. I record the DVD and --- WOW! I still love it! Leeds is wonderful and my only complaint is we wish to see more Kester! What a man! And pru He is so strong and wonderful ... where he is living in a time and age, and how he deals with it seems unfortunate and bad. Even his own brother is prone to his face that he would ever suspect that a man is with him. * Nightmare * Unfortunately, my copy is not the greatest, wear and wear it over the years, and if it ever happens, I'd also like to own it on the professional DVD.
