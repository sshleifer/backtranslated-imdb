I just want to say that the role of Chris Diyantopoulos as Williams for that whole show, he was worthy. It was weird how he was good. And Robin Williams is really as fast-fire and random and creative as .... WOW. There was a scene where Dynatopoulos probably said 20 fast lines of fire and used 15 different letters while supplying those lines, all the same as the characters that Robin Williams did ..... ..... Well, my friends are acting impressively . This is one thing for Robin Williams in a disguise for a minute. Do it for the whole TV. <br /> <br /> I do not know how I felt about the whole ceremony, and I do not know how much they are playing with, but I know that Chris Diamantopoulos was keeping me watching. So for that, I give him a 10.
