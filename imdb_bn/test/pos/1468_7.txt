This British documentary recently comedy Central is their "Best of?" The time is shown in the Week and South Park's second season DVD. I think the DVD of this documentary appears to be seen in many commercial advertisements for DVDs shown, which is most likely to happen with other people in Math Stone, Tray Parker and a hot tub. It was fun when I saw it commercially, but I was used to watch it while showing the actual documentary. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Goen Down South Park" is a fairly funny and South Park episodes are made, and after the introduction of Matt and Trey College, the series focuses on the history of history. However, there was something about the sound of this documentary which was really frustrating. It's fast, fast and not as fast as the South Park episode. Instead, it has a slow, dry-looking style, which can be fun sometimes, but most of the time you are waiting to do something. If you get the chance to see it, go all the way, but if you do not see it then you really are missing too much. <br /> <br /> My IMDb rating: 7/10
