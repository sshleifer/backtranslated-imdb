The big name of the film tried to do their part in the war effort, and there was no exception to Charlie Chaplin. This was part of his contribution to patriotic and promotional pictures, though the release was almost during his release. Tram goes to the war, performs valiantly heroism and kicks Kaiser on the left. It's a very funny picture, though I do not think it's about its best one. Before making his debut best film 'The Kid' for the first national, it has its best output with 'A Dog Life'. They are their first three relayers, of which there are more durable, more broad gags, usually more than Tarek in the mutual two-reel shorts. <br /> <br /> It may be difficult to adjust the message of a war of war with slopstick. Antics and front burlesque scenes, but one does not think 'shoulder arms' observers. It's much better in favor of "more serious," dramatic work with the same message as Griffith's 'World of Hearts'. This time Chaplin became a true virtuoso in screen comedy; She makes it look straightforward. He now knows very well that a movie with Low Gogh - with more expansion, refinement and cautiously - a fake outlook, Kiston-type Fars can be better than one minute with one minute reflection. Incredible as Chaplin tree is a relevant example of the order. Even with the war criminals, even Chaplin can raise millions of spirits.
