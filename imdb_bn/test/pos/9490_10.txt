Just showcasing them to the best of them and zeppelin one of the best lead of rocking them. Each band member is singing like their tomorrow with their best hostage page and his bow and guitar JPJ pounding his thunderous lightning Bozo away and sung by Robert. I want to say when we're going to enter the first song where it starts something very special. These DVDs begin with their 11-year career at the 69th year in the royal Albert Hall, followed by the Madison Square Garden 73, at the Irrals Court, following the old and mature bands at the age of 75, and finally a different looking band at their last English show in Kevborth. This DVD is a fantastic exhibition of Zeppelin and if you do not have a fan, then you'll be after it. N
