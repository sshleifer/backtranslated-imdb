Charlotte owns a beauty clinic, she has broken up with her aggressive pre-husband, moved to an apartment alone with all the furniture packed without her big bed. Veronica is sitting beside her poor dog, she is sensitive and desperate to bother her mother's visitor and her relationship with her father. His only hope is that the upcoming transsexual operation will turn him into a real woman and everything will be okay. What he can do now is waiting for the approval certificate. <br /> <br /> Then these two people meet with opportunity and gradually they are related to the lives of others, some have a glimpse of them, but nobody is brave because they are not convinced of accepting change like most people. . Finally the finishing is quite rewarding and we leave some imagination to think about it. <br /> <br /> The director's wonderful work gives me a great impression, they handle characters development very well, the mental atmosphere is completely full and intense. I am also covered with great lights in the whole apartment, Dellfik is full of desire. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ p> <br /> <br /> In this Swedish indie film you can see and change, you are gay or discriminatory male, male or female, curiosity of life everywhere, whenever you come across it, you will feel hesitant and embarrassed, but at least fear No, follow your heart and choose the right way.
