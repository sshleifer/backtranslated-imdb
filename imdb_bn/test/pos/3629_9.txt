It's a great movie for the whole family. I do not think many people have seen it because I ask people and they say they have never heard of it before. Sophie Hyman is my aunt's sister. My favorite scene is that the whole movie I can not even pick a favorite scene. My favorite character is Halbert because he's a funny but smart dog. If someone does not see it, they are missing a great adventure. I only saw this because my aunt was related to Sophie and she received a copy from her. If someone is reading this then I would recommend buying the film and I am sure it will not be a bad decision. I have seen this movie almost five times and every time I give me the same message, dogs are smart as they give people the opportunity.
