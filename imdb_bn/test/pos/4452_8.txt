I was pleasantly pleasantly surprised by the depth of the story and character development. Flu Discoctor was a master in creating a horrifying atmosphere with cameras, lively painting, and yes - surprisingly clear gore. This picture is not exemplary, but compared to its subsequent films (Beyond, Junk 2, Living Dead, House of the Cometry etc.) Here the characters are very well developed and strongly away from the miraculous and it is in the high mountains of Italy. Dunat is more on the mysteries created by the classic. The scenery is a memorable moment of the fairytale folklore and then immediately receded by the mud and blood-filled terror covered by debris. The film's gore is not quite prevalent in the later films of flowering and it seems to be better than Phulcis's next films, but Splatter and GeoLoos fans will probably be wounded and will be satisfied by the last 5 minutes of the film within minutes. <Br /> <br /> Overall, a fantastic and mature movie from our great Italian horror directors.
