I am a fan of independent film Dialog powered, the letter study piece is where it is for me. Some other posts are correct: "Vanbabs" is sometimes not going to be the "The Godfather" rival for the best view film. On the other hand, "Wannabes" is a well-written and well-known picture that has wonderful performances from every actor / actress. My problem with other reviews: <br /> <br /> - Connor Dabin is standing as the sole Irishman in the Caste of Italian <br /> - Dobbin is a Jewish last name and has such a dark color, an Irishman is a traditional curc No <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I found it for 7 bucks in Blockbuster and was surprised to say it at least! Highly recommended.
