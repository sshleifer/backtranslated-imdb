I saw this in a VHS tape in 1993, but since it is unable to find it from a source. In the last days of the Japanese army of the Philippines, it is a very shameless and incomprehensible appearance. Anyone interested in the Pacific War will be good to see this film and see what is happening under any other party. From what I can say, it is historically correct, and illustrates how humans can easily be transmitted to full barbarity. I understand that in the Philippines by 1945, the Japanese army has completely stopped from a re-supply, so there is no doubt that the most horrific events mentioned here have happened. I could not identify the characters in the picture, but I realized their humanity and the survival struggle. If you have to compile the list of the ten greatest war movies, then the film will be on it. See if you can get it.
