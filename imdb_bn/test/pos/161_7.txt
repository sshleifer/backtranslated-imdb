I do not know little or nothing about astronomy, but still; I was initially a little skeptical about the plot of this film. It follows three children born at the time of the solar eclipse and thus there is no emotions and thus (naturally) ruthless serial killers. The plot seems to be ridiculous at first, but once you realize that the solar eclipse blocks the sun and as you know, the planet Saturn, it falls everywhere; It makes a complete sense and then you know that you are not just seeing another evil 80s slash with a motor brain plot. Thank you Lord! Seriously, bloody birthdays are based on a ridiculous proposition, but it is more than just for it with its originality. Children sometimes seen in movies can not have some great masterstrokes, but when this option is offered on a dry Friday and another 13th clone - I know what I like. <br /> <br /> Also helping the movie from disguise Some people think that it is a delirious plot, it is very fascinating to dig it out. Many slashers became formulas very quickly and the viewers end up watching simply to see some gore. However, this film is running with some extraordinary performance from the kids (which comes back to the scary children's class like Dammed's Village), a constant trend of ill humor and a small, but impressive, suspicious and tense dosage for the kind of film. I love a lot of things about this movie. There is nothing worse than a slash, where the killer repeatedly uses the same weapon (cough Halloween cough), but bloody birthday does not find everything to avoid bow and arrows from planting. There was no room for Chainshow, which was a lot of shame, but I do not think there might be a chain on every movie.
