This show is actually quite good. Like all the events on TV, its good episode and its bad stuff. <br /> <br /> I compare this show where people compare married to these children, and I think this is the same show for a new generation. However, due to the expectation and conjecture on TV while they were married to children, this show was actually a television show, and it was extremely taken to show that it was not to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> The war at home has the luxury of being a bit more realistic. Parents talk to each other like the real life style, often telling their children one thing, when they revolve and vice versa. <br /> <br /> Certainly, some of the content may be considered controversial. But I see this show really tries to maintain a sense of honesty. Like it or not, there are just a lot of families like this. <br /> <br /> Each episode will teach a 'valuable lesson'. It is sometimes only text that you will not find the perfect solution for every problem faced by a family, and sometimes the least of the solutions is to choose less wickedness. We all know that in some cases the only aim of your parents is to keep your kids away from the big trouble and hopefully they learn the right things wrong. <br /> <br /> I respect the authors to try to keep the truth in life true, instead of ending some magicians like Clive's family, always.
