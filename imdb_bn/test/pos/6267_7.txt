A young Chinese envoy to Western technology is trying to make a fancy of a very sweet film about Chinese people and an English movie in China. This is a very interesting story that is probably based on true facts, although I feel it is more imaginative than reality. This has got the value of a fairy tale that you can rarely get in real life and 8 people have been submitted for the script so they must upload the stuff and go to the left. <br /> <br /> This is a very favorite movie that conveys how the witch film before it was never before. It is not particularly a deep film, but a brief short film on heritage reduction and the exploitation of Western culture, but it is mainly a lovely small movie. This is actually a movie that I've enjoyed so much that has already started in my mind 15 minutes after my disappearance. Light as a souffl√©, but I enjoyed every minute.
