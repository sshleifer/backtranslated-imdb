This program was quite interesting. The way the program is displayed it is all the more interesting. String theory is very interesting to hear very much. My opinion was good value for the whole three hours. I enjoyed listening to ideas given by the physicist. The excess levels are really mind-boggling. If you have the opportunity, see this amazing documentary.
