This is a wonderful story that I have never heard before. First Sol, 1968-69, the non-stop maritime nation was formed around the world and several rackets were involved. It's a really interesting story about yourself versus nature and people versus people. The story focuses on the tragic figure of this story Donald Crowhart. The film beautifully coordinates with footage, which shoots itself in boats. After the details of Donald Crowhur's history details, the story is very suspicious and tragic. This is one of the best documentaries of the past few years. It has a real passion among humans, because men do their job almost impossible to navigate the world without their own existence.
