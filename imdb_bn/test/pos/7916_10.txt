Alexander Nevsky is correctly held as a cinematic masterpiece. It has been very old. People do not mention this and do not talk about great battles and great music. Sound effects may be good but without all the foreboding organ all the words are invisible. I could be shot by film buffs for this but I am sure the modern viewer of Alexander Nevsky would agree that blatant promotions and isolated music film isolate from. I gave this image 10/10 because it is a master piece unknown. It has its great bit though. Tutonic knit dresses are fantastic and war scenes are fairly good for the time being. This is a master piece that shows its age.
