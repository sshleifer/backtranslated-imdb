With WWII, movie studios quickly reach focus on homecoming focus. "Best Years of a Live" was probably the best example. It is coming home from different countries and will not have to re-select the overall variable world instead of their pre-war. Perhaps the most interesting Cast member non-actor Harold Russell. While losing his hand in the war, he played a man with a hook where he had his hands, and reminded the man that he wanted to be treated like another; He won the Best Supporting Actor and Special Oscar for the role and made him the only person to win two Oscars for the same role. Perhaps it will always debate whether it is worthy of a better life than "a wonderful life", but I must think that they did a good job with it. Have done very well.
