I'm sorry that the Surfers NBC has not been selected for the 2006-2007 season. I won a good story on the broadcast television game and the demand for reality shows, reflection of our feeling of culture, a good story. I hope and some networks will like it to pray so that it will continue as Stargate and its spin off. <br /> <br /> I hope the producers find a place where they can create post production levels. Wish for a TV Guide Interview. At this moment, sci-fi, marathons must be re-evaluated. I love to see where I want to see the story after the last tsunami of 15 episodes. I want to find the mastermind of an effort to frustrate the true identity of animals. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
