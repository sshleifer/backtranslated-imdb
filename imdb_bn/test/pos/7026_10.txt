I thought I saw this movie as I have seen before, it is one of the Sopi love stories where everything works well and lives. But I was really wrong to sit down to see it. I have found that this is actually a true story about a family that goes to a dance park for a 3 week holiday and a little girl loves the child, but there is a problem with her newly found love because of her disagreement with her. Father. But on the other hand, helps another dancer coach and puts the whole relationship in jeopardy ... true heartfelt film, not like anyone else. <br /> <br /> 10/10
