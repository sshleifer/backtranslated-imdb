Some things in Haggard are stupid and unnecessary, overall packages are good. <br /> <br /> Haggard Ryan follows Dunn and his friend Valo (left margarine) and Falcon (Brandon Decimillo), who tried to win Gullierren (Jenny Revel), Ryan's former winner. <br /> <br /> The story has been followed and surprisingly improved, it does not surprise and Jacks or Viva La Beam is an episode, although it has a story that does not hit the original story. <br /> <br /> And, all the left fan boys (and girls) have several sequences of left skateboarding, probably the weakest aspect of the film. Phil 2 creates a surprisingly small scene, even Don Vito has received a big (but unmatched) roll. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a comedy and run away from the madness of the left, stay away from this movie, otherwise, if you can find it, spend it on time. There are some really funny scenes in this movie.
