After the wind ceased for a while, Colombo came back with the secret of the TV to create something new that is not as good as the original series, but it is better than the next 90s. <br /> <br /> Actual crime shows as a murder situation when "killing can be dangerous for your health" (and I think now, if you think about it). The assassination is made by a very successful, committed crime host of truth, George Hamilton (great bit of casting). Her discipline-smoking, lost her job to Nemesis, who played by Peter Hassel, trying to blackmail Hamilton, when he made a favorite video Hamilton with the actor on his salad day. Hamilton contributed to the use of Hessel's cigarette to protect him from toxic toxic death, as himself gave aliabi. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You know the rest. Very entertaining.
