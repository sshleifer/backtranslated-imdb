Director: T Garnett, Ford Conscience, Cast: Mike Majuzi, Vic Christie, Fretz Ford, Ta Gernet. <br /> <br /> I think it's a forgotten movie, based on the number of comments on IMDB. It seems rather horrible to me because it is one of the first movies to remember. My mother took me and my younger brother to visit this film at The Gerland Theater in Spokane when it first came in the mid-1970s and I still remember it. <br /> <br /> I'm going through memory here but I believe this step is about a trapper, whom he did not commit, and the law went after him. I believe it's set to 1800's in Alaska. A narrator tells the story of trap trapped by Mike Mazurki. Really, it's a very good film with a great setting. It can be compared with Charles Branson's 1981 film Death Hunt. Two pictures have a very similar story line. The main difference between the two is Death Hunt, an adult-based film and challenge is a family-friendly movie. <br /> <br /> While making this film both Mike Majuki and Taey Garnette were old, when I think that this film seems to have been located in the wild areas of Alaskan, but I'm even more impressive. The last film of Ta Geraneet died a few years after he died. They were around from both silent era.
