SPOILERS <br /> <br /> You know I have commented on many silent movies in the last few months. Now, I have no idea why I comment on Steamboat Willi, I guess I was frustrated to comment, so I saw it, and now I am commenting on it. This is, of course, one of the first cartoons and I believe it is not the first cartoon with the word. <br /> <br /> Plot here PT threw him down when he was driving a steamboat in Mickey Mouse and he ran it. When they tried to try on Minnie Mouse to stop for the cargo but unfortunately failed. Mickey gets her by a crane. Then a goat eats his sheet of paper with turkey on it in the straw. They used goats to make songs. When I say that I mean that they used the goat as a Victor. In the steamboat for Mike's instrument, the animal plays Mickey. Then an angry pitt threw Mickey into a potato room and was forced to trim Mickey Potatoes for the rest of the day. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is one of the silent short films. I mean, this is the third Mickey Mouse cartoon. Yes, third. Also, this is not the first cartoon with the word. I believe there were two more earlier this one. In both ways, this film is really groundbreaking, really. Mikece was more violent than he Mow. I mean, he threw a pot of a bird and could cruelly kill it. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> Recommended movie: Plane Crazy.
