Spinners <br /> <br /> I love Simpsons, and I have seen any single episode that never came out. I must admit, one of the most partial seasons of the season, and it is one of the most intrinsic seasons of the season. Start with the family playing a game of Scrabble to get bart ready for an intelligence test to take to school with the family. . He said the game is stupid and he does not want to play it, but he needs it. He spells out a word that homer homers and he picks up burt around the house. The next day Mrs. Crabbell assured the class that the test was not part of their grade, but just test them as they would be in the future. Burt can not answer one question. She thinks faster. He quickly tested the Martin Prince, with the most smart test in class. Later that day, Merge and Homer were asked to go to the Principal's office to discuss the behavior of Bart. Suddenly, from somewhere, the school comes to the psychologist and tells Skinner and Homer and Mart that Bart will go to a special school for a gifted and gifted. Burt will not have to do any homework. The next day Homer took Barta to a new school. He is launching everything and everything. Unintentionally, his days are not very good. Smart students take lunch at his lunch, he can not read any comic books, but he criticizes his colleague, however. Thankfully for Bertt, he and Homer started to start a great time together, but Merge bought tickets for an opera. They go to opera, and make fun of it. The next day he went to his old school but was fun by his friends. They call him a point dexter. Bert was asked to test his chemistry at his new school. She made it wrong and left herself green, pushed up the school. Bart psychologist told him why he did it. Instead, Bart tells him that he wants to go secretly and go back to his old school to keep the other kids. Psychological stimuli and he told Bart to explain in a piece of paper. He wrote it a very difficult and rather a confession that he really is not a genius. He gives it to the psychologist. He is careful about that he spelled the word confession. That night Homer bathes bat and Burt tells him that he really is not a genius and he cheated the exam. Hurt Barta around the house and throw bars around the house. Lisa and Merge looked at them. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is a episode of the very underrated season. <br /> <br /> 8/10
