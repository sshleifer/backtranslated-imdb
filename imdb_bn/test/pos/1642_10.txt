Ice Limerick: <br /> <br /> A virus has dragged from the ice <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If one of the cities in the city started to start and if you ask me, you can not ask for a much better question throughout the series. It's one of the best teasers in my opinion which really started with a awesome teaser. Scientists in Alaska have drill a few drops of ice cream that they killed each other for some reason. Three other scientists have been sent to Mulder and the school to investigate what has happened. Mulder is as they are because they are bright or expensive. I mean that they can be brighter or not ... The team will soon know that the reason for Mymensingh is to draw a small parasite of ice. The blood stream gets in and causes a violent behavior because of a small insect. Since the pilot is infected, the rest of the show becomes suspicious that it is suspected of being infected by others as a K-pannuous thriller. This can not be helped by a highly paranoid doctor Hajj, which is incredible on the first person, which we can know for the first time: "We are sure that we say we are all" to see everybody's credentials. Comes out to learn how to get infected and how to cure them. <br /> <br /> I like a lot about this episode and certainly certain characters which I want to face in this episode as well as a couple of loopholes but most carefully take precautions and can not be thought clearly. I like the beer from the moment and meet him. Her shame she has to die. I also like the scenes from other scientists' points of view, such as Mulldard and schoolie argue in another room. It gives an interesting insight into our general view of the audience and I think we should not suppose that anyone of them knows the secret mysteries of conspiracy to the government. As much as Haggens disappointed me of this episode, Muller was blamed for a slight accusation of Melder's accusation. I really liked Scully in this episode. Firstly he can work like a freakin linebacker! Secondly, I like the focus on his terrorism that what can happen there and how he tries to maintain his reputation for Müller's faith and friendship. When I go to a sleeping house, I love the scene and first shows the image of the previous group and all of them go from bedtime to sleeping in the house and then how suddenly he is sleeping and how the dress in the front pulls the chest in front of the door and the final touch of the bullet. Sitting on the floor, we see the bottom part of a poster in the wall, which says "Bombs sister". This is such a great writing. Unfortunately, due to this old suspicion, this group may have been infected with mood since the muder believes that without worrying words he is worried at school. Although they did not visit the corpse to find out. My main problem with character behavior is that they can easily solve all doubts by donating blood. But I guess I probably would have worked very badly in that situation. But then the stupid Hoodes decided that Mullalar should willingly surrender but Mulla should be infected and then intentionally inspected and the process almost infected Modarara. Fortunately, he found that it was really contaminated and that we finally reached a resolution. At least as much as you can expect from an x ​​file. The "government" does not waste any time in spreading "deadly" evidence in this case and Mulder is left in another frustrating "unorganized" case. While closing I give "ice" and easy 10/10 and I leave you with a haiku. <br /> <br /> "We are not the ones we do."
