I had to call my mother (WSPSP) to ask about this. What was really bad in New York 40? Surprised, he could not remember. So I asked him to watch the movie. Arthur Miller, Novel for the change, instead of playing the screen, was 30 years old when writing it in 1945. This is a painful illustration of anti-Semitism. Yet surprisingly enough, a flexible story of human relationships (Finkelstein, Jewish, Newman, non-Jewish, primarily) involved in cruel stories. Able to act and cinematography is very good. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can not make it big for the theater is to think that it is >> aaagh << controversial <Br <<I can actually give ten ten. Maybe a little more, but it is so valuable to see.
