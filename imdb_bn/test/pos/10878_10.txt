Two years after the initial release, Golden was sitting in the field of the first person missing for Nintendo 64. Even the graphic details of the Quebec and Torque series, sound quality, enemy intelligence, challenges and overall fun combinations were not over me again in this game again. Mission has every specific goal that forces you to think as a bond, not only to shoot every body to pop up on your screen, to avoid cameras, to disable protection systems, rescue hostages, protect bondgirls, etc. The questions include these games, including the famous clock gadgets. The game is based on the story of the film, with the lead characters and the best scenes in the movie, jumped from the dam and jumped into St. Petersburg's retreat in the prop-plane of the tank. Even the layout is preserved wherever possible, so if you have seen the movie, you can recognize it in different situations. Other level players are added to the challenge and the little scene is string together. The mission objective with each difficulty level is more difficult, the enemies are smarter and bullets are more lethal. I still have not gotten through the 00-agent level. Codes or pushing buttons do not enter, but certain ranges can be filled within the specified time frame and additional characters may be opened for multiplayer. Multiplayer is still the best in first-person shooters. It's not as crisp as the Turk, but it does not diminish almost ... many options give your buddies the opportunity to travel around each other and only once for kick. Gilda and all things have more good games for N64 like Star Wars, but Rare continues its continuation of the shooter's fantastic games for the first time, which will not be surpassed with the Perfect Dark in 2000 itself.
