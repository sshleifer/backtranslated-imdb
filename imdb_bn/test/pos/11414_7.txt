I do not see many 'horror' movies, but one night I sat and watched it with my cousins. Now, we are teenagers, so we tend to enjoy a lot of things, but honestly, acting here was not really very good, especially at the beginning. Scarlett told Jill and Tyfani that one line was standing, "It's so ... high school!" The next scene shows Jill walking before a sign by the high school name ... In the beginning many parts remind me of a freaky, badly written, poorly played Lizzie McGuire episode. However, as the story progressed, and Caste only moved to Jill, I was able to appreciate the film. Camila Bell was really good at this film and I think other actors and actresses have spoiled the movie for her. And I must admit, I've never seen one of these awesome movies. Well, no, big monsters and white faces were not like the dark corners and the appearance of dolls, but the thing that made this movie more scary than those things can actually happen. And this movie has really reminded me of scary ... we all know that we can not have any problem with the living dead in our lives, but the idea of ​​being a murderer in the house will really happen. The only error in this movie is that it is one of the most movies I have ever seen. There is any horror film in it - what and about someone turning around, shadow in the corner, rotating corners of stairs, rotating, and seeing dead bodies, waking up quickly with a deadly scene. From a dream, etc. At the suspenseful scene, it was very predictable, but overall, I would give it a 7/10. It is certainly worth watching. Anyway, this is the reason for my first review, so I do not know if any of those things were distorted ... but to be safe ...
