It started a little slow but it gives an opportunity. This soul of "Wakest Ship in the Arm" and "Pink Sub" is not so much a group that is not involved in miraculous ways to disturb everyone. Rob Schneider is as invaluable as the LT, which takes its own course very seriously, resulting in a failed rebel attempt and the "pirate" crew pans him. On the contrary, Kelsi grammar (like the Kary Grant) does not accept anything serious than the job. More about the line than this movie plot. In the "whistle" jail of Charleston Herb, "Whales" from Duke, their antics surprised me and I laughed loudly.
