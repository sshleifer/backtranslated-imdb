This photo was held quite a few times in my interest to see it. There is a hole in the plot, but the main actor does it. <br /> <br /> Catherine Marie Stewart (Julia Carebridge) worked as a woman at the age of 37 who dedicated everything else to the doctor. He worked for years to earn money to go to medical school. He is acting brilliantly at his residence and only he can take his board exam and understand his dream. Meanwhile, Julia's sister and father-in-law is murdered, and as the closest resident, she forced her servant Amanda (Arlene Aguayo-Stewart) to avoid becoming a state ward. Amanda is about 7 years old with her appearance. Amanda is so frustrating that she is silent from her parents' murder. Not saying, Julia's 16 hours a day is taking more care of Amanda. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> Amanda always takes a joke or comedy to help her deal with her pain. Amanda really begins to warm up Kevin as the film progresses, probably more than her aunt. Julia began to take care of Amader for taking some time to rely on Kevin, because she is preparing for her case load management and her board exams. Kevin erupts some crisis for always when Julia <br /> <br /> Chemistry between Rob and Catherine Mary was great. Keep watching to watch them together before the end of the movie. Chemistry was good between Rob and Arlene. Arlen managed to express a lot without the convenience of words. The plot Julia and Amanda gradually warmed each other As a movie progress you can work with their relationship. <br /> <br /> We've discovered that Julien's sister and father-in-law (daughter) was involved in industrial espionage. They steal a highly valuable prototype microchip from their employer. They had three associates who would share the revenues. Julia discovers that the Meyers are planning to leave the country under supposedly identification. It is not clear whether the mother wanted to double their partner or crossed the double. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Before killing, she did not try to find out the position of Microchip from the girl. The killers find the house and fail to find their reward. They have been alive for their crimes, Amanda. Then the killers spent unexpected attempts to make films for extracting microchips from Julia and Amanda, who have no idea where their prizes are located. Finally, the killers kidnapped Amanda, hoping she knew something about the status of microchip. Finally, discover the truth about Julia Kevin. He is an investigator appointed to hire the rest of the stolen microchip. After some rough moments of the relationship, they managed to rescue Amanda and send bad guys. The expected completion is to form a family of three and have been moving happily together in the future. <br /> <br /> This plot was the main hole that hit me. Kevin went to the same apartment building named Julia and Amanda after the girl's assassination. How did he know that Microchip is already in the hands of the killers? There is no concern in the murder of the murderers, leaving their fingerprints on the murder scene. Maya, who pretends to be a psychotheracerist, reveals the red color residue Amanda from the scene of her shoe-sliping scene. At the beginning of the film, the murder scene was not shown. There are a number of significant weaknesses mentioned in these lines. <br /> <br /> The film could have been great if the script was more refined before filming. A little expense has been added to fill the plot hole and the efforts are greatly improved.
