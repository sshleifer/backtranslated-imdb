Jamie Fox Ray Ray was a symbol of Charles. After a few moments, you stopped watching a movie and played yourself by a great man. Ray Charles really had a talent in music and the movie illustrated that exquisitely. No one will ever write music, play, or record music like this or ever musical monster. When he passed the meat, the world lost one of his greatest American heroes. As far as the film was concerned, Jamie Foxx was a classical music scholarship at the college and truly the real director of the film, she was the director. What could have been better than that? You do not have to have a "double" piano and then try to split the face of James from the other hand. It's a nice job. I really liked how hard the verdict was. She was not always an excellent man. You did not have the route for him. He was a drug addict, a man and a woman, and sometimes only on the straight head. But I guess that made him jeans so I can not blame him. I love jammy for the best actor!
