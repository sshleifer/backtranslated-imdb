This movie has no evidence of great art, which is good. But it's a well-written scripts with well-developed characters and strong acting. I think if I had written it, I could work without the play around the wife, but did not pay enough attention to refrain from the story of Minnie driver. I think that Hollywood often tries to write real-quality and tries to inject more visual dramas, when it's really necessary to play an adult-themed film with adult-themed movies - and perhaps more believable. Overall, it's a very well done and well-priced price.
