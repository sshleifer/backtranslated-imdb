If you do not have anything good then go ahead and hire this movie, it's cute, funny, it definitely will be busy for a while. <br /> <br /> I discovered it by surfing the channels, annoying Sunday, it was on the cable, and I saw that to face, I thought it was worth the effort, it made me laugh and read a movie other than the TV For that it was not right. <br /> <br /> Lively looks amazing in Tyler's movie, though her performance is not what she hopes for, for her poor performance and for other crew, I also like Rebecca. I saw the guy from sitcom walking around a gay lawyer about "what I like about you". <br /> <br /> J. For Goodman I've always seen it as a very good performance, Michael Douglas's small role, but his characterization was tough for me. <br /> <br /> It is a good movie to meet with the company.
