Although the book is not dark in the movie but in my opinion it's a great movie. It's great camp fun with beautiful Stuart Townsend as Lestat. He may not have hair and blue eyes that are described so clearly in the book, but to be justified, he does not look good with blonde hair, and Lestat is very good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! It does not interview with the vampire, so do not try to compare the two. Interview Louis' story. It's the cut and paste version of Lestat. In any case, I highly recommend it.
