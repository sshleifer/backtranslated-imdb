As a great fan of Hammer studio and their enthusiastic audience of Gothic Horror movies, I took so long to start watching their TV series "Hummer House of Horror", which ran for the only part of the 1980s. Now I have seen the first four episodes of the show, I can say that it easily satisfies my expectations. This is the first episode "Witching Time", which is probably the most spectacular story that is never called and it does not provide the Gothic atmosphere suddenly, which I love in Hammer Cinema from the 50's to the 70s, it's a surprisingly wonderful story to say and fifty minutes Make some genuine laziness. 17th Century Lichinda (Patricia Quinn) music composer David Winter (John Finch) is subjected to torture ... Although the story may be simple, it is effective and a lot of annoying moments during less than one hour Northern Irish actress Patricia Quinn, who is perhaps famous for her role in "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" (1975) and Monty Python comedy "Monty Python's Mining of Life" (1983), is uniquely polluted in her role. Which fits her like a glove. John Finch is also as good as David, and Prenny Gee, who is acting in the act of his adulterous actress, may not be the best actress, she must be pretty looking. This episode is a beautiful score that comes alongside the atmosphere as well. Overall, "Witching Time" is a truly entertaining moment and a very entertaining episode with great opening batsman in the series.
