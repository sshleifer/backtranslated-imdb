This movie is ridiculous, bright and intuitive. Perhaps the story may well employ almost any ethnic group, but the underlying Jews give extra money to the loyalty of wonderful conversations. There were so many social issues in the plot that it was only worth seeing; But the real braces were in the warm smiles that spread among the complimentary spectators. Actors play complex roles in their strengths and weaknesses with all pathos and humor which seem to be parody of their life from Shakespeare's plays. This is a movie about the family; - Often fragile, sometimes unseen personality and lifestyle together, binding between the first and the parents, and inevitably the big family of friends and even strangers. The technical aspects of the film have given the film a speed and development that intrigues the viewers' ultimate view. Peter Foke is pretty, always as, his role as family father Maurice Applebum. Fine performances by a fine cast include an astounding guest. Do not miss this movie!
