When you are watching this series, you will probably feel like how our parents felt during seeing the Star Trek for the first time. <br /> <br /> This series is all there. Forget about how stories can forget you, letters that you want to join on TV and join the action and your atmosphere that breaks your hair with wonderful and endless praise. <br /> In short, we start with an astronomer John Crichton, who shot dead in an insect and escaped from a black fighter, ending with a gang of detainees, who are known as piscicards. <br /> <br> Other colorful characters are d'argo, small tactics and associated with a sword / laser-rifle. Airoon Sun, former peacekeeper and PhD in Bootking Jotahan Jhan, who is a plant. Not really, he He is a priest, but with an average streak. Dominic Ragella XVI, a greasy lazy sack which removes heavy helium and usually causes more damage than good. <br /> <br /> Later on in the series we met most sexy alike who came to TV, such as in Chiayana. A young and seemingly chronically horny Nebari. He played by Gigi Adley, which you should remember. <br /> <br /> I like much about this series, since John Chrichton wrongly end up in this part of the galaxy, he keeps reference to "real life". That is, when John has some difficulty, he will be frozen as an idol for 80 years, one of his many accusations is that when he returns, Boffy's Vampire Slayer will die. <br /> <br /> So fry all other serials, combine your drain and spend an ego in one of these episodes. I can assure you, science / fame will change forever, as you know it. <br /> <br /> There is everything in this series. It's sexy. It is actionpacked. It's mountainous. This is Persian
