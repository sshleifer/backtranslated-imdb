Both the critics and the audience have portrayed most of the movie, but I do not really think it was too bad! Even critics generally think that it was frustrating, and I usually miss PG-13 "horror movies." So one of these two things means: (1) I'm very happy, and movies have reduced my taste over the years, or (2) 'when a stranger call' is almost as awesome as not to be. Now, to be justified, there are some critics of film criticism - there are not many characters in development, and many things do not happen in the story. But surviving people, what are you expecting from a movie about a childish race? Cut some of them slack! By late night, I can safely say that Stella Dude is a vague mufo by late night, as this former babysitter! Who knows? I think these things just give me a will. <br /> <br /> Yes, I acknowledge that I have fun seeing it, and no minority of mine does not consider me as big .;)
