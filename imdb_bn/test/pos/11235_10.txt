Do not think what this socialist disabled person said above, this show is ridiculous. It shows how the single male is once in the atmosphere and also shows that men think that men do not think they are. <br /> <br /> How really cool and original competition aspect This is not a human show that we're all using a day now. <br /> <br /> Give it a chance to all, we are only in one episode, finally our Canadian programming is something that is not complete chatter. Generally what we get as Canadians, forest cop, bad copper, or corners gas. Show people that we are not all weird as the previous critics. <br /> <br /> A new event opportunity to go to the comedy network. Panels are funny and the competitors are so far better.
