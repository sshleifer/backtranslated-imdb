Jack Jack and Kodi's Suit Life are very happy because this is my favorite show and he is my favorite actor. This is really a fun episode and a fun show !! I love everything about shows and characters. Actors are all great Jack continued acting, and I'm very happy that most of my favorite actors (including High School Musical Characters) are on this show. Jack Afron is so 'hot' and I have a signed picture of him! This is not a photo copy and it came from America to Australia and it has not come about for Christmas. Also, my high school musical mugs have been found with my name. (Scarlett 8)
