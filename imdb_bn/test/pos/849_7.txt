The world's ultimate conflict began like a new world, something full of new vision, fresh and unique elements from the Creator of the Star Trek. Very well-behaved with Kevin Kilner like William Bonan, a former police officer began to act as ambassador of mysterious alien race (Talons) after the death of a former police officer. But soon the character of Kilner joins a group, which aims at discovering the true aims of aliens, why they care so well and care for mankind. Soon this resistance group began to discover the terrible plan of the Taliban for their own problems to destroy mankind. As I said before, the show began, the characters like Dawn were almost perfect, the main ardor was a great mystery because he seems to be a beautiful creature but at the same time his own evil plan is manipulating some people in the world. Soon Jor came who was not bad but ... marked the beginning of the fall of this show because he had become the first big enemy of the human being, incarnation of evil and grew slightly in Dan. The first season ends with Boan's death in a great way and the second one shows Kimera (another alien race) with a new lead character (Liam) with a hybrid of humans and some very funny powers. He replaces Kilner's character in a good way so that other stories make it better with conflict with Jaredian and Atvas. But before I stressed the turbulence of the tide, I told the line, so the new contradiction was less realistic as the same lock. Over time, the whole legendary story of Lion's Alien roots, which was almost completely removed with other issues of previous seasons. So when the final season began, the final world of the final conflict was almost a forgotten dream, then all the magic was missing, for some episodes, some live motifs, including Killan and Liam's return, were kept alive. The final episode proves how bad it is to show up in such a bad way (some of the authors of some episodes did not know about the first story), this is the worst thing I ever saw on a TV show. A real shame because the final conflicts of the world began in the story of some unique, fresh stories, after watching many shows from the United States, Canada was somewhat surprising in the mind of Star Trek's creator, but eventually all changed. I hope somebody will rebuild the show, definitely without the use of season 4 and fifth (without casting, everyone was perfect in his work). I can still dream of a good thing
