I just did not have very high expectations before Dawn. I do not know why I keep buying this slasher movie when I know it's always the same. Maybe I'm a little moccotic? However, I'm happy I bought this one. Yes, it's all the same. No, it's nothing original. Yes, it is known to young people that they are camping in the jungle, drinking and having sex. Yes, they killed one by one push. And you know what? It's just magic! One of the best experiences I was watching on a slasher movie is The place where the shot shot is so wonderful. You see the hills, waterfalls, rockies. It's just amazing. It takes a lot of time before killing the killer (except for the opening scene), but I have not cared! It was enjoyable to see it not enough to care. I mean, you do not have to sit down to wait at the beginning of the murder because every thing that has happened is enjoyable for the beauty of beauty. The end is a bit weird, but I would not say anything to you about it. You know what I mean. Another thing I enjoy: you care about the characters. They just do not have a bunch of quarrels who spend their time bitching each other. Of course, they are pure stereotypes of normal slasher letters but there are some special about them. However, this is a terrific horror film and I hope you have a great time because I've really done it!
