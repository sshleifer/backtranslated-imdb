For years I had a remote memory to watch this movie, I could not find it looking at the net and found it somewhere, so I thought it disappeared. <br /> <br /> My gran showed me a set of boxes sent for the daylight mail, and although I was not suitable there, I was among my kids among the other wonderful people! I was not so excited at all! This is a great light hearted movie, songs are not memorable if I was a child, when it came out I would have kept my mind stuck. Sadly, this was a movie, which I saw in my grance 10 years ago when I was a little tougher. And now it's awesome to see animations! And to get the word prosperity in the film, they are completely closed! But when your child does not think about them then you never think of the kids, even the 10-year-old boy looks like children. <br /> <br /> Great classic children's movie!
