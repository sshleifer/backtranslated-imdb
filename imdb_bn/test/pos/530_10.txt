I just saw this movie tonight. It's because I thought it would be good because I liked Natalie Portman and Susan Sarndon was also a great actor, but I was better than I could imagine. You get great feelings come out of the movie. The performance was nice, something that could be difficult to come in recent times. Natalie Portman is determined for great things and I'm a college student in New York, it seems that she seems to be going to school instead of being an actor. However, on the subject back, the movie keeps interested in the whole path through you and I definitely think that everyone will see it. I get more details, but I do not want to give the movie.
