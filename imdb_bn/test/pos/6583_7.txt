This is a movie that I read repeatedly reviews; And it does not play in the Plate Theater in the film museum? I decided to try one of these movies. Because there were so many ?? In the release, it was compared to POP fiction, it was a parallel story running in the film and in the end it has already won 17 awards internationally in different categories. I was interested in watching this movie and because of my friend's birthday in Greenpeace, I decided to see and watch the movie to make myself happy. <br /> <br /> This is a story based in Finland. I think it reflects the current life of the people in general ?? Drug, crime, sex, anger, anguish, fear and crime. Each emotion is caught brilliantly in the movie. There are several characters and stories interwoven but few letters come back to the next half ?? Creates a link to sequence at the beginning and the story goes forward. <br /> <br /> The story is about two friends? One of them is a computer gyke and another drug addict ?? The son of an insulting father. Drug addict son turns an euro 500 note ?? Printed by his friend ?? His music system gets huge changes in cash back to buy back, and buy more drugs back. EUR 500 notes trading intriguing events continued ?? Robbery with an automated mechanic from the shop dealer ?? A car dealer ?? A vacuum cleaner salesman ?? A prostitute ?? A police officer? Then her family and children. How to start a small thing ?? Does such a chain reaction lead to 5 years after the first case of a frustrating last note? Which I will not publish here. <br /> <br /> The direction is excellent. The first rate of the development of the movie character. Even after coming out of the film, the character that your mind takes is vacuum cleaner sales person. All sections of the movie are nicely managed. Here I would like to make some critical comments. First, while moving forward to an event, I felt that the event was very fast and compulsory. But sorry to see this error in this scrapplele full canvas. Secondly, one of the characters in one character brings the first two characters in a different way and again I get a compulsory decision by the author of the screen. As the major cities did not have the same characters again showing different effects. <br /> <br /> But after saying ?? This is a nice movie! It's a dark movie with several sex scenes. Characters are black, white and gray shadows and emotions which change to face different situations that are glazed by the director. <br /> <br /> A top rated movie! It has all the elements becoming a worshiping movie. I hope only these films will not become and will not achieve the status of culture films and will win a lot of rewards, because in addition to crime, gender, violence, medicine etc. can anyone make a great movie ?? Is your main example of cycling thief and rock panchali ?? The only thing is that they are changing days long and before and I think the movies are reflecting the current time.
