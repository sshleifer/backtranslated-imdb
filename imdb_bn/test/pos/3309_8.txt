Enjoyable movies that give you romance, women-to-the-miz cycodrama, acts of sexual harassment, fornication and fashion. It's all there. Typical characters found in corporate America Joan Crowford is usually a long time employee dog executive executive officer, who needs to stay with big boys. Hope Lanza's entry level level ambitious employee whose mind is using her body to move to the top. Their personal life is subplot. <br /> <br /> The dress is great for the film but someone forgets to say Stephen Boyd's hairstyle, "Little Dab!" Sometimes the amount of brickilium in Stephen Boyd's hair is confused, and his character's relationship with Lanz's character has never fully developed which I'm disappointed The movie is enjoyable as a whole. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 8/10
