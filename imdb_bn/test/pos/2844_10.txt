In September 2000, I saw 'Nurse Betty' in the international film festival 'Sea Film', the Netherlands. It has affected me so much that I keep the whole day happy after watching the whole day and often in the evening I took this film as the ultimate flavor of the festival. What I knew about 'nurse Betty' was short, that Riley Jelliegiger plays a girl with a sub-opera-star. But much more than what I saw! Splendid role for Morgan Freelance, Chris Rock and Renee Jelviser. Romance, violence and a strange mix of roadside. And for every story that gives you another direction every second, you are on track. Many soap-opera-lovers will love 'nurse betty' - character as well as film !!! But they can bring all non-soap friends out there, because they will enjoy more stories for cruel scenes, thriller aspects, and difficult and ridiculous lines for beautiful pictures - Freeman and Rock. And I'm sure everybody will love 'nurse betty' for its impressive and unselfish attraction !!!
