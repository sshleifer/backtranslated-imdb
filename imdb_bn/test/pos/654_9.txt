Very memorable comedy. To develop a lot of situations and ultimately harmonious humanity (and the world's biggest hunky) - the gathering of the greatest collection of the Great American Freeway after a long trip is fun. Like "... crazy, mad world" it has got contemporary talent, old boy politics, good humorous action and dialogue loads. More than that, they do not know any such idea that is not a stranger, they want to move along America's wonderful road. Nor is it a great fall that carries the weight of people, which is stored up to the end only by a great belly. But the last stunt sequence is not less than spectacular viewers with excellent film editing, humor and timing, and the big city bank scene is particularly enjoyable with a very original character played by a very gifted character. People of the city facing the chaos feel like a projectile fly on a rough roof. Slapstick is funny, but Honky Tonk is easily missed because it is easily loaded with nuance and character reactions because it is able to listen and be closely watched. We were all a very interesting reflection that was good and bad, and the stupid situation we found ourselves in was in it. It was just meant to be drunk!
