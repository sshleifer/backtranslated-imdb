I like this picture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Noticed in absentia). Why is this picture tired of getting married and why does he suspect someone who is selfish or sweet talker? Lila's dinner table response shot on her anniversary occasion, when her devious husband (again late for dinner) ate salted scallions with gusto and pushed the bride-doll doll to its plate path, perfect. <Br /> <br /> The show is stolen - and easily stolen - As Elliott Dixter's Jim, Lilah's Neglected Husband After losing Lily to another, Jim literally works to clean up his work, stop his torch, spread to middle age, and cleanly sort. There are some gymnasiums at home, solitary and lilar thinking, when he found one of his old clothes in the closet, with a strong view. The film gives viewers the benefit of observing Jim's transition along Leila. It's not just exotic, which is more interesting; We actually came to know more about a person like Jim, and we see that he is completely different from Lilar's second husband, Sheyular (Louis Kodi). Before Jim and Jim, he wanted Dexter, who can determine who can win Leila after discovering Sheyular's true character, if he can. The most sensitive moments of the film comes when Jim and Lella discover that they are standing under the millello, and Jim talks to her who has lost her. <br /> <br /> Definitely valuable.
