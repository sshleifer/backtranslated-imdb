Little Gass is a ten year old criminal. He moved away from his parents and decided to go on a road trip. Petali is somewhat difficult for him, so he made an instrument to help him. His goal is to win a terrible lottery type card called Motorama. To spell M-OTORAM, he has to find eight letters. Following the dark smile, since it turns from hell to road. She runs in some deranged lynch like characters. The most memorable gas station attendant, who put his image on a thin sheet, hopes that God will see it. After Gus gets a tattoo and an eye patch for her injured eye. You can be a witness on the screen as he becomes one of the most insidious bad asses of 10 years old. This is the kid's flick! See for Jack Nance, Flaya and Drew Brewrimore Camos. Be careful even when Drew is in front cover, he only appears in the sequence of movies for a few seconds. Also, the film becomes confusing at the end of the David Licht area, you might want to see it a few times. "Mintama" Joseph Minyon writes, "In-House Hours" and "Vampires Kiss" are well-known for its screenplay, so enjoy this unrealized exaggerated road-trip!
