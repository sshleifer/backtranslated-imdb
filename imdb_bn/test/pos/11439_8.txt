"The Gig" is a fun, funny and shocking little movie about a group of regular friends gathered to play in Dixieland. The group unexpectedly lands in a real paying profession, the parlance of music science; A "gig". <br /> <br /> They are a member of a summer research mince, who bows out of the cancer treaty to travel to New York for a two-week giga. In the last minute, they hire a professional to take his place. Sticky things like street surfaces seem like Franky tried to come back to Wiley Type Resort and tried to use the group as its band. <br /> <br /> Professional lightning player's attitudes were genuinely true. By signing up to play two weeks of gigabyte, they were taking bread from someone who had to eat their baby's food. Pop, Rock, Rap, Country and the West, and R & B Star earns money from the album. Jazz musicians must travel abroad to make a living. Almost no one gets rich. <br /> <br /> I believe that almost everyone who can play a playing "dream" with musical instruments for some time, Woody Allen and Kevin Bacon are two popular examples of this amateur-to-professional crossover. Anyone who has played professionally in music professionally recommend this movie. My mother, who was a musician, loved her.
