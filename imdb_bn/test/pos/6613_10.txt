This picture was removed at the age of 39 when I was 13 that all the footage and coverage of the city of Dagon were affected by me at the age of 13. Those who criticize the debilitating of the boys of jealousy, they will end up cheering on you to criticize them. It was their entire agreement, "We are better than you and here .... (Imagine inserted footage into the most simple pools)" It was a film to tell their story and it was their story that you or your loved one does not like it or not. It mattered them to their opinion of their skating ..... you do not have me. I was thinking that this picture has taken its attitude and effect exactly as I thought in 70's. The reality is that they have revolutionized the skittbording, they were inspired by the extreme sports and inspired a cultural refinement that reached every corner of America. This film has reborn in waves of Bertelman's pictures, and Alva and J. Adams have raised this challenge, which the dream of California made fun of the whole culture of young American teenagers, which just wants to be fun and red! I saw this picture, I realized that I used to live this image every day until I returned to Noyalal after I was five years old and went back to age. As long as I could come back, my friends and I made the road after the ramp and threw them, probing for each empty pool, and I met Stacy with these boys. We are all educated and now family and professionally but this movie reminds me that I was at that age and why I still surf. This is an inspired movie that is interested in pop culture, extreme sports, 70 or even better documentary film, enjoy it completely. Whenever it comes to cable I can not change the channel. Stacy Peralta Kudos for making a nice piece of art!
