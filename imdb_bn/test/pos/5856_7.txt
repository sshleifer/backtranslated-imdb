Now, I know Sandra Bullock has created this movie, but she must learn something that sometimes you have to sacrifice some things to advance the story ... without trying to make the whole film about her character! The story is about two high school students (a wealthy and popular, other smart and anti-social) who prepare plans to kill and follow it according to the numbers ... only they can see that they do it. Enter the Sandra Bulak and Ben Chaplin as a detective trying to solve the case. The boys planted testimonies, made alibi, and made it clear after themselves that police fell to the whole law. But Sandra does not seem to have all that feeling. <br /> <br /> This movie may be a bit of a bit hotter for hitcouch-style thrillers, but the movie spends a lot of time to know Sandra's character. Than focusing on actual crime itself. You see, the past happened to him that he is hunting for him throughout the film. And we all know about it ... all about it. After a while it becomes rather tedious, especially when you are right in the middle of a playful murder investigation and then have to stop the investigation to know what happened in the past. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the original winners of this movie. They play their character convincingly and just with the right amount of errors. The script spends most of the time concentrating on these characters and stops the detectives to do their jobs, but it can be a very entertaining adventure. Along the way, the thrill of the most lost. They could cut all the elements with the character of Sanders and create a separate TV movie for the Lifetime Channel. But I have no hesitation. It's still an entertainment movie, yet. I recommend this movie ... then wait for the video / DVD.
