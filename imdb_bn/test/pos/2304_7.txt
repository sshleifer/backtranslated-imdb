A real horror ghost story, full of cold and intense, this movie is just short of promise short. It is apparently based on an old ghost story, and probably depends a little more on a simple premises. In most cases, its fantasy and genuinely sticky, but ultimately, like Oshim, it just lost interest and it quickly ended. <br /> <br /> The story is simple - a woman killed her husband, her younger lover so that they can stay together. But the nerve and his returning ghost condemned their failure to their failure. Fantasticly operated with fantastic set scenery, and lovers' emotions are nicely portrayed. But most of the time the film really fails to promise its promise, often if Oshima lovers lose her nerves in the same way. <br /> <br /> This is an appropriate film to see how Oshima is skillful as a filmmaker to attract viewers with some exploitation film techniques to see how to unite her great, but sadly it is not an ideal classic of Oini Barbara or Duess's female views.
