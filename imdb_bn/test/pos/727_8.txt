A raw material thriller targeted for great philosophical heights can not achieve it quite. I still enjoy the film incredible. It was a mysterious big element, which hopes for me to thrill that I hope to have fun from the spinal cord, and it has achieved it completely mentally in relation to the increase of blood and grazos. Soundtrack and setting add up completely mystery. Occasionally, it was an overwhelming, especially acting, and character development. We were more familiar with the past nightmare, when they saw the characters while closing their eyes and why they felt this great need to find "answers" which in this story is so integral. After all, they started looking for it, there is no doubt about what can happen when it finds it intelligent or at least. I would suggest watching this film if you are ready to go beyond the rough grit to see this diamond possible.
