I saw Bappy's Vampire Slayer and did not start loving the shots until the season 4 began. This episode "Hash" opened in my dark night in the darkness of my window and after the wind the wind blew through a fierce storm. The author of this episode did a great job scaring the hack from me. I was terrified of the whole episode which I just finished 2 minutes ago. Surprisingly this conversation does not touch what surface is done with almost no dialogue. You do not see at least this episode of this event, but never pay for this event. If it does not affect you, it probably will not be a case. <br /> <br /> BTW My Heart Still Racing ...
