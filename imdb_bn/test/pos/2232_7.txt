I had pre-code it and Turner was interesting only because Turner tivo'd this classic. When I turned around, I noticed that "criticism" gave it a hundred and a half stars on a four-star scale. I started watching with panic - even old movies could be bad movies - but I was quickly involved in the story and the performance of Mary Astro. Not a real great movie - it's very predictable - but certainly good than advertising. And I liked Ricardo Cortez more, who praised Mary, but do not give up her rich wife. I'd appreciate it Astor and recommend how long we've come, give it a look.
