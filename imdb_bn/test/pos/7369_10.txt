This movie has taken four friends who broke a car during driving. They build a campfire to get to the night and wait for help. To pass the time, they tell each other's story of fear. The movie will be destroyed to tell about it, so rent and enjoy !! <br /> <br /> I would say it starts a bit slowly, but every story will be well and well done. Among the film's most popular artists today is Cristin Taylor (The Bradley Bunch Movie), James Merceden (Annoying Behavior) and Ron Livingstone (Office Space). So big and big big stars !! !!
