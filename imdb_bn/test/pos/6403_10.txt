This series, when it's ideal and fantastic, comes from quikki, generosity, and sincere heart that lives on an island. <br /> <br /> I've been out of Hawaii for a few years now. And some remote (non-tourists) areas found some delightful, quirky, and funny people. <br /> <br /> Every time I see reruns in this series, I happily compare my experiences with memories- parts of Hawaii with memories are portrayed in the original film and imagined. <br /> <br /> This series is not reality television. I hate reality television. <br /> <br /> In this age people have written creative TV shows. Give me a "young writer" that takes their inspiration from "angels in inspiration, wizards in palm trees and elves in seashells".
