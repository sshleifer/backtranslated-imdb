Sweet, rich valley girl crashes on a punk from the lane and when her snobby friends void her, she is forced to choose between her heart and her popularity. Very funny romantic comedy black comedy and '80 cheese that mixes it into more fun viewing elements. The movie does not follow the girl of the valley and the life of her punk; But they also go to the store, party, hang out, and mall to their friends. If you do not laugh at non-stop for a week in the dialogue, then there will be music. Like the song "Johnny, are you quier?" Available in the whole. Also, Elizabeth Day is a fun, existent character and finally pram King and Queen lectures delightful!
