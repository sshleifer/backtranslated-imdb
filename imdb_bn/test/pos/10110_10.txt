"A Tale of Two Sisters" is a brilliant South Korean mental awful symbol that kept me foolish. This movie gives some terrific moments of horror horror and extremely vague. Actor little cast is really nice, lead ewe so-jung, especially the main role, is memorable. Kim G-Wind's direction is well-directed and cinematography is absolutely fantastic. This plot is a little confusing, but some scenes are surprisingly shameless. The action is rather slow, but I was not bored at least; I was very weird and impressive. This room looks incredibly appealing and isolated where the film takes place. "Ringo" and "Cairo" with "A Tale of Two Sisters" is one of my most original Asian horror films. Never seen See this masterpiece as soon as possible. My rating: 10 out of 10
