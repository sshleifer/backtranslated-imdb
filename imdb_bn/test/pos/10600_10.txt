A word for it. extremely happy. I have not seen this on a long time like movies. At the movie point, I totally forgot it was a movie, I felt that I saw Viva La left back, even seeing, my own friend was giving something like this. It was realistic and how I liked the left, Ryan, Rab, Rake and Brandon, and the rest did not try to work hard. They were, like me, just acting like the souls of their famous ass. Some scenes I loved more than others, like RAW's Shower, Holy, I laughed very much. He was honestly probably my favorite character as well as the left. He really, in my opinion, made the movie a little more humorous. This is basically a CKY crew must see for any fans:]
