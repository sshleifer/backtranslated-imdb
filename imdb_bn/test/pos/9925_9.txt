I consider myself a casual fan of Dario Argonto. For him, for every really good flick (such as "deep red" and "teben"), it seems that it is equally unclear (its operating "opera" has become frustrated). Still, he does not deny that when he is at his best, there are some awesome directors who can keep him at the top. I consider "Opera" the best work in Argentina. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the movie where all its trademarks are present. There is no advanced-developed character, and if you start testing it once the plot gives very little knowledge. However, think Argentina is Brian Depaler European equivalent - this style is important here, so it becomes substance. There are some beautifully pictured assassination sequences, especially in Argentina. Those who are unfamiliar with people's work can understand that they are as bad commentary (and it may be that often thinking about their wrong times), but it is really true. Argentina stage eye shooting with an intensity of popping eye sight. She really makes an art form of graphic violence. Plus, its direction and the look of its films are ineligible. Fortunately, "Opera" is one of his most awesome products. Argentina is the only director, whom I saw to watch the room music work well to create a threat (when others tried to stop it, it was added as Chess). Cristina Marcillac plays a beautiful and reasonably sympathetic game, but the young opera in particular does not make the performer impressive. The remaining actors are working and work done to get done, but again, with Argentina, never played. Its beautiful color, terrible violence, and overall fever, dream / nightmare environment. (9/10)
