I saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, a good message for kids. Expect a bit. The book was good, more plot details, ore about the environment and how the kids exposed the conspiracies. I think Huessen's satirical humor is better than the book compared to the film, but there were many fun moments in the film. This is probably a bit too slow for kids under 6 years of age. Jimmy Buffet is cast as a science teacher. And those baby owls were adorable. I managed to show how they managed their film. The film is mostly seen in Florida, it seems very interesting. Am I imagining, or did the writer Carl Hysen have a brief look?
