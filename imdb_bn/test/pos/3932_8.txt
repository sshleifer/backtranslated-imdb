I saw a friend's preview this Tuesday night, a group of friends and we had an explosion! After learning the brightness for Bozieman (awesome! 3/10) and the remake of Amitivel (so 6/10) I've enjoyed a lot! In the trailer, I believed that the whole city could be "forgotten", but it is a hungry pop starring movie, so I accept it for it. <br /> <br /> My only big complaint is that I think Paris Hilton wax touches or drowns etc. And they will shout the word "hot" but they did not (how they can resist ???). No nudity from <br /> <br /> 2 girls though looks great in her underwear in Paris! I am surprised that they do not want to be the third "hot token victim" in the movie, and some nudity that is the kind of glamor! I will not have any death or plot spoilers list but I can say that Paris and Elijah both get well-roughed! <br /> <br /> Characters have developed slowly and some favorites (like cabin favors, where you do not want them to die) and the motion of the film, though nothing happens in the first 30 minutes, like the first horror movies. <<br /> <br /> I could have given it an 8/10 because it provided good fear and pride and I had low expectations. If you go with some friends like Chess Hour movies you have a great time. <br /> <br /> Noah
