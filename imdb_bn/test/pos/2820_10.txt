I usually do not have the type of dark / mental thriller type. However, ME SEIZING is really a wonderful piece of work. The story, acting, filming, psychic themes, erotic qualities and spiritual understanding are all really complex and compulsory. Rose really plays the complexity and shifts of a mentally disturbed woman correctly. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way managed to exchange power issues. It was so intense for us to see that we left three quarters of the "drink tea" and I was forced to shower. The story was sticky, but we were not able to manage all the strengths in a single shot. (It spreads among people's intense and fearsome aspects, but you do not leave them there). I think about letters and deep meaning for long periods. I would highly recommend this one. Still you will be ready for an experience you are not expecting.
