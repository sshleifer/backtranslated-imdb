I saw it on the syndicated TV in the 70's and praised its production value, which was high technology for a period of time. Remastered video is rich and colorful, much more intense then pale 35mm TV prints. This movie is worth a lot of attention: it also features Star Wars and Ubisoftly Gazette with UFO, Space: 1999 and even its detailed miniatures. Sure, the story of Earth's alternative alternative stars from Star Trek has been recycled hundreds of times, but for the beauty design of this film, the self-aware European Floyer: From Rolls-Royce Space Engine to "Euro Second" Letterhead business paper, JaffaSa or DopGlangers Europe, is said to be the delight of European legendary views in the shadows of the Director General. Gary and Sylvia Anderson's ambitious episode became a little tedious when American astronaut finally realized that he was in Dopplanger's heart and poetic impressive shuttle encouraged him literally after the boarding sequence. The medieval story was helped by the grand and lyricist scriptural score by John Williams of Great Britain Great Barry Gray.
