** SPOILERS AHEAD ** <br /> <br /> It's really unfortunate that a movie is so well generated <br /> <br /> Such despair. I thought this (full) clich√©s were full and <br /> <br /> It basically tried hard to work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said (married) girls : How many of you are suddenly <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To the French: Do you really want to know someone? <br /> <br /> When you know that they can not speak French, then "la la"? <br /> <br /> <br /> Are you using a more common word? <br /> <br /> I used to live in France for a while and I can understand and understand a bit <br /> <br /> (and I love it) in Europe, but my (German) roommate and I have found it <br /> <br /> Overall insulting. It looked like a movie funded by the European Parliament, and it was originally tried very hard. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . Then the end <br /> <br /> - The last 10 minutes left all the rest. Why Xavier <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> > <br /> <br /> he left? Why does he just run away from his job, <br /> <br /> "freedom"? And finally, we should rest on new Europe <br /> <br /> who smokes and stops throughout the day? This <br /> <br /> <br /> What is it? <br /> <br /> As well as acting was very awesome. I can not believe Judith <br /> <br /> <br /> The role and role of Godre. Why is he <br /> <br /> <br /> It looks like <br /> Emanuel Beart? At first I used to think Javier was right. <br /> <br /> I once again thought that he was very bad. <br /> <br /> It's really bad, because technically (Open credit, <br /> <br /> when he asks whether it needs any papers) It was true <br /> <br /> Good (Without sound editing around British siblings), and <br /> <br /> Soundtrack was very good. So the form was good, but the content <br /> <br /> is pretty awesome.
