Even after viewing the date, "Inki and Minah Bird" is my opinion, an enjoyable and charming cartoon. Artwork is not great, but good enough. This cartoon has no dialogue, just sound and music, but this combination works quite well. Cartoon itself is good, funny, old fashion, creative, entertaining and fun. <br /> <br /> This cartoon also makes the difference because it only focuses in 3 letters: Inki (little black girl), Mina bird (a very strange bird) and a hungry lion that wants to cook both Inki and Minah for breakfast - So he left behind cartoons for most of them. <br /> <br /> I am a lion, very nice, ridiculous and cool. I really liked that lion. The poor lion is so stupid and hungry that he will feel sorry for you. For me, the real enemy mine is the bird, not the lion. At one stage, lion eats it around - very bad, because it does not make it fall, it deserves to eat. <br /> <br /> This animated short back, is a single dull or not boring moment. At least for me The only bit that I feel stupid is finished because a big fight with the bird lion, steals his teeth and puts them on himself. Even bigger, I have nothing big to criticize about this, it is true that Steak must have gone for the lion and not the bird. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, underrated little jewelry that should have forgotten it very much and definitely get more credits.
