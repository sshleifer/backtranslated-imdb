The second film about Gaelic and Obelix literature is 10 times higher than the first. Humor is fantastic (and overwhelming) and the script is well-edited from the original 1965 comic book by Goslein and Woodrow. I fell asleep with the first movie (though I was a great fan of esters) and I was reluctant to see this series, but the film is happy to prove me wrong. Nice comedy for everyone. Highly recommended!
