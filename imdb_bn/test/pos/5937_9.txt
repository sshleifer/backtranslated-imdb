I've enjoyed both Van Dykes for years and were happy to see them again. <br /> <br /> Just cute and funny and easy to see and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Dick was good when he was younger, but as soon as he grew older, I enjoyed him more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am disappointed that I could not find any other 101 numbers list. <br /> <br /> I saw that both were shown. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br />> They will enjoy something different. <br /> <br /> They will be sure to see what they can do together and together.
