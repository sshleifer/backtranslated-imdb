This is my favorite love story which has every element that should have a good love story. Poetry, jazz, friendship, ups and downs is a relationship. Finally a movie that shows the positive aspects of a black community. Lornej is not able to portray anyone else as Tate Darius. He read poetry like his poem and used to mean every word. I own this movie and if I have time, I will look at it every day, it always makes me better and what it should do for a good movie. Also, the character Saawan could not have done any good treatment on the subject of marriage. We all want to find Darius, but most of us are right to watch this movie. My vote is 10/10
