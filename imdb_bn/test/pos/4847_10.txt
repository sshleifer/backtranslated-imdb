Arthur Miller certainly knows. In the 20th century, a writer from the United States gives a clear picture of how he can explain his stories more than I can remember. <br /> <br /> Focusing on his novels is no exception. <br /> <br /> William H. Messi and Laura Darn gave excellent acting here. Emotionally hurt but eventually rewarded, this movie is excellent.
