Why did I rent my video store box? It seemed to be cold since it faced half-ax axed, so of course I was trying it. I was pleasantly surprised when I actually saw it as the "Evil Dead" fan. Fans of Swedish manufacturers must be included in the reference as they certainly mention this best composition. Evil Ed edited the movies by trying to break into a criminal house which eventually made him crazy and said as "Govvy" he saw his weapon like Bruce Campbell when he finished his chain hand in Evil Dead. There are also many posters of this movie spreading in the film and at home. They are like the Greek-style puppet giant in the affidavit, it's not only Evil Dead. My personal favorite is when he put his wife around the house and said, "I am coming to meet you Barbara", if you did not know that Barber's brothers' main line in "Night of Living Dead" This movie mostly has a fair amount of it all good plots, cool letters, funny stuff (Gremlin dolls), scary stuff (monster doctor), excellent impact (bursting head) and female nudity. I only gave it a 9th because Ed's madness was slow before but its well worth waiting. So if you like "Evil Dead 2" or I break any other movie mentioned above and see it with a friend, and when you're done try "dead brain" because I have heard that it is similar to this best. <br /> <br />
