I saw this scene this morning where Aid was involved in 3-Way and my wife was caught on screen in the morning! I'm not surprised that it has attracted my attention and I've reviewed it and saw it at 4:30 in the morning! What a very entertaining, rich, fun and well-developed plot line and script. We both enjoyed it perfectly, my wife is so much that she has shared the work experience with her friends! It is recommended and a "kick" is going to tell what he got out of it. I'm in my late 40's and she's in her first 50's. I think this film will appeal to both the young and the old. An unexpected, very enjoyable surprise. Excellent work! Thanks! Two thumbs up!
