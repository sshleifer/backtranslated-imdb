It was a great movie! It was a completely enjoyable teenage fantasy. So what makes a movie great? Technical details? I think that if it was the only criterion, then our culture would be poor for it. So this movie is the new wave music mojert as "The Godfather". The point is, I saw it as one of its best movies. Woman is all beautiful (only when California is seen in the beach while the movie is made). It met a little something, a kind of battlestar galactica met BayWatch Facebook CenterFull video met Wayne's World. There is a lot of charm and a rational (though predictable) story that keeps you interested until the eye fat fills the screen on the next screen. Joe Estevez may not have his brother's career, but the story does a good job of bringing focus as the teenage kid ever. The Games Rock Band without plug-in plugs as the female rock band has plenty of expected absurdities in the game. (Is that deliberate?) If you are attracted to the box, rent the video, you do not regret it. As committed, it is good non-violent erotic fun!
