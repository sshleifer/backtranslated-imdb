When I saw absolutely "I live in a big way" fell in love with! Reason # 1 Because I love, Ador, and a huge fan of Jane Kelly. She was such a wonderful dancer, actor, and dancer. Her extremely handsome appearance and her sensual personality are not mentioned. I love his role in this movie. He was such a gentleman. This movie demonstrates its wonderful talent for acting. I enjoyed Marie McDonald as well. It was my first time or the first time to know something about him, and this extraordinary movie made me his fan alongside him. Indeed, the whole custom of this movie was enjoyable and fantastic. Humor in Butler, "Hannover Smith in Everest", and Dad, Mr. Morgan; Concussion of Mrs. Morgan's court comic, and especially concerns with Grandmother Morgan and the concerns of "Leo Gogi" And Jane's number "Fido and I" adorable. The number of opening dances with GENE and Marie is very nice. I would recommend anyone watching this movie. It really will be your heart forever favorite Or at least I have it. And you will all fall in love with GENE again. I rated it my # 2 favorite Jane Kelly movie, and I saw and watched her several movies. They are a part of my daily routine! So when I tell you, believe me, you will love this movie! See it and enjoy it !!
