Although I'm not a Michael Jackson fan, I like some of his early songs and some of Jackson 5's. 'Thriller' is one of his great songs and it comes from the best selling album with the same title. For the video, it's cool, Michael's best one, but very surprising and weird. <br /> <br /> There is a story behind this video, but it is so complex that I do not fully understand it. It's weird Instead of Jackson's Jackson conversion, his bad red eyes at the end (like a lamb) and those who are dead people are dancing. <br /> <br /> The video is very dark, thrilling, pepper and original. There are great sceneries and settings. The music itself is full of life and rhythm, characteristic from the old pop of 80 well. <br /> <br /> I like Vinilent Price soliloquy He described a great with his unique and unique voice and at the end his evil smile is remarkable! My favorite videos of 'Pop of Pop' are "Billy Gene" and "do not stop until it's enough" (both of their best songs).
