Oh God's rude accent !!! Megabyte Garden is probably one of my most brilliant '70's ​​childhood memories. With Pony Taylor, two hippies will swing the baby, carol and pallet swings, picking a chocolate patch, Jokes will say, they will wear a giant chest wearing Stormbox, and they will debate with a pink pink glass called Sherlock. They could sing an average acoustic guitar string and a beautiful melody. It was a great childhood show. Very 70 Feelings But that's the problem: they do not show up like this anymore. It is a pity that You could say these two girls were really true heart and loved kids, they were really sweet. The Magic Garden shows them that they have come out with the box box, people will buy it because it's walking down the memory lane.
