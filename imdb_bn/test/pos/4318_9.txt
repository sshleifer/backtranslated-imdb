A very good episode, although the end of the season is not devastating to the end. 1. The idea of ​​creating a Desmond flashback works very well and Henry Ian Kucci was fantastic, probably putting the best performance of this whole series, but my only complaint is that the Michael Plot line will be very much like a supplement, and three minutes before After the episode, I think it will be more featured. But the power of Cusicks character and performance is drawn through it. Plot development, as always, abandons more questions, answers, who like others, something we still do not know, and where they are taking Jack, Swar and Kate What was the white light, what was the effect? Lock, echo and Desmond dead? Hatch destroyed around them. If they are then it would be a big mistake, because these three most interesting characters and series will enjoy without them and Terry and Quinn Locks have been fantastic throughout both series as well. Then a fitting ended up in a good series.
