I think this show was just fine for me. I saw it on the plane but there was part of the movie that let me control myself from across the place. <br /> <br /> Chemistry was very believable in Richard Gere and Diane Lane (both played superbly)! I also play Diana Lane's daughter. It is easy to believe that he demonstrates maturity and how he transforms throughout the show can be like a teen in real life. <br /> <br /> I like this show from the beginning to the end. Definitely recommend there for romantic people!
