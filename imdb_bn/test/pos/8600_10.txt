In the light of the recent typhoon, the country hit hard (i.e. Typhoon Ondaya), I thought about myself the "black rain" (1988, Japan), the black and white disciplinary force of Shahei Imamura. After the destruction of the atomic bomb after effects of the destruction of Hiroshima in the last World War II and after effects Both disasters (wars and typhoons) can be different from the degree of degeneration and impact and quality, but there are still injuries (physical and mental). <br /> <br /> This is one of the rules of the film's power that its images are as strong and as soon as it is seen, it is impossible. Now my only difference is that observing these images has led to a greater sense of continuity and power due to the early experience of a major weather disaster. There is a sense of kinship, so to speak. <br /> <br /> Imam is always one of my favorite Japanese filmmakers. His films are always delighted to see their anarchy, sex, and intuition: "The colorographers: Anthropology of autocracy" (1966), "Agnica" (1981), "War Water Under A Red Bridge" (2001) Some of the non-winning "Ballad of Narayam" (1983) and "The Yell" (1997) Considering the mood of his film, who thought he once worked as the most powerful and least filmmaker of Japanese filmmaker Yasuzaro Ozu? But then the Wazoo's rigid formalities and domesticity that revolted against the Imam. <br /> <br /> Again, anyone with "black rain" can understand the excuse impression. The purpose of marriage (or parents) to their daughter before marriage is on both of them, and with the stability and peace of the scenes, all the members of the family are shown together (in particular, Dinner scenes or film lexicon, tatami in ozu) is something that honors the master The filmmaker will always explore his work ("Tokyo Story", "Last Spring"). Basically, the most intelligent and deliberate quality of "Black Rain" is a remarkable contrast to the bacterial chaos of Imamura's entire film and the progressive drive. <br /> <br /> However, seeing this movie does not mean that there will be a completely unsettling experience. "Black Rain", "Black and White", as well as the American film critic Leonard Moulinne described as "terrible." In the first 15 minutes of the film, Imam did not create any obstacles to show immediate and graphic horror of atomic bomb attacks, one after another (strictly-burned bodies, hanging meat, dead walking, fire and ruins everywhere, above all insane). The attacks on the audience's senses, of course, have been licensed by Tashishi Kawmattar Sleeping B / W Photography (He is an episode of "Yashitu Nomura's crime drama" incident) and he was tuned to Chemishur Chilinging Scorcher (as he did the classical music of Akira Kuorwa's "Run" and Masahiro Shinoda's "Double Suicide" ). Even in the supposed "quiet" stage of the film (ie, after five years of nuclear bomb attacks), there may still be no feeling of satisfaction and emotion, yet discomfort and pain are felt, not only physical health failure by the living, But in case of trauma and social stigma. The human race, it appears to be relentlessly now, has been determined to bear the legacy of the bomb, as long as it is alive. A few years ago (blog posted IMDb.com) I had already written a piece about "Black Rain", but compared to Volker Scandorff's superb "Teen Drum", another movie is working with memorable human folly And global disasters. Moreover, I have never practiced my writing twice about a movie that I have already written something. In the light of the recent weather disaster, our country has been devastating, that I was asked to write and write about this wonderful Imamura film, because there are so many resources for education from films and recent events. Scientific knowledge and the lack of action and danger, and wounds caused by harmful (human nature or induced) harmed by long-term wounds and wounds. <br /> <br /> There has been a number of "black rays" and "black rays" between movies and movies working on nuclear holocaust and destruction ("Testament", "Threads", "War Games", each located in their respective countries) And a slight painting of communal tearing is a nuclear disaster, and as a foundation, it brings a historical event. <br /> <br /> A few weeks from now on, another disaster in Hollywood, the Roland Emerick "2012" will finally be hit (no pun intended) big screen. We all know that this "American designer" disaster / apocalypse "-" Independence Day "," Godzilla "," Next Day of the Day "does not serve any purpose other than entertainment value, the nature of mysterious disaster and insight of knowledge and Human condition is being affected, due to the recent weather disaster, this "giant" film has become a tragedy of how human beings are attacked by us. I wonder what will enjoy bega and fear. This would be more than flash a satarkatabadi story perhaps an overstatement to say that. <br /> <br /> But yes, I am still "2012" look.
