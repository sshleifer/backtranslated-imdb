It is not a bad idea to see both of these movies together for the introduction of initial film production and camera styles. I know Garbo about her naturalness (but not by many) informed. Robeson royal But its performance is aimed at a large proscenium theater. Other things that hit me in the movie themes empowering women and minorities. There was no film coming out of Hollywood, which allowed voices of little characters such as Anna and Brutas to take progress. This was very progressive films for their time. Before the others about the future of America, it was quite probable to see the writing on the wall.
