The title of the film seems to be quite suitable for the fundamental character of the fundamental character. He is an old man who lives in the late autumn of his life, yet he is a jubilant school boy who has just entered the entrance of a spring field. The signs of old age and the warning signs of death are all his illusions. His wife supports this idea when he says "the fund laughs at the funeral and death." In other words, death does not take any fundamental importance; She already has more important things than to worry about inevitable. Life, however, and the lifelong pursuit of his whole life, philosophy that controls the fundamental existence. He is not the only one for mere existence, but must live life for every day and every passing moment, because tomorrow is not guaranteed. <br /> <br /> This picture seems to give strong opinion about living, even though there is no day tomorrow, but death alone. Many people take life very seriously and as a result, the real part of life is missing. For example, the fundamental wife; He is very worried about preparing for death, not some religiously spontaneously, but very remote, even ruthless in how he can smile, laugh and get a good time. His humanity seems to have turned into a zombie auto pilot mode. The fund, on the contrary, is probably too blithe and absent mind for his own good. He needs a person like his wife Emilie to maintain her balance. <br /> <br /> It seems that the fund is a child's unknown soul, such as a child stuck in an old man's body. He was introduced as a kind of adventure; He gets profit, the money is squanders money, instant lies and he is always for a good laugh. Although he is a deep and humble intelligent man, who wants to be modest in his extra-ordinary wife. Both of them close each other, even though none of them really appreciates the binary value of their relationship until they are transformed into metaphorically: ie their divorce. It can understand the reality of the fundamental death during the court scene and that means if he is different from his only love. His wife remembers all his mistakes emotions, yet despite his crazy behavior, he is lowly drawn to love. At the moment, while pardoning him, the fund realized his wife's selfish behavior to drive a fool and made an internal commitment to make him happy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Life is in the blood as it turns out to be like him? A zombie is going through daily speeds. She does not seem to live longer, but exists. For example, he gives up his jolt, does not waste money, gives up smoking for his wife (not his health), and, overall, he only gives approval for what he wants. Undoubtedly, he is due to be happy to make him change So, the binary values ​​of their relationship gradually begin to disappear. She does not understand her husband, she is a part of Emily who missed the old fund. She misses the absurdity of her husband and the fight she had, because it was at the moment that she was not realistic, only present. <br /> <br /> I believe the filmmakers are trying to get a specific message here; That true and loving relationship will not always be easy or convenient, but often times the mind will wade through bad times to take sacrifice and patience. At any moment, the chances of death remind people for a moment. Life is often passed, but the threat with death ?? Is it literal or metaphorical ?? People awakened from their ungrateful slumbers and were stimulated to start living their full life. They fear that they will not live anymore, so they make the most of it better with it. The Fund and Emilia had been married for 44 years, but they were not threatened by both the possibility of death-separation to show their true color. As the old maxim goes, "love does not know its own depth until separation hours." They both start seeing the most important things in life and in this way they meet. The more important, the close relationship they make with their significant others.
