There is nothing good for me to tell about this delicious and hearty movie. I think the film's director / writer's efforts are brave and inspirational. I just like this amazing story (which needs to be said), but not to distribute the story of actors, like this film. It is not a shallow "gay movie" that depicts stereotypical characters in ridiculous situations. It was such a memorable and flawless effort that people really have no love of love and love is always beautiful and surprising since it was always there. <br /> <br /> Another thing that touched my heart is, how well I could have been in relation to emotionalism in this film surrounding the main character coming out. We all live in the same society as we live and feel the feeling of being separated from everything "right" and "normal". I give my most sincere appreciation for this incredible and brave story.
