This Nifty small film shows the time, place and kind of mental strength-strong attributes that we do not have or even more. The Saint is not only a paladin, a polished vocabulary and fiction, with a good expression. There is no need to turn on the volume or read dialogue. George Sanders is so charming and yes, all the talents, memorabilia, physical presence and maximum, manhood, think, good, almost normal. Something normal! Apart from Mr. Sanders (and without mugging Mr Clooney), the scene can not begin to dominate. He could play a spleen (witness to Gest and Mrs Muir and Rebecca), but when he was good, he was very, very good. Really, a man for all the reasons and season.
