I agree with another 9 and 10 star reviews. I saw this at the Southwest Film Festival in South Austin. I saw in 20 movies, 7 was really good and it was best for me. I'm not hungry for movies where there are plot tools where the characters go through transformation that completely changes their lives. Nice acting was mostly done by people involved in TV, or it was their first movie. It was written and directed by J Flood. It is its first debut as a director. Jeans Day Job apparently appears as Clearance Administration for famous films. Forgiving Franklins was fairly delightful and the spots were very interesting. This is a movie where I will buy DVDs and watch it again, really a high complement from me. Good job, J, yes ... give up your day job!
