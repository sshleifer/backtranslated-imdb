This is a type of movie that can be seen many times to keep its beauty and intelligence {just like the Curse of Frankenstein from 1957}. You do not like strange, non-mainstream movies, but make this great piece clear. For me, the price of the purchase price of video cassette in this film alone works alone. The story seems to be a bit fantastic but today becomes the reality of our world. To be produced in the 1980's, this film proved to be a prophetic aspect of the idea that the film wants to control and monitor the bigger government and big brother. <br /> <br /> Too many slow parts and the dialogue has become very difficult to catch in many scenes (for that reason I have seen it 6 times now) but if you can digest it all, it may be appropriate for your time. <br /> <br /> The film is basically a world where people have developed robotics machines that have lost their personality. They are only concerned about accumulating and procreating. The hero of the film did not bend to the illness and "tagged" and not supervised by the elder brother. His mission is to publish a secret drug in water supply that will allow people to change the opinions of robots and to be part of humanity again in humanity. Yes, it is very low budget, but for its time the effect of the computer effect and sound is very unique and painting is completely interesting. If you have an open mind, then this film should be printed and its predictive views are frustrating.
