I see Lackawanna Blues every time it comes to it. It brings happy times back for me. I grew up in a big city in the middle west. It reminded me when it was my child, although my situation was a bit different, it was the same. It makes us wonder if we will all know about the lost family. The big paternity is under the age of 55. Will they see what it takes as an inspiration to others? I hope that I just did not like the movie, which was enough to be related to the past. Music was great in this movie. I really felt that I could see it in this theater. I saw the movie for a second time, I knew about this picture. She has a fantastic job of writing and producing this film. I guess those who produce a film based on your life other than you are well. As soon as possible I get a copy for my home use. I like black black producers or directors they feel like this film is actually like you had to live in just the right time. Thanks for such a great movie.
