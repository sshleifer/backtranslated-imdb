This film is about three teenagers who were the best friends for the longest time and the most horrific journey of their lives. When the heroin in their city becomes the preferred drug, these three teenagers cover it among themselves. This movie depicts heroin addiction very well and you are going to see something that can not be stopped watching. MTV was never the best made for the television movie, but it has a lot of good content to look at. I enjoyed this movie, at the beginning I thought it would be the worst movie, but when it went, it got better and I could not move.
