OK. You saw the picture and I saw the picture. Truth? If not, there is a lot of plot summary and there is no reason to waste time with any weak efforts to make us. <br /> <br /> The most striking aspect of the movie is undoubtedly performance by two young men and led young lady. Their ethical integrity was not compulsory compared to the performance seen in recent months. I laughed, I laughed, I started crying on the right with them, and it is a big thing because I often call it a powdered and worried jarak. <br /> <br /> As someone would expect, the story is cliche and I guess that picture is Achilles Hill. This is a story we have seen many times before; We all know how Rory will end up from the moment of introduction. Although you do not know the exact mechanics but you know that there is a converted friendship, a bitrswit romance and a heart-ending conclusion. This is not for a strong throw and if not directed, this movie is nothing more than eight percent of the program's Hall of Fame in the program.
