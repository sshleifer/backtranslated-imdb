This movie is one of my all time favorite movies and what made me a lifetime Nicholas Cage fan. In the middle of the 80's I taped this movie (when it was impossible to do it with VCR !!) and it looked over. Nicholas Cage is just brighter here. And, he looks amazing and does not affect "Acting-Ishma" (see what I mean about "Peggy Su Married" !!). I measure all its performance against this. She is so completely cast as a cool punk guy with steep friends. The music was great. Plymusulus! Cycodelic Furus! Modern English! Men work! Whenever I hear "dissolve with you" I'm back to the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> And his violent friend, Cameron Die? There is something different than Nicholas! Interestingly, the drunk friend (Elizabeth Delli) finally ended the voice of Tommy from the Rogets (he was the EG Daily as a daily for that awesome show!)! Victory <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to travel great in the 80's, check out this movie. It's definitely a classic. Completely like!
