I was enchanted by the debut of debut. I hope we'll see more of his work soon. I was lucky enough to catch the film while running her short NYC and it qualified me as the successor of the 80th flight, and was able to find hours later, but a gentle European humming that makes it new and fun. Playing mostly against the type was a pleasure to throw a strong ensemble. And I thought complex complex threaded plots were just fine. Sandra Bernard keeps his best performance from the King of the Comedy, while Peter Stormer is sunny, and touched by Gender Beyond. See it.
