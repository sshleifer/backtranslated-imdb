There are many twists in this thriller and it is on the edge of my seat. I saw it in the video, some landscapes in "Bluff" can be a little more spectacular on the big screen. Cast Sandra Bullock, Ben Chaplin ("The Truth About Cats and Dogs"), Michael Pitt (Henry Parker in "Dawson's Creek") and Ryan Gosling (???).
