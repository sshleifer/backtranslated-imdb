Last year, I fell in love with Tim Burton's version of Swine Todd, so I wanted to check out other versions of this musical instrument and I found it in the library. Although I think Burton is the best, probably because I love movies much better than the theater, it's still a wonderful production of the story. I did not see any other version but I'm trying to get my hands on them. <br /> <br /> Seeing Jod Depp as Todd, it is hard for me to imagine someone else in the role, but George Hearing does a fantastic job. Angela Lansbury is fantastic, always good and like a song. I found myself singing along. This is a game that you do not want to miss, but before trying to see the movie version try it so that you do not have impartial scenes.
