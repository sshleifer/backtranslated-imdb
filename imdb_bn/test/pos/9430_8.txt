A Swiss scientist Franz Tobel was smuggled out of his house by Sherlock Holmes so Nazi agents could show him new bombs without espousing him. While coming to London, he lived with Hollis and Watson, but went to meet his girlfriend Charlotte Daryili, where he placed a formula for Homes as the location of the bomb scene, which he divided into four parts, but Holly's eternal generosity, Professor Marriette, to the Nazis Find out the bomb scene and sell it. Leaving Tobel, the church left, a series of dancers' code series, which both Hollis and Marriar could not fully understand. Hollus finally discovered the code and found the fourth part of the bomber's view, but the other three of Marrias and a tragedy are inevitable. The very best entries in the Holmes series go about working mysteries and guesswork. Marriott's screenplay is more saddening than the impressive type described in the Dowell Stories (or acting of George Zucker of the Adventure of Sherlock Holmes), but the actress-like skills of Attil make her a great assistant to Marie. Both the script and the direction make this character more and more of a cat and mouse game between two characters and one of the reasons for this entry is so successful. Great work on cinematography as well. Ratings, 8
