I was mad at seeing this flick here before reading the external reviews and user comments posted here. Why? Firstly, Mick Maloye's humor (my modest opinion) can be proven by his ill-Semogel, a fantastic crass and top of a television show several years ago. And secondly because the good Aussie comedy film is sadly rare as Tessie Tiger. <br /> <br /> Glad Mick has resisted his natural curiosity in this surprisingly observable film. Who will say that a bowl club will provide a setting for the most exciting Australian films of the year. Cast is excellent with trustworthy local old timer putting all credible performance. <br /> <br /> John Kleck is interested in playing villain in this piece. It's a dimensional part but Jesse still adds a touching class as always. Judith Lucie was happy to get a Gurnee or saw a big screen belt uniform. He had a real talent, pity his expletives in a few reactions. Knowing a lot of its own stuff. Although interesting character. Local rag over bowler reporter How much journalist food discipline could get !! <br /> <br /> The crackerjack may not be the funniest movie of this year, but it is certainly an enjoyable packaging that is good to see. Most people agree with me as it is being run as the largest Australian film of this year. Eventually, it does not look good to anyone, before that many Australians make a playful, gentle comedy without having to try Slasherhamer to smile like 'comedy'. <br /> <br /> Finally, some intensity. If you are wondering if Aussie Rules Team Mick was able to check the flag at his workstation. Also look for his old partner in crime, Tony Martin announced in the final bowling scene. <br /> <br />
