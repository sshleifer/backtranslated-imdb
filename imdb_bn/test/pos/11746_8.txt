This image catches the eye, with the very atmospheric aerial view of the very beautiful Hong Kong. The films of 1950 were painted in rich colors, which modern blockbusters have never been caught. Probably a sign of that time, because it is not a high power, it was seen before the movie, full of horror and violence. Thousands of refugees are trying to get away from China, although retreats and violence are still, though it is a tragic and compelling story in recent history, with the expectation of sad times and love. The stories of two people falling in love from different cultures. And the heart of this very fine and moving movie is trying to deliver on them.
