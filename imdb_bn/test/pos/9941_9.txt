"Opera" is one of the greatest achievements of the genre. What should be the true horror movie in this wonderful movie: good, fascinating stories, many signs, wonderful scenes and a lot of pride. The killings are very frustrating and bloody. An unforgettable atmosphere of fear and fear. A true Argentine fan would certainly see, so if you get a chance to watch it.
