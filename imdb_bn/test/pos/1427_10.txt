As a "Mr. Scoutmaster", Clifton has reminded the comedians of all time in the memory of the greatest actors and an innocence, which has now been reduced to the world. I do not understand why the American movies do not show the cl ic-like networks and this movie, although I repeatedly requested it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is now about to achieve loyalty, respect, dedication and best possible basis on a different basis Solution In today's daily life, almost so much self-esteem has been spoken, but this film will be an excellent teaching tool to see what many of them can accomplish with common sense and modesty for the current generation. Pride yourself and your success yourself. Sadly, such a movie does not appeal to modern viewers. It certainly appealed to us yesterday's "baby boomer" generation. Older texts are Universal and Times.
