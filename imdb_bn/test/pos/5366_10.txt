This is an unforgettable thoughtful and involved movie which leaves a good impression outside its initial hoist well. Based on the real story, one of the many "small" stories before WWII, which lays the psychological understanding of the generality of the common man's culture, which is influenced by the previous enemy and possibly the foes of the future, in the dark horizon of war fighting. At the Stone Brook festival festival, this picture was encouraged. Good writing and skill throwing. Characters were most credible and painted one of their trials and sufferings.
