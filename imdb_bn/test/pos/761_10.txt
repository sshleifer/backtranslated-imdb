I had written this movie cleverly and played very well. A movie that overwhelms other movies in terms of originality and enjoyment. Rupert Green has played this part wonderfully and this is a common thing for the business of acting. Almost uninterrupted mother has added a lot to the plot, and a character that can almost immediately hate. It reminds me of Ya Ya Ya sisterhood's divine secret. Not the actual content of the film, but the theater and the overall tune of the film. "Driving Lessons" is the story of an era, many of which can be related to the power of the mother, the lack of independence and the discovery of her own.
