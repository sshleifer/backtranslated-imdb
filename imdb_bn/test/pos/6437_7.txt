When I was 6 years old, I saw this movie - my grandmother thought it would be an excellent Kidzie film for me to entertain and hold me .... However, every time I saw that I had nightmares on the same night. Yes, this is a children's movie, but I still see the places really dark, especially the scary music that the guardian angel is on screen, and instead of hypnotism eyes and voices. The film's actual "bad", ie sharks, Mr. Grimes, do not scare me, I have always seen the whole film in the dark and in the dark. I am obviously 21 years old, I can clearly understand, but there is no way to speak with experience that I will show to my kids!
