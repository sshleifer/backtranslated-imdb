Perhaps in this century I probably saw the best new French movie in this century. There are some great people, including Norse Arbarsol, Green's Lee Pantes des Arts, and Innosbot of Hadijihalilvic. None of these Les Amant came near the ruthless pride of Regulatia. <br /> <br /> The picture describes the events of May 68 and what happened next, and later it was a novel unclear film of those days and an updated and updated version of it. The film is accurate about the riot story in Paris (I was only 19 years old and I was not there, but you know what I mean) and almost real-time and many long riot scenes set the stage completely later on in the streets of Paris. Rioters are not proud or are not photographed very beautifully in Bartolukie's The Dreamers (which is relatively comparatively comparable in many ways), but instead they hear black and white shots courtesy of William Lubchensky. Following the riots of 68, the film's main concern is that the story of love is stunning and portrayed in fewer shady shots and otherwise in the political environment and in a seemingly cold environment, love and adolescence reveal the true feelings of confusion. <Br /> <br /> This picture is a beautiful love story and it is distorted by that the director wants to describe his own experiences of the late myths of the 60's, which makes the film even more compelling. But the film also paid tribute to the whole of Nawawel Wing Canon. Most conversations unfold the first trumpet, and the length and non-action and plot less formation are reminiscent of Easterch or Rivet. There is even verfremdung effect like Gamard, with whom they are watching the camera directly and addressing Bernardo Bertolucci directly. This picture is no doubt a northern song of Bertolookie's Dreamers and it is a novevel grim tribute, but it still stands as a beautiful and brilliant love story. <br /> <br /> The following line: This film is incredible and if you love French movies you should not sleep it. It can be the best French movie after Esterch's La Mameen et La Putin.
