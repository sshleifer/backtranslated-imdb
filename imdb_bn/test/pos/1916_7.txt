This must be one of the ultimate clerical classics and it must be seen for all psychological fans. Why? It has everything to have a great 70s absorption film. Includes top conversations, bad acting, encouragement, sex, puzzle, political mistakes, violence, and many other elements of a well-known classic classic. In other words, dllimite must be seen. <br /> <br /> With many of these movies, the plot is not less in any sense. What I found from it is that Pump-Hustler steals dolaimite and is ready for half a million dollar worth of narcotics. He spent time, his archive Nemesis Willie Green (the same person who made him) captured his nightclub. However, the sympathetic warden (the only white character in the film that is not completely bad or disabled) decides to sit down free to stop Willie Green and her drug trafficking. Thankfully, he knows Kung Fu, as in this film there are around 50 to 75% characters. And more fortunately, when he locked up, Madam Queen Bee sent all her "hoes" to Kung Fu School. Kungfu plans to return the nightclub from Willie Green to the army with "Hass" (his words, not Mine) war. However, two racist white police tried to frame him again and thrown him into prison. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, do not try to follow the plot. I have seen this movie almost five times and there are so many elements that there is no connection between anything else. Helpful characters soaked in film and outside. I'm still trying to understand what was with Rev. Gibbs, Mayor, and Hamburger Pump. Who ends up caring? The scene with these characters is all invaluable. For dialogue, with its even worse delivery, its awesome. Rudy Ray Moore was originally a comedian, I started thinking that this movie could be a scandal or a serious action film. Looks like he can not make any decision. "Yes, I'm very bad," I kicked my own donkey twice a day "and call for further investigation. However, the film is delightful, and the plot has more holes than a Swiss cheese factory. Another sunny material film is ever the most unerotic use of sex and nudity Some of the actors that you never want to see nude get naked (including mayor and queen bees). <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is usually a good time Seems to be being and is certainly charismatic. His comedy raps influenced gangsta rap the next day, along with Dr. Dre, who performed his supporting album in 1992 album "The Chronicle", as technically disabled as a film, it Culturally influential, even more importantly, it is almost always a good one. A exploitation film is the biggest crime. In other words, if you dig this kind of film, you would prefer "dlmeight." If you do not dig it, you are a "no business, born-insecure, Joke-Javed Motha-f *** a! "(7/10)
