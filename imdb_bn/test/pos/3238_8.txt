I just checked out Abner's Abbey from the local library, and there was not much expectation. Imagine my dream of this Gothic behavior! Northanger Abbey is one of the most eerie places that you have ever seen, with secret passageways and a full decorative room full of secret mysteries. It does not always reveal the glory of the film: your imagination is running free, with the imagination of the main character, the dialogue m. She is the wild fantastic girl, a reader of Gothic imagination, in which she (and us) is in the real world. <br /> <br /> If I want to use a word to describe this nice movie, then it is very dear. The dream is woven throughout the movie, the mood increase. Sometimes, what is true and what is not difficult to say; This is deliberate, I believe. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is supreme. You will not expect this song for Jane Austen's film: hunting, flute and drum-based, high and awesome hunting with an undercut. If the soft, happy tune is played in Northjorn Abbey, it will be positively invited. Now, it's foreboding, a serious and stark-walled palace of crabs. (But the characters! You have to see them for yourself! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
