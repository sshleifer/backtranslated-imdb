Just saw this movie and it's not bad; There are a few moments of moment and long dialog string. Comes off as fairly intelligent; Faster like 'documentary style'. This film will develop some nostalgia and cold war paranoia with cars, street scenes and life in the 50's. Acting is fairly difficult and it goes by 85 minutes at a good pace. A nuclear-era film buff should not miss this one.
