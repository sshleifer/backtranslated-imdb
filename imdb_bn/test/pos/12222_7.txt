This DVD set was a full-fledged fullscreen 15-episode run of a television show "Surface" created by Universal in 2006. Full bonus time with some bonus features (deleted scenes, cast interviews, special effects) for 10 hours and 34 minutes. It produces comparatively higher budget shows and most quality budget designs and special effects on the screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 10+ hours will be for a long time and usually happen with such stuff, the overall quality will stop in the next episode. I found the first 7 episodes (discs 1 and 2) extremely compelling and a frustrating residual. "Surface" was created, written and directed by Josh and Jones Jute; And it seems they were surprised by the series success and failed to merge the next good enough components because they came to meet the order for extra episodes. Later, there were additional writers for episodes, because the characters (the weakest part of the series already had) lacked compatibility with acting in their initial episodes. The series was canceled and although the final phase provides the conclusion, there are still many things hanging. <br /> <br /> It is basically a science fiction story about genetically engineered dragon; A television blend combination of "Jurassic Park" and "ET". As a crew-less navy began as a puzzle as discovered in the sea by sea, boaters on a Texas lake are sucked into the cyclone, a lighthouse in Africa was destroyed by a huge monster etc. And as long as the thing keeps this vague tension and mystery a fair amount. Three American families, one on each coast and a human component was introduced on the Gulf of Mexico. Laura Dutter (Lake Bell) is a California marine biologist who discovered a strange creature originating from an undersea temperature beneath the ocean. Rich Konleley (J. F. Ferguson) is drowning with her younger brother when the same creature threw away his brother (not seen again). <br /> <br /> Miles Bennett (Carter Jenkins) is a Wilmington teen who finds some weird eggs in the ocean floating. He hatches in a home where it is an "ET" type dragon. He will spend the remainder of the series trying to hide his strange pets from his family and from the local authorities. These dragons may seem like fungus, but they fire the electromagnetic pulses, empties the electricity ocean, empties the fish sea, and finds warm water like a powdered water of the rusty rabbit. They are sure that they are uncertain whether they are an intelligent, outsider, or a ruthless generation. Once you start doubting their original doubts it all gets very tired and expected. <br /> <br /> J. J. Ferguson (a great acting actor of David Hasselhoff's tradition) originally plays Richard Dreyfas's character from "Mortgage Encounters of Third Kind", so you know that a good actor and a good director can be an attractive character. You must hate this character with each episode. Unfortunately, in the three parallel story lines, Ferguson and Bell (a low budget version of Sandra Bullock) soon collapsed as soon as the two lines collapsed and the staff were associated with a series of almost unlikely inconsistent events as "Jason Bourne". Gets yourself Hope you need to halt the plot hole and such a show (that may even be part of fun), but their adventures are simply completely impossible, they are completely and completely annoying. There are three series episodes that combine Ferguson and Bell with a plunge, which you will be interested in for the excitement of the Acuraillial Conference throughout the day. <br /> <br /> Junkins (Miles) is the most powerful member of Cast and many times inter-cut with annoying Ferguson-Bell staff is enough to bother you with parts with his pet dragon (Nimrod). And these segments benefit from the presence of the gorgeous Liton Messer (recent "Gossip Girl" fame) like her sister Savannah. Apparently the producers show their importance to their "teenage son" target audience and the positive thing they did with the next episode of the series is that introduction of Linges Godre (Kaitlyn) as the "first love" interest for Miles. So by reducing Saavanah's screen time, Catalina gradually stepped step-by-step step-by-step step-by-step step-by-step step-by-step gradually. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Young actors <br /> <br /> Do you know again? I'm just a child.
