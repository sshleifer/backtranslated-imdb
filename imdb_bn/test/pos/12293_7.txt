I agree with "Janlewies", who said that there are a lot of things going on in the film lines. Although I think the passage of this movie can be improved, I think the complexity of the relationships between the letters is interesting <br /> <br /> Example: <br /> <br /> She is going to Pierre to marry her cousin, though her love is cousin for her? <br /> <br /> Instead of the head of Pierre and his ... ... strange relationship <br /> <br /> Peer, Lucy, and Thiebault seem to have a triangular relationship, and the real points of the triangle are not very sure < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Isabella, who is she ?? <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it's my time. An interesting picture, and that wants me to read Melville.
