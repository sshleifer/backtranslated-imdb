This movie was incredible !!!! I did not know the story behind her so I needed to publish it before the DVD. It was many twists and turns but still kept the story fresh and exciting. Yale Cassidy's performance was in a word called Brilliant and Sally Hawkins. The storyline is rich with current ideas, from current to fresh ideas. <br /> <br /> "There is really something about Miss Marcus's eyes that gives a sign". This film is a 'Winner Bar' and a refreshing form of how we look at that society. A very careful watch.
