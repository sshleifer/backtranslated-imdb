Here in Germany "Queen's King" has a big religious status! Almost every teen (and adult) watch this sitcom. It's really awesome !! Better than other terrific American sitcoms like "House House" or "Step by Step" (only series, which are still OK, "Al Bunndi"). It was as effective as this funny show who was not such an Amercian sitcom in Europe !! Kevin James and Leh Remini as Doug and Carrie Hafaranan I know the most wonderful couple, Jerry Steele as Arthur I know the most fun "grandfather" and Victor Williams and (especially) Deacon and Spence as Patan Oswalt is the most different, but funny guys I know. I see it as soon as possible, and I'm still not enough, good humor!
