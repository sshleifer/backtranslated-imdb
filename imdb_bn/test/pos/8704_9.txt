I saw SubJoxy when I was ten years old, only when I got hits for Michael Watson and Laura Tate, in the earlier part of the film, they had some great on-screen chemistry. I ordered a copy from the full moon in 1993 and I learned it: There is a big role in the screenplay with the laws of servants and the fasting, King. Most people do not know that there was an alternate sequence in the last stage that was supposed to: Michelle and Stephen entered into a room and hold the idea of ​​making him a vampire to help in the battle of Radu near Michelle Stefan. His demonic controlled former friends. However, for some reason or other that scenario the camera did not make it. Another scene from the script, which can be confirmed from the original trailer, is that Stephen receives blood from a wolf, or in fact, in the trailer you bring him blood on his chin. This movie gets 9 because it is one of my childhood memories and memories associated with my characters; Although my favorite character of Stefan and Michelle, I think Anders Hove's rudo is an intelligent emotional act of his own feelings, so much so much in his work.
