Double Shock is one of the best Colombo episodes that reach a good film level. <br /> <br /> It contains all the elements that we like in the Colombo episodes. When Colombo makes some painful, we get smiles, and it happens once more than double shock. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The last is natural, how we got stories about the solution to the mystery of the Columbus. <br /> <br /> This is another good Colombo-episode, and I'll rate it 7/10. It's near 8/10. <br /> <br /> "Just another question" - Acting? Peter Fox is very good as usual.
