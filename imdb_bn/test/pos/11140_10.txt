I am awed by actress Bobby Phillips and his fantastic skills as a starring actor! This movie is driven by its wonderful acting and awesome action skills. I am a fan of science fiction, but I must say that the film has exceeded the maximum science fiction film in its cinematography, and in most cases it uses an actress whose appearance is fine but it is not new. Although the picture seems to have been made for television, but in my opinion it is better than most of the theaters to release movies.
