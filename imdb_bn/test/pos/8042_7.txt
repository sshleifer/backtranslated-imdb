This is certainly a quality movie with a classy cast. Carlos Jacalal's films spit upon them as far as Bruce Willis's bloody arrangement hits 'The Jackal''s weak efforts. I was surprised that this film did not attract more votes, a 'sleeping' is obviously something. A merciful reason this film is definitely worth a watch. It is tricky and sometimes dull. See it, 7/10
