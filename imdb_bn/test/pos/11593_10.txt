This small, quiet, harmonious film becomes an excellent writing about human dignity. It is cleverly defined, meaningful little details and filled with important side plots. It tells the story of a humanity with humankind, which promotes life without political choice, but underlines the choice of valuable rights (not obligations) and the right to customs. It enjoys various landscapes (mental and physical) and language (important details). The actor, especially the incredible Javier Bardem, has played each. You have forgotten this fiction that there is such a force in attendance on his screen. The movie has an amazing rhythm, it is nicely shot and uncommonly directed. With understanding, humor and heart, it takes real talent to film it in a solid theme. Five out of six stars.
