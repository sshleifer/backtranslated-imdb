Shahrukh Khan says, "I love you, KK-Kiran ..." before going to the scene suddenly and frightening at the same time, from the beginning to the end. This movie has made her famous and I completely recommend it: D It is very entertaining, music's mischievous and you will laugh along with Shah Rukh here ... You are really afraid of heroes and heroes and you will be curiously identified with you at least one of the characters. You are sad and happy and relieved and afraid at the same time. Check out this classic Bollywood movie with your best friend and some nice food and have a daydream. And after watching the movie, your songs and visible scenes will continue in your mind ... forever.
