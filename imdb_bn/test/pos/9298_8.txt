Let's face it, Australian TV is terrible in most cases, but it is a real diamond that is not seen by rough people. Chatters crew who are doing satirical newspapers and CNNN, they try new comers, pre-recorded skits and political satire on a show, presented in front of live viewers, like Roov, but mixed with funny. They love creating controversy and because some shows are the most fun moments, especially Chris Christmas Television and Julian asked a novelty test signed by Saddam Hussein to "off-off" to the head of AWB. From the Micallef program it will be the most fun amateur show.
