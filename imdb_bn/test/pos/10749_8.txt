This production was pretty amazed for me. I like the obscure love of the 30th film, but I was not ready for the last 25 minutes of this story. If, by no chance, you are not believing in the first half, hang there for the last. Of course, as pure racist you must look at racist racism. An interesting visit experience, but I think that the CAT PAW is still not available on video / DVD. See your PBS list!
