I like this movie. The romantic story of women is not for the line, but for the imagination of people's strength, frustration and release. This film must see a must. Recreation! Mental! Impressive! All the characters are very well written and are portrayed by some very talented actors. This story is a story of self-discovery and sexual awakening. A journey of mind, body and spirit. You find yourself characterized with characters and even some points of story. <br /> <br /> I would recommend that I first recommend watching the movie, then read the book. If you read the book first you will be a little disappointed. The screenplay adapted to cut a lot and some things changed. Something for something good and something bad
