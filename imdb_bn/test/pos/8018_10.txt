"The Jackal" [Excellent "rebuilding of the day of Jackal"] is a great [and a boat budget], this film has passed the real personality of "Carlos" ... <br /> <br /> To hide in the secret of Queen's legend and Swireland Will overthrows the naval officer to make Jackal impersonate and turns himself into such a way. His family, his career and his beliefs risk everything, although he did completely unwittingly. <br /> <br /> To hide more ... it's a nice movie. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 Nero ~ stars [4]
