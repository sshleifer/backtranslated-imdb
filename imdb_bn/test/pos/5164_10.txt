You can not review the latest movie by Swedish filmmaker Roy Anderson, The Living is not easy to review. One of the reasons is that, in his own words, he broke the Anglo-Saxon tradition of storytelling, which is primarily the template for Western film productions. Another reason may be that although Ray Anderson is somewhat heavier on the symbols, however, Andrei Tarkovsky is more different, than the more confusing nature. It took him about 3 years to finish this 86-minute long film, and it was not that he was forced to have a long break in the beat due to problems of financial problems or actors. The film has 57 Vintats, which is often shot by the camera, and it is a careful design of each scene, which is required many times. The film is closely related to the director of the film's earlier film songs, which is very important for the story, thus, this story is called a great degree by the surroundings of the environment and the environment where the characters of the universe of undersea live and interaction. Before each shot was finally shot, there were no less than 10 test shoots, including different actors, colors, dialogues etc. The result is a dream version of the world around us which most of us can recognize and do not dream about setting if I dream? Like the intellectuals of Binyai's intellect, when someone says "I had a dream last night", you can see it. But again, what is understood here as reality is not much different from the dream. <br /> <br /> Despite the lack of a plot in this traditional sense of the film and there is no main character, different characters that appear in different characters and reappear still meet each other and their stories are inevitable disconnected. Although most of these characters are close to common people, their unitary loneliness Trailer Trash Chain Smoking and Drinking Beer Drinking Women who dream of having a motorbike so that she can be her gentle and mostly silent boyfriend from "all these cravings" and her weak and visually mild, rather a member of the missing mind. The brass band whose skills are improving the efforts at home is not favorable reception to their families or their neighbors, frustrated Middle East hair itching and its arrogant customer, "a very important business meeting", an elderly man is having a nightmare about sky bombers, a young girl The young rock star dreams of marrying that she loves à¦¼ so crazy. It is about the reality of dreams and nightmares, but it works as a statement on behalf of the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein's claim "because of all human communication corruption". People talk to each other but they talk each other past. They tried to reach out to others but stopped others while trying to reach them. <br /> <br /> You are a poetic film set in Living Stockholm, but it is universally applicable. The society that it represents is Sweden, its artistic language, and the people displayed are usually Nordic. Yet, the matter related to mankind's woes in the selfish world has reached far more than this hemisphere. Despite the seriousness of its theme, the film can make herself feel more fun and laughing. But the director himself said, "Everyone living in our lives is so complicated that our only thing that protects us is our humor". Therefore, this film is a frustrating comedy or a comedy tragedy, which depends on your sensitivity and is not a toxic black reality tour of human nature. It's unusual in language and structure, but if you can think and enjoy it outside of the box, of course you must find both of these movies both leisurely and meaningful at the same time. This year's ear festival was shown as part of the Un Sarten Reeded program, which provides "original and different jobs" outside the competition. After showing the film in Salal DeSUSUSi, it gives a constant encouragement to 1000 strong listeners for a few minutes. Tell me more?
