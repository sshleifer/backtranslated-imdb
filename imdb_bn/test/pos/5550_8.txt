Treading water is a very nice movie. I'll keep it straight under the wonderful small film: Fiona McKenzie's Kosa Bella. It is not just coming out but also about tolerance and acceptance in general. I look forward to seeing more work from Laurel Himel in the future. Actors, Angie Redman and Nina Landy are pretty good. The relationships of the main character may be somewhat strenuous as we realize that they have a very strong tie, but it can probably be interpreted a bit. I'm surprised that Angely Redman does not appear much in other movies. The first big step as director of Laurel Himel, I'm sure his skills are more visible.
