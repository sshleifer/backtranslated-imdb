Just eight years after the end of the film, the violent death of Fernando Ramos da Silva only links to the strong message of Director BAbenco. This film has been divided into two categories - a reformatory where the first violated law enforcement and guardians have been violated and violated. The second backdrop is a city that is changed by its own actions and morals, which embrace, thrive and kill various letters of their life. <br /> <br /> Various sex and sexual roles in the film allow them to change the character as interaction with other people for constant change. Especially interesting is the body of the body of reddish, a transvestite who is a mother and some child lover. His response to Suleyi arrival, a prostitute both mad and sad. <br /> <br /> There is no happy ending in this story and I agreed to see it with caution because in the beginning of twenty minutes there is some uncomfortable scene. But while watching it, it is important to remember that this is not just a legendary story. Actors are not trained professionals but instead selected boys in the streets of Sao Paulo. They have actually portrayed this life which is illustrated in the screen and clearly in the case of Deal Silva, the police have been portrayed so ruthlessly. A documentary? A piece of fantasy. This is both the outline, but it certainly creates a heart twist element and it is a film that actually breathes you and thinks long after looking at it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
