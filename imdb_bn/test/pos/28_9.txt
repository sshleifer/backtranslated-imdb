A fantastic movie experience. I really enjoyed seeing this really fantastic movie at the theater while coming out. There is nothing to add, except it is a terrible shame that Sir Albert Finney is still not accepted by AMPAS (American Academy). Tom Jones, Marder on the Orient Express, Arm the Volcano (for only a few nominations - for which he was nominated for the Oscars), The Dreser reasonably brighten his heart, even though ... <br /> <br /> I know, the Oscars are only Popular competition, but British actors and actresses ("And Oscar" Jeremy Irons, Daniel Day-Lewis, Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson, Glenda Jackson etc. The Americans - and they all deserve the reward!), Why they always leave Sir Fini with empty hands? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you have seen two of the Darwan's leads, then do not forget the acting industry. See this picture and enjoy! I recommend it to everyone who loves art. <br /> <br /> I can give 9/10 for this excellent movie (1 point is missing for non-cinematical material, after all it is only a theater) <br /> Note: I am more than IMDB The criteria are more powerful (10 only the best compositions of the movie that can last forever).
