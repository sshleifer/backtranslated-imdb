As an adventure mini series, it is almost as well as it gets. I saw it as it was originally shown in HBO. His role as Sigrid Philadelphia was completely credible, and the whole production was the first rate! If you can see it all 400 minutes. I highly recommend this mini series Amazing that I can not rate it officially, but for readers / users I'll let you know it's a hard 10!
