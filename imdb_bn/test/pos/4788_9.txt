I saw this at the age of twelve. This is a movie that made me realize that there was really a great mystery. I could read the whole Happy Holist children's mystery series and they often had a family of children who had found their child. But we did not have a position to solve their mystery with the readers. This movie showed me that a great mystery that ends the audience / reader, finally says, "Oh !!!!! Course of !!!!!!!"
