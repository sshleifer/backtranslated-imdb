I have absolutely say this movie is absolutely amazing. I do not understand why I got so little ratings It has romance, music, dark and vampire. Stewart Townsend also did great work at Lestat, the act was great. Also, usually I sometimes do that music, not good. But in this film, the music is perfectly fit. If you like dark movies about vampires, it's definitely for you or even if you do not have a love story for it, but what I can say is one word: amazing! My rating is defiantly: 10. 10 out of 10, I seriously recommend you see it. It did not seem to have seen it for a few years, I have seen it again almost a year ago and have been addicted again. Hah hah Awesome movie !!!
