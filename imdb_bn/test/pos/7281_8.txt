This is a very dark movie, somewhat better than average asylum film. It was a lot better than I wanted, a combination of a mental thriller and a horror film. <br /> <br /> The voice on the telephone is really vague - this voice without any mouth, this unknown and threatening voice works really well in movies, since we never see that the killer left the viewer's imagination. <br /> <br / > After the first half of the film, the verb and mystery never gets eroded, it becomes vertical; There is not much of this picture, the story is good enough to serve and the director works well to keep your attention. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 8/10 because some clich√©s.
