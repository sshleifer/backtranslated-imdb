United States movie like this: You take a sleep on a long hot Sunday afternoon. It seems great to close your eyes and remove your anxiety. Soon you have lost in a deep, profound dream where you know that you are dreaming but you can not wake up - not what you want to do. You go with the flow, and soon you've completed a kind of strange Alice in Wonderland story that you do not think you are dreaming about. They're all kind of crazy stuff about war and peace when you are through a trip past and even in the future. <br /> <br /> The dream begins to be heavy and you think it's going to be a way that you can not control. Maybe you want to wake up so that you try to open your eyes but you can not. Now destruction and sadness and confusion and horrible voices tell you whether it can be true or false. You see the pictures that flicker and change and then it becomes clear, but do you want to see what your brain is making? <br /> <br /> Finally you have lost in a mythical world and you have realized that the end has come. End of the world and dream ends. It's over Do you wake up What do you do next? <br /> <br /> Maybe you write that dream because you do not know dreams very often - and when they give you good attention. <br /> <br /> Or you might cut a beer and forget the whole thing. Bad idea do not forget.
