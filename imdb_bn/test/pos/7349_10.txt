Viva La Bala shows that I had no height before any expectation, and even when I saw it, I never knew until my friend saw this. I was thinking that Jacques was quite funny but Stunt was just that, funny and I did not really get into the show. When I first saw Viva La Left, it was completely opposite effect, I like it. It seems to have had a more TV show, which today has many of the "reality shows". I was hooked and wanted to see what new projects I'm going to cook for each episode. It was my interest in all the ways of the past episode, and although some ideas seemed to occasionally, it always had a new and fun turn. Viva La Left is one of those shows that scares you, and I still did not see another show like this one.
