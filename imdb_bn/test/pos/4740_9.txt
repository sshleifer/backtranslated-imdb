There are many documentaries that have seen the law on the wrong side of the fence - Thein Blue Line and Paradise Lost comes first and foremost in mind. But I saw this first movie that I am sitting in anger. From the evidence presented in this film, it seems clearly to me that what happened in Waqo was very rarely an irrelevant and vicious mess in the FBI and AFI, and the incident of a very bad murder. Like most people, when I was blocking the waqoos, I used to think that David Quaresh was a totally evil madman who was leading a violent religion. After watching this, I think that the quotes are more likely than a little helpless and confused people who draw the attention of the US government through its peculiar activities. Of course, the branch had plenty of weapons in the Davidsian compound. But it was not illegal. It was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video footage of people inside the compound, all of them seem very nice and harmless. And to see the vile testimony of the government officials on the Voco site, the stupid testimony of Janet Reno and the defendant's defense committee, and some Democrats of the Committee's leadership forces. New York correspondent and New York Senator New York's Charles Shomer was the most permanent place in mind. When I was in NY State, I voted for this person - I am a democrat, very leftist. After seeing his activities in this committee, I hope I can go back to time and instead vote for D'Amato! Anyone interested in far away from the government, this is a very important movie, must be seen. I think I should even show up in class - it's that important.
