I think this is one of the best Tamil movies. I love that a man and a girl do not wander around in love and they made the movie brighter. Cast has done a great job and I especially litte congratulate the girl. She is bright and really bringing out the feelings of an adopted child looking her true mother. All the best songs, beautiful music and moving songs. There are some great songs in this step! Especially 'Kannathil Muttittal' and 'Velai Pukal' Great songs, both of them I highly recommend this movie to those who want to enjoy the tears and some great acting (and superb songs!). Cheers Simran
