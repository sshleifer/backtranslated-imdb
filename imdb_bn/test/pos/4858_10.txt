Essential Message - Miller's intention was after Miller's trial of the war crimes trials - on the basis of logic, some people's hated is the loss of life. Mitt Lough's character Fred has known Lawrence for many years, and during his time when it came to the comments of his strong supporters, he allowed them to attack a person who is not part of their "goal" group. For me, this is an important message - Lawrence and his wife do not mind what to do this moment - they have the opportunity to identify themselves, and save themselves by using the reason. Fred's union has blinded the lip with animal aggression and anger. <br /> <br /> A friend of mine advises me to show "WOW" how unreasonable hatred and evil ideology can take people without their realization. Once I conducted a test in a game that played a role and saw how people, under normal and level leadership, welcomed the formation of an oppressive police state - which would threaten them all - because it had gone to the stage. <Br /> <br /> Fred begins, his friend and friend of the preacher is a catalyst, pushing his neighbors towards the edge of the edge, preventing them from thinking that they are doing wrong. <br /> <br /> In the relationship between Lawrence and Finklestein, the Jewish shopkeeper is an impressive reason, Lawrence almost missed the point: If the points force Finkelstein, where will he go? If his family escapes from the Nazis, then "freedom" can be tortured again in the country. <br /> <br /> The big poster (this is a fairly prominent part of the promotion) that enjoys the highest standard of American families, living in the world is a very important detail. When you watch this movie, look for the subway train graph and all the small posters. This message is hidden too. <br /> <br /> This movie should be on every school curriculum, especially in our time when baseless hatred is widely publicized by "reasonable" people who are extremists in thin incognito.
