This is considered to be one of the greatest entertaining shortest shorts ever, and I certainly would not argue with that. Even in a country where the leading animated shorts are made regularly, this film still runs stand out. If you ever get the chance to watch this movie, please do it. It's only ten minutes long, and then it's a man who is covered with shirts, a woman who vacuums the bathtub and nuclear war. Do you want more of a film?
