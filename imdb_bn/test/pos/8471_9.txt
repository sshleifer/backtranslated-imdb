When I say "ray" was fantastic then i'm not saying something new I would like to mention something that is going forward for praising this movie, which will separate it from other movies. Very rarely a film made by the actor (s). "Ray" was quite simply made by Jamie Fox. Without the wonderful performance of Jamie Fox, "judgment" will be just another interesting and informative biopic. I always used to think Fox as funny, starting with his "In Linen" color and "The Jummy Fox Show" from his days, and I knew that he was talented because he used his show ("jamie fox show") his musical instruments Display talent But I did not imagine that he could stop such a role. I do not know much about acting and going to something else like him and what they're going to do, but what I saw from Jamie Fox was very impressive. He binded himself to that role and showed Ray Charles to Ray Charles without an actor acting. The story of "Ray" was great, but the life of Jamie Fox was given.
