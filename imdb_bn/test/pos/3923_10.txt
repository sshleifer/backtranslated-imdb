I recently saw the house of Mymensingh and of course I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> If this is not the best and most entertaining, it's been one of the better horror / thriller films in the last few years. <Br> <br /> I've heard many people say so-called slowly and about the development of character, which takes time to open 45 minutes of movies. <br /> <br /> If the picture drowns directly into death, the audience and critics would criticize the film because they could not have any suitable characters, because they could not take less care. <br /> <br /> As for the development of characters, I think it did a great job well. <br /> <br /> Receives my own responses and others (read messages off the message board), many people lose their character to survive, among which I mentioned Edwards (Paris Hilton). Consider considering Warner. Brothers is marketing his death, he was surprised that many listeners glad him for his survival. <br /> <br /> Back death / death scenes are not saying, they were some of the most inventive and suspicious. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, and I expect him to have more than 25 minutes of screen time in a 120 minute film, behind him the scene was created and I believe when Paris will see the scene that is afraid (see the scene where she is hiding Vincent's car and she goes behind her ... the appearance of terror on her face becomes very real)<br /> <br /> Overall, I'm the Biggest House of Max, for entertainment and mystery, and even Gore ...... I just want to criticize that while selling the film, they will not release the dead list and who will die and Who will survive, as well as it's ten times better to know whether the character that is being played will survive or die and cause horrible deaths. <br /> <br /> You can not wait for the DVD, but when you see it in the movie, it will not be the same in your own front room, but if you wait for the DVD then watch the film in the dark without any interruption, trust me That you will not be disappointed.
