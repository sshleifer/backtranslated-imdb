Keeping it "I'm pretty sure" and "completely annoying", it's one of the most sweet and lively romances portrayed in the film. Dibor: Foreman (now she's where?) Julie and Ricci as Nicholas Cage as Romeo and Juliet, Tony and Maria, Jack and Samtha as classic ... you can not help but fall in love with them Plus soundtracks - plimsouls, sparks, furs, flirts, and of course, modern English - also outstanding. For film fans about young love, I would recommend the latest film David Gordon Green equally to all the real girls.
