The plot of "In Measure For For Love" is simple enough: married men and married women (though not each other) gradually develop romantic attachments with each other. The motion of the film is gradually becoming very slow and worth little in two. Nevertheless, in the early 1960s, Hong Kong's retreat and director Wang Kar-wai have been keenly interested in the beauty and beauty of the beauty of the film. Actor Tony Leeung and Maggie Cheng are both excellent and Wang Kar-Y has done a great deal of past feeling and nostalgia (most films and directors try to do something but usually lose). There are so many small details that adaptation of the film (a trademark of the director) and color and film imagery, which, in the top of the movie's achievements, would otherwise send this simple story. 9/10
