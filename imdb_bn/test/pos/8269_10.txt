This amazing BBC mini series reviews reminded me of how much I enjoyed when it was broadcast many years ago. At that time I waited for waiting for the next wedding and read in love with John Bove and Jeanette Macteier, these two talented actors that we do not see enough in TV or movies. <br /> <br /> I have tried without any success to achieve fantastic plays from the BBC's past, all the amazingly untrained stories, including 1973 edition of Zane Eyre and Green Gabell, which is sad that there is no desire to publish a BBC video or a DVD . If someone learns otherwise, then I would love to hear from them. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, we must make ourselves amazed by our own memories.
