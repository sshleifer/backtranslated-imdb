The stories of Tom Garner are said to be open with his grand financier and through a series of elegant flashbacks narrated by Henry's faithful lifetime friend. Henry and his wife have argued that Tom was a great man and a talent or helpless helpless. The picture is beautifully written, played and directed, and I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Tom was an incredible and successful owner of the huge railway, his manager and his authority over competition, terrorism of his employees, killer strikers. Tom's aspiring wife Sally was responsible for Tom's success. When he met her, she was illiterate and her work as a trackwalker for the railway was completely involved. While going to Tally School, Sally teaches her to read and accept the trackwalker's work. He began to rise to one step at one stage through the domination of the railway until he was finally elected to the post of President. <br /> <br /> Tom is a business tycoon, and his marriage with Sally gradually gets broken. His disgraced boy hates him, and he goes to take on the consequences of a predictive catastrophe, many little ladies (the true creator Eve). In his business life, Tom is a total success; In his personal life, a crushing failure. Spencer Tressie is awesome in Tom Garner's role and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Both of them have multi-generation stories beautiful age.
