Well, certainly the critics hate it. This is not a movie that is going on for big criticism. But it's really good. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you like Kris Farley's physical comedy brand, or David Speed's dry wit, you're not going to like it. But for the rest of us, the movie is very cheerful, and for that matter quotation, sequence and plot is not half as "black fox". The parts that are meant to be ridiculous are really good, not what you expect from such a movie, and the acting is really good. <br /> <br /> The question without "Tommy Boy" is Chris Farley's best movie. I suggest giving it a and you give it a view.
