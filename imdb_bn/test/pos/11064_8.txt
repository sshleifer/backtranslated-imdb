I must admit that I have a bias about my vote in this film, but I have strong reason because I know here some true history that was given to Hollywood treatments here. Eden Ferber's novel based on it, in the era where real names can not be used. In a way, all the smoke and mirrors in this film. Although it was released in 1946, it was very soon depicted after Casablanca. Eggreat Bergman played her most brilliantly in this movie. <br /> <br /> She plays a beautiful woman, who is trying to gain a rich husband for her beauty. Today, the gold digger, but in this social era, he is a favorite and a woman who likes all men, and all the old graduate society speaks to him and avoids him while avoiding him. Ingrid plays this role in its best and best. <br /> <br /> In the New Orleans section of this movie, some sympathy is raised for the character of the Ingridas, because she directs her relatives to get a decent besieged tomb for her motherland to release her. Orlin's The relatives of relatives have become so scary that they will ask for anything to leave her. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper is good in this film, although he already seems to be a little too old to play Dashing Texans Bachelor / Jubala. He considered considering the disorder in which he appeared in the elder than he was due to smoking his real life chain. Flora Robson, like Girl Ingrid, is nominated for an Oscar for actress in this movie. As a creed, Jerry Austin looked in many ways in many ways for his role, but the film's only humorous relief and it works well. <br /> <br /> When the picture goes to the event, it accurately describes how important Saratoga is in that era. When I walk towards Bergman Saratogou Spring, drink it a bit of "sulfur" water, which makes everyone feel so healthy. When he drinks something he does not let himself be confused and commentes how good he is and how much he has to be. <br /> <br /> The real history is the railway war that actually happened in the tunnel in New York's rail line - which is derived from the actual title of the truth trunk. In 1862 Andrew Karnagy and J. P. This war took place among the mortars agents. Line 1869 was the economic key to the coal country and the country connecting the eastern coast. It's very real throughout reference film. There are some dialogues called Carnegie "Scott" which are unclear and unfamiliar to know about the history of war. <br /> <br /> Railway line tunnel and tunnel tunnel, New York (ZIP code 13848) Although this image was shot in California, it still exists. The original tunnel is about 1 mile long. It is still part of a key freight line, after several years. I grew up there. When the line of Gary Cooper is walking around the tunnel train, its right line is fine, it is still a "strong country".
