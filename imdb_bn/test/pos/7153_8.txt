They are always happy to see the characters of a movie that are completely heartwarming and well-established, even when they are not surrounded by them. In the middle of the movie, the uninterrupted proof of conservative, religious Franklin family (mother, father, teenage son and daughter) is involved in the accident, including the experience of parents and brothers in which they meet Jesus, a joyful but somewhat frustrating spirit from them 'original Sin 'removed from the burden. When they return to their lives, most of their opinions and views change, many for the girl's shortcomings, who did not share the experience. The religious aspect, I think, represents a good balance from the good (Jesus) to the horrible (his 'followers' who are covered with sins of others and completely unconscious for themselves). This is a movie that gives you some good smiles on the way, and you think it might be a better place than the world.
