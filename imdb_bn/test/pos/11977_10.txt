I have no doubt about this movie that I have seen throughout my life. Throwing star stars is a wonderful bonus, and an add bonus just on deep stories and glorious choreography. The movie is an ancient love affair that folds into the modern world. The two lovers in heaven are incurred and cursed by the wrath of a great sage. Later, the woman was born on earth again. While he was in college, he was raped and suicidal. The rest of the film focuses primarily on the victims of rape, who possesses high quality and skills in different languages ​​by her boyfriend. The Sona Corporation offers a very mature and deep performance in this film, and all other actors often work well. Radioactive scenes with Akshay Kumar should not be missed, and should not be missed. You just have to watch this movie !!!
