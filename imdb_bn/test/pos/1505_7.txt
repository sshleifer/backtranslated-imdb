Lucio Floris was the most profitable Italian director at the time of his death in 1996, yet his career had long been among the descending spirals of increasingly disagreeable series, which may have stood very little in the shadow of his earlier work. In the mid-80s, she unveiled the horrific horror scans of "Living Dead City", "Bound," and the Stylistically Horrifying Horror Cats, like the brutal Geo "The New York Ripper". Yourself And in the era of Phulchi's fall as a film maker, "Bit In The Brain", when it is a sudden, dark hilarious headtrack, it is clearly evident that the work is framing (framing, impact, and acting), interesting, open-ended meditation on pop psychology And the ability to reduce the sensitivity of the movie. Do not make any mistake: "Bit In The Brain" is offset by total gorgets and previous films of Fulgari, but it is worth getting credited to try something else. In a tasty tongue-in-cheek touch, Phulasi has played herself: A director in the middle of filming is yet another violent horror hit with the opposite / killer hallucinations; After visiting a shrinkage, who puts him under hypnosis, his dreams and reality begin to get completely disconnected, where the audience can not understand the two. The latest DVD release of Greenhouse Releases has referred to the "cat" as the heir to pronounce like "eraserhead" and it carries the same uncomfortable, curiously fun quality associated with the best guest industry.
