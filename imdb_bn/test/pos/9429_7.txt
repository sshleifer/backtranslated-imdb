In the stories of Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce's modern Sherlock Holmes, Sherlock Holmes and Secrets Vipon are not one of the top films - although it's entertaining. I think the problem seems to be delayed by the fact that most of the "dilemma" of Professor Hauses and his Nemeses Marriette (played by Lionel Atoll) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Three hot films in Rathban In the coming of Sharkak Holmess, he starred in George Zuko, who received the real taste of the love of Vileylani for his own interest in the role. Zucko's performance as Professor for my money was the best of three (Comemedia has a brief moment of his performance, when he eventually became incognito as "Sergeant of Police" - as he is preparing to sing "Police Lot" from Gilbert and Sullivan ). Later, Mr. Atul's performance came here - furthermore. Then finally Daniel's intellectual Mrs. Maria Serrak Holmes and the woman in Grenada, it is usually a cool, enthusiastic performance by Mr. Daniel, but her conflict with Homs seems to be a tiring sister for her, they keep her from fulfilling the main plan. A generosity that will survive as long as there is a danger. However, due to intellectual tennis matches between him and Rothbon, Rathbo (His autobiography) really thought Daniel was the best of the film. <br /> <br /> Daniel Tired Oxford Dawn (Professor was a well-known mathematician, The volume of the denominational theory was "European enjoyment" and was written by the book of america the dynamics). As a progressive businessman, Dr. After all, he sold his service in Nazi Germany (apparently). It never went away, but somebody thinks (before the Nazi era began to fall), he replied that they would win the war. Secondly, he is not a fool. W. Tobel (William Post Junior) When Marriard's gang showed incidents of close physical collapse due to torture, Professor Tobey has decided to kidnap other assistants who help him, because he is a good scientist. Tobel and bomb sites will be able to put together. I obviously could not see Zacco clearly making such a smart decision, and if Daniel had to do this, he would feel annoyed for another delay in his plans. <br /> <br />, Professor in all the articles in the Holes series. If you read Homes stories, Mauritius appeared as a villain thrice: The last story of Sherlock Holmes ("The End of the Last Problem"), the first story of Sherlock Holmes ("Arrival EMPTY House") and four novels / novellas last (the fear of the Valley). It is so amazing that the professor came out of such a low presence, how wonderful it is (he mentioned in two or three stories as well). But due to his fate in the "last problem" and "The Impact House" Rikenhach, we always see him in his death. Junko falls off Tower Hill's White Tower. Daniel tried to flee from Gregson and the police (with more imagination), but he was shot by a jump, and the injured people failed to hold a adjoining building wall. Atwill (here it is not seen, but listening) seems to fall down on a trap door he is planting a shattered tunnel). It is really tiring shortly after the professor always read these movies. Gene Weilder Comedi (Lady Comedy), Sherlock Holmess's Smarter Brother, where Leo McCracken is an amazingly horrific and dangerous mortuary (completely, finally with Irish accent), who has not died in the end, but the rest of the mulling - in a rowboat - his How does the careful scheme work? I prefer that rather good. <br /> <br /> Using the "Dancing Men" code here, using "Devil's Foot Root" as a DRESSED TO KILL, snaps a mystery piece from a short story. "Dancing Man of the Apparers of Sharkak Holmes of Return" and Hollus has a relationship with a client, whose wife received strange, bloody messages in this code. Charles Hamim advised Kanan Dowell's aviculture in his voice that Sir Arthur chose a code from a magazine game in the 1870s, but we do not really know. The code is basically one of the replacement of characters for dancing men's figures. The story of the short story is dramatic, but the police with a triangle. The only innovation in the film is that Tobel Hollus and Mariah make a few changes that confuse both. <br /> <br /> The movie will be entertained, but I am still afraid of the house room, Scarlet Cloud, and the Sherk Holes Fasdi Death are good movies.
