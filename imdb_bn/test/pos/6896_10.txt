This movie was very funny with very little fun. It is almost two tombs robbers who are doing business as normal when they discover that they can serve a different client. These change the direction of the bodies they have collected. Both of them told the movie that during the childhood, he explained the business of a priest before sending his head down. His companion has already been beheaded. The priest needs to take the last confession and it takes shape of a story. Some animations are cast, which gives it a tile from the crypt. In the story, we meet another group of other terrorists, but at one stage, two people are given a small job to execute the death penalty, so that some of these groups calm the hatred. When a woman joins two men, she crosses her borders and gets them in trouble with the terrible grave robbers. This story leads to two groups' meetings, which arrests the person who acknowledges and arrests the person who has already lost his head.
