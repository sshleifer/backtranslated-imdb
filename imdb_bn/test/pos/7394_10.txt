Some say this movie is a guilty pleasure. I like this flashlight but I do not feel guilty about it. You can tell the whole movie and crew was fun making this movie. But Jack Frost 2 will not work well with some people. From the beginning, you can say that this movie will be Chasey and it will certainly be an amateur look. Well, if you get the privilege to watch this movie, remember that Jack Frost 2: Mutant killer Snowden's revenge is a joy, or a guilty pleasure. Now, because I can not fill ten lines of some great scenes: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> The first was a jack in a tree, in which the isicles were dropped in one. She kept missing so she left a brutal on her. The next female icicles fell on a bed. The last page was spotted in the eyes. <br /> <br /> Another great place where two-storey stoners hanging around the frozen pole. One of them gets stuck on their tongue (of course). Jack Frost "Dude in Geo-Tongue!" At the time of saying, he stopped his tongue. Well, you have to see it for yourself. <br /> <br /> And of course, snowball kids kicked ass. <br /> <br /> ** The last spinner ** <br /> <br /> <br /> Infinite stars
