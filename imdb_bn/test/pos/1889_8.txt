I like this kind of movie, and still growing love. Crate the huge plot of the big budget movie and crate them and do not accept them. This film is always taken and you create something that can sit back and enjoy. <br /> <br /> There were previously some movie students who complained that this is not a list item. But it does not matter. The point of this movie is that nobody likes the CGI clich√© fill movie. There are many people who love movies that are simply entertaining you, and they can not make as much money as they can. Also, it's better that Ol 'Bruce does not know yet dead yet.
