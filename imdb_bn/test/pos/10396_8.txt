If you know the topic, it's a special movie. Antoniani, his eight hundred years, was kidnapped by a stroke. For the silent and half-paralyzed, his friends - who were best for the best film in the world - arranged a last direct film 'direct' for him. The idea is that he can only mock a story by watching it. So we have a movie: a director who congratulated the story through simple observation. And how about the story of four (four) stories that define love of visual fantasy? <br /> <br /> This film is grown by providing our tools to bring it through our own imagination. The result is pure film-world: Every person (without the director) is lovely in the outlook or movement. Some of these women are ultralovely, and they encounter sensual encounters in a dreamy ugly world. There is no intelligence, there is no indication that there is anything but what we see; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, he understands something about not touching. None like Van Morrison could understand. Morrison's Celtic Space Music is based on the same concept: Sex touch refers to but does not touch physically. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Assessment of Ted - 3's 3: Viewable.
