I saw it last night and it was cool. I can see why some people feel the feeling of feelings towards it from the perspective of the Rugby fan and Maori culture, but there is no such conjecture about it from any other. The movie is great. It has a lot of heart. Very inspirational and enthusiastic of all ages. Great family movie! They did a fantastic good job considering that they were in a budget movie. I love movies based on true stories / events. I have always been raised around Ragbi in my life, it is a great game but I have never brought it (because if I hurt someone, please forgive me, I personally have not seen anything) I thought, it is not like training them cruel or harsh Players are not disciplined and do not seem to be as serious as other players, and it seems like it's only Esi and facing each other on. But after seeing it forever, I was good, wow! I was proud! It did something good for Rugby (well it changed my scene of rugby) and New Zealnd Haka. I actually cried. I'm even new zealander and I was proud of their culture. Until this movie did not even know what the moon meant. The film is not about rugby tactics or rugby, it is not about New Zealand all blacks or hookahs ... pearl mom !!!!! Haha shooks! <br /> <br /> So everyone's pretty negative PPL, you're missing points! I was sure that if they had money, it would have been better, because the hakat was there because it is part of the Highland Rugby culture, tradition or what you want it to say. <br /> <br /> So if any new members of this site yourself, please do not close those negative comments. See it for yourself! To see the movie! You can learn a lot from this movie, PPL of all ages. It definitely wants you to be a good person and wants to be humble! This movie reminds me a lot, which I knew and raised, but I was lost on the road! Love! Happy reading Ppls and all the best! <br /> <br /> Muawha!
