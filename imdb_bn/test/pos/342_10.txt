I am a great follower of Indian films, especially in Malayalam and Tamil. <br /> <br /> India is involved in sending this image as an official Oscar entry. I have seen this movie and it has clearly shown to me that the Tamil film clearly expresses through its story and well-connected story with Balloud. We are all in the West, Tamil film is more quality and different from Bollywood, which looks good on glamor and promotion. <br /> <br /> What was India thinking when India was sent to Oscars like 'Devdas'? That was really a Masochist move. I think the Oskar judges are judging the Oscars trial while sending Devdas, who dropped Logan last year. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I will keep away from it . However, a movie like Kanthel Muthital is not being sent to see how much reform should be done for the Indian administration, who should be protected from their intelligent poor administrators. Now I know why there are so many problems in this country. They are not very talented but properly displayed.
