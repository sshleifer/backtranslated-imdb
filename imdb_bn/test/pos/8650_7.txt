The whole movie reminds me of Dante's first infantry, where the ghosts believe that they are 'fools' and they are happy. They do not realize that they are actually a hell, but nothing is enjoyable, they leave without any emotion. In this sense, Dante thought that he was in bad part because he would not actively try to change his situation. The place where no one will die, but it is hard to try. I'm not sure whether the author relies on his story based on this medieval manuscript, but the look is absolutely interesting <br /> <br /> I did not enjoy the movie when I was watching it because I hope Climax has never come. Still, it seems to me later and now I actually think that this is a good film - it must be sticks.
