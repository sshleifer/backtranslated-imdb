One of the best! As a supporter of the civil war, I was very happy in the first installment of the North and South Quarter. Patrick Swayze and extraordinary performances, as well as James Reid and Leslie Ann Down. This incredible story is never released at any time forgotten, love, emotions, sorrow, shame, resemblance and cruelty come in. I was in the eighth grade when I first started this series. Being a small boy, you will not be interested in this civil war soap. To be honest, this story stole the heart of everyone in my class, and it is only the first book. I bought the novel and loved and studied the difference and it was great. I have now 17 years and still remember the stories, characters, topics, and civil wars. As a future film director I will always enjoy the North and the South: book one.
