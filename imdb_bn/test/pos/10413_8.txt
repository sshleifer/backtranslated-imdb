This is one of the best half-hour horror / mystery / fantasy shows of eighteen years without any doubt. The program was a little competent with each single episode and it was as far away as the production price (as set), but it has been removed, I have to give some credit for frustration with the plots. I was quite strong enough to plot every episode, even I, a harsh horror movie, Shock-Film, and 70's grind-house buff got a little sick and found out. Great show, just great, regardless of what other critics have here to say. My favorite episode was known as "Bug House", yes, I think the title was? Since it gives me some time to think about it today, it is almost 20 years after the first premiere. Other programs such as "The Darks to Tales", "The Outreach Limits" and (of course) "The Twilight Zone" were obviously good production prices, but in my opinion they did not have much of the plot line to go. When compared to this sick little show! It's definitely the way of the more graphic culture the classic phenomenon that was, "The Tales from Crypt".
