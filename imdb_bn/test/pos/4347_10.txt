Charles Branson returned to his most famous role. In my opinion, this series and the best movie till my favorite movie. The film does not take itself seriously, because filmmakers knew that all necessary social commentaries were included in the first film. Golan and Globus Brosnan have created this film for fans, not for critics, and it works. The DW3 has been rightly criticized as "trash" and "a fatigue entry in a crowded series". These statements would be true for taking the film seriously or spreading the statement, but it was not. If you take it as it, DW3 is just a fun, action packed romp, we can do whatever we want with Charlie to punks on the street. The action is non-stop, the atmosphere is superb, and the film is the best out of Branson Flick and out of all time. You can say that Pany Peach's Canon Group gave it a lot of money. It is believed that Branson thought this photo was very violent, and that is why the winner did not manage any of the following entries. I understand his concern, but in the ever growing case, you have to put more leaflets further to pass the previous entry. In any case, this film was not more violent than a movie made at this time. The best series of DW3 and my favorite movie is always the best (not the best, just my favorite), it's Charlie's presence, the memorable villain and the ability to jump in the bandwagon of viewers. The first film can be made most technically well, but this one is the most fun. For one time, Charlie is actually some clever line (though he does not say much) and half of interesting stories, photography, action, and direction to bring him back. Charlie has not been more intense or super cooler than this one. Yes, it is exploitative, perhaps it promotes stereotypes, and it is probably the same story as before, but the movies of Branson always remain and will always stand in favor of saving the common people and giving viewers what they want to see. Many argue that the DW series manipulates its audience, my answer is, the movies that do not help us, fans are charged. We demand that Brunson's scum fly away, and instead supply the winner and the Co. And remember some things that still want you to do it down. The Americas # 1 movie in America was the # 1 movie, and it was among the favorites of watching millions of people on video and television because they realized that all the movies that are not epic are just fun. ********** / 10 You can not get any better.
