This special title is very interesting. The whole movie was like watching a ninja RPG, which is really cool. Three magical swords, three clans, a terrifying demon, a political power, Yotoden have it all. The animation is beautiful, but a little stained, the story is a top notch, and the real cool in the battle scene. One thing that really looks good in this movie is the monsters. They are superb pretty fantastic. One you see yotoden, like blood rule and nada scrolls.
