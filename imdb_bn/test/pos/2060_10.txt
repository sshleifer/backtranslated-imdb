I am extremely sorry for some people who review this movie. It is clear that their values ​​are so much that they will never be able to enjoy a film for the occasion. Or, perhaps, their leopard film is derived from acting to tear; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Certainly, the plot has a hole which is big enough to run half, but none of them is enough to stop the film flow. I'm not like a big geneous Davis fan ever, but I was very impressed with how he was able to create two different characters, Samtha Kain and Charlie Baltimore. In my opinion, it was not necessary to change his physical appearance to differentiate between the two ... his performance was much more than doing this technique. <br /> <br /> In addition to anything else, this picture was of Craig Bierko. In the hands of others, Timothy's character can be another interchangeable villain. His decision to play him with a more casual approach to him was all just the counterpoint of the action scene. Often no actor is found to be able to express himself with the expression of his face ... Case: Scenes in the freezer with Charlie and his daughter. Where most of the movies surrounded the moment of "revelation" with unnecessary dialogue, Birkera's eyes told the whole story. <br /> <br /> The basic plot? Thin, be truthful. An apparently average housewife who suffers from retention has gradually discovered she has been a killer. As his memory goes back, so the killer does not want those dead. Is she really Samantha, baking a cookie housewife, or Charlie, a cold blooded killer? Or both a little bit? For me, The Long Kiss Goodnight was to find an enjoyable journey.
