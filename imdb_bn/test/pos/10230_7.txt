I've enjoyed this picture. Looking at these mutants along with the voice of the film, the way is very good. Plus, David Craneberg Philippe Great like Decker! It is true that his personality is the same in real life (except for murder). If I were animated with the creation of this film, then this movie probably had fewer budgets, mutants / animals / monsters looked great since the 1990s. This is certainly not a unique movie and shit. This lets me read it based novel. This is an interesting movie because it shows how humans can be monsters and "monsters" are one with humanity.
