Again, I have read all the comments posted here and agree with many intelligent people, but with complete disagreement with those who think it right. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think the atom is just power left to us, our government (feds and state) will use photo cells on their roof until the homeowners grasp the increase. A lot of interesting and valuable home designs have been made in Southern Califillier and it is designed to take advantage of clean energy around the sun. I live in a loft, which is open all day sunlight on its roof. I rarely use AC - I'm sure it will use a lot of electricity to convert the heat to a temperature of around 5 degrees Celsius.

I did not score too much. It was very interesting to have a real life view of the back of the TV industry - it's no wonder. Currently, Dan Rudder sues CBS, and I hope he wins. Do you believe Donald Tram "he is a damn"? Does the trump care? "Tiberius 1234" posted a very good comment here - I agree. It is in my opinion that "nuclear" spreading is better than living in a world that has been destroyed and becomes "blade runner" and / or "solvent green". Stay away from your video-game for a few hours and see this "dated" movie), and get a little education on nuclear energy. I recommend the whole family ....
