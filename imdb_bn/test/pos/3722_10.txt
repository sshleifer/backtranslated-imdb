I'm the longest fan of Luke's work, and as long as I know his name, I also searched for this movie. I've been trying to find this movie across California for four years. This past summer I have had a tour in Europe, at least for this trip my mission was to watch this movie. Short story short, I bought it and saw it in France! I fly, it has fully traveled me and finally I feel that I saw the first thing in Luke Besan. Absolutely amazing character development, very thought provoking, great acting and extreme idea movies. This is one of the most original and classic one if you are an idea movie fan. I think it is a rare treatment to watch a movie that seems to be risky, it's incompatible, and finally it's just unique. If you are a los absent fan, of course it must be seen, whether or not your bean fan, it is certainly an important work, overall contributing to the immortal film industry.
