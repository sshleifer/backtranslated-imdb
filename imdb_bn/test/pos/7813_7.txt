I found it an underlying, quietly spammate Western (also known as Dead or Alibhai). Despite the submissive credentials (except for multi-purpose co-authors / producer Albert Bond, the only significant crew member composer Carlo Rustileley), the film has definitely benefited from the presence of three American stars (the new arrival Alex Cord is a vicious opposition protagonist, when senior man Arthur Kennedy And Robert Ryan lent a mythical quality in the proceedings N) Along with the unusual plot (a helpless hero, an Amnesty Ruze, which covers the city's strategic cleanliness, and a gun shooter against a group of Mexican bandits until the end of the law). <br /> <br /> There are many hard steps in hand ?? The movie is captured by an awesome climax where stars are surrounded inside a burning cabin? Plus there are some overwhelming moments that some of the Spaghetti Western trademark: from the street, the cord sees the hidden gunman in a window shown on the whiskey bottle; A man that helps escape the cord is repeatedly submerged in a pool of oil by villains. Nicletta Machiavellio has made a great impression with the card lodge as a village girl; Supporter cast, then, is known (if the maximum anonymous) is peppered with the face ?? All of them are mainly jeans fixtures. <br /> <br /> I was not aware that the English version of the film was cut in MGM / UA's R1 DVD: I was fooled by the wrong running time, the back cover was listed; The film was not 99 minutes long 118? Clearly, the character of the cord dies in the longer version of the Italian!
