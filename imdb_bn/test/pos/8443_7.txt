I watched this movie a few years later, so forget about most details. However, I liked it at that time and saw the plat to rush firmly, the final heart was closed. In 1979, I literally recalled the end of my seat in the theater. <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda hit a crash at the local nuclear power plant in Campbell, a reporter of Los Angeles in Camberley. He wants to go to the public through the story, with the help of his Hippie Cameraman (Michael Douglas) who has photographed this picture, but a cruel conspiracy has tried to cover it all. Jack Lemon's role in the middle manager's contradictory nuclear plant is absolutely amazing; it is 'doing the right thing' by reporting loyalty to his company and deadly situation. The expression of its face here's the volume to say. <br /> <br /> In addition to traumatic plot and riveting tension, this film is about Jack Lemmon, his character, and his wonderful acting performance. Jane Fonda (I was then a great fan of him), I suspect that he only proceeded against him to take nuclear industry from anti-war protests. <br /> <br /> This movie is a nuclear scare technique. Despite Chernobyl and the three-mile island (they're a variety of reactors), our Canadian CANDU reactor is safe and well-respected around the world. I will not hesitate to live near an hour at a nuclear power station, where my friend works as a very capable engineer. Apparently they are irregardless of financial losses, closed for every teen problem. I sincerely suspect that there are no conspiracies afoot. No moderators or highly trained operators can imagine that they want to take any type of malware or risk ... Of course, there is no cost or effort to moral duty to build facilities here or to ensure its ongoing security. <br /> <br /> If we want our western lifestyle, we have to get our strength somewhere. Those who claim nuclear power can not be made completely safe (of course), they probably have to be volunteers as a coal mine or else they will have to return to the electricity and horses in the garden. <br /> <br /> Enjoy all these ways, this entertaining and highly mysterious movie, which is based on a real story (shortened?). It's a real killer, a thriller, and perhaps (?) Even a killer, but please, do not get your attitude about the operation and safety of nuclear energy plants from it.
