I did not see the original "House of Max", so I do not know what I can expect when I went to the preview of the new movie. At the beginning of the presentation of our young characters, "House of Max" changes the gears and it becomes a very dangerous terrible pedestrian. <br /> <br /> This plot does not give much importance here - I think most people know that these helpless kids meet with a nasty killer and look at this that wax is going to find some terrible things in the home of Titel. It's about special effects here, and they are top notch. Viewers who like their horror movies with lots of blood will be pleased here, but there are other disgusting effects. Production designs and sets are excellent, and Cast makes most of their underlying writing. <br /> <br /> Of course, Paris Hilton's performance is so frustrating. To be honest, Hilton has published herself quite well, and she does not portray herself as herself, as many people are predicting. His character is sexy and sweet, and I think he will change the opinion of many people about his good work. Elisha Cuthbert's previous movie, The Girl Next Door. His character has entered through many, and Cubbert proved to be a skilled heroine. Chad Michael Murray, like Hilton and Cuthbert, is very nice, but unfortunately this group is not very believable as a "bad boy". <br /> <br /> I predict good things for "House of Max". As an audience for screening, I appeared in Holland, screamed and found many parts of the movie. Cast and congratulate the crew for doing a good job. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Paris Hilton for proving a lot of people wrong. She always says - "It's hot."
