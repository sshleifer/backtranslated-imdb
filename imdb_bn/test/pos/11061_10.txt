I first saw the movie when I was in elementary school, in the 1960's. I was impressed by acting in the role of Ingrid Bergman and it was my role in the New Quarter of New Orleans. The first part of the film returned to revenge his father's wife and daughter (his mother was disgraced). This time he beat Wonderful Clean, played by Gary Cooper, met. Chemistry between the two is great. The second half of the movie does not enjoy it as a set of titles, titles (headlines) and New Orleans, but it is still very good. I divided this movie into ten parts - partly without nostalgia, but in most cases it's just a valve film, and Bergman and Cooper as well as the characters are equally surprising (near to stealing the photos of Flora Robson Bergman). It is shown gradually on TV but it is rarely seen - it is best to choose one of the classic movie stations and to insert them into their programming cycles.
