I felt this film has many good qualities. Cinematography certainly publishes the set and story stage outlook. The original character as the actor was certainly a feat and I felt mostly played quite firmly, of course they are playing themselves, but definitely unique. Because of familiarity with Chinese and Oriental culture, cultural aspects can become very frustrating, such as parental / child relations and any drug abuse that will be used to answer many questions about the stigma. I think the story of Zia Hongseen is interesting. In a note below, this story is in Beijing and there are some fashion and music rikes at the beginning of the 90's, although it was created in 2001, it is sometimes cheggy (Beatles scraps etc). Whatever it is, the top ten or not, but if it is on television, check it out.
