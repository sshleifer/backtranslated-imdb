Residents are known for their strange presence and the strange musical stylings of a cat, so perhaps their music video is not going to be just normal. Actually, these small videos are unusual and bizarre, but they have a huge artistic value. Built with atmosphere, light and thoughtful visuals. This is a great observer experience. <br /> <br /> Originally, Aikki Flicks has many resident music videos for her song only. The music starts from rock-rich music, which sounds straight from the horror of 80's. Do not change the value of this video. They are great <br /> <br /> Any fan of art will love them. They are so original with their visuals and they are illustrated in the corner, and the lighting makes them so attractive. Music is obscure and attractive and extremely original and these short films are mini-classics which are more than capable of observation. This is the closest perfect collection of short videos. <br /> <br /> My rating is: **** **** Outside. 56 minutes
