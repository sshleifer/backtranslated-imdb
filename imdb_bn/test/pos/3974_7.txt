(Synopsis) High School Senior Graduates Bachelor "B" Gaines (Justin Long) finds himself without a college presenting himself. He was able to get out of the problems he faced and get out of his way, but he was not able to choose the path of passing the college admission board of eight colleges. His mother and father were very disappointed that the buyers were not accepted in college. Her parents think that if she does not go to college, she will not have a future. Most landowners have applied for the same college that is applied by them. To satisfy their parents, ideas for starting their own college with internet sites come up. They transformed into a derelict psychological facility in the South Haramen Institute of Technology. They will be the only student. However, the web site says that we accept someone. The first day at school, they were unexpectedly rejected by a large number of students who are all acceptable college. With one million dollars of apprenticeship money, frauds will have to effect its counterfeit college. He appointed Uncle Ben (Luis Black) as the college dean. The fun begins when they design their own curriculum, make their own rules and party all night. <br /> <br /> (my comment) The basic foundation of starting college without teaching staff is a little away from the wall. Since it was a fake college, the landlords did not really need an employee. The film reminds me of the classic movie "Anime House", college setting, Brotherhood, lots of gags and beautiful young people. There was a different idea about what the new college's newborns had about college experience. There is not enough laughter in the film, it has a good message of life. People can not make the passion for what they want to do in their dreams and what they want to do in life, and other people can not decide what they want to do. The last one was a bit absurd, but it's just a movie. The movie was made to have a little fun for young people. (Universal photo, Run time 1:32, rated PG-13) (7/10)
