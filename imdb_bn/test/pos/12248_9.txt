I do not like "good as it gets", but I'm a big fan of William Hart and Holly Hunter, so I decided to watch this movie. And the most amazing thing for me was Albert Brooks' fantastic work. Here, in Spain, he is a little familiar, and only as the second division version of Woody Allen in the West Coast. He played a great part, but Hunter and Heart were also very good, especially the urt, played a relatively unusual role for him. Hunter played a role that reminded me of his part in "Once Near" (Las Halstream, 1991) in Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> Finally, the rest of the Cast is also awesome. One of the familiar faces of the American film is Robert Pasky, former bond girl Lois Chiles, this role is quite beautiful, I think, in its first years, always the perfect Joan Cusack; And especially Jack Nicholson's brief appearance. It probably does not have any good scenes, but Jack Nicholson, anyway, however ... James L. Brooks's best movie, Great Story (Best Solution), and Best Picture of the 80's Best Movie
