Yes, there is probably some part of this film that requires a little bit of suspension, but it is not far from the attraction and wonder of the movie. It was shown as part of our city youth festival festival and was a favorite of the organization committee. Which is not surprising. The matter - racially organized, is coming together, although the apartheid South Africa is very relevant and the theme is inspirational. Of course, the film has errors as a reference to the previous comment, but the reality of the setting and how the director behaves on his subject, these errors are false. I saw this with my wife and we came back with the children in the same evening. Watching a film, meditation, discussing and working on.
