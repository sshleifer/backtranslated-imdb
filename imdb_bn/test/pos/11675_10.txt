<br /> <br /> First of all, I reviewed this document because it was my interest, L. pandas. <br /> <br /> I heard that song and I like that song and I too. Read the small genes created in the early 80's and did not get so easily in Finland. <br /> <br /> So if you do not like this kind of music, why do you write it here? I like this kind of music, it speaks to my soul, thus, I know pans from Europe and America, why do you comment on this song as "unexpected"? <br /> <br /> <br />
