Despite myself, I really like this movie. Pauli Shore is always sunny, and there is no exception here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Perhaps this is why it is easier for him to jump from a person. <br /> <br /> In this movie, like the lively sunshine and Shore's "City Boy" way about the country's life, the crawl is incredibly different. The way of life, funny, but he is not only a fish who is out of water; Comedy also comes from the truth, that no "ordinary" person or man, a freakish nightmare of a person in a crawl. This movie works so greatly: We love crawls, they breathe fresh air, but we can also sympathize with the warnings. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is classic pauli shore, although there is no brain power to enjoy the movie, enjoy it and even a "never judge by the cover of the book" somewhere Ethical type. Not bad, not bad at all.
