Just got to see Monster Man yesterday. It waits for a long time and after a lot of expectation and build up, I'm glad to say that it came and filled my expectations at every level. Actually, you can not expect too much to hear the plot rundown, but I was happy after reading some reviews for it. I mean, what trash fan does not want to see a big flick about the fragile intestinal hic that is pushing people down with their make-up giant trucks? I hope the cross between the road trip and the mountains have eyes and much more. This was actually a horror comedy that's a job. The filmmaker has got it right when it makes you ridiculous and at the same time laughing To make Max Davis out with Gore and push the crazy with sick humor. Let me list some reasons for this movie so much love: the first closed story. It has been completed the death of many other flicks. A college guy gets the air that is married to her childhood crush. He was a 25-year-old virgin, decided to travel to the streets of West Vista cruiser and to decide on the road trip, hoping he would head over the hill and all those good gyms. Hidden behind her station wagon, good friend Harley. Discuss like Harley Laudmouth, a former friend, who like Jack Black in the sunny and high fidelity. You can not help but be like a man, but if he was your friend in real life, keep a whifle ball in his hands (keep smiling, but have you ever been hurt?) By checking him. So, he says little from the unexpected side, at least say, but you can say that he is a trusted friend, deep down ... however, they are on the road and when they stop at a bar, they make the locals grow more. Now they are being stalked by a leatherface clone of a giant truck. That's it. Yes, they are the way to pick a fantastic hitchhiker but I go to the very lazy and hungover that right now ... so just watch the extraordinary movie. <br /> <br /> The second love was humor. The cinema was one of the most ill smiles after the cave fan. Just how messed up it are? Well, I will not go to the whole cat scene and as the "body burrito" thing, I'll leave it with your virgin eyes as well. The full bar of Amputees was a bit annoying and people that look like John Turturro bothered me. Harley, although a completely overwhelming frat-boy type, can really sling off a liners. Love the clogs by the way. I need a new pair <br /> <br /> <br /> GORE. This one poured it heavily. The first hour plays as a demented road comedy, all about the last third blood and hat. If the film could not keep such a mild voice, it would have been a bit annoying, but seeing how it was played to be sunny, there is no way that you would get annoyed at it. If you are still at your seat while coming, perhaps you will see humor in it, but seriously, there were buckets and buckets of red stuff. There was a big plot that I was not coming and did not see when the credit was rolled, I was completely satisfied. I got what I got and I'm really happy that I bought it. Lots of cabin faware, it's going to get many replays. <br /> <br /> The look of the film was outstanding. This was deliberately inexpensive appearance that the whole thing shouted at the end of the 80's and I liked the color very much. It is clear that Manchester man was done in a relatively low budget, but like the cabin fire (sorry I'm comparing the two) it actually works for the movie. There was a swap of the greatness of cabin fauve 70, it was 80's answer. So it's that worth to take that. No CGI here This is what we all need to do I'm not sure why it did not get a theatrical release because all this should be done by Zipper crepepers. Thank God for the lion gate.
