I love FahrerSmith of Sarah Waters, and was concerned about TV adaptation because I was disappointed by the BBC Edition Tipping Velvet (although it was nice to see Kelly Haus was not able to be able to sing, and Rachel Sterling was not able to work). FingerSmith is a very tightly designed novel that breathes and breathes, and I'm surprised if it's just been done within 3 hours. <br /> <br /> I do not need to worry. The adaptation was nice, very little cut, and went along with a cracking speed (although you did not read this book, but what would you miss?). This was the look and feel of a BBC classic costume drama and I was forced to remind myself that it is a contemporary book. <br /> <br /> Acting starring Sally Hawkins played her heart like Su-Tidder, and Yale Cassidy, Slow Burner, who was brighter like Moud Lillie at the end of the story. Love, emotions, betrayal, both works were written on their face. It was the pleasure of watching. <br /> <br /> I hope Rachel Steering is watching: thus you play the character of Sarah Waters!
