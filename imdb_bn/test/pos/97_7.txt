Well, I disagree with Leonard Maltin on this animated short. She loves it and claims it was pleasing. I enjoy it but do not see any ridiculous. He does not like hockey or does not know anything about it and still likes stories. From Canada to the border, I have watched hockey for 50 years in Buffalo and there .... but I do not think most of this cartoon. Oh, it was fun and I knew what would happen if you wore Toronto Jersey in the Cuban region - disaster! That's especially the glory of Les Canadians keeps years true. However, that's not funny stories. <br /> <br /> In 1950, everyone in Quebec province honored Montreal and their star player Maurice Richard, and everyone wanted to be like him. When her mother orders a new sweater, she has a sign of Toronto Maple lift, so the child does not want her to be caught dead. Finally when he finishes and continues to dive towards the local rink, then he is separated from the rest, his hockey friend. What's so funny? I see the same event happening with Boston kids, who died red Sox and his mother got Yankee shirt! Horror! You could not wear it, and on the contrary. <br /> <br /> Anyone who does not follow sports like Maltin, this situation seems strange to him and ridiculous ... but it is a true life or a bit of sports fans and his favorite team. This is a funny story, and completely trustworthy, but nothing that has allowed me to laugh. <br /> <br /> This art was fun to watch throughout life, watching the long series of crayon images made by almost gifted school kids. French Canadian accent was very good. This film was part of the DVD "Leonard Moulton's Animation favorite from the National Film Board of Canada.
