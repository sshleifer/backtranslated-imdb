I am a great fan of spying style and it is one of the best of these films. The assignment is based on the real story, which is a bit hug for the big screen and it brings you to a fun ride. This film is a great actor, whose name is Eden Quinn, Donald Switterland and Ben Kingsle. <br /> <br /> After being interviewed by the Navy Officer Queen Legend, she was unwittingly employed in Switcherland, who believes that queen could be the famous terrorist Carlos. Shingles. Because it is closely related to Queen Carlos, because Shereland does not stop for his appointment because Catherland is covered with terrorist capture or death. <br /> <br /> Training sequence is awesome. Quinn has been kept in the Kingsley and Satherland experiments, to prevent attacks from a remote controlled snowmobile, from eating the same food every day, to drown with hallucinogen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Quinn has to struggle with his personality with his new personality. Would he be cruel and free as Carlos, or will he again be good husband and father in his life? <br /> <br /> If you like spying, it must be seen. The action is used only to promote this thriller story; No gratuitous explosions or war scenes. Ratings 10 stars 10
