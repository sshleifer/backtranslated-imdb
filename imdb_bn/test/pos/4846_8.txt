Focus William H. Messi is another fantastic movie. I first discovered Messi in Fargo and I saw some of his films and he still did not cheat me. Macy archetypal is "nice guy with something hidden". At the focus, he played the role of Lawrence Newman, a loyal and hardworking man who captured his unfamiliar land in the house. The scene was established in the height of MacArtist after World War II. Chief of Newman Human Resource, who is mainly anti-semit for a company. After recruiting a woman from a Jewish descent, she was asked to buy a pair of glasses to improve her failing eyesight. Unbelievably, the simple task of buying glasses shows a great reaction on his life and Gertrude's heart, his wife (played by a great Laura Darn). Until the movie is unveiled, Newman will start looking at a completely different world, where the Jew is like a creature. <br /> <br /> This movie is disturbed that being racist was fairly normal. In some places of cool thought, maybe it still is.
