When it comes to political cinema, I usually feel empty. They usually accept some moral views and you have good versus bad story line as it is a Batman movie. <br /> <br /> But this is the first movie I have seen with Lumba that is seen in politics. What is this, and the real thing to try to rule the broken people, who do not know any other rules but violence There was no good or bad conflict between interests and interests only. In my opinion, this is the only political movie that anyone can learn it from the truth. In particular, looking at politics like this film shows you this film, you can not rule on what country you want, but what does the country want from you? <br /> <br /> Because of this, I disagree with a lot of things all seem to be bad, I think they are very idealistic, (Belgians want perfect colonies, Lumbuma wants perfect unity Congo wants, wants wealth and wealth, America Communists Against the perfect partner wants, Russia wants the perfect helper for the community) And Congo? They use and misuse them, (General Jancens is the best example in the movie when your black soldiers say your government is a liar and leave them all abusive) They are always forced to support this person or the other. <BR> <br /> This film shows in politics that a mistake can cost you money and this film makes every mistake wrong, until it grows and destroys the country. Their objectives may be good (or at least in the letter's opinion), but it is everybody's fault that leads to the fall of the Congo. I do not think anyone is bad in this movie, I think they want too much from the sick people and want to start taking. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is not only the best political movie, it is a great film. The performance is fantastic (as Iriu Ibuiyi was the perfect casting of Lumimba, I believe in him really), script error-free, perfect performance, and more of the production value than I expected for a Central African film. A clock is required.
