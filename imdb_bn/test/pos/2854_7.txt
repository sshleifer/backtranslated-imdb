Tiny spoilers follow, but nothing you've learned from reading behind the DVD. <br /> <br /> Held together by an excellent central performance from Renee Zellweger, the nurse Betty is still a dark comedy comedy goodly nature <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Instead of creating jokes about the mental condition of Betty, the author John C. Richards is very sympathetic, the prisoner portrays him as innocent, completely helpless, but not sadly weak even though not. Even then he is not really such a hunter and when he undoubtedly views the motives of his characters as one that can be understood with all its weaknesses - even Grew Beyond may be the object of his misleading content, yet he can be a true believer, shining, proud, but he is sure to believe <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's cinema It's just as old but it works pretty well here, even if it is unfortunate to turn back the tone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Zejorger has worked hard both Kenyan and Morgan Freeman and it is particularly fun to see Chris Rock Shock in his previous scene. <br /> <br /> As much as you can be cruel, not as cruel, and fairly intelligent nor nurse Betty - until the laugh riot - it's a solid entertainment much more by some elevated lead actress.
