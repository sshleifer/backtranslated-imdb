I live down from Georgetown to Hoi An, co ... I thought this movie was good and it's great! Feel like the story will make something even in real life, but there are always something that I remember most about the movie. For those of you who do not live in Denver ... Every Christmas, City of Dave, City of Town keeps an excellent display of illumination and decorations at the Civic Center in Denver. Well ... as it happened, during the filming of this movie, the scene of the birth was needed. So ... it was displayed in Civic Center ... with permission, with permission! Whoever forgot to give power advice, and was stolen! A resilient search started with law enforcement for a few days. Finally, someone talked and remembered for lending to Georgetown movie crew! It's back to where it came back and belonged! As it turns out ... it was not featured in all the movies in the movie ... You can see it during the Christmas show with children. Although it's made without a hassle ...
