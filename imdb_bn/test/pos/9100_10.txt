Everything in this movie can expect for a firm de fans. Imagine the partnership episode of director Liam Lynch "D". Of course you have to understand the humor and the layout of Tennesses D. When I saw it, it was not very funny from the audience but because there was no humorous or intriguing joke. This movie has been revealed to a vague crowd who did not know themselves around the musical instruments. This movie is true to its roots. Some of your people who watched the HBO TV series and heard the album did not forget what they loved their audience. People such as television have seen scenes from the tragedy of Jebie and KG apartments and of course open microforming that each Tennesses D phase starts and ends. The soundtrack is awesome and every song removes you away. <br /> <br /> ... and Dave Grohl plays an extraordinary devil. <br /> <br /> This is a good film for you. Hard time and a rocking musical.
