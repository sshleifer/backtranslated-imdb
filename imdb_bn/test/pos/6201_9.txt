After Season 2, I do not understand why this program can continue to run in Darwin and Farrick's line, probably Darwin could not turn UC agent into an infiltrator and could not refrain from them. Inside, but still they should at least give this show to another season. <br /> <br /> The show shows well-casted, credible, and Islamic religion from both normal and extremist perspectives. It touches controversial matters in detail and it has a dramatic meaning that can be said very short nowadays. I'm sorry that until late 2007 I did not know about this show.
