There is a bunch of movies that we say must be seen twice. In most cases this is basically a recommendation: you can understand the movie even after the first look, and for the second time it helps you to find the plot that does not just notice. However, for Mulholland, Dr. The sequence for me was: See it for the first time - Try to spend a day on the internet to see what it was - and then see it for a second time. Otherwise you probably will not be able to fully enjoy this movie. Then you will realize that this piece is impressive, the camera work is stunning, and the next weeks follow you. <br /> <br /> 9/10
