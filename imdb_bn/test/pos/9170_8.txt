I must admit that I love this picture much more than that. Smith has that clear-cut charm that you just can not help but. The plot was a minor trunk of the original romantic comedy staff, some of Zen Zen Austen's "Emma" memorable. This guy Kevin James has a real mood for comic timing and physical comedy. I have never seen a TV show, but he was very fond of it. Amber Valletta was good enough. I can not remember why he was a rich celebrity in this movie, but if he could be an actress or model, then there might be some desire for casting. I enjoyed Julie Ann Emery, and she was willing to have a bigger part. But, to save the best for the last time, Eva Mends's steal or a thief was stolen. Its beauty, and elegance, and the exact amount of studyfish I was in the screen when I was there. I hope to see more of her in the future. This film is definitely worth checking out.
