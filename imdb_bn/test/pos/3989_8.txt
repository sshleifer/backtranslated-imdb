I always like this movie, I've seen it many times but I've always enjoyed it :) The story is interesting and special. But agree that I should not agree with what I think Max was not a Roman monastery or what was: p They were not seen in Romania. However, back to the story, Gita Murrayan played well, but someone said before me, her English needs improvement. <br /> <br /> and there were some funny moments and some sad / sad parts too. It turns out worth, I thought it was huge that the giant wanted to find her love. I recommend you all It's never the best movie, but it was nice!
