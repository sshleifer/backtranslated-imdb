If you enjoy the riddles and mystery, you will enjoy this movie. To be honest, this is mostly part of Adrian Paul, which I could choose from, I did not know much about the movie before. Plot Hall: A student of philosophy and physics Sarah (Karley Pope), trying to find "Reasons" started playing a mysterious puzzle game and resolved the puzzles to get involved in "Games". Vern (Adrian Paul) owns a store, also receives a puzzle ritual, and also entangled the game. The idea is that if you solve the game, the meaning of the existence (referred to as "design") is revealed. Brandon Fehrer's character is "rural fool" type store, which is hanging around the shop, more than it seems. All in all, I had quite a good job in the movie. And it's definitely an original idea, find this rare one day! I personally happen like riddles and puns, so most of them were not very difficult, it was still a fun movie. The price of the fare is good. <br /> <br /> So, if you do not see it - get it! <br /> <br />
