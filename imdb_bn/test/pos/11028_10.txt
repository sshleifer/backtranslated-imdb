The other one is a "Must Have" film. Henry Brandon is a favorite! I learned many years ago that he was in Germany because he is listening and so generally American is watching! And was he not as great as the "Scearhers" main scar? !! Another of my favorites, I have it and watch it again and again. Now if I could add this one to my collection, it would make my day! This is a great wildlife story and film for all ages. Visible Scenes The plight of the beautiful and endangered snow leopards has been told with such great emotion that it will spark the interest of the endangered species among the children, especially the children. If I could have given a copy of all my Grand and Great Grand!
