Why would it take a perfectly good original drama based on the best novel and rebuild it as a pure musical instrument? And especially the lack of sing or dance talent throw it with the actors? Like some "shows" or two recent "Star Wars" movies, "Lost Harijana" is full of strange smiles. Sir John Gilgood may remember his Dali Lama party vaguely, the Republican Party ("family") under the supervision of an explanatory dance? <br /> <br /> Or Sally Kellerman is lovingly loving George Kennedy, impressing his best fans as he hops from one rock to another ("What are you doing every little thing")? And my choice, Bobby Van adds the power of America's education system ("Give me an answer")? I can not wait for the DVD release, hopefully it will be the comments of Lewy Woolman, who will finally explain what he thinks if he agrees to do this.
