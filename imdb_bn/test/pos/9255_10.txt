For all Homicide militants there, this movie was great! Every single character in the show has made a look in the movie. It helped to solve some (but not all) issues from the series. Unfortunately, if you do not actually watch the series, most of the enjoyment will be lost, because the movie is notably mentioned in every season of the show's existence. Perhaps it was a series of films to oppose a separate movie as finale, but we have to accept what we can get. I hope they will create more movies and coordinate homicide letters in the law and order.
