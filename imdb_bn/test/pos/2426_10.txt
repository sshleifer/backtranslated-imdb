After all, tell me this film is not for everyone. This is a very strange thing. A sprinter who lives alone and lives a boring, discovers a young man in a park across the street from his city house. He advised him to sit outside the rain and invite him to dry and warm. The man is not talking and the woman guesses that she is deaf silent. Yet, he was fascinated by her and showed sexual interest in her. He thinks him strange and continues his silence, although we later know that he is not silent and that he describes all that is happening to his sister. I will not leave the rest of the plot. If you can see this film. You can not take your eyes off it What makes it so attractive? Well, it's totally unique. I have never seen anything like this and together these two observers are very uncomfortable. Especially when you find out what this bland is, the annoying, emotional spinster capable of. You will not forget it soon.
