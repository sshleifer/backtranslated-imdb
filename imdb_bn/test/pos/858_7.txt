When I watched this movie, my first light was that Kelly Owerton was acting as a young (and an open and upcoming star) actress for the first time that I completely blown me off. She is amazing on the screen and I look forward to seeing what she really looks for in the future .... <br /> <br /> This movie feels good to herself that it stuffs Kelly Overton and lets take the weaver to travel ... Long ago I had the feeling that I saw it before. But a good experience :) I would recommend this movie ... if only I can see Kelly Overton .. At this stage the actor lifted the screen through the storm. I give this movie the 7th vote ... 5 performance performance and 2 for the rest movie . <br /> <br /> and in the last note .. sorry for my bad english .. if it's uncomfortable for you: please ask me please ...
