Deepa Mehta's "fire" is groundbreaking, brave, and artistic. A disciplined social commentary on the plight of conservative, high middle-class Indian families, this is a film that no one can miss. Shabana Ajmi and Nandita Das perform miracles by performing their characters as final as possible. A.R. Rahman's music plays genius and often plays the role of another character in the film. Using Mehta Rahman's scores and together, they create amazing sound moods that show up on Radhawa and Sita around to effectively support the world's perspective. This photo is not about homosexuality as branded. Lesbianism is only a part of the film. It is unfortunate that most people write the film and instead of giving it a chance it bans it and looks at its true meaning.
