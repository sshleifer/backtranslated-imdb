Wrathful writing and brilliant acting This extraordinary delightful and malicious plot-twister is one of the best American films I have seen this year. Nil Lab's Great Casting and Senior Direction This movie is becoming very sensitive, when Renee Gelveszer and Morgan Freeman's real performance give it a spirit. At the same time with a really wonderful end, violent, provocative and ridiculous. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnner's Aaron Eichhardt, Crispin Glover and Allison Janny give everyone tongue in proud behavior. The soap operas of soap operas from the soap, but better and more efficient. 10 out of 9
