Very beautiful movie I was browsing channels on my TV and I generally ignored the channels of Air Drama movies, but then I saw this channel which carried out old school movies and I saw this movie. Initially, when I saw the title "The Chuir", it seems to be annoying, but when I look at Brad Renfro in this film, I was alarmed (my greatest movie of all time is "Client" because Brad Brad is also big). Then the scene was getting better and better. The story is so beautiful and very touching! I cried hardly in this movie that I usually do not. Great casting! And there are so many beautiful lines / quotes in this movie which are very interesting and have made me cry! Now, I bought my copy in DVD and I always recommend it to everyone!
