It is frustrating if a film based on the life of a Japanese writer Yuko Mishima is not an impossible task. However, Paul Schrader is indeed Mishima that "pretty" made a film that is both fantastic and complex. Although it is not a literary biography, Shadar and his co-photographer Leonard Sherr (his brother) took various events from his life, including his successes and can be described as the best inexplicable tableaux, which is fantastic and stunning. Misima homosexuality is not nearly because of her legal threat to her widow, but still, the film is still awesome, and one of the best films I've ever seen in 1985. I should mention the important contribution of Phillip Glass to the score, which adds an extra piece of film, and is better than what he has done for Scorsese's Kundun. Jon Bailey's fine-colored painter and eco-ashiko's great production design and dress, who was wearing a memorable outfit for Dracula of Coppola, for which he received an Oscar. Hope this picture will soon be available in the DVD.
