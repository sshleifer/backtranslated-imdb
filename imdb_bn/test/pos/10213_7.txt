I saw this year ago, and it's not entertaining, but deep. The basic story is a young man who has dreamed of the media, although he is not sure where he is or even if it really exists. <br /> <br /> Follow the spores: Finally, it visits, it is transformed into a nightbride animal. Being bitten by another one. Then, he has to help other members of Knightbrid because they are being attacked by Canadians. (Save for pronunciation, they all work well like Ol 'boys, not compatible with Canadian mentality, am? Some "alternative" alternatives to "monster" or "knitbrid", "Jewish", and Canadian / "Nazis," And you are supposed to get the insights of the struggle by the monsters in front of people. + Well, <br /> <br /> One big objection was that the underground city was interesting, but rather it was Ramshekhal And afterwards There is a conventions for the movie with this underground settlement, and someone would think that if the monsters were good boys, then at least some of them would be decorated. <br /> <br /> The story is thin, but it introduces characters. It's fair enough for a repeat view.
