Many thanks to linear scientists about joining Dean Kongtu's novel as Zinni Simpson. If you have read the book, then I think that keep it as far as possible before you watch the movie. <br /> <br /> The boy met the dog, the dog was followed by super-intelligent public lab tests, dogs and boys with very intelligent and emotionally disturbed monsters created by the same lab, and, oh yes, I'm a giant follower follower Shady Government Agent Reference? Movie <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The giant effects are cheerfully cheesy, most of the conversations are ridiculous, the script is very sensible or credible - this is a good example of the absurd recognition of the dog's intelligence of the frozen character, as everyone fido is off for a computer keyboard or bar once and twice You can type messages repeatedly! Hmmm, it should be a puppy, right? Hyam's performance is passionate but sticky, she carries stupid dialogue with less efficiency in skills. Ironside has highlighted many bad movies, and it's no exception. He easily gave the movie best performance, although I was forced to add a dog (which is a beautiful sari himself!). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> stupid movie, and yet still. . . And yet I saw it three times in a week. And yet I can not help to like it. Hey, what can I say, I have a taste of junk - and Michael Iranside (I never knew Michael Iranside - I'm sure there is a law against it). But any movie that laughs me (yes, even unconsciously) can not be bad at all. It shines up to a guilty pleasure, a "yes I know it's a humiliating fool but I like it" film. <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to lose On the normal scale I compelled to give it a D-B, but on my own personal cheese scale, it gets bumped up to A-A. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know. I'm weird like that
