I'm so excited that the Greeks returned! This season looks really eventful. I'm happy that Casey is trying to get serious about school but still involves entities. It's really interesting that he wants to go to politics and they show their 'talent of planning'. I cut calvin's new hair! It makes him look more mature. They should shave Cappy's head as well. All guys are hot but Calvin is certainly the hottest! I can not wait to see him! I am particularly interested in what happens in Calvin, Adam, and Rosti! I love rebecca She is really beautiful I really think Rebecca and Calvin should hook up. Go for him, Calvin! Join my team!
