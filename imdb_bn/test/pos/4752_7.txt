This movie is not about Soda and it is not the most French connection. <br /> <br /> The seven ups are a group of elite policemen who use techniques that are not based on the NYPD protocol. Scheider Group heads with its fur or regular looking joes. They are monitoring a local Kastra nostra cartel and when the police finds a police cable they are scary. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Richard Lynch, the worst-looking man in the movie (Attack: America, Little Nikita) and his companion accidentally killed the police and escaped from the most fascinating Chase scene from Shaidar, Bullet And the French connection is not new to West Side George Washington and new to Plisides Parkway. Jersey <br /> <br /> Stunt drivers are awesome and Lynch frees it, though he is frightened from dangerous travel. Roy Skaidar was killed almost when his car hijacked his car's roof and went behind the Mac truck. <br /> <br /> Things turn around and the singles are seen to follow the sequence. Fast moving and intense, fresh for thirty years.
