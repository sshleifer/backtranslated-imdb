For all intents and purposes, 'Teen Devian' may seem like just another lightweight Bollywood musical. In some cases, it may even be true, especially the producers are certainly sure that the film has been successful with the public. But behind the scene Somasive Brahmam (the concept of this story) or Amerit (who had directed the film) decided that a normal form would have a cover and would probably succeed beyond his own expectations. <<br /> <br /> It's not just a handsome man who is flirting with 3 women, who must be chosen as the partner of his life. In fact, the character of Dev Anand was actually with three women being with love and with the other two being aware of him. Devyani and Kalpana with Dev Anand are particularly attractive - each woman is dependent on her. Based on the maturity of viewers, there are lots of teasers in the language of stars who lend themselves to fantasy. The theme is surprisingly adult and after that it has ended that the last day has ended, it is clearly designed to please the public and to reflect the criticism.
