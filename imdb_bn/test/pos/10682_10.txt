Gary Anderson's first live-action Facebook that benefits from incredible model FX work and a great Barry Gray music score through a big motion picture. Reel-to-reel analog computer, remote "2069" (I think Anderson really wanted a safe date after 100 years!) Looked like a guru-jacket fashion, but one could easily complain about the same violations in 2001, but as they turned some Some of the things can be predicted. This picture was springboard for the next year's series UFO, and in reality it was not the only FX man and producer, but most of the cast was regular on that show. <br /> <br /> It's always a "alternative history" more than the future - "Apollo-like" rocket is used in lift-off, it always seems to be another planet other than the Earth. Given the "alternative world" plot, someone would guess that they wanted the feeling. We are ending up with the last questions than the answers. Since every "movement of the other world" exists, because the incident and the thing are duplicated due to the happening in the world. The two versions of the same person (in this case Glen Ross, the astronauts) can never meet for the given reason and the Sun. A complete accident was discovered in the first place when it was probably concealed forever. <br /> <br /> Most of the FX work in England has been made in Portugal, it is a must for Gary Anderson fan. My picture has a DVD bone DVD out of print several years ago, but one hopes Universal will republish it, perhaps more and even Gary Anderson's commentary.
