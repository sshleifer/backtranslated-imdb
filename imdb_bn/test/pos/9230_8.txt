The bullets could not roam around his chest, but my other boyhood hero - the Lone Ranger, like Superman, was a symbol of me. He represents the American system of integrity, justice and classic TV western settings, living according to the principle that he will never use to kill his gun, while opting for his South Indian to carry out every single law of justice with his trusted Indian partner Tanto. The advent of television has given an appropriate opportunity for a post of war crime, it is a sophisticated masked person who stands for the protection of law and order, it offers extraordinary entertainment for five years in almost five years. <br /> <br /> আজ আমার প্রথমবার দেখার সুযোগ ছিল যে পুরো তিনটি অংশ মূল পর্বগুলি স্টাডিকের ধারাবাহিকতায় বাধা দেওয়ার জন্য স্ট্যান্ডার্ড খোলার এবং বন্ধ করার ক্রমগুলি ছাড়াই শেষ করতে শুরু করে। For the fans of Rangers, this is how all of the Western Sagas's elder father, Texas Ranger John Red Boy, survived the attack on the Savvy Gang, and how it can be said by telling how an Indian friend was given health care from his childhood. Tonto (Jay Silverwells) declares his partner to be a 'trustworthy scout' and his name is Chemo-Sabe. I have read the interpretation of the word chemo-sabe, but I am satisfied with the interpretation of Tonto. এটির মধ্যে খুব বেশি পড়া কেবল গল্প থেকে আটকে যায়, স্প্যানিশ থেকে 'টনটো' এর ইংরেজী অনুবাদের মতো, যা আমি প্রকাশ করব না, কারণ আপনি এটির সাহায্য করতে পারেন কিনা তা জানা ভালো নয়। <br /> <br /> How the first story created confusion in the disguise of making Lone Ranger mysteries, the ranger who died in box canyon attack caused this confusion. You never see the face of a lone ranger, because it is always lazy to conceal its identity or hide it. Even silver sources are brighter; Voice of the story narrator describes the stellings of Wild Stalin. That's the relationship, Sterling would say, silver? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some of them are almost embarrassing fools, especially When it comes to Lone Ranger's procession, he snatches the gun from the owner of a crowd of bad people. And when they're going to attack the bad boy, the little wave that he gives to Tonto - it's always the same gesture, but Tonto always knows what is in different situations. Then there are episodes in which Clayton Moore took Ranga masks to impersonate another character in the story has a different disguise. A villain, top hat and exposed to everyone, President Abraham Lincoln once again entered Dhaka as an actor! /> <br /> I have met some fans <br, and they knew that the actor John Hurt 195/53 season signed a contract with the producer of her. If you are ever "Happy Day" episode sees the statue of the hero of his youth phanji, then you'll see it listed on the credit of the heart. It is actually hard, to tell if you are watching the heart episode, the key is to listen to the voice; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> bhieicaesa at the Renaissance saw it, I absolutely beautiful, but I do not know whether commercial prints are available. Often black and white episodes have been re-packaged by most providers with most configurations, so you should not have any problems getting their hands on. Of course, three parts will be raised, and if you do not see anything else, it gives you all the smell and excitement necessary to capture the imagination of the most famous heroes in the West. Hi-Ho Silver, Awaya!
