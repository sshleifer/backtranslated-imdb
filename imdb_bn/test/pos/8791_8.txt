Great movie! And well! Powerful, full of fun, presenting our generations, presenting our generation: In spite of this world, a song of positive thinking, we talk about a great party, the story of a group of friends that will suddenly do something within a week and the only thing is the club. But keep away from fun and unrest away! Very funny, nicely extraordinary few points, nicely shot ... and great soundtrack!
