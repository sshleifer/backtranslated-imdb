You can say from a few comments posted here - if you do not play it in a DVD release or TCM then the mine will be very good! This is a kind of "Our Gang" movie, which bunch of different kids. The MGM was in the musical studio - if the musicians, dancers and singers were not under contract, they were on the tap. Heifetz is one of the most expensive ..... it works for a charity !!! He was neglected in the age he received. Another musical photo with Jose Itiboi (Mexican Pianist) has played some simple tunes in 100 pianos of 100 kids ... So, those who suspect that the suspect is not a musical instrument misunderstood: I was. <br /> <br /> To write all, "Frankie Smith" - Good-ole American name - (Jean Reynolds) was a bad boy who was taken by the song owners on the street. Can you believe that Walter Brevin ("Professor Lawson") was the man in that western film school running? Joel Mcrayera ("Peter McCarthy") and Andrea Leeds ("Anne Lawson") were the big stars of "their music will" with many popular guests (many of them themselves grew up) right). As others have commented, almost orchestra (actually, The Marmembla Symphony from Los Angeles) almost all of the kids have made great success in their lives, for musicians (for studios) and other businesses. <br /> <br /> Sadly, today many young people do not have orchestras - a sad mistake. Parents with school children are usually busy trying to keep their heads above the water and many do not know what is going on in the school. Musical Instructions can be Bridal, and almost everyone was a football team ..... <br /> <br /> You are in this movie, the cheapest concert in Jessa Hefettes. That day, a quarter. His play is bright, even if he thinks he can be anywhere else ... feeling unnatural. Through the contract, a concert by Yo-Yo is so much delightful, that you want to buy it properly and buy it ... This guy is spending a good time ... Concert like "street" kids, when they let heifetes play in their school. <br /> <br /> All the orchestral numbers "kids" played and they made it easy. I love this kind of movie - their plots are so easy, if you enjoy - or do not take two days to enjoy the movie - the movie is always there. We need some new movies like this - nothing can do anything, but encourages younger kids to run other instruments than guitar ... Bravo!
