This very obscure South Gothic Melodrama Star Clint Eastwood has been identified as a wounded Confederate officer in civil war, who took the girls to school and took health care. A strange conflict has happened in the genres, it seems that the "dangerous" man has been caught in a batch of seemingly disadvantaged women, who prove themselves cruel as they continue to fight each other during war crimes. It's a classic spider and fly story, but here's a lone flying and a whole bunch of spider. <br /> <br /> Geraldine is the headmaster of the page school, and she gives a characteristic exciting performance. The page was trained as a theater actress, and it shows all its performance. He does not play any role, he always pledges himself 100%, and never misses himself from the character. So here with this deadly spinster, who is victim of sexual abuse on this helpless man. Each of the other girls responds well to her in her own way. The most famous person is the whore girl who can not wait to throw herself on her and the virgin one (played by someone else with Elizabeth Hartman?) Those who work will fall into death if someone says the word "gender" . The movie does not keep you so many crystals and it's definitely uncertain what's going to happen next. <br /> <br /> The most memorable scene was the film for me when the women's team split on Eastwood's legs, which gangrene was infected. Again, the spider / flyout is clear: they hide it so that it is more difficult to escape from its web. <br /> <br /> A classic quill. A great movie, but a morbidly entertaining one. <br /> <br /> Grade: One-
