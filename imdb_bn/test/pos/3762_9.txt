The first transformation scene, what is music? I heard it "Greeks do not drink any freaks". Is this right? I really liked that word. In the final scenes I do not like to hide "Hide nothing." Really a doper movie, but with many smiles and puns, sight gags, and slapstick. Madam Woo-Woo's place was memorable in some places I visited. Ivy Venus actually appeared in some other amazing staffs. He looks different in the movie we are talking about, but his maturity did not hurt him a bit. Mark Blankfield reminds one of Gene Wilder in some ways. Base Armstrong was beautiful and maintained her beauty for a long time.
