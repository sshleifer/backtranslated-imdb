The film follows four friends from the 1950s (when they are in high school). They are Danillo (Craig Wasson) a Yugoslavian immigrant; Georgia (Jodi Thalan) is a "free spirit"; David (Michael Hoodleston) has no personality and Tom (Jim Metzler) is a big, strong, handsome, vague person. Three of them love Georgia, but they love Danilo. The film mostly focuses on both of them - they have made their lives, love and attraction to each other over the years. Danilo also tries to win the love of his difficult immigrant father. <br /> <br /> I love this picture, but without its bad side. Thalan's high, sticky voice is annoying (but you are using it); The story jumped too fast; The life of Tom and David was not explained (Tom shows Vietnam's wife and children and David's wife we ​​never meet in the end); Some important scenes are badly written and some pre-release kits (probably kept the film for two hours). <br /> <br /> But everything else is so good that you can easily forget the problems. The story is mandatory - you really get to know the letters and get caught and caught in life. With a few exceptions, the script (Steve Tesichch) was good - in fact, Tesich was a Yugoslavian immigrant and wrote most of the script on his own experience. All acting is great - especially Thais and Wasan - also Reed Baroni threw a strong, preferred performance louis, as Danilo's college roommate. And his role in Lotus Smith is very interesting. And see for Mercedes Roal and Glenn Headley! <br /> <br /> Basically, it's a really great story about immigrants, the age is coming, the love of America and the full 50 to 80. <br /> <br /> This photo (inappropriately) was released. Did not know how to advertise it in the studio (it's a solid film for the market) and critics have stops in it (Pauline Kells's review of "The New Yorker" was particularly strict). It only played in the theater (I was lucky enough to run it in a short theater in 1981) and just disappeared. It's a shame. This is a movie that is only ripe for re-fixation. I'm not betting it - but you never know! A certain 10 all the way!
