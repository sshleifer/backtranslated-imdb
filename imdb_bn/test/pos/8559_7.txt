H.O.T.S. Not for those who want hardcore porn. Instead, this movie is like a 80-year-old religious-classical college / frame film, which is a post-cursor in the Redjen of the Nords and Porcis and the world renowned Animal House. A good time if you dig a big kid playboy type of 70s and a Chevy Stap-Dick comedy - but if you want to use it as a vacy-material, then not very significant ... <br /> <br /> HOTS A "unauthorized" sorority of sexy outcasts who are fighting against popular and conventional Pi girls. This is a joke, the keeper of a aunt Jemima-Isha's house, even a super-robot robot, which seems to be your "thing" if it is relatively interesting. <br /> <br /> Well ... I like the next guy as much as the next guy (or perhaps more ...) - but I saw all that sleazy sh! I could not help but would really like to do some hardcore scenes to do this really. I knew it would not happen, but I still want that the HOTS There was a bit more sexual and a little less chin. Not as significant as NERDS, PORKY or ANIMAL HOUSE, but a look for fans of such films ... 7/10. <br /> <br /> I forgot - it's all gone - Rogue Danny Bonadisi probably His career's best role beyond "reality show" ...
