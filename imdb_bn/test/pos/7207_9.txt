For those who do not know, Estersks Books is a very successful series series of comic books about a village of magnificent Gospel that awakens Caesar's aggression thanks to the magic smog that transforms their helpless superman. Most of the animated features (only one of them, one of the twelve works of Achstics that holds books and souls in spite of having real screen stories) is a completely cast Christian Clavier and Gerard Depardie, adaptation before being a leadership role in two live actions which proved to be quite successful throughout Europe but English-speakers in the world And the effect is not broke. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> There is no sign of the United States Theater or DVD release, however, the Meramax version of Astrix and Obelix: Mission Cleopatra DVD (and played on UK TV), and you never guess - it's completely re-edited (lasted for at least 21 minutes) and dubbed in English has been done. Maybe Harvey has made it wrong for the Hong Kong film - in the end, he has never seen a foreign movie, he does not think he can improve for years with heavy editing and shelving. <br /> <br /> Estrica et et Obelix Contre Caesar is laced with a specially well translated script by Terry Jones, but otherwise leave unaltered, that kind of thing is not really Miramax's way. The result is not good. The film was the best effort to combine the book into a mix of scapestic, anarchoanimism and scrapic classical ridiculous acids, but many classical references have gone (such as the Meduza sight pointing or the great roof of the Sirena de Burgerac references) from Depardieu, which seems to be very French or slow down the picture As a result, the first 20 minutes is now a bus Your slogan. The part of the diaphragm was pruned (due to his serious health problems during the drawing, his part was already small: the version of the version was partially distorted by the original version to change the unhealthy palms of his face!), And naturally with dubbing, because literally fit literally in English No, the lines are not confiscated , They are no longer funny or the dialogue has changed completely (these changes are just funny, like a character who dreams of a world that he can move his lips in French and hear words in English). <br /> <br /> Not a total disaster, but very frustrating considering how good the full-length version is. Miramax will work with a Shawlin Soccer and it would be great to think that both versions will be released, but after giving $ 45 million for them, they've snatched both films for two years (another classic case of Harvey's notorious Chronic Repeal: G, why surprise? Disney There was a **** in PHP and yet there is no release plan, which may be too deliberate thinking. <br /> <br /> It's a real sad that it's accessible and entertaining movies are now only available to non-French speakers in such a weirdly balanced version. It seems that lucky gulls might defeat Caesar's army but there is no match for the Miramax jackbot.
