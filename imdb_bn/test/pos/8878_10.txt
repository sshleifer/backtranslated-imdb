This movie was rolling on the sunny movies I have ever seen. Danny De Vito plays perfectly oven. Mom has been portrayed exquisitely, and it is one of the highlights of the movie. <br /> <br /> It starts differently at the beginning of the movie, but what do you expect. Larry is trying to write a book and there are some problems. After Larry tried to read his writing, Larry tagged a writing class and Owen. Oven finally requested Larry to kill her mother, and then kill Wayne Larry's former wife. The whole movie was really sunny. <br /> <br /> When Owen wrote, "One of my favorite parts of the movie is finished when I write" Tom Mom from train ". Larry became angry because she wrote a book of the same plot. Oven turns out that a child wrote a pop-up book. <br /> <br /> I would really recommend this movie. I gave it a 10.
