Rent a slow Saturday night video. First seen I was funny at it. Take a while to use American Character (here we have more British British Gets) but it is very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I looked again at night and got really hot. Characters seem more humane - even lovable. A movie can be viewed more than once and it may get more each time. However, my wife * hates it. I think no accounting for the taste of humor.
