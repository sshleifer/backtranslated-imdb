It can be easy to complain about the quality of this movie (you do not want to make money on cartloads in a movie, it guarantees that it is worth watching), but I think it's completely absent. If you are a fast car, T & A or a movie that spells you for yourself, it's not you, you'll be frustrated and silent. <br /> <br /> This movie was completely enjoyable, kept us on the edge of our seats and really felt us. The authors have clearly kept a lot of thought and research behind this movie and it finally shows up, just keep an open mind. Note: School scenes were all featured on McMaster University and most of the rest of Toronto was completed.
