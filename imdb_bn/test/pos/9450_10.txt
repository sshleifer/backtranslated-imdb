Well, I'm not a movie critic or do not do anything like that. But there are my opinions for this movie. I think the best of this movie was Amanda Bains, she played my roll very well, I saw her a lot of movies, I like it the most! When you are watching this movie, you just relax, come down and see it. You do not have to try the theorem or something like that. You will see it. The movie is really great. Perhaps I like the actress for all scenes, but I like it. The whole atmosphere was created. At one moment, I felt that I was at the university, in that room. This is not another drama movie, Oscar is ready to win, it's just a nice movie to watch your free time.
