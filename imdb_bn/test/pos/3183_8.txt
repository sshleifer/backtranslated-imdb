Uncut version saw, I made this picture nicely. It took my attention from the beginning to the end; The tension was surprisingly conveyed. Nasan K Man portrays the right Filipino family with his personal privacy and false representation. Gloria Diaz's character is shown to be very subtle even in religious culture, maintaining human perspectives and maintaining pure fame. There is no visual in this movie that has no purpose - cinematography is excellent and the author is brilliant. <br /> <br /> Although the plot is great, I personally found that the perception of expressing Jericho's character was not so frustrating that it should be. But maybe it's just me, because otherwise, Nassan K. Man is a very cleverly-made movie. <br /> <br /> Casting was good to start, but Claudine's performance was cake. If you find the Filipino movie which is unexpected and will exceed expectations, then do not miss it. The director thumb up.
