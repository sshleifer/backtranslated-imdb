Just saw this image on TV and it was great. <br /> <br /> While doing some work it was planned to watch but I finished the work and finished seeing the whole picture! <br /> <br /> The actor does not know me very well, but the story line is made for it. The less well known events created by the actors only makes it more believable that can happen. I did not feel biased towards one character because there is no verdict in my character because I have never seen any film actor, before it is more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> It is.
