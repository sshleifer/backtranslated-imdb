After viewing the trailer it was an easy decision that did not see this image. I mean, I do not care for stupid "stoner comedies." I'm sure it's a simple choice for multiple people together, smoking a bowl, and people from Simpsons and people with "Billy Bob" see this flick. It should have been a good time, but the movie is not just funny - a very bad person should go and they should be tall. Unfortunately, I found that the trailer was confusing after the departure of the theater, so I had to wait for the video. I really enjoyed it. Excellent space, excellent performance and excellent performance from the whole cast. Looking back at this, the plot twist was not completely unexpected, but it was not very difficult because the compound was so attractive. <br /> <br /> Why was this playable drama sold as a comedy? Has something happened to the producers to market their own producers?
