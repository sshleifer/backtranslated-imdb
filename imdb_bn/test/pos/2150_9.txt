This solid-footed small picture, played in the Mode and Robbers 2007 festival It's a wonderful and loving look at Harry Nilsson, using many famous faces sitting for interviews, rarely seeing TV's performance and Nissan's scenery scene at work. There are also several shots from "Sack of Dracula". This film is the ultimate and appropriate respect for the best voice, the most clever writer and the most entertaining of popular musicians. It is an offense that he is not known about this person's name and / or some songs performed. Tell these incredibly funny stories about this gifted Huck with an unconscious desire for self-destruction of his friends. As a bonus, you also perform Eric Idel's song for Nilsson's final album during even closing credits. It's funny, it's sad. It is not a general release. Watch this photo where you live somewhere nearby, watch it!
