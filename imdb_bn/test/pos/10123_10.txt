Cuba Gooding, Junior. In 2003, Oscar wins for Best Actor. And Ed Harris wins for best supporting actor. This is a nice and shocking movie, but do not forget to bring along a box of tissues because the picture does not come to you, but your veins contain ice water. <br /> <br /> It was 1976. This setting was in South Carolina and the Civil Rights Act was almost ten years old. We have a white high school football coach and teacher, Ed Harris. Still a black hindrance, but a happy colleague Cuba Gooding, in which a public property is inserted into a shopping cart with a radio that is also used as his bike. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After a long time co-worker for a reason explained in He gave Cuba a nickname "Radio" and what happened later, the absence of man's soul, stimulus, extreme investigation <br /> <br /> This film is not short of a great composition.
