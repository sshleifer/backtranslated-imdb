This off-beat horror movie seems to be nothing but bad reviews. My question is; Why? I think this movie is quite good. D Schneider did very well for his first (and only) time instruction. He plays competitor in captain Howdy (Carrollton Hendrix). This movie seems to have a view of the future. Although it came back in 1998, it seems to be about modern things. Internet huntsman seems to be the underlying plot here. While taking to another level, this is a problem we face today. I will admit, the story has been shortened several times, but it does not make it a bad movie. Robert Englund even in this movie, that automatically makes it even better. The acting was not bad, the characters were quite well as well. Hendrix was a pretty good competitor I think. I give this off-bit awful a 7/10. Recommendations for fans to see.
