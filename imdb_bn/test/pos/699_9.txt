While hiding the real loot of the bank, he hired Galen Ford to hire an idiot banker and sticky stable owner Eger Buchanan. There is no show with Ford, the two go with the second choice instead, because he did not leave Ford on the hook for heating. <br /> <br /> The first color feature in Colombia, The Disadorno looks fantastic, strengthens the Western philosophy tones with the set and costumes designed to take full advantage of the technicola process. <br /> <br /> It's the incredible teamwork of a new Glenn Ford (third-bills but essentially star) and a major Randolph Scott, the character of the character of the character of the incredible character, the incredible supporting actress, the eyewitness Idler Buchanan is a good but silently Villain Yokel, which he is not seen and not as silent as the memorable lines. <br /> <br /> A fairly complex script mixes incredible action sequences, melodrama, and comedy, directed by Charles Vidor, effectively. This is one of the great western nineteenth century and highly recommended.
