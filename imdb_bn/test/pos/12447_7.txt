This DVD sells for about $ 20. If I could not give it too much for the DVD, then I knew what I got, but it is a pretty good disc, however. It includes footage from their concerts, including footage from their concerts ... Playing "Treat It Out", along with music videos, playing surfing, weight and billiards and scissors, which are apparently prohibited from MTV. <br /> <br /> Slip knot, for those who do not know, basically a Symphony of enemies: On the stage, there are total chaos, those who screw machine gun drums, guitars and voices that shut your mouth and give you more. For those who have never seen the slipnate before, I can not recommend you enough DVD ... maybe ebay or close Amazon so that you can get a better deal. <br /> <br /> A small, well-made show note though. <br /> <br /> Seven of the ten.
