I first saw this movie in the mid 80's and it was a fun movie. As I got older I see this movie for a variety of reasons. I'd love to see it when I'm feeling sad for my "lost youth". I was a teenager (14) during the liberation war of this girl, so I can identify the same problem / hesitation of the campus / CIT in this film. I was delighted to see clothes clothed at this time and heard about the same old urban legends such as overnight canoe trips. The film is full of fun one liners. At the end of the 70s, at the age of 80 to 70, I highly recommend this movie as a teenager.
