This Stan Laurel comedy bint is a cute little parody of Valentino Film Bloud and Sand. If you have watched the blood and sand, you probably would appreciate this movie and laugh at some of the scenes of Valentino film scoffers. However, if you do not see this movie and only see this movie you probably will not be impressed - although I really like the title cards, our "bull" has been used repeatedly in very interesting ways. <Br /> <br /> Playing Stanley "Vasselino" is a bullfighter who feels very slowly and wins because the bells seem to be lazy and non-aggressive. Even after the end of the film that killed ten men, even Bull is evidently a steam steam. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
