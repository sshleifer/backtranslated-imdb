I was very anxious to see this movie for one. <br /> <br /> Although I knew that it was going to be another type of movie in the vengeance of the Nedars, I was still fascinated. <br /> <br> There is so much truth about the authenticity of such teachings and it firmly believes that it should be approved in the "new style of education". <br /> <br /> Traditional learning methods do not always teach the students. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For the Hollywood comedy to create comedy, it must be left there. Although we all know that life is not really in any way. <br /> <br /> <br /> A touch is incredible, yet funny and ending with a killer. <br /> <br /> Wonderful end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> There is plenty of oath or nudity or fair jokes. <br /> <br /> Great crew and cast, stories and compulsory "Hampton Fraser members" genre type casting done well. <br /> <br /> American pie 1, 2 3 and American wedding or any clones it does not measure it by 1/3. <br /> <br /> The first year is much better than most comedies with college. <br/> <br /> I like it, though it was easy ... it was interesting and even heart ... my only regret for watching this movie was that it was no longer there.
