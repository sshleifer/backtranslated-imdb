Is the Internet a Wonderful Thing? I'm watching a tipped episode of my favorite documentaries, "Vietnam: Ten thousand days of war", from my DVR to Florida from the United States to my laptop in Kuwait; I am writing a review about this series and read another review from someone living in Vietnam! Amazing I just want to say that in the statement of Min Nguyen America is fighting the war in Vietnam in one side. I know America was the main player in the West, but the wages of the two sides in the war. Soviet and Chinese were the main weapons suppliers on the north, because Mr. Gueen showed an ignorance to blame partially without mentioning them (Well, I think we all know why he does not mention them, both raised ignorance) in the communist system and in his political conflicts, or fear of telling the truth fears of being arrested Due to). Also, Mr. Guen, I guess about part of North America's main aggressor that the whole war was not shown in your country to blame in America, but also showed ignorance. However, it is interesting to read a review from Vietnam (of course it can also be made but I will accept it as real), at least at least in the Communist East. As far as the mini series; Why i love it It does not focus solely on American involvement. This is a war that started 15 years before America was involved and this series covered every aspect of history so that it is a real plus. The first rate of footage used, all the Vietnam War programs you create now will use the same footage, so that you are missing something from this old series. The date this series was created is another plus. It has interviewed all the major players which you can not do now because they are dead from age, it is a major historical reference. Third, Richard Beshat has added a very distinct descriptive voice, sounds as different as the voice of James Earl Jones, and I think it is very steep praise. I do not think that you can create any better warcraft, it is to adopt the modern technology of the 1980s and replace it until the 1950s, and to meet the second general and politician's interview of both world sides of World War II, for this, > <br /> OK, I favor some, its fine, fine bias type npa in the 1970's 80's style Opinion: "All things considered" bias, where it seems that all straight, but when you end up with your head vibration blurred. In this show case, the following episodes do not play the role of the media and generally propagate, all the effective tools to influence the outcome of the war, do not you think ??? <br /> <br /> The same thing is going on from the IIF warrant even after 30 years.
