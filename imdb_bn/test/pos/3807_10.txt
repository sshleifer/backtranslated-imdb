I liked this movie, when I was about eight years old and had seen almost seven years later, this evening I got to see it again. I really had a fun idea of ​​it, they were the only things that disturbed me that I felt was a police out. 'Here is the hard rock to find this movie and I was lucky enough to see it in Bravo. I also wanted to see more Drew Barrimo here!
