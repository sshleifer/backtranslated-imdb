The consequences of love: There is really something special about this film but it is very difficult to keep your finger. It's a love story but I never really saw it before. It has various love themes running throughout the film. A man loves a young woman, a small man loves for his older brother, love for money for the Mafias, all these are just some of the stories you have guessed or do not know where and how it will end. The film stars Sophia Teasing from the Burmese to face direct competition with the character of the central character. The simple, yet dominant camera function, closes an ever-changing soundtrack, which combines low-fat trip hop with lash orchestral pieces. The style of film is sometimes beautifully changed using different styles without cluttered. Love is not so diverse and powerful as the story is called Orthodox every conclusion. The director is old and married in a rich Italian classic.
