The Surface was awesome, I do not know how long I survived in school, I think only about the new episode on the surface. I liked it, sometimes I had to call home and asked my mother to tape for me. I heard that it was very annoying when it was canceled, that means we have a way to hang on. So, they could get their new Tina Fai comedy (you can not pay me to watch it, I think businesses have lowered me). I will miss the Surface fix on my Monday night, even if my sister makes fun of me. Although, kidnapping looks good and they still exist: SVU (I think I still have to be tested) (I only wrote the above two lines because they said that I need ten lines).
