I am surprised to see this movie, how much it has been 'bound' to me. Actors have not usually acted like 'Hollywood' actors, but this film proves that it is not always bad. Very different from the Disney Standard, it is not a refreshing turn! They give you a taste of what you prefer without 'educational'. A movie should both see and enjoy. Many people debate about 'aurunuris' in such a movie, but there is a lot to offer only the basic concept. Light glide; In East and West Germany, a map shows that the right side of the west will be Germany, from east to right. Sometimes the film returns you slightly, because half of the scene has West Germany on the right side of the screen and there are other bars on the left. Even during the same event, they move behind. Most likely, this slight distraction will avoid little adjustment. See it!
