This is a beautiful, yet easy movie, which is driven to find an answer, it does not require a reply, but its whole life is surrounded. It's frustrating, it's ridiculous, it's magnificent, it hurts, it's fine and dynamic, I say it's gifted. <br /> <br /> I've enlightened everything in Jonathan Sapphar's book (basically because I've been hearing Eliass Wood adapting the movie), and I was just enraptured by the characters. I once laughs out loud more than once. And whenever someone talks about what they say about it, I can hear the same hackneyed reaction, almost like a big long word: "It's OutOUTOUTINGFINGFIFUMMOUTHVOTHISGANDPANDPOHROMETHNAGIS". Yet, this story is so philosophical; It goes deeper than that. That conversation about the ring and "case." It really gets one thought. Suddenly, this story is transformed from a simple search to an internal sunflower, and I see myself a little differently. <br /> <br /> I would recommend reading it if I read it earlier, because the book was a very obscene, cruel misrepresentation that was not included in the film, mainly on Jonathan's family history which was not necessary for the movie. <br /> <br /> Some quarters, I've heard, Wood's current girlfriend has a camo in Flickr, which is like a band drummer that arranges for Jonathan steps from the UK train in the UK. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's nice, and in my opinion, Elias Wood is one of the best movies.
