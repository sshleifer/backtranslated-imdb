Linda Blair has been acting for forty years now, and when she does not run away from Regan McNeele in "Exorcist", some of her subsequent horror films used her legendary status as a "witchery". She is the wife of Genre Brooks, a pregnant single woman who travels with her family to a abandoned island hotel that her parents want to buy. Some couples from their real estate agent (Catherine Hickland and Rick Farnsworth) are met, and after reaching the island, they are scouting the photographer (David Hasselhoff) and his writer girlfriend (Leslie Cumming) at the hotel during illegal search. A local wing (Hildegard knee). It seems that the sinking had long been the result of his suicide, and at the time he was with the child. Unknown about the dangers, Jane recently dreamed of the dramatic death of the wizard, and Jane's younger brother Tommy (Michael Manchester) has directly interviewed his Sphie, Black-Claude spirit, which he called 'lady black'. The island was quiet enough during the time of the island; Their unknown, however, Lady In Black has already sent the captain of their rented boat (George Steven). Long ago, separation and cold began to affect everyone, and during this period the mood and tension that Lady Black began to reign in during this time of terrorism. He planned to revenge his own destiny by leaving Zen and sacrificed his companion and his unborn child. All other victims of his revengeful curse - temptation, passion, and a virgin's blood are full of an aspect. Just as the sun decreases and the sea becomes wild, so he hunt after a terrible, scary way. Island location is really scary, and inn is very awesome and hunting shots. It's a color film that reminds me of the work of Dario Agento. The lighting is excellent, and the set decoration is quite amazing. The soundtrack is very effective and unique. The horrific effect is extreme, awesome, and unforgettable. Cinematography is fantastic, and it will bring us back to Linda Blair. The creative team behind this film should be shot dead as a horror star: Many of the dramatic push-ups, close links, which give details of Zen's growing occupation and the memorable moments of other great horror films. "Rosemary's Baby", "Jacob's Ladders", "The Shining", "Black Sunday", and of course "Exorcist" have hidden confessions. She does a great job, and absolutely stole shows with her moody and show performance. That's not to say the rest of the frustration; Catherine Hickland is sexy and very good, and memorable as experienced actor Annie Ross Jane's Wicked Mother Rose. Haslehoff makes it his best, but he is not basically a movie star, and his television personality gets his way of performance. Blair and the young man Michael have a wonderful chemistry together. This film is fierce and weird (well) that it was their humorousness (Blair played a Mao in "Monster Maker's 2003" and his film had a similar humble feeling in his scene). Finally, Hildegard Kaneef (among his last roles) plays a great witch and he has the most amazing voice and pronunciation. Along with Blair, he was completely cast. But it's Blair's movie all the way. Jane Brooks seems to have some mental strength, and this view of the film will again hear "Exorcist 2: The Heritage". I think "Weitchery" is there with "Exorcist", "Exorcist 2", "Hell Knight" and "Fear of Girl", which remains as one of Blair's best-known works.
