I have seen this movie about 12 years ago and I can still remember that I recently saw it. How much did this movie affect me It seems that a movie of the 50's seems like it was ahead of its time. Something which makes me amazed at this issue, some may be considered banned. The helpless and hearty journey that is very realistic to choose to embark on an addict. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, br> When others talk about psychiatric illnesses and / or addiction related movies, I always recommend Man with Golden Arm as one of the top five.
