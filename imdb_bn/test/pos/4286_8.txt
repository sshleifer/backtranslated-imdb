A few years ago when I first read The Evolution of The World World Garage, I was surprised that the young adults who have been communicating with me do not like the book. I realized that this is an age and experience thing. I enjoyed a bit while reading some comments on this site which were clearly written by young viewers. It's definitely an age and experience of enjoying a completely different fiction. <br /> <br /> In this film an apparently happy high middle class couple - he is a successful lawyer - he is the perfect wife of a successful lawyer They have a townhouse in London and a house in the country. Everyone in the village until the villain's entry into the village, "Villain", everyone is good. This guy looks like a cad from the word, "go." He denies everything including everyone and his own child. When the beautiful form of the beautiful son ends, the lawyer's wife is related to the border. You see the lawyer is really an excellent guy but with an organized perfectionist wedding wedding features. Although he really loves him, he is disturbed for his wife's death. Bad boy is a lot more exciting. <br /> <br /> In these villages, a person is involved in the death of a deadly death, in which all information refers to cad as a driver of a car. It is easy to determine that this movie is not made for a happy ending, but it man and his wife directs them to a very satisfying finish to their experience and perhaps to grow and grow. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Tom Wilkinson is perfect as husband. His screenplay shows us a kind of person who has so much control over his emotions that he has lost contact with the world. Emily Watson has shown us a woman who is trapped in the role of perfect wife that she has often lost her emotional sense. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - You will see these nice actors to do. It's a beautiful acting and directed adult film about realistic adults.
