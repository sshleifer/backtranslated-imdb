Matthu is a doctor of a unmarried hospital who enjoys his solo status and staff at the feet of the staff and the nurses available, colleagues and friends, Richard Benjamin watching with entertainment and wonder. Their boss is going to the hard-hitting army chief, Chief of Staff Art Carney, who is ready to re-election this post. <br /> <br /> Matuo is not playing field until meeting with single mom. He insisted on being the only woman in his life when he was in his life. At the same time, she was under pressure to react in response to possible cases of possible cases in the corruption case and to support the re-election of the Chief of Staff and to support the unfinished cornea. <br /> <br /> It is an old-fashioned romantic comedy equipped with a wonderful supporter Cast that works with four-grade actors and first-class dry, stunning, and skinny scripts. Carnes stole each of their scenes and according to the IMDB's policy, whenever they are on the screen, fly around floating on the floor. Our two other titles and various sub-plots are entertained by close relations. <br /> <br /> Reduces the ambition of a great movie, but it is its best and observable and re-watchable for its curiosity alone. The DVD or video cassette is worth more attention than what is available.
