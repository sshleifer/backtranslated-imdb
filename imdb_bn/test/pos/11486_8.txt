Once it starts slowly, the film closes and gets really fun in many unexpected ways. Great cast is really good, Hathar Graham is probably being the weakest of them. KC affile as his brother is really good and very likable, if you hold my drift <br /> <br /> If you want good hours, I highly recommend it. Teenagers should really enjoy this film - it says a lot about the relationship.
