This interesting losing film (Trarence owner's writing) searches for Stacey Kitch and Frederick Forest to open two serene, southern brothers' seafood restaurants. Margot Kidder was never beautiful and Forrest was nominated. Originally titled The Daen Brothers, this light-hearted twinkle with violence is a pure joy! <br /> <br /> Where is this picture? I have been searching for it for over 30 years. Keach was still back then great and I'm not surprised that there is more of a cult following it (probably it has it). These guys make a crack up with more ambition than the brain, but totally lovable dudes! 7 out of 10 You can dig it somewhere, you'll have fun.
