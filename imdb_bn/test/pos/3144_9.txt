I saw this picture the same night I saw 6 other shorts. In terms of performance, direction, filming and originality of the story, it was ahead of others. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2 actresses are both mandatory and trustworthy immediately. Their chemistry is palpable; Although the film was 10 minutes long, the depth of their relationship was revealed. Acting and guidance is very strong. <br /> <br /> 2. Beautiful shot Lighting, structures and general filming are interesting. 35mm film sets this movie from other shorts. And it makes a difference. Filming this film is worthy of stock. <br /> <br /> 3 Powerful story Often small films try to do very little or too much work over time. Or they are trying to tell a predicted story. This is a good balance to tell you an interesting story, without drawing it too much or unhappy. You think what will happen next, at the same time, you feel like seeing something happen. <br /> <br /> Excellent score too. Complimentary without empowerment <br /> <br /> If you can find it at a festival, make an effort to see it.
