I sincerely enjoyed this short, even as a Toronto Maple Leafs fan. <br /> <br /> Director Sheldon Cohen and the narrator Roche Career took the boy's full emotions completely. From the feeling of Richard "Miracle" Rocket, when he got his sweater from his mother, soon to see the horrific look from his face, a new Montreal Canadian sweater got to excite, expectancy and hope; A Toronto Maple lift sweater was invaluable and shameful to wear this awesome (his eyes) blue and white Toronto Maple Leafs sweater; Montreal's No. Number Montreal is not like the Canadian Rouge, Blue and Blank, but like its old sweater. And worst of all, her mother used to wear this Maple Leaf sweater from her house. You can think of the sweater that struck the ice after his friends and you can expect his mockery. <br /> <br /> I'm laughing all the time and it's one of the best animated shorts. Saw it <br /> <br />
