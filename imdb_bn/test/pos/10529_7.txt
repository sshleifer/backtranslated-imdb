This BBC version of Agaga Christie's book shows the problems of following a book very closely. Christie's books tend to move slowly, sometimes even at speed and "Evans" certainly do it. It has a solid school to have red squares to confuse the plot. This version is highly trusted for the book, which is a very slow, inclusive story result. As Christie fan, I've given it 7 stars, but it takes about 3 hours to create its way through a relatively open-ended story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> its role and James Warwick very well closed Drama
