Shortly after Clint Eastwood's Spaghetti Westerns and his string Henry's string string, he and director Don Seagull gathered to create this amazing picture. Eastwood was wounded during a civil war in the Union Army Corporation game for girls received by a South School until he was rescued from his wounds. Within a short time these young women (most teenagers seem to be older) have a man in their premises, so they are reluctant to surround him with local rebel soldiers. As a result, the situation often gets ridiculous, ridiculous, erotic, even unimaginable, because Eastwood gradually acquires its power and starts bothering the organization. <br /> <br /> The main story often sounds like creating a porno movie. We have a stranger male surrounded by sudden young bride women. Most of them are sexually attracted to him. And he is more than willing to spread love among them. The object does not really slips down to the "tasteless" level, however. Estud, Siegel, and cinemographer Bruce Sarthez are such skilled filmmakers, who always keep their status. <br /> <br /> Eastwood's John McBurney has never played any role like this. McBurney is a casual, conniving, and lustful charlatan. He knows that most women even young people want his body, and he shoots more than one of them. McBurney often uses shiny gloves for women, then her fork uses good looks. She is like a drunken player in a cocktail party, often striking different women in the same scene! Finally, in his desired way, he must show himself in a way that results in him suffering and suffering. This writer will not dream of expressing certain consequences, but he does not have any doubts about their coming. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The thing turned out really ugly until he seems to be having an explosion with the role, then he Average and ugly turns active. Geraldine leaves who run on school as a treat as steely B * tch. We know that he likes McBurney like other girls, but his checkout has been shown in flashbacks in the past, we see that he is not next! My Merseys also give a great performance as a slave of the school. He obviously knows that MacBurney was a quarrel from the beginning, and he never allowed his terrible elegance to guard him down. This is a character that you want to know more after the movie is over. It seems that the film has more knowledge than any other than the world. <br /> <br /> Badgaya has done a bad job in its dramatic liberation war. It was not certain that anyone could create it, and some of its products created some eyebrows in 1971. For example, in the initial stages, we romanticly kissed a 12-year-old girl. When the rebel soldiers get closer, is he just trying to keep him calm, or is he really enjoying? Probably both! After a fantasy sequence even Clint finds it only with the page, but its young assistant looks! This one is really something really interesting. Eastwood has become its big star, or it may have forgotten long ago. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 10 stars bigger 9 <br /> <br /> Hound.
