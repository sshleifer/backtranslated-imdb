These three films are made, they are created in the same way and each is extremely fun. Red Plays Radio Actress Wali Benton, Ur Fox, who is your common wrestling girl next visitor, played by Anne Rutherford, agreed to solve real life crimes with her fianc√©. Many of the one-liners and gags are stupid and probably I was expected in the 1940s. However, I really laughed loudly to me, which was unexpected to say at least. Red Scalton is amazing in the presence of a wonderful strong screen because I grew up with an old version of the old man who did not really play well during my impressive years. Although I went ahead of this movie- if your mood for such nostalgic fare I almost threw a light heart, but really people are suffering and beating and I say dare, sometimes more than the average of the senses. Like most movies of this era, you can imagine that it gets a PI rating (politically incorrect). WARNING is the funny way that I guess, and so this movie is again. See one, see them all.
