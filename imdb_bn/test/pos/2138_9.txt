When it is opened, "damage to the gates" of heaven, there has been a more cultural event than a motion picture. It was a convenient target, because it was a convenient target, because it was too much budget work than the latest "october" budget to hit Hualien, who still established the track record, gave him doubts in the criticism and industry equals, as the concerns about excessive budget and the directorial arrogance increased. Since someone specified at one time, no person survived even more expensive and dark "reds" of Warren, because BT was our "one", when Michael Simino did not achieve this condition. But the "Gate of Heaven" was influenced by a cultural change that took place at the time, toward the more uninterrupted democratic steps of mythological diplomacy on the right and the west (and the western). A few years ago, demythologizing of Symino on the border might seem timely, fresh, and a necessary revisionist. But in 1980, it was considered almost American in the context of Reagan Revolution. <br /> <br /> No shame, because the film has been seen convenient for several decades. Hobbes's words, "painful, stupid, and short", is an impressive and thought-provoking look at that particular time and place around the world. Cristoferson played a high-class former James Averil who was a Wyoming Sheriff in search of courage, where he saw himself leading the resistance by settlers and opponents against the attack of tenant dead, renting wealthy landowners. , Along with best friends in Averril's lifetime. In more silly times, his "color" tag will appear on the winner of Ovrell and his poor peasants; But it is nothing but a traditional western, and when US Cavity joins the war here, it is not near the "good boys". A lot like "Deer Hunter", the previous movie like Simino, "Heaven's Gate" spent a great time creating details of the life of his principals, which sometimes gives the film at an exciting pace, yet still comes in a chic conclusion. Excellent performance, fine musical score, and visible textures that believe in one, are actually seeing "Old West" with new eyes, "Heaven's Gate" is a movie that gives rewards to watch. I just want to get a new DVD from MGM, with an improved transfer and a comment from Simino. However, the current version is quite satisfactory to show the audience that critics in the 1980s were blinded by the cultural dialect of the film, missed it ... that "Heaven's Gate" is a great movie.
