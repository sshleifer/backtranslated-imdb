Ponyo is a beautiful animated film with some dark undertones. It presents a small story of longevity and love with environmental influences, but it is not a campaign. Hayo Miyazaki added Anderson's Little Mermaid and its trademark Stam Pank Flash flight to Japan's local mythology, and its results are very fruitful. There are some scary moments in the ocean storm and flood, but they are thrilling, not terrible. <br /> <br /> If you ever want to run with waves along the coast, travel as a lift on a jellyfish, completely transform yourself, or a friend for life, Ponyo is a fable for you.
