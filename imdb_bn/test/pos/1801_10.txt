It's a romantic, though cheesy movie that's my favorite one of all time. This is one of the 80 episodes of "Pretty in Pink" or "Some Wonders". <br /> <br /> In the traditional valley, Priy's daughter Julie plays the traditional Punk man in love. This is a heartwarming love story that helps you win the girl till the end. <br /> <br /> Actually, most of the actress suits but <br /> <br /> After watching it in the theater, Nick is in love with it and since he came from, it is almost always seen. She was really raised as an actor, but in her first film she had very likely the possibility that she had many possibilities. <br /> <br /> If you like 80's movies then you love this classic. <br /> <br /> Rent it !!!!!
