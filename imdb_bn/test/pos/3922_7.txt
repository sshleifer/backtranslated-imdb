Curley Jones (Elise Kurtberth), her bad boy brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray), her boyfriend Wade (Jared Padaleki), and her friends Pazy (Paris Hilton) and her boyfriend Black (Robert Richard) and Dalton (John Abraham) Another city to see an important game. They decided to camp in half an area and proceed their journey the next day. However, the fan belt of Wade's car broke down and bought a new city with Kareli to buy a new one where he bought a wax house. When they arrive at this place, they realize that this place is a ghost town, and the rogue ex-Siamese brothers transformed the people into wax statues. <br /> <br /> I like this "Mymensingh house", it's really a suitable teen horror movie. The story follows the "Texas Chess Genocide" and other slash movies, and it's well-made, a good team of actors and actresses and special effects and death scenes are amazing. Although the movie is not good, watching the Parisian and Hilton sexy and tasty precious. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Casa de Cera" ("Wax house")
