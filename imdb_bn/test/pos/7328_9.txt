I can not say that this movie deserves ten, because I will lie. I loved this movie when I saw it, though! It carries a unique bond of friendship between a teenager and a dolphin. Although Jesse and Willi do not show sweetness in the free will, it provides an exciting movie that the whole family will enjoy! If you love marine creatures, or if you only love a perfect family film, this movie is perfect for you! Flip definitely shows us how adorable dolphins are, and everybody had a big enough pool if they could be playful and easy to house pets! I love whales and dolphins, so perhaps this movie works for me. I think the producers will choose another shark instead of hammer to enhance the opponent's story. Probably a great white? Flipper magistrate! So check it out!
