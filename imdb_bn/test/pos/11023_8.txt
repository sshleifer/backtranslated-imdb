How nice! I recently saw the IFC but I saw a cheerleader. ID has not heard of this movie, but the story seems to be remotely interesting. I went with low expectations and now I must say definitely one of the films this best love story. Robert Tunni has done a wonderful job by portraying a person with a torrent. The relationship between two of the film and only the fewest details is so intense and trustworthy. I usually hate "romance" and love movies but this movie really touched me. I therefore recommend this movie with the power of the scene.
