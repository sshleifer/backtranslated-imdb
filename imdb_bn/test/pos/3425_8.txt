I saw this picture at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival. I gave the impression that if it played Chuittell Ezifor and Hillary Swan, it was at least decent. Well, after a gradual step, I was frustrated. Actually, I was very happy with the final product. <br /> <br /> I must admit that some English speakers of the African and Xhosa (?) actors were difficult to see but it was good to see "Watching the Divine", "Trainings" or about 15 minutes later, with heavy coordinating actors Movies. I used to think Hillary Swan as South African and she was trying to speak but looks very American ... so she is making a poor effort to pronounce it. But later on about his character in the film and how he has gone to a US, you have expressed how he lost some or more of his pronunciation. So it started to mean that only a few words could return to a African man. <br /> <br /> I know that the film is a weak one to use for education, but one of the great things about this film is that it was interesting to see the reality of drama and reunion trials. I heard about the TRI process in South Africa after the fall of racism but I do not know how it worked. <br /> <br /> The final verdict is that although some scenes felt a little united, this was a very powerful film overall. The end of the "true" exit was the hope of a firm end for each movie. Anyone who is careful about what may happen a certain course of action can happen outside their borders.
