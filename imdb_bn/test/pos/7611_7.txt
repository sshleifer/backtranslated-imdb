JC was a newspaper journalist who again set up a job to return to high school when he was 17 years old. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> He said, "Show that (the little kitty) Jose was very poor at high school and a lot was sorted and one day cool guy He tells him that he is taking him to the promotion, only when he leaves his house on Promenade night, he gets the donkey hole and eggs from his bitch. What a terrific thing (something will be hard to see as it is so painful and it will feel warm to Jose). <br /> <br /> I could not find this movie fun, but some were really fun things in the office scenes that have happened in school. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect happy, because it brings tears in the eyes of my mother and sisters. The performance of this movie was not outstanding, it was good for most of the movie, some parts of the film had some poor acting. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give this image 7 out of 10.
