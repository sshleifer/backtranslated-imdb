This is a good series for me. I'm disappointed that Ana Lucia and Libby died, but the masseur lied about those who killed them. And if someone could answer this, then what was the name of that girl "Henry Gallo" she was the leader of another (or Mrs. Clu ??) However, if you know her name well. Finally after trying to think about what might happen after not having to press the button. That whole DARMA project messed up things and I personally used it off of Desmond Magnet things, how they were cool, how it was cool, and yes what was that whole point? Finally they are not happy to press the button, but what will happen to the people? Mr. Echo, John, Charlie and good Desmond are probably dead, but what about others? I think they survived, I forgot? Well this is just my little thing about what I thought about the end of this season !!!
