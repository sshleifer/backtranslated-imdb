In the middle of the 19th century, I saw the second part of this beautiful piece of piece in the ship. Golding's book should be responsible for some great dialogue, but everything else was also good! I especially like the way to create a sense of time and feeling in the ship. For me it was a feeling of fullness, which I know, I can not express it in words ... It probably mixes the story without mixing it with technical and historical details about travel in the eighteenth century. Up Benedict Cumberbatch was excellent, as was the rest of the cast. This often does not send me a mini series to "region", but it's a one.
