Hoot Middle School is a wonderful young person about a group of kids who try and keep a pancake home chain from bulldozing a plot of land in some endangered burwing owls house. Acting is nice to look good and fresh face. There are many well-known comedians in this movie and humor is almost nonstop. This is a film for young people aged 5 to 11 years old. I thought that this day it is a great change of pace from adult films spreading the screen. Generally there is no realistic or correctness for adults or children. Being a developed country, it's just fun with a constant message about preserving beautiful places in this country. If you think that you can remember the day when you did not fight for a profit then remember that the meaning is not everything. More than 12 people are not going to enjoy it unless they have a soft spot for the old after the school special series.
