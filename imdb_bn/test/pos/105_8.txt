For a moment, keep aside the cultural aspects of this film, even if it is a very important aspect, and the real fact is that it is a very beautiful love story. Two people find themselves in a difficult situation caused by a sad husband. There is no hope except for their sad days. If these two women were alone, imagine what everyone can accept. They found each other and they fell in love. This love was almost irrelevant against all social, religious and cultural laws of their environment. They love each other, get relief in each other, that was enough. The response of people around them is simply a small issue that they have to accept, even to suffer, and then they can take their lives, their lives. very nice.
