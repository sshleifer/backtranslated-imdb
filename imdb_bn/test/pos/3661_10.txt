Bermuda was very fortunate to see the film Hari Om on the International Film Festival. It was in the opening night and was such a delightful movie. It was shot nicely in India and I want to go there now. The winner of the main actor was completely incredible. He was the highlight of the film. Apparently he was in the movie ... Monsoon marriage. He was the total star of the show. Benoit's character trapped me ... it was very funny. And the girl (forget the name) was very great. They all were great! The monkey had many wonderful scenes. And basically I just loved the movie. Everyone was walking out raving about it and it certainly was a high point in the film's gala. My favorite was from the festival. It really has earned India's life very nicely and can not believe how good India is. The feeling of getting out of the movie ... is a real high. This is a delightful, happy film. I love it !!
