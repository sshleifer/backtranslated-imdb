What is the matter with you people? John Dahl? From "rounders" and "unforgettable"? You cookie MM Thompson and Alan Rickman play on the shoulder? Anyone likes Gingerbread Man? <br /> <br /> I did not know anything about it and found a video that could be found as a nifty. Insulting, good thoughts, funny, scary. I do not agree with naysayers, definitely. I thought the story itself was unknown, but the great cast, which was probably giving attention to the director, was highlighted in a very quiet position. Good sound design also (much appreciated around, but I'm not bragging). And yes, I'm a girl, so maybe it has a little female slant (the boys in the gang are pretty). All in all, a 9 and an impressive recommendation.
