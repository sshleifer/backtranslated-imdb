Spoiler alert !!!! This is my son's movie review, which he wanted to post to me. He wrote, I swear. <br /> <br /> They can show up with the middle bracket of Monkeys Malcolm and Nikkeodan, Amanda Bios. They are up to the team of actor Paul Giamatti. He stole Jason Shepherd's composition by Big Fat Leah and turned it into a movie. Jason (Frankie Muniz) and Kolly (Amanda Bains) have to go to LA to get her back. Jason's father does not believe that he wrote the essay. So when they look at each other, Jason asks Wolf (Paul Giamatti) to give Jason's father a call because he wants to finish his composition !!!! Wolf does not make movies but the company's president makes it. In the end, the family and Kaioli have seen the film, based on Wolf, and based on a real story written by Jason Shepherd.
