A fun-filled movie <br /> <br /> A group of thieves led by Mark Wahlberg looted gold in Italy safely and expressed gratitude for them that they succeed and they take it without any major problem. Before the group could celebrate, Steve Ed Norton played that he wanted all the gold for himself and dragged someone to the group and shot one of the members. He and his associates feel that this group has died, but thankfully this group is not dead. A year later we came back to the story where the group tracked Norton and decided to steal behind the gold and the rest of the gold and plans to set a score. <br /> <br /> - It was a wonderful thing for me, it could all be a common forgotten summer movie, but it was really memorable and really fun to watch. What I like is how smart and well thought film plans are, and how the film looks realistic. Seeing the trailer you think it was a stupid action movie, but in reality the film has only two step views and they all got done well. The next action scene is a very long 20 minutes. One of the best cars ever has never been that ride. I like how to complete the old school style of everything without the help of real and CGI help. Personally I was more fun than this car on the Matrix 2 CGI Fill Chase. I remember watching music videos by director F. Gary Gray and they always watched how well they made and thought that he made a great filmmaker, I was always right and he proved it here. She can not wait to see what shewel do. <br /> <br /> - Actor Sheth also worked as my favorite friend with the green team. The other thing I liked was John Powell's excellent score, since I heard his score for "robot" this year, I gave him close attention to one of his fans and his music and people are really good. He did a great job of avoiding all the ordinary summer movie Movie Clayik and provided a very good score. I did not see the original based on it so I can not really tell it how much it stack up. <br /> <br /> - So yes it's a great popcorn movie which actually has a brain that comes in the summer movie most opposite of BAD. Have great characters, have fun as hell and have an amazing score by John Powell. If you like histricic movies then you will love it <br /> <br /> - If you knew that I was in this group, they would call me a handsome mic
