My commentary is basically commentary on the first commentator (extra in film) and his unhappy assessment of the film. I think his point of view is why an additional director and director directs. The film was sweet, enough to play, it's a wonderful diversified observer experience from a busy working week. It was not "The Hours" (acting), not "The Matrix" (special effects), even "color purple" (directions). Most movies will not be there. But it was a festive festival that "Winnie ..." would lead you to believe. Sorry guy, just my 2 cents. <br /> <br /> Like this picture, it was very gay (+ # 1). It showed a world less perfect than perfect and perfect people - you know, like us (+ # 2)! It opens a door to a culture other than the other culture (+ # 3). And I liked the song (+ # 4).
