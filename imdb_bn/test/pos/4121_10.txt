It's very close to publishing at least one perfect video. The Messian Metallic Group, Rock N 'Roll's Dinosaur, is the world's largest and most influential heavy band, playing their hit songs and remembering the past of the band - what do we need? <br /> <br /> The video contains the largest and most notable classics real line-up between "war-dried" and "paranoid" and in the middle: "electric funeral", "sweet page", "forever", "iron People "," baby graves "... and of course my personal choice is" void ", I'm glad they did not leave it. Well, how could they? <br /> <br /> However, this video is more than just music. Ozzie Osborn, Tony Emmy, Gija Butler and Bill Ward go to the colorful history of the group. That thing is only a little annoying when being interrupted with a live interview interview. For example, how can it be known that the song "NIB" It's name, right in the middle - on top of the other? I doubt that. It's still a small error, so it's not a big deal. <br /> <br /> The band sits on the chair chairs and chats together: a beautiful piece for a Sabbath! I admit that I have difficulty following what Ozzy Osborn is mocking, but it's just fun. "Last night's tour" When I entered Finland I had a special opportunity to participate and this video is a great way for me to remember this great show.
