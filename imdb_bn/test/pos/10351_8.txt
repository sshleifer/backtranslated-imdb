In the last ten minutes of this extraordinary piece of television I was stupid blobing. I think it was not the idea to break it, despite having beautiful dipping stuff on 90 minutes on Sunday. Another thought, for qualifying, the chances of winning BAFTA have not encouraged me ... ... the last result hit me 6. I saw several television channels of this age. Over the years, I had thought that all the basicities left the BBC's play category. Answer Our friends were the last production that really blew me away and that 10 years ago. But the belief is restored and the honor is satisfied. David Tenant was incredible! I could think of many actors that I used to come to town in such a city, but once I never saw Mr. Tenant as an actor or a doctor, what I saw was Alan Hamilton. Since the days of Daniel Craig's work as a Jordy Peacock all those years, my heart has not been so vulnerable. Sarah Parish was incredible and I really hope this role will play her good role in the future. All the cast was great but the specifications must be directed to the director who really kept us inside the Allan Head. Toaster view, in particular, seems quite queasy to me.
