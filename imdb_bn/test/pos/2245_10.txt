Again, Doctor supplies the product by bucket load. It's humor ("you're just making it as well!" "Yes, but I'm doing it brilliantly"), action, monsters (in this case still more kick-ass cyberman), tragedy and fear tactics. In short, exactly what the doctor orders (pun intended). The way the passions move from one another to another is accomplished in such a way that there is no feeling "to walk with it". So, up 3 out of the last 4 episodes that made you laugh, then you cried, and made you "eek". <br /> <br /> This clearly shows Nike Clarke's Mickey (and Ricky) clinic for the character development. Being one of the doctors in the doctor, you know that he will do the right thing and he can doubt the procedure he has done. But even after confirming its future, it is a mental wrench. <br /> <br /> "The rise of cybermen" became even more terrifying for terror, "the era of steel" was all explosion out. "Alien" is better than "Alien" - both are classic, but in different ways. Can this series keep it at this level? So let's hope so.
