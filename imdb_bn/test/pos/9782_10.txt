When I heard that there should be an ABC [Australian Broadcasting Corporation] mini series based on Changji [WDIII POS] Camp's living ..., keeping an eye on the "comedy element", I was deeply suspicious and somewhat critical. <Br> <br /> My father served in World War II. The Japanese were barbaric, they were able to speak only about the dangers surrounding Labuan and its surroundings recently. Along with my dad, I have been fortunate enough to know many great men (stronger characters and souls than I have ever seen) who saw unreasonable barbarity in the hands of the Japanese Empire and did not completely recover. The name 'changi' has been known from time to time to discourage horror pictures from time to time. <br /> <br /> But after watching, I was very impressed with this excellent series of cast, characters and complex plot-lines. . I'm now considering 'Changi' as my week's highlight, (Remember, I have only seen three episodes so far ... I hope the rest of the episodes will comply with the first three standards). <br /> <br> The black smile works well undeniably (however, the flutulence jokes are a little overdone), and most of the horrors have been suppressed, but the series continues later that those who survive come quite close to recovering the unbearable soul. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When sadly Experiences of stress are experienced, sometimes years after horror scary. <br /> <br /> One of the darkest chapters of the second world war, 20th century, and, (as far as I want to say in human history), travels through this series of a new GH, and I hope it is generated by warlike generations. Helps to rehabilitate a huge shocking response. <br /> <br /> 'Changi' is going on, I do not think that I will ever be able to listen to the mood, as is the case with 'Gangetic streets' again. Begin...
