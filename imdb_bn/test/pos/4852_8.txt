This is a film that everyone thinks of a Jew. It is a movie of Lawrence Newman, who lived in Brooklyn in the 1940s during World War II. One day, when he gets his glasses, people think he is a Jew. And that's why he looks like one. And he lives very antisemitic around. So some people started behaving like dirt. They also make this verdict as a Jew of Larry's new wife, Gertrude Hart. Lives in a helpless life. Neal Slavins Focus (2001) is a fairly good look of antisemitism. This is a problem that can not go away. This movie was based on the novel of Aturu Miller, which I admit, I did not read. But the movie is really good, so I'm sure the book will also be. Actors do well. William H. Messi is always good, and his work like Larry Newman is brilliant. Laura Darn Gart Heart and she is awesome. Like the owner of the Mid-Luff Jewish store, David Pemmer's character is almost frightened as a neighbor who wants to keep a neighbor as Jewish. Finkelstein is the most sympathetic of the film. Perfect choice for palmar roles. In this case, the greatest scenes end when Mr. Finlsteen and Newman fight baseball bats with the Nazi people. Evil Christians and Jews
