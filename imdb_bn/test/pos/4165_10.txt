I'll shorten this. It was a pleasure to see. Although the letters are similar to their real life counterparts, it may or may not be more effective, but since this minor observation I think fantasy characters are most enjoyable. Scenes were the most stunning except for the second scene CJ Scenes, which can be omitted. However, I dislike the computer-generated animation, it will lose biopic like this. See it, you will be very grateful!
