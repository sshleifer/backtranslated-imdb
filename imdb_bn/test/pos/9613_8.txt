I saw this movie in the base movie theater when the Air Force was in it, so that in the presence of the theater at night, my love for this may be affected by the reaction of a rude audience. But I think this movie was one of the first popular Kung Fu movies and helped to start the trend in the early 70's. It's worth watching.
