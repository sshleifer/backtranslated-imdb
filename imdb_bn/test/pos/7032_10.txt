Last night I saw this movie for the first time and I enjoyed every aspect of it? Dance, acting, conversation, plot, script and the entire environment that creates this film. I would highly recommend <br /> <br /> Jennifer Gray Francis (Baby) gave her astonishing and first-class performance in her role as Hausanne. She has a natural ability and mood for dancing and she is beautiful and enchanting on the dance floor. But what's wonderful about the baby is that her character has such a deep depth and dimension. This is not just a movie about dance, but the authors give us the opportunity to experience the various emotions and feelings around the film, to see the behavior of the child and to inspire others to communicate with others in changing our camps. His life Gray portrays this character with the reality that you feel deeply for the child, because he feels all that he does in this movie. <br /> <br /> Her role as Patrick Swayze Johnny is great and really her character come alive. He gives a wide personality, powerful application and great depth to his character. Chemistry in Swayze and Gray contributed significantly to the enchanting and powerful and great success of this movie. His role in Cynthia Rhodes Penny is great and he has his experience that the drawing of his drawings really strengthens and contributes to an awesome dimension of film. Supporting cast members? Jerry Orbatch and the late Mark Cantor have the ability to get a special mention here - it also provides extraordinary and fantastic performance which gives this movie an extra level of high quality and credibility which is a wonderful experience. All involved in dance are magnificent and first class. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> The plot, though highly esteemed, has been given more than enough life and lively to make this movie successful. Along with <br /> <br />, the wonderful selection of music in this movie creates a true magic environment and very nostalgic environment which enhances the quality and success of different scenes. <br /> <br /> 'Dirty Dance' is really a strong, beautiful and very interesting movie that touches you deeply and inspires your heart and soul's wonderful feeling and inspiration for dance. I highly recommend it
