In 1242 Russia was attacked by two sides: from the direction of Mongol and Europe, by the German Tutnik Knights of the Holy Roman Empire. Navegor City is the last city in Russia. In order to organize populations, Novgorods and Russian defense of the country, Prince Alexander Nevsky was summoned by defeating Swedish in the previous war. After a great fight on a frozen lake, Germans defeated its successful strategy,. Due to the Russian threat of Germany in 1938, the film was made in the second phase of World War II. The idea was to campaign for Russia. However, this is a wonderful, wonderful, stunning powerful masterpiece. It's amazing on the frozen lake battlefield. The current generation is accustomed to the special effects, such as 'the Ling of the Rings' triangle, and probably can not understand how wonderful this black and white war is. If the audience forgets the ideology and can see it as an art, then he must be amazed by such a wonderful composition. My vote ten <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Alexander Nevsky
