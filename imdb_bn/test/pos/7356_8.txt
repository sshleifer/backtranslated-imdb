This movie was talked about in Fangoriya where I heard about it, it was very interesting to me because it was in the direct video and I recognized the two stars of the cover, James Merceden of dangerous behavior and the Crafts from Christine Taylor. And after my surprise in Valentine's Day, when I was searching around with a scary rope to find it! I had to grab it immediately. I and my brothers and our friends saw it and it was good after my surprise, the story was interesting and once they were actually scary, many horror movies were being made recently. I do not understand some plot but once I saw that I could get it. And I was also surprised that I included one of the girls of Real World from another television television show MySaiSo-Claude Life and Jackinda, I'm not sure why this movie was direct video, how much to make this movie with a little advertisement The money spent could be made at least. My only problem is that it is not released in theaters because I think I will never be able to watch it on the widescreen. You should definitely take an opportunity and rent this out. <br /> <br />
