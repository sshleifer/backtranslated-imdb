Some of these boards have predicted that the whole thing is dreamed by the best friend of the hero, even though he has not seen a friend for 20 years. I'm reluctant to dismiss this out of hand but it does not raise some effective questions. Why the telephone engineer - or the shoe salesman or the Butcher - want to create a mythological world and equally create a set of legendary supporting characters in the process with the public. That friend with a fantasy should be writing well-written dreams. Dream or no one, and the candid candidate Paolo Cerrito, has created a very observable world, among which Tony Serilo stability creates a fine art. We believe that forty things "Troubled" Mafia a few years before Tita La Girlamo (Survilio) met us and as a key to the virtual prisoner in a small Swiss hotel, a suitcase containing every nine she notes of local bank-notes With In addition to what he likes and likes to do this weekly tour, he smokes, plays cards with a person who is cheated and a wife who reminds him of how socially he has fallen, and ignores Olivia's friendly cover Magnani, who spent two years and tried to get her a 'good evening'. Inconsistent with a person who is not interested in himself and any person interested in anyone, Survilla spends time while applying stethoscope on his bedroom wall and listening to his personal conversation on the card - the partner is playing. Eventually he responded to Magnani - he must do it or he will not be a film. This plot 6f: One like Destiny, who never goes to gun or sun (Duke Wayne), 'Quiet Man', who refuses to become excited and struggles on the battlefield and struggles to face the boxing scene. Instead of pleasing himself with the volunteer, Sti Ojie bought a car and removed 100,000 from the suitcase. The final inconsistency occurs when Magnani tells him that he will save him at 4 pm at 4:00 pm and take him to the mountain to celebrate his birthday. We have lived locally, so why did he see miles from somewhere far away, police have been ignoring the road block to drive on the road, and anyone's idea of ​​the car breaks. These inconsistencies remain apart from a fine piece of film making with a nice lead performance and a very good supporter.
