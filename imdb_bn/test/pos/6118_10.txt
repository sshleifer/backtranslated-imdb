I like this thing. The most surprising thing about Pink Fliming is that it tries desperately to taste terrible, but it has really made a god following the global followings. Saying a lot about us (we're being human) is not it? Pink Flimos has been successful because Waters made such a photo that he wanted to create. To succeed in a film does not have to be obnoxious, but may be. When you watch this movie, you see the things that are hateful, but it is finally shining because it is freely displayed. What we have here is an honest piece of personal creative expression. Anyone who always thinks of being successful as an artist, whether it is in the film or in any other media, will watch this movie.
