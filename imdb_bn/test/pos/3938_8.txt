I was really surprised, unlike most of the documentary, it was written, directed and produced by a film critic - Richard Schickel. Most of the time, I came to know about the major role played by film critics in movies, the bombing of movies ("Mera Breconriz" and Roger Ebert's "Bold the Valle of the Dals" are the main examples of this). However, in this case, the critics' strengths are not used for good and bad and the results are better (although it is not saying too much, since the pictures I mentioned are one of the worst movies.) <Br /> <br / > As a documentary, it is narrated by Clint Eastwood (a beautiful choice) and is directed to discuss his long-term activities - his silent day was In the early 1960's. The only negative, and they are little, the film is very small (mostly like a movie documentary) and there are few people about Gary Cooper - you really do not learn much about his life. However, as a beautiful overview of his film, it works very well.
