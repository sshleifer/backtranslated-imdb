"Best in Show" is definitely the fun and deep movie of Christopher's guest. Characters have been portrayed nicely and the connection to the pet owner has added a new level comedy to the film. I was a fan of the guest on Spinal Tap but in reality, he made what he did in "Mak-Memorial", he discovered, and he is now perfect.
