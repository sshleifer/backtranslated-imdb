Although I agree that there is no real substance in this film and it should not be taken seriously, it is initially directed to fans of the series who are trying to amend it quickly. Brosnan (Paul Cursee) has been on the street again (the main police is not licensed to kill him) and his friends have gone to the apartment (where you assumed it), the street gang that took control of the neighborhood, which looks like Beruit). It is interesting that people associated with the brochure used to be the killers. The bronzing regularly kills one after another, because the surrounding people are used against it. Bronze and Fructor have some dynamism that leads to the street gang, you can say they both enjoy their work. After being leaked to the city prison at one stage of the photo, Fructor says, "I'm just going to kill a little lady for you, hold it at 6:00." "Jigler", a Paris thief who laughs for committing his crime, is also enjoyable. The film was made in 1985, and most likely, most people can identify with film stereotypical urban gangs employed in the film. Bronze (Paul Cursee) is a great way to get rid of this fun street. Watch for the appearance of Wilde Magnum, a serious part of Brandon-powered hardware. I really liked the soundtrack of this movie.
