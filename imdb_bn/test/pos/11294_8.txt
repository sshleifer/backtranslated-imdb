I saw 'Begton' last night, and I have two minds in this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm thankful for Michael Bay's total inverted film. No conversations, highly stylized Danny B. and Wang photography, sometimes the most real horror imagery set in film, and very strong use of the word (which seems to not be picked up by someone else yet). This is a reflection of the theme and it has the courage to see that most filmmakers are not only about film but also in production and concept. This is a movie that most people do not understand, and if you read these comments, you will find many people who, due to their lack of ability to portray this film, have their cage bars at the time of 'persuasion' during their induction of a ghiban rhetoric. It really made me amazement and annoyed me, and the last time a movie was conducted which happened a while ago. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is 30 minutes short and spends more than an hour. Half I understand that there may be artistic qualifications for repetition and use of such kind of pensing as bluesgen, but in this case it does not support everything hanging together. A street man on the street imagined you on your shoulders and said something that completely misleads your own worth ... but then, instead of breaking and leaving you awake, he only talks and talks and talks . At the end of the film, I look back at my watch. <br /> <br /> This is entertainment, not people. This is disentertainment. In this way you only depreciate people who have seen "shiny". If you watch movies for entertainment, it will be frustrating, confused, and possibly angry. You do not want to contact Begoton as you would like to eat the chocolate cake because it is a good taste. Something that you have never heard of in the menu that you have ever heard has reached you like this, something you are seeing through the kitchen door, something that is dark and glistens and blurred on its plate; Something that you do not order because it will taste good, but because it's just to know what it is.
