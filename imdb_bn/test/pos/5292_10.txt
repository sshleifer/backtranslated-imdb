Probably not the best thing in Miyazaki, but I could not help but love death. A five year old boy thinks that a goldfish stuck in a bottle He saved his life and kept it in a bucket as a pet, but it is actually a magician, human wizard and goddess of the sea. Piano, as the boy puts his name, is brought back to the sea by his father, who tries to get him back home and discourage him from being a man, but he falls in his magic under Eliassi and he does whatever he wants to do. The story is simple and clever. Although the film is really alive, it is an amazing artwork. Draws are more childish than Miajaki's other works, but its simplicity has its beauty. Miyazaki with all his films created this world of imagination that I was so scared. It looks like this was when Smith notes the score of Joe Hiyashi's score on Smith's face and washed on me and gave me a hint of just a decade ago (here the score is equally surprising). I wanted to live in this world and did not leave it.
