Yes it wannabe a fast times, but it's still decent entertainment. <br /> <br /> Some comedy parts are really fun. When the three Spanish ladies visit the scene, it is a little flamenco music in the background. The reaction to a riot when his sailor's husband comes home. Boy's exploitation in dealing with the crew is funny, when it "drowns" and when they try to visit the pharmacist, it's funny too <br /> <br /> Abortion scene is a fast-paced Rephof, but it does a good job of catching the situation terrorism. You are truly feeling for Karen going through and Gary is suitable for her abortion for abortions and money for her recovery. <br /> <br /> painful to see the end, but instantly realistic. For the first time visitors will not be prepared for it and it will be a shock. <br /> <br /> Young girls and milf have a decent eye candy for men with Spanish lady, but heterosexual boys probably want to avoid penis size competition. <br /> <br /> uninterrupted soundtracks too. Get started initially, the first U2 (!), By their main car and by Car James England, for a wonderful ending of a suitable tier-song song. Some people will hate it and it is somewhat dated, but those who like tin flicks or should grow up in the 80's.
