Here, in contrast to the previous correspondents, I think Shoppen Munich (it was billed when the English subtitles were displayed in London in the German film festival in November 2007) was very fun, very well played and excellent script. <Br /> <br /> It is very weird to design a 100-minute film, which is exclusively, and steadfastly in the talking head. But I think the Ralph Westhoff has succeeded with intelligence and talent. An ideal film-related device, following the relatives-barbaric declaration of some characters, some gradually-including seven-church music and long-shot nature cutouts. But when someone said something that revealed their souls - all right, we used to hate the timer for another patronage. Which, of course, dot: hurting tickbox superficiality to Thirtysomething cities, where everything is answered and answers to a quick question. <br /> <br /> Most of the movies are so stereo and stupid that we smile in any strange and irrational movie that is ready in English, but I can promise you that during the screening (tonight, Surya 25 November 2007) the whole audience laughs Mostly sunny with <br /> <br /> My girlfriend (who speaks German and lives in Munich) thinks he is a laugh I (who can not speak German and do not have Munich, I think) it was ridiculous. I am happy to think that anyone (especially a couple ...) would recommend Superpena (Munich) to shopping, patronizing modern relationships and looking smart, malicious, original, intelligent movies about the brutality of generations. <br /> <br /> While showing the NB English subtitles in London, the subtitles (which were very good) were shown completely below the very least image, not inside it. I had a good thieves in this.
