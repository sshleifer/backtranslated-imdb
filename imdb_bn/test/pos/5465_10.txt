I'm back from Santa Fe. Nm I visited Loreto Chapel. I looked around this building, which was acquired by a private owner, I released the movie version of the stairs. This is a luxury mystery that occupies this building. You really have to believe that what can happen about it. There is a story in the bookstore, which is the story of the stairs. I describe it in its completeness I was absorbed by the ambiance of the people around there. It was we thought completely at the same time, all with the same thought and fear. When we left, Hughes was very excited. Everyone needs to visit Santa Fe at Loreto Chapel. Nm
