This movie gives you more ideas on how to play in Australia. Although Castle is a great Australian movie, it has a bit out of it. This movie I saw was the best Australian flick (I have not seen Dirty Deeds yet) and probably will be my favorite movie. Check the point if you have not seen it. If a crime / action / comedy is your thing.
