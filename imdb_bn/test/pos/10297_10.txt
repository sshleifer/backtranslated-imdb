This is a fabulous movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is a good twist, and fantasticly said in a series of flashbacks and alternative perspectives. What was deliberate, and what was the coincidence? Who is in love with? <br /> <br /> You will get the chance to change yourself (sometimes literally) across each letter, and it helps to define each character in a satisfactory way. <Br> <br /> After a few tries, twists and turns, you can understand each letter; And the main events of the film are re-photoshoped from different people's perspectives. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It looks great on the big screen. <br /> <br /> More than you guess, the plot changes so much that you just see what I see - I refuse to predict! <br /> <br /> Perhaps you will need to see more than one - I have seen his real release three times in this movie, and it has become better every time. <br /> <br /> The performance was very good, like Alice, the romance of Roman Boehringer is split between three characters in three ways. <br /> <br /> A classic. 1990's second best film
