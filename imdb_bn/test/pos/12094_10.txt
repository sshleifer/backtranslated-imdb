Turkish culture is accomplished with lots of different cultures. Different cultures have different styles of music. Like the blends of Istanbul Turkey. It's mostly the same language but there are different dialects. This documentary shows us these different types of music with different dialects and different instruments. You can see singers and groups reporting their performances, their music and their music with their daily life and learning to think. The film is not Istanbul's music but it includes the life of Istanbul, how people communicate and what they eat and drink. Although the wonderful part I live in Istanbul, I learned a lot from this movie.
