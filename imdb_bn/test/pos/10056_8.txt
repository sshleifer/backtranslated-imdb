I'm not a fan of Madonna for a while, but I think I'll comment on this picture. <br /> <br /> This image is wrong. One of them, as well as Madonna, was banned by critics. They were very wrong and many potential visitors were stopped by bad reviews. <br /> <br /> First, Madonna did a great job in this film, which was her first. She plays a ditsy blonde in the film, she is far from a ditsy blonde in real life. Most critics were somewhat ancestor by his singing fame and did not allow him to give a fair shake. When you watch this movie, I hope that you understand that the pronunciation and fool are just acting. She was absolutely hysterical as the film. <br /> <br /> Griffen Dunne is another person who has not given a fair review to the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gere success. It's a goof-ball comedy that features plenty of site gags, slapsticks, and one liner. The comedy takes a comedy aficionado to some extent and to appreciate more ridiculous humor. <br /> <br /> I know that you will not say a lot about this movie, but I hope it will help to remove any belief that this is a poor movie. It's absolutely worth hiring for a fun night of fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gary
