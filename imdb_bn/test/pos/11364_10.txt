In 1961, this series was shown on local TV in southern California. I have been suppressing the BBC for tape or DVD since and after a lot. Suddenly, here it is in the Amazon. I ordered in advance in January and now it has reached the 30th of March. It was a long wait (48 years). Was it worth it? So far I have seen Richard II (I've got DVD from 2 degrees) and I can really say YEA !!! Full price waiting. The acting, direction, and production is fantastic and I remember even better. Production B & D but it fits in any way. The video is clear and very good, the sound is flawless. The real proof of how long Shakespeare is. <br /> <br /> I gave these 10 stars even though I only saw 8 plays. I'm sure when I look at them all I'll change my rating to at least 12. <br /> <br /> This is currently stock at a reasonable price at Amazon (US Zone 1). <br /> <br /> I want to stop well now so that I can come back again. Later Henry IV, Part 1, which is my best Shakespeare game of all time.
