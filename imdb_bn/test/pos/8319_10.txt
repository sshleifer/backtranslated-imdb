This series was lived 65 million years ago by dinosaurs. Dinosaurs look very real and when they are moved very realistic. Climate change is also very interesting. <br /> <br /> I am very interesting about how dinosaurs survived and died. I'm also interesting about how dinosaurs behave. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to see and discover the color of dinosaurs. They thought they were in a color. <br /> <br /> Most dinosaurs died and what happened after this <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
