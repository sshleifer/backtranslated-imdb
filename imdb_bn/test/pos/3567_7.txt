- A group of gunmen is carrying it a gold robbery robbery train. In their escape, bandits split. A thief knows that where the gold is hiding, he dies before speaking. Three men have a separate piece of "yarn" which will lead to gold. Can the banker, the bandit, and the monsters work together to detect the loot of the hunters? Or they will kill each other? - The plot is a clear off of Leon's The Good, the Bad, and Fog. Various scenes from the movie were taken from Lyon, Arabian, and many other movies. But, it has been done to me that is not showing disrespect to the original work. Instead, some of the biggest films in any of the Guns Spaghetti Western History can play parody lovingly. The first scene of three people traveling between three main streets and the final face of the three major stars was the SD. It's a great tribute to <br /> <br /> - Castellari adds many beautiful touches on her own - the impressionable wine reflection, the stranger's entrance with the strange red background, and finally discovered the plain way of gold. Although extremely incredible, the battle scenes are much better staged and operated. Especially two battle scenes (war in the market and bathing houses) are done very nicely. She is brave to try different things with her camera. All of the tight closed-up, overhead shots, and all the songs around the corner can multiply any song. <br /> <br /> - Another plus was to work with Castellari. George Hilton is always good at this movie. Gilbert Rowland is literally playing Gilbert Roland. And SW Newcomer Ed Byers was in his own team with two relatives. Supporting Cast Feature, among others, sd Regular Gerard Herrer. <br /> <br /> - You should not take any music very seriously. Nice touch of laughter can be found throughout the film. If it is possible with a SW, then it is a lot more like "Happiness" - something memorable for Terence Hill / Bud Spencer movies.
