Now, I understand that most people here trash the young warriors or type it "so funny" fun "entertainment", but lets me do some cleaning: this is actually a low cost part of the rental, if you want to see a critical eye Without the movie In fact, it was much more entertaining and more worried than 80% of action films. <br /> <br /> What is the significance of this picture? I always search for psyches of characters involved in the aspiring, especially when they are a hungry for movies that deal with the issue of awareness. Young Warriors' First Death Wish can not have the intelligence or sensitivity of the movie (and yes, I think both elements were among the first elements), but it is trying to isolate the run-of-the-mill-canon films. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> assaulted by a solid street gang. Students have been on the road to fight for street crime, because they do not know who is responsible for the gang. They finally get some heavy surgical (machine guns and grenades) and fully armed in the night. However, this is not a kind of showerhouse; They are weak, inexperienced novels who make big mistakes almost every time to clean the city (usually with their fried mascot dog hat). They eventually decide to follow the gang and go after them, but then you will not expect an ideal measure where the good people will go helplessly. <br /> <br /> An incident that struck me is curious yet effective that the first thing most do not give any indication that we will see any step or violence later because it is a stupid comedy that you are all night in the United States (Where I believe it was actually shown at one time). The comedy set-up actually forgot me that the VHS cover shows a guy with a machine gun behind a man riding a motorcycle on his motorcycle. Then, when violence finally comes, it's not fun or intelligent ... it's frustrating annoying. From the point of the film, a complete bloody, disrespectful activity has arisen, which is involved in some amazing gunfights and Gore. <br /> <br /> Acting, though not something special, I'm far weaker than expected. James Van Patin, who plays the playwright, all of them and his performance are surprisingly good for this kind of film. The rest of the cast has been invested equally, as always the father of the reliable Ernest Burgenone hero. The cinematography is the same and the above visible scenes are managed which I personally would not have expected. <br /> <br /> I understand why some people think that this movie disagrees because it is very dated, but those facets hit me as cold and nothing short of themselves. Van Paten's character is animated and its patent's 80th style work is featured on several scenes, which is a transcendental film boyfriend's psychedelic wet dream. I'm sure most of the contemporary visitors will quote those moments as in the movie below, but I disagree. Also, Joe Walsh's soundtrack - sounds like this can only be recorded in '83 - especially regardless of how it sounds "old", especially special and enjoyable. <br /> <br /> 80's Action films and I strongly inspired anyone interested in genre to take a look. Sadly, this post is only published in VHS, and it is not shown on TV this day. A beautiful DVD presentation will make me walk around the moon around my living room with my intensity as the key to moving around my house. In the meantime, I would like you to go to eBay or Amazon and cough for ten rupees or old big-box tape. It's really an extraordinary staple of aspiring trash movies.
