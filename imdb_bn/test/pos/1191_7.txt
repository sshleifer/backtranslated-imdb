I have avoided watching this movie for some time but eventually pick a copy. It's too late to see 'hair' in contemporary settings, I've been familiar with UK and Broadway cast recording for years; And at the end of the 1980s it looked on the stage where it looked a little shocked but still, fun fun. <br /> <br /> image. It drops some songs (The Bed, My Convocation, Frank Mills) and cuts others (walking in space). However, what is left is really very well presented. All the singers and dancers are excellent, and the main actors (especially as Williams Burger, as Beaverly d'Angelo Sheela, as John Schweiz Cloud) are memorable. <br /> <br /> As a hippie celebration and song, 'Hair in a picture that has been delayed for more than ten years causes the hair to become stronger'. It was no longer the peace, love, and the era of the times, but during the punk rock ... Although this picture now resonates with the Iraqi problems, in the 1960s, the new resonance in Vietnam. <Br> <br /> The Milos Farman, who created 'Amadas', did a good job of directing. It's an opportunity and it seems to remind me of the joy of 'Jesus Christ Superstar', especially 'Aquarius' scene and the intimate of 'Easy To Be Hard' by 'Numan Jusson'. <br /> <br /> I've really enjoyed the film and considered it a good presentation of a musical born out of a real procession era.
