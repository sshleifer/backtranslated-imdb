A rich experience can be gained from seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> This is an easy-to-read story by a gifted student EU Kavac, who later became a teacher of classical Chinese poetry. He is married with two sons, and the house seems to be normal in the ordinary. After 20th century of marriage, he loves his wife, and his sons meet him with despicable (big) and despair (small). <br /> <br /> Her passion for poetry gives him an object of infatuation for one of his classes one of the senior students. Student, Choi Lam, painted her picture during classes, significantly, her one with a flower coming from her face. She teases him more with her intelligence than her sexuality, even though that is a very element. He is certainly not resistant to his attention, although he is trying for a few minutes to keep the restriction line between the teacher and the student. <br /> <br /> Why will not he finally succeed? Firstly, there is a real depth for him and Chio Lam. It becomes clear that he really likes him, and it is mutual. Second, there is a long lasting problem in his marriage when both his wife and his wife became ill. The consequences of the consequences of being associated with this friend of both past and present are often tragic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All characters have an animated internal life, and have a easily discernible history. Two chakras, Jackie Chung and Anita Maui, are fantastic, such as Karna Lam like Chen Lama and Shan copper like Big Boy On Yin <br /> <br /> Recommended without reservation.
