One of my favorite lines of Shakespeare <br /> <br /> e.g. * We did not finish with you by a long shot * So Shylock did not get his pound of just one meat, or dacats 3,000 or 6,000 or 36,000 (6 parts were in each ducat), a matter of minutes he was destroyed by all his property fraud. And her daughter has left her for a long time. <br /> <br /> Revenge is a dish served cold. But Shaykh's retaliation revenge completely backfires. <br /> <br /> I suspect this game was popular and because it meets our wishes for justice. But the harsh reality is that the world is in crisis and most of it is standing. Some big names go jailed, SM gang punks 'good guys' lose their turf but in reality it is almost the other way around it. <br /> <br /> But not in this game. The long sigh of anti-racial and antisemism is forgotten that it can be another disfigured group that is profitable, at that time that money holder was a Jew and therefore the need for story line plays Shylak as a Jew. <br /> <br /> Venice's commercial favorite Shakespeare's 3rd favorite, 1 and 2 Hamlet and Macbeth. This production story gives moral excellent treatment. Viewing price with single suitors. They also reduced the issue of unrest and finalization of new husbands, so that they took the oath of eternal life forever. In real life, this trick is to remind the good half of the spouses to take advantage of the promise that the commitment must not be made nonsense and foolishly. This game has a lot of importance in comparison to comedy / dramatic perspectives. It's about loyalty, commitment, and love. <br /> <br /> A good overview is more valuable.
