Warm, most compelling movies, those lipas, those eyes, made me laugh and cried because it reminded me of the work that was done to make me dream and frustration. Hulce and Langella looks fantastic and write stories itself. A wonderful screenplay by David Shawbar (one of my favorites! - Watch Warriors and Nathothax for more ...) and beautiful sets of beautiful summer theater (I think) the story goes. You can not see this movie and do not want to miss everything and go to the theater! If you can find it, then check out this video.
