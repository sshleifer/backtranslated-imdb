A drug addiction mix of 70's including medicines parody and classic story lines. As I have often said about this glance - if you do not get it - you are astray ... like the classic line (parapharsed) "I got this emission and it will not go away. Can you give me this? "The nurse answers" I have 5 dollars and my wedding ring ... "Great Soundtrack. Classic "Hide nothing to hide". Surprisingly, it is close to the original plot - fundamentally no joke is in the way ... no more than 115 IQ is not seen to be violent. <br /> <br />
