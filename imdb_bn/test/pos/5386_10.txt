In the 2006 Senate Italian film festival, I saw "Heaven-Ship" ("HimelSkybet"). What a great movie! When the Telegraph of Belarus was perfect, this exciting story from Mars's first trip to an era in Danish Stampmook Saga The spaceship has no radio, and the heroes are brought back from the landing area through Horscart. Even the intertitles are pleasing ... some of them are written in the original Danish. <br /> <br /> Actors' acting is ridiculous, in most cases hand-written history But the set was amazing, easily conveying something a few years ago by Georges Melis (or a decade later in "Die Fro M Mund"). Of course, the plot is simple. The crew of the spaceship consists of seven slim boys and one fat slob. Guess no one cracks. Interestingly, everyone in this movie (except the dubious Professor Dubby) firmly believes in God. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ) And reaching Mars in six months. During the construction sequence, there is a very impressive set-up that must be a dancer: dozens of workers push through different aspects of activity, without any hesitation and no clash. Although Danish scientists are near the Moon and Venus, their ships "Excelsior" ("Packing materials"? When the ship (which horizontally flies horizontally vertically) gives Mars land, it is greeted by "Tuesday" - Martins - those Nordic blondes, all are extremely Enhanced pacifists and vegetarians. (As a highly developed meat-eating substitute, I am worried about that part <br /> <br /> Just enough, Mars like the Earth, there is an atmosphere similar to that of equal gravity, in the outer shot of Martin's landscape, a clear measurement of the Sun's Sun can be seen from the Earth. Can not help watch. In fact, the female older people here are thin on earth: Earth born hero and Martin May Both of them are mothers. Martianans speak the universal language, wear Awna on their clothes, greetings to the world's visitors with earth's earth ... Of course, they hold the North Pole up and down. <br /> <br /> Martin Marty's Mary, a beautiful Acting by the beautiful Danish actress. (Waiter, I'll have some Danish!) We see a martini dance of purity that was TV or laughing but really quite sensitive and beautiful. Also, Martin's funeral scene features a shot that reminds me of a sequence of "seventh seal". I'm wondering if Engmer Bergman saw this image. <br /> <br /> "HimelSkybet" has some errors, but its production design and its features exceed its drawbacks. Ole Welsen is named after credit (and who is present in short discussions) is not related to "Helzpappin" from Chuckon Johnson's Vaudville partner. I'll give "Heimelskibbet" 12, but scale 10 will be closed ... So, 10 full 10, blonde planets for this lovely tour of Mars!
