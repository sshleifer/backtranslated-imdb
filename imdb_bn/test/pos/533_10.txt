Adam Sandler's movie is my favorite comedy. The silence of Lambs is my favorite horror movie. Matrix is ​​my favorite Sci-Fi movie. Anywhere but my favorite drama here <br /> <br /> Perhaps this movie plays the most valuable resource in it's single. <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandan is absolutely amazing. At the end of this movie, I felt that I knew myself well enough to know her character. She works a simple wonder. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman also did a great job. I recently rented his first movie, Leon (1994), where he played 12-year-old girl. I believe that there is a conflict on condition; She was a good child actress. Well, after 5 years, she is still good as the actress. Actually, she's pretty good. <br /> <br /> Sarandon and Portman did not just illustrate their characters well, but they worked perfectly together. I mean, even now I can not believe that they are actually a mother and a girl, and in fact not even in this movie. <br /> <br /> This film is a 14-year-old girl (Portman) and her unstable mother (Sarandon) who leaves her residence in Wisconsin for Beverly Hills. <br /> <br /> Portman initially hates her mother to take her away from her cousin and friends, and both of them started a very annoying relationship that started and for several years (usually down, I could add) Certainly down <br /> <br /> Although this explanation is a bit unclear, this plot can only be made vaguely vaguely. But when you look at this movie you will find that the plot is not really unclear or weak, because it is actually very deep. Unfortunately, the plot is unmarked, but then they pay attention to it for strengthening it. <br /> <br /> And it's very powerful, but the plot is also cool. And there are some brilliant scenes that I hope will ever be seen as "classic". <br /> <br /> I like this movie. I laughed I waved. And although, by the way, there are some flaws, it's still a starring movie and it really comes together.
