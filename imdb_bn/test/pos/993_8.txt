I did not expect to enjoy this. Actually I saw it because a friend knew that a friend knew that he did not credit the friend who wrote the script. Dylan knows Thomas and really expresses gratitude to his poetry but is conscious and distorted by the people, I do not think that I keep his hair bomhemian life empty. And it was not. Critical and still grateful it was. It made me cry Kiera Knightley was pretty fantastic, even with that little fade Welsh accent, and it's a sad story that they say. Dylan Thomas is not a hero like sadness that he did not live throughout his life, and actually is not the so-called 'skilled woman' of Pre-Spell. It is the movie's William Cillian. A man who leaves a woman who loves to fight for the sake of ignoring them. Its challenge to re-connect with this apathy, what is the real interest of this film and that's a beautiful performance from the actors. I implicitly thiink this film because it is so badly marketed. Dylan Thomas fans will expect more from their very disappointing heroes and will get less and be well marketed. This is not a movie about Dylan Thomas, and for this it is more interesting.
