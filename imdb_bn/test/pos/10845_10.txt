At the weekend I saw the movie tipping movie and if I want to score this movie out of 100, I have to ask 100 questions. I'm truly a true believer and this movie has been removed in different ways and the actors fit the part without any dirt. But I want to say that the end was not so great that I did not see the spark in the eyes of Nancy when she looked at the eye of the floor, because when she looked at her eyes became blurred, that was only in the room or Nancy's thoughts and Nancy was just Spark the sparks. Kinti told Nancy that she could not find him and she was looking for him, but could not find him. Nit was ready to give Kitti all to get back. Kitty eyes have Kitty pain. I believe that Nancy must show that her love is true and firm and she will not let her go easy. You have to create two parts and both of them have to combine it, but you do not let anyone else play as a real kitty and nancy, or it will never work. My mother once told me that true love is not just real. I'm not a fool, I know that we all have real love to wait for all of us and with my life, I believe that Nancy's true love is really the key and the real love of Kitty is just Nancy. Let's play the game in the right way, the only way. Let Nancy's eyes glow again ... Kitty lost everything by losing nancy. And what can not be the only blame. I'm not getting myself gay and gay easy! Wake up !!! In 1889, I did not want to be gay, the kitty lost herself deep inside and in 1888 there was a right to marry a man. Although you love a woman. Notta had to stand up to Nancy to fight for her. I myself feel that I love this girl deeply and I leave her because I thought I made a mistake and I went back to my ex-boyfriend. I thought I was doing the right thing, but I know that I was wrong to release him and I would pay for the rest of my day, as if I could not find him anywhere. I have heard that he is married to some people in the United States. I heard that he was killing her. I finally guess we lose both. Give more opportunities to two daughters, life can be very lonely if you and your loved ones are not true. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Kristen Ann
