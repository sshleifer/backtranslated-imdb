I absolutely hate the idea made for television films. For me, TVMs usually involve Jane Simu or Jacqueline Smith as the mother of a sick child, the disease that has become harder to treat than sugar that does not require hearing tissue, for which it requires insulin. So when based on the real story based on BBC and HBB TV movie Deadly Voice, I turned TV shodows a few weeks ago, sitting in the back, sitting sitting and sitting sitting and sitting sitting I was surprised <br /> <br /> No strikes last, I was surprised I was surprised. Here's a TVM that will make you harder than a brilliant white shark, in fact it is not worthy to make Dedley's voice and determine how it should be distributed by a very important human film and how it should be created due to its most awesome compound. It's even more - in contrast to Papillon and Slipper - the whole truth. <br /> <br /> Those guys do not know the story !!!!! Potential Spool as Plot !!!!! In the early 90's, a bunch of Africans were locked in a Ukrainian freight vessel to work for France. Of course it was an attempt to immigrate but the freight crew was already fined for permission to allow illegal immigrants to board their ship and there is no further problem with the marines and immigration authorities. Keep them secret. In addition to an African, Kingsley Ondu, who managed to escape from the firing squad, but who tries to survive on the ship, but the problem is that the crew is hunting them, and France is still a few days away from the journey. <br /> <br /> Just remember how well DiDio Voices is typed in the upper paragraphs. What extraordinary story, and again it - claims that many stories are like - the whole truth. It is very well written, directed and played, especially Shan Parateway (why that guy is a big name star?), And most of it is a clutrophobic boring thriller thriller, which I can still remember after six years, it's one and only time. I look forward to seeing again <br /> <br /> But you can ask yourself, how can TVV be better than the Hollywood action blockbusters that are almost at the same time? Hold on, Jerry Brickhammer about the reconstruction of Jerry Burkimier with a reminder about Jerry Brickhamer, and Daniel plays with King of Kings Washington, Brad Pitt is playing the role of Parvati, a massive artistic license passed with the event. Let's talk about an inexpensive TVM voice instead of a poor blockblaster
