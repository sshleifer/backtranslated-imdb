Soap is very interesting in an interesting movie and parts. It must be seen for your strong character and there are risks of plot about two sick people lying in love. You can certainly tell the story through several other reviews, so tell about the brightness about this movie. <br /> <br /> First, the two titles are so real and such a playful personality. The first is a woman who has ended the relationship for four years and is angry enough to sleep with her. The second is a man who always wanted to be a woman, whose pain and loneliness were shown with such sensitivity and brightness. You hate the past and your heart sheds blood for the next. <br /> <br /> The second issue of this movie is the complete concept of love for someone, without gender. So, if you want to change his sex, would you still love your partner? The idea that the film discovers and it is a beautiful one. <br /> <br /> But there is one point if the movie fails. I hope the relationship between the drama improves. What they think does not come to the end. But look at this, and post your thoughts here .......
