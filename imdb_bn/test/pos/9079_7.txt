I knew this was the picture of the flatlines that I was probably on my road. After watching the final destination, I was told about this movie and I was looking at additional features about the Dr eth experience. <br /> <br /> I bought DVDs of flatlines at a price less than Â£ 5. Got home and saw it. And I could not help, but it was sunny and well thought that this movie was never before in my life. This film is about a group of medical students, trying to see what it likes to see after the death experience. But then there actually comes back sin and can harm them physically. <br /> <br /> A great hope for you to be played from Kevin Bacon and Catherine Sotheraland. And Joel Schmacheur has made it a great movie as he is with the lost boys. <br /> <br /> It's a nice and stylish thriller kind of bound to film fan.
