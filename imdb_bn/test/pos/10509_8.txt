I can not see why everyone is making this bomb bomb. I thought it was not very famous that sadly it was not quite popular enough to be famous. Believe me I've seen so much worse than this. If you want a bad movie then see blood or aliens dead or something. So this is the usual slasher rental but the best is the best. And it is watchable. I have heard of this movie as one of the best soundtracks. Some of the music is very suspenseful. And death scenes are very cool. We sound in a bathtub with blood written on the mirror to see a bloody body, and we get a cool double injury by a toilet plunger! With razors attached! It's a good fun 80's slash which is worth your time in spite of telling others about it.
