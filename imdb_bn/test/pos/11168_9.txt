I read comments about this movie before watching it and do not expect much, but it's a curiosity as a B movie. I guess you must be a certain kind of person to enjoy such things, but I seriously thought it was horrible. People will only see it for the experience because it is completely one kind. Do not expect it much. Actor is poor, has been converted into a PC, and surely there is a B movie, yet it is really valuable to verify. Very funny. Light, and some suspicious themes, probably nothing to show your gran, but for the more brave spectators, I would say it must be seen.
