"Down Periscope" has been in our library since it first came in VHS. After that, we've got DVDs and a digital cinema from now on. <br /> <br /> This is a playful flashing game that does not go to the military as a private or conference. This is the first and foremost comedy and a car for the protagonists, I am surprised that no signals have ever been given. <br /> <br /> This film follows a border that is the desire of civilization, even in very young people. In 2002, I went to mobile ASP drums when I became aware of this. A group of graduates of my graduation have played their role from the movie and have planned to revive their top time on the board. <BR> <br /> This is a fun romp that makes you proud of our navy and Hollywood ... which is the rare company. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Chris Grammer, Loren Holly and Rob Schneider, otherwise extraordinary movies, such as great entertainment!
