I really wanted to write a title for this review, which did not stop like a brawler or a joke, but still described my feelings for this show. I can now see it is not possible. The pleasure of watching an "American family" television is one of the best shows for me. While describing this show, several critics of IMDB have termed this word as "beautiful". Ever a word has been more appropriate. Cinematography is stunning for this show. Each scene and shot looks like a masterpiece. Lighting, camera patch, scene structure and color ... I should remind myself that I am watching a TV show and not the masterpiece of the Motion Picture. The scores of Lee Holddj and Nathan Wang brought tears in my eyes. And most importantly, strange cast is all honest and sincere. I do not seem to see the performances ... I seem to see the real life. If only real life can be this beautiful. <br /> <br /> "American family" actually raised the bar for quality entertainment on television. I highly recommend this show to anyone who is willing to see it. I could easily prevent CBS to pass this program, but I need to say that it does not matter to me. I'm just happy to see it out there for everyone. So I do not want to thank PBS that this show has disappeared. <br /> <br /> I must give special recognition on the end of every season. The first one had pure creative brilliance and it moved my tears. I wait to see if Season Two will end in a creative way, and make sure it's not enough. Again, tears. <br /> <br /> Thanks to all those involved. You've really created a special piece of art with this show, and I mean that sincerely. It's a shame that we only got two seasons, but we got something in a miracle.
