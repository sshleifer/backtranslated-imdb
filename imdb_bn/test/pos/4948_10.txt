This was incredibly realistic, with an awesome movie on the flight scene! I have seen it multiple times and it has kept my attention every time. I myself also love to see a big fan of the Air Force and a movie where I can get a glimpse of an F-16 flying. If you like Top Songs, I'm sure you also like this movie. Except for some mild curiosity, it is an excellent film for the whole family. This is a great plot and there is not a dull moment throughout the whole movie. Each second step packs up and puts you on the edge of your seat to see what happens next. So again I recommend this movie !!!
