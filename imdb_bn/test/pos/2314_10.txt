As a former (atom) submarine officer, I must admit that this is my favorite submarine film (even more than Hunt for Red October). When they wrote the movie, someone knew something about submarines. All right - not realistic - but it's a comedy - and it has all the "internal joke" from the submarine force. A great cast with our heroes' rigid objectionable submarine son in "Orlando" and Diesel Boats. Of course "DBF" path = which means diesel boat forever. But they want ten lines in this post - JG Admiral Incharge here? <br /> <br /> Line 10.
