We still love movies and soundtrack "Valley Girl" really. I owned it in the video for eons and wore the original soundtrack out. I have a number of friends with whom I am together and we have "80's raves" - groups where we are together and play 80 songs and drive "Valley Girl" on the big screen - and we're all in 30 now. We have a great time. <br /> <br /> It's all good fun, like, know?
