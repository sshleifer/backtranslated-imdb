These three directors shut off from good start. Three stories have been well-done for independent productions and while capturing the terrifying feelings of "coming" when you're not really a good idea. I laugh at those veiled glances around the dressing room in "Pool Day"; I suppose that fans of Bit Middle, Judy Garland and Barbara Streisand are considered to be gay as "a friend of Dorothy" (meaning browsing through CD Music Racks). And I was crying over the "joke" of "The Disco Years", which is now "obscured" by sweet sex. It all seems so real. I look forward to more offers from the director this trio.
