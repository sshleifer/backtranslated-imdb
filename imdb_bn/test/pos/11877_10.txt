I am a big fan of Larkin's work, I believe he was among the greatest poets of the 20th century. The film itself is a great trial of the Hular Dam. Wonderfully portrayed their role by all the players. Bonneville is a serving of Larkin in sexual abuse, she avoids an impression and strays to become an impressive. The piece used in his poems was highlighting itself. Instead of expressing the intense intensity of Lorkin's feelings, using his words gives better insight into the plot, and more energetic but completely more attractive environment. Most enjoyable
