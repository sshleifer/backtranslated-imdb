Hey, now I've never looked at Manga comics, but apparently this movie is based on one. Well, like life. However, it's a fantastic bizarre, at least say, film, as the control of a small Japanese town literally spiral out. People are becoming overwhelmed with Uzumaki (spiral) and this young girl sees her friend's father's wobbly muddy, and then shoots folk shoots in the movie? It seems that this boy's father has become so disgusted that he committed suicide in a family appliance. Here are some bogus humor that may be at the house of Tim Burton, but there are some vestiges and cow-like things that the Japanese can do with trial. Although the ending of most Japanese films has ended, and some have been resolved? Well, not my mind, it's not. There are some indications of why all this is happening, but they are not searched or imagined enough or else it is not considered important. Yet, there are plenty of things to encourage for the eye and if you are not covered with everything in the perfect sense, it is very good to see, because it is only real and bizarre. My favorite father was Spinning Ivbal, personally 8 out of 10.
