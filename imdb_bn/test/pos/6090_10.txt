I like this movie above all others It is "multi-layered"; See and have a lot of praise. Each viewing story-line, plot and character brings a new perception. Faultly played and extremely enjoyable if you take time to visit it and appreciate it. I love interaction between players; Fine relationships; The atmosphere of time. Ralph Fiennes is completely embroiled as a brooding lover, and Jafrio has been nicely influenced by Colin Firth. Catherine and El-Massi are discussing various types of sand storms where the sand storm scene is one of the highlights of the movie and where it really starts. Another relationship between Hana and El-Masri is still another "layer" of the movie which is full of exciting (and heart-dyeing) Such a prize is a worthy winner.
