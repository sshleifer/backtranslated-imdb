This was such a great film. It was done with such beautiful design, parallel. I love the way to classical music, tied with the classical art of space and beyond. It was such an intelligent, and thought stimulating masterpiece. I never liked the nominees, although the vivid, the earth and the space took place. I like it, "Now do I need / need us"? The film has expressed desire, peace, love, curiosity, vitality, humility, courage and innocence. What more could you expect from a mere movie? Perhaps a supplementary movie. Any of 2001's admirers: A Space ODC. The film will find the supplementary film of the year 2010. More stories based on 2010
