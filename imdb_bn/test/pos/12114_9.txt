Yes, I know, Roscoo Urbakal was not liked to be called 'fatty', but I could not resist joke. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The pictures work with two good gags and Rozco's normal attention to the two interesting funny pictures. Most comedians prefer flat lighting and a camera that make them more attractive. Roscoe tells her story and uses a few long tracking shots and some nice camera trickery to show a fine actor, and ham as a talented comedian. <br /> <br /> This story plays with some interesting themes, like Lloyd's classic movie allong: Here it is the realization of reality and the confusion about the movies made by them. Or you may like to ignore such things and laugh at your head.
