After reading the previous negative comments, I had to put my two cents in. This show was not there, despite the absurdity of Assex, any bad event was broadcast on TV. I think most of today's TVs are worse (when will this stupid "reality" stain last ??) and I can not stand watching a current show. I grew up with. I am a child of 1965 and not ashamed to accept it. <br /> <br /> This show was my favorite of almost 30 years. I originally broadcasted when I was in high school and I think it helped me hang out throughout this sad day. I was so mischievous back then, and "fantasy island" appealed to my imagination. Since I was a rising writer at that time, it gave me incredible opportunity to practice fame. What a wonderful compound! I say it was not his fault. Sometimes the scripts were quite bad, and some issues seem to be trivial; But it could be very good, and see it and still had an explosion. As a sugar factor, well, I think it's unfair to label every single 70 product as sugar. Then there were some great things and these places were there. (BTW, most of the 80's are broadcasted !! !!) My favorite episodes have come from season 2, 3 and 4 of most of the time. <br /> <br /> Those who defeat Vilaschasez are disrespectful for his heavy French accent and his short comedy: Grow up and learn something! It is very easy to be fun when you are "normal" and "perfect" The person made the best of what he did in life, and if you do not like it, it is very difficult. There is a little sympathy. He died for 15 years, and how easy it is to cut someone who can protect himself. No longer shy. <br /> <br /> I love this show. So it shows the date. You hate to say it, but we did not have splashy special effects and Blu-ray discs. We were lucky to have the VCR. Living with it. Take it for what it is, and that's just a little fun. "Espipist TV" describes it perfectly, and it was for me - it was a turn of my rotten real life. And it's still a lot of fun to see.
