I waited for ages to comment on this program, and felt that it was almost complete. This is one of Cristy's bold, more cruel and engaging acts, not just killing anyone for money, it is a dark and perfectly compelling story, conspiracies, love and murder, designed properly by the adapter's correction. The acting level is absolutely fantastic, as part of Joan Hicksson is as glorious, as always! Leisure Fraser, Anna Cropper and Helen Cherry have played with Cast as everyone else, but my view is that the Margaret Tijak's theft was stolen, and the closed scene between Joan Hickson and Wizard is only witchcraft, acting as soon as possible, cool, moving and completely brilliant. <br /> <br /> Please let me comply with my words. I look at the remake to see how well Geraldine MacAyn's version is. See and enjoy.
