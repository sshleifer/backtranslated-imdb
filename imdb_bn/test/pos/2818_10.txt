I love to see a female drama, this movie was his name Rose. Rose's fullness brought many interesting questions to her journey. Is it possible to achieve peace and internal supplement by external means? What does our society teach? Can anyone be a victim of memory that can harm others? Is one environment responsible for being a product? Can control one's own or control the environment? How is a "normal" person everyday than single or different? Finally, if the results or stories change from any other country like France or Italy? I love that this movie has excited all these questions in me, when it's entertaining, stimulating, and guessing me to the end! Every time I saw it, I learned more about the film and me.
