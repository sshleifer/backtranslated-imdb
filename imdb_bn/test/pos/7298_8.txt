All right ... so I look through my mother and father's huge DVD collection (for most of the time, they do not charge late fees ;-)) and I'm "thousands of acres." I saw that there was a movie that was Jessica Lange and Michele Pfeiffer (with a small appearance of Jennifer Ledger) that I did not see. I do not think I've heard it even before. Well, this is the kind of dream I have seen, because I have to admit that my parents took my brother and my two movies. With a few exceptions (none of us can consider seeing the Lord of the Rings film, but my father matrix trilogy - go figure), our movies have the same taste. <br /> <br /> Today it is specially AWFUL day, weather-based. It poured rain all day, so I popped into this movie, and shortly after, I became gentle. <br /> <br /> I saw it as the best "sleeping" of all time. Jessica Creta and Michele Pfeiffer are great in their role because they are very different kind of games. Jessica Lange's character is a man-follower follower who rarely plays leadership in the family despite being a senior child. Rather, he rebuked his father (Jason Roberts) and sister Rose (Pfifaar) and taught her younger sister Caroline (Leigh) to follow the suit. Michelle Pfeiffer is a very strict deliberate cancer survivor who is not able to keep angry in her unhappy life. Five years before the film White Olander, you remember, he was inspired to show such a powerful, angry character. <br /> <br /> I would say that this film will probably appeal more to women. However, it is a difficult time to deny the joke of this drama about true movie buffs, which enjoys a movie for it, irrespective of what kind of or target audience, family secret secret plays and people related to them and their love. I do not know how I missed this movie now, but it was sure that a nice confusion in the rainy afternoon. ENJOY !!
