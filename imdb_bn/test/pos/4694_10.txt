By mistake, I gave a series order from the BBC on their new edition of Sunday Hood. Very frustrating than RoS. Awesome costuming and backgrounds I enjoyed the sheriff, took a comment from Nick Grace, and the rest cast was left to be desired. "For example", Marian's dress came from Walmart suspiciously. And sir Guy, well, he looked a bit like a character from an outdoor space movie! RoS stole spotlight, perhaps to tell this story, forever. Soundtracks by Cast, Costuming, Story Line, Scenes, Screenplay and Clandad are all superbly proven by all the continuous feedback, such as for over 26 years. RoS is a timeless classic. Thank you to me who made the series.
