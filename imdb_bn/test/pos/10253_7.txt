This 60-year-old age drama set is coming to Chicago, we follow a group of friends in high school when they navigate their life up and down. The two central characters are Layer "Promotions" Jackson (Turm√°n) and his best friend Richard "Kochis" Morris (Hilton-Jacob.) Both children have a committed future. Promotion is a great writer but a lazy student, and Cochise just got a college scholarship for basketball. When they do not cringe with their friends in the diner of local friends, or do not run behind friends or girls of friends, they leave school, run trains with Chicago or participate in the weekend quarter. <Br> <br /> If Priyach and Kochis are involved in two hood, then something went wrong when they are delighted in a stolen vehicle. The police pursued them and they were arrested. But due to the efforts of a related teacher (SNL's Garrett Morris) they are released. But not two hoods, and the promotion and commitment of Cochiz revenge, they blame the whole thing on them. <br /> <br /> This film is very spiritual, but it still works, because life is a series of episodes. Some are funny, some sad, some romantic, some bizarre. The film is not boring because all the characters have played so well and are realistic, and the situations are all credible and related. A group romantically romancing a beautiful girl or deciding to start a war on a party or while dealing with a barbarous younger brother, a group is becoming violent. But when the situation is not personally related, people want to prevent a hooker from some people who pretend to be secret police, so that they can get all their friends into a movie, but the sequence is still pleasant. <br /> <br /> 'Kolei Hi' was based on the classic 70's 'Watts Hapinine'! Which was broadcast from ABC since 1976-1979. Although the show is the most famous for the character of Raron, he is not in the film and he does not have any distant characters like him. The show's laughter was very broad, but still funny. The humorous story of 'Quli Hi' is real, and thus more entertaining. <br /> <br /> Extra, Soundtrack is wonderful. By the time Diana Ross and The Supermesses, The Temptations, Martha and Vandelas and Smoky Robinson, the classic songs started playing throughout the lifetime, adding fun, youth, brilliant voice to the film.
