Cleopatra 2525 is a very fun, entertaining show. You should not take all the shows seriously, but if you want to have fun, it's your TV show. Being made by Xena's producer is a quality guarantee, and Cleopatra 2525 is not different from JSA. The sources of female warriors are brought in the future, where they do not have to fight with their warriors or gods, but for the dangerous robots lying on the surface, and the people are forced to remain underground. With two episodes of Cleopatra, they develop an interesting and interesting underground earth and we can learn three main characters: Cleopatra (Jennifer Sky), Hell (Zina Torres) and Sirage (Victoria Pratt). They all are different, but as a team, they work really well. The three main actresses were previously present in the genre, mostly like regular / guest cast (there are some familiar faces from Hercules, or both shows). I especially like the character driven by Danielle Karamac (Jesse Affini), which I knew before, that her role was different. So if you like Zenna and Hercules, then you would like Cleopatra 2525. If you do not know them then try it: I'm sure you enjoy it.
