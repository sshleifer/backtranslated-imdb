I do not think it was the best film of 1987, perhaps it was one of the 10-20 best movies on my own indecent list. For any reason, I'm really connected to this movie, and it's one of the most personal movies I've ever seen in my life (I was 26 years old). For good or bad, I firmly identified with Hunter's character (and I'm a guy!). She plays a very bright, loyal and intense woman who can not find romantic relationships. The things he said in this movie were those that I told or told in similar circumstances. And the end of this movie I'm very happy, very sad. <br /> <br /> This role was obviously a great break for Hunter. Obviously, I was not the only one to think so much.
