How nice! I just have to say this show super cool! I fell in love with the show from the beginning! The idea of ​​the event is very original and very beautiful! It's a pleasure to see two delightful leading ladies, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel to see the delight! They're just amazing! I'm a big fan of Lorraine Graham in particular! She's not just a beautiful face, she's an actress in a "monster" as well! I'm not saying that Alexis is not a wonderful actress ... I just loved Lauren! Nevertheless it is a real pleasure to watch them on the screen, "sparing" with the word! Immersed in the words of Jim Carey, "Bee-e-Uteful!"
