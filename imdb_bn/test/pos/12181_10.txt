I am quite adaptable to this Anne Rice book. Although most of the movies here are portrayed in Australia, it offers a visual scene and an excellent area to shoot. Lestat (Stewart Townsend) has recently woken up from sleeping and has decided to cheat with his vampire oath. Express yourself a band. When he became a popular movie icon, his fellow vampire, understadbly, went crazy and his death plot. Meanwhile, Jesse (Margarute Mourou) is an orphan member of the supernatural research, which has an ancient Vampire family tree, deeply covered with Lestat. His master David (Paul McGan) realized his passion and revived his emotions with Marius (Vincent Perez), who was an old vampire and a person who also made Lashte a vampire. Jesse was given the diary of Lestat and read about his first assassination and a clash with the queen of Damascus - Alysa (Aleya). When Lestat holds the Death Valley concert, he has received the news that only Russia will not be on the side of the road, as well as the sky can come. Meanwhile, there are other plans in the sky. He coven a vampire, goes a bar, and killed everyone in his path. Lestat lured with the royalty and loving care of the sky, the plot against them against ancient Marsas and Jesse's Annie Mahratt (Lena Olin). <br /> <br /> I thought this picture was fantastic, it had great war scenes, great music and great location. Alayah was crashed in a very short time before the premiere of the film, but she looked stunning on the set and stopped the set. <br /> <br /> I gave this image 10/10 because it was a great movie and I want you to see it!
