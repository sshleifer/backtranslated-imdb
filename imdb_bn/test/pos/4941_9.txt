When I played the first solo album in the dream, I think it was fantastic. When I was the second game I was hooked. And finally when Soul Calibu was released the third, I bought a PlayStation 2 and the game. <br /> <br /> It could keep you for a few hours, loads a lot of letters, unlockable content and does not mention a great fighting system, this really dates the biggest battle game. <br /> <br /> Games are most important in strong points vs gameplay, two human players fight each other, one of the main characters or playing as a customized and customized character. Create character option is huge, and allows players to create thousands of different combinations. <br /> <br /> The only thing I am worried about is that if you create a character that uses the style of war, "Greed Edge" (only kicks) who have to wear ridiculous shoes. ^^ <br /> <br /> This is the greatest battle game that may be desired. Now, I hope the planned movie will not be painful.
