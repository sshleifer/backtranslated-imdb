Michelle Pfeiffer and Matthew Modine are a delight to see this sculble comedy. Alec Beldwin, when the film was made, there was an up and upcoming star, it was a hoot. Dean Stockwell on John Gotti's sentencing is violent. But Mercedes Ruelle, Paranod, and Top Koni have stolen the movie. <br /> <br /> Famous for the vacuum comedy like Jonathan Demme, who is "Something Wild" and "Melvin and Howard". A gifted I was not surprised when she went to win the Oscars to indicate "the silence of the Lambs". "Married" is inspired by his acting debut, and the audience is taken along a wild and tattoo ride. <br /> <br /> One of the 80's most perfect, most favorite movies, it shoulder top and shoulder above many ratios of its era.
