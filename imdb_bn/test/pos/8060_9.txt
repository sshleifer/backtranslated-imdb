This is a film that every child will see before it is grown and is distorted because generations of generation generation ideas are accepted. I grew up in two different places even though only 20 miles away. I went to school and had friends of religion and religion of each color for the first 8 years of my life. Then I went to Hilili country (though not now) where there was an African-American child in your class. In my high school, 2 or 3 African-Americans (Why do not I just say that black? You can call me intelligent or white or whatever! This political majority makes me the most!) Return to the movies however What happens when people see distorted scenes or lack any ignorance or understanding of any culture or country! This is a nice movie, especially for everyone to see the children.
