OK. Barney is the best show at all times? Of course not. But among the few comments from IMDB's other members, you think it's a million dollars in production with a ridiculous budget for high-class actors and special effects. What is a good guess? It's Barney for God He treats children well, looks good manors and shows that you are OK to be. For those of you who feel annoyed because you are five years old and the show is not meant for you. The IMDB member wrote a review on the first page, you seem to have gone too far. Have you actually described a Sesame Street character as "from the grassland" Everybody grow up, it's a great show for preschoolers and helps children to learn in a fun and creative way.
