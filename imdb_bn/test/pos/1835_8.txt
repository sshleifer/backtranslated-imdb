This movie is so cool It tells me to enjoy every moment of my fullness in life. I think Bonny Hunt (Jerry Maguire) wrote well and I'm very happy that he has given an adult actor an opportunity to play such a big role in the movie. It is truly a society, which worship wealth, health and youth, it is beautiful to watch a movie about ordinary people. The film reminds me a lot "when you were asleep" which I really love. If you do not like this movie you should work in your sensitivity skills. <br /> <br /> Favorite quote: Megan Dayton: "I'm saying, for safety, do not shave your legs, because it's definitely not going to go too far."

Megan Dayton: "I got married to the first date, I'm sure you are planning on the top of the head, but once you feel like a man's brain, I do not know what they say, suddenly it seems surprising. "Favorite view: Megan (Good Will Hunting) drives his bike. All the scenes in the garden.
