It was easily one of the Ernest films, especially for product design. What was up with the Pink Guard uniform? Sadly, this film probably destroyed the series of Ernest, transforming the series into a direct-to-video series. However, playing Jim Varney Nash, his criminal change gave one of his best performances by the ego. The series was a misconception, but in most cases it was not very bad. (Electro Man was routine classic)
