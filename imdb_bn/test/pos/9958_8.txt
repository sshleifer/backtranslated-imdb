"The Merchant of Venice" was one of Shakespeare's most popular plays during his own life, but due to the illogical anti-Semitic material of the 20th century, it was a difficult period. This game is called Sizyzoid under the play of comedy scenes under its supervision, many of which say that it is trying to assemble the two plays together. Bosanio (Joseph Fiennes, who played "Shakespeare in Premiere" with William Shakespeare) falls in love with Portia (Lin Collins, Pretty), but he has to lend a lot of money to scream. She went to her Girl Lover Antonio (Jeremy Irons), who did not fund on her own, but borrowed from Shulk (Al-Pasino) of the Jewish utility. Shylak was surprised and upset that Antonio, who insulted his religion, now comes to the money, but he gives the condition that punishment for defaulting to a loan will be a pound of Antonio's meat. Which is, of course, what happens. Basanio and Portia offer Shikkake more than the main loan instead of the pound of meat, but Shylak is annoyed with his daughter after leaving her and refusing to marry. Portia is not a scene where the audience can sympathize with her, it is not sure what Shylak should legitimately do to her, and then hold her wealth and religion. Shailk was originally written as a cartoon villain, but modern actors and directors made him a tragedy of the railway against the injustice of the 16th century Venice. Al Pascino does a great job as Shylock and is as good as Jeremy Irene Antonio, but I think Lin Collins's work as Pinnia is the best part of the game. Some prominent female roles in Shakespeare Canon, Portia, and Collins are wonderful in part. Joseph Fiennes is more than a little crap, however; I've enjoyed its often overwrought acting style. I give an 8/10 "Venice Merchant".
