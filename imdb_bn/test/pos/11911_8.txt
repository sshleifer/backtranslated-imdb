The film is likely to be released when it is released, probably affecting my shallow mind, but it is not a bad film yet. It is a movie about a hostage situation involving a love school, some people who are desirable of population by somewhat tolerant teenage boys can not come out of the problem. What's wrong with this? It has no big special effects, but so what? Who needs special effects? The fall of the movie began at the same time that special effects were popular. A coincidence? I do not think so. It turns into films with potentially good intentions and feelings, and makes a bigger, less material light for innocent kids and self-medicines. Well, you know, all movies require special effects. Except for the special effects of the IMDB Top 250 film, about three quarters, but almost all of the top major films have special effects. Think about it: Star Wars, Etc., Hostbasket etc. All good movies, but the leading top films are usually non-sensic plots and lots of eye candy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The soldiers are simply a great movie. I acknowledge that some of the ingredients have been leaked a little bit, but so what, each movie closes somewhere else. Think Resovoir dog. Countless "gratitude" sites are favorite quintin tarantino, which I acknowledge, many of his films have been copied by the creator of his first major movie Reservoir. Many people say that the whole plot has closed almost the scene for the scenes of Japanese and Chinese gangster movies, which makes Mr. Tintino so favorite and probably still Sorry again for the tangent <br /> <br /> The toilet soldiers are kidding. It has unwanted members of teenagers' authorities, such as complete misconduct from hostage takers. It's fun to see when the kids are going to do something they do not want to do. Hell, the teenage-inspired rebellion was a major issue in the 80's comedies. As well as the characters use fire weapons and there is excitement and thrill out of bad guys, etc. There are also some mental aspects of the movie. One of the characters died when others handle and adjust. It's not perfect, but it's losing most of the other triangle. <br /> <br /> Short, toy soldiers are exciting, interesting and fun. How dare you brave this movie ratehard blowhards! Shame on you! <br /> <br /> Personal rating: 8/10
