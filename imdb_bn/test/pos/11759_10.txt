Homegrund is one of the movies that falls through cracks, but better. When I first saw it, I had a very embarrassing reaction. But, over time, it really has grown on me - no penalty intended ;-). As much as I see it, I appreciate it. Top notch of writing, as acting. Drop in a few wonderful casinos and good sides, and you end up with a great little film. <br /> <br /> It finally gives Hong Kong Azaria a chance to play a starred role. And Thornton provides performance to its normal quality. Even relatively new comer Ryan Philips delivers, a friendly innocent game with intelligence and subtlety. <br /> <br /> As well, the hometown is simply a "must-see" if you're a delivery bob thornton fan. Prior to Stephen Gillenhall, Thornton projects seem to have been influenced by one such Felus Move and Sling Blade (although the homeland is certainly more than tongue-in-cheek). And starring in the role of starring Thornton is a perfect match to play.
