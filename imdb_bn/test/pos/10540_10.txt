(This review contains huge explosives, but I do not know how cool it is.) I saw "vengeance of Pinocchio" a few minutes ago. <br /> <br /> Now, you might think that just a child's play is a rip-off. Actually there are similarities. <br /> <br /> However, the shiny was a owned doll, who worked independently of the child. It is possible that Pinoccio is possessed with a giant or a curse or something. However, the doll itself is actually completely inactive. KID is mad, and KID is killing people! Everyone, including the audience, the survivor and the kid himself, think of the doll. But it's KID. <br /> <br /> The nudity is almost unfortunate, because otherwise I could tell everyone to see it because it's really an interesting horror movie.
