It is one of the greatest films ever made. Bright acting by George C Scott and Dian Rigs. This movie is both boring and extremely deep. Do not be fooled to believe this just a comedy. It's a brilliant mockery of medical profession. This is not a beautiful picture. Healthy patients are killed by the physically challenged, who spend time earning money outside the hospital. And yet, you really believe that it's a hospital. The producers were very careful to include real medical terminology and real medical cases. This movie really shows how difficult it is to run the hospital, and there were already many bad things in 1971. I love this movie. Freshly - I noticed that the ineligible, wheel-dealer surgeon played the head of the firm in LA law. Lou Grant starred young doctor. I saw that registration nurse appeared from grammar and other shows.
