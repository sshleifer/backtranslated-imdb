The Gray English language can jump like someone else through hoops. He reviewed a number of incidents, writing a manuscript (title "monster"), some tragic, some wildly funny, in his characteristic, satiric manner. If you like "swimming in Cambodia" you would like it. I actually think this is a little more interesting and better than "swimming more Cambodia". A real masterpiece
