I thought this movie is amazing. I was a bit skeptical because I had no idea about it, but it was a beautiful story. I started crying and laughing loudly. <br /> <br /> I think it is very important to make Holocaust and how it is affecting the film (it happened 60 years ago!) I am in Germany and Eastern Europe and I studied Holocaust, so this picture is about me Much more I think this picture has done a great job to hold this story (I will not go into detail, I do not want to hide it), but I definitely recommend it for any film to look for, I know it may sound silly, but change Things to do in your psychology
