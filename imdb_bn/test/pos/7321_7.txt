In the direction of the younger brother of great director Leonid McKay, it is a commendable short, nominated for Academy Award from three Stuiges. Doctors Doctor Howard, Doctor Fine and Doctor Howard, are here. They are not the brightest doctors, but they get the benefit of suspicion as long as they manage for responsibilities and humanity. <br /> <br /> I like this short. This is not their best one but some moments are sunny. A joke that works once again works repeatedly. Of course, the bus driver of the hospital must be terrifying. To say more, some jokes will be lost, so you must see it for yourself. Another subtle fine from the three stages.
