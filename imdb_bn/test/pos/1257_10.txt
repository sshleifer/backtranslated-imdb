From a point of view, it is possible to make films that are not offensive to strong moral-value people, it is obvious. This is the second Bruce Willis film in a second row, which leads to narrations, off-color humor, prejudice, or her story with neutral violence. (I'm referring to six references.) Both films are compelling on multiple levels. This is suitable for children as well as children, although others have been as specific, it is not a glimpse for kids. <br /> <br /> I was disturbed that the travel device can not be interpreted while running this plot, except that we know that Russell is 70 years old. Also, why his dead mother would have to come to school to win the war; Why, if he speaks of his old soul, he will not have to meet his child in the next few years and he will not have to get to him every time, and why he does not learn how to butt in the process. I found the score rather annoying and step-by-step always suitable. <br /> <br /> Good use of the red plane as a metaphor.
