Distributor: GOODTIMES home video <br /> <br /> Plot: Admission to the television movie This suspension marks a beautiful high school student for terrorism. New in the city of Gayle Osborne He has a boyfriend who makes friends, and everything seems to be going on his way. Until she gets babysitting an evil and horrible phone call. After more phone calls, she was raped. Throughout the film, she tried to find out the evidence that the man raped her. <br /> <br /> Audio / Video: Goodbye imes frustrated the VHS version of 1987. There is a constant line at the bottom and top of the screen. <br /> <br /> Extra: Goodtime no additional from home video. <br /> <br /> Final thought: This secret made for TV movie has been created. In 1978, so does not expect much death (no one is there). If you find this movie in front of the homevideo logo worldwide, then buy it. But the GoodTime version is pretty crappy It can be a bit annoying, but if you are patient then the last is very good.
