I love a cute hearty movie with a happy ending. This film can be considered as a play, can create two characters in the feel of true love, but the story is so sensitive and so sweet that I have a romance in mind. Imagine, the acting is not so big (which you did not give it 10) but they work, and they are absolutely vital (thanks to God) plus they are beautiful, but the story is strong and only plain adorable (you will bother up some pansies ) !!!!!! This is a great surveillance for a love story, but if you live Homophobic, survive! Everyone else, I like the movie, its very sweet! I think it felt a breakback on a small scale ... but with a blessed end .... so enjoy !!
