The Naruto Anime TV series has so far produced two feature-length theatrical films, and the third is coming to our destination this summer. <br /> <br /> The first one released at summer '04 was a fun adventure featuring Naruto's main character in an exciting adventure. But to deny the flaws of the film, there will be a blind, deaf and one wacky chicken. The first one was most definitely enjoyable, many things could be improved here. Naruto Movie 2, however, takes all these aspects and excels on them. <br /> <br /> The first action was incredibly cinematic. Like the first film, the lighting, setting and style were three times as effective. At first we gave basic steps, good animated and dancer animations, but there was nothing but popping, but the film's cinematography was exceptional, but it was very effective to make it shine up and shine together in light, and added strength to the war. <br /> <br /> The animation was very good. Disney contested it, though it was a film about TV's characters, but there was little difference in the character's design or details about the characters, but the animations were incredibly fluid and realistic. I think they even used two times the sales for every second because there was absolutely nothing awake about the animation, it was incredibly fluid. <br /> <br /> Music ... I think where this movie is failing. The original musician / conductor of the TV show was used for the film and I do not really think he did that. The music reminds me of pieces used in most old SNS games. Musician is very good, but the synthetic syllabus used for the film could not be very well expressed. However, they did not fail in this movie, adding good collaboration with this action. But in the end, the music does not work as a borderline or special thing, except for a few jokes, except for some Halloween / string pieces. <br /> <br /> The story was fun. It was a particularly ideal story for Naruto and, unlike the first films, it took what was wrong with the story of the first movie and was developed on them. The characters were very attractive and the path of progress in the story kept me throughout the film. It forces you to think that this movie will not end anymore, but it will continue, but instead of being perceived, everything in action and letters still feels fresh and exciting. <br /> <br /> Overall, this image is a goodun, but it can be good however, it is definitely one of the supporters. I've enjoyed the film, but that's because ... I'm a fan! But I can see that, like Final Fantasy Advanced Children, it does not excel as a movie, but it works as a superb service for a good one-and-a-half-hour fan service. Although I think this movie acts as a good role in the series for the current non-viewers, it will not have any effect on anyone other than the obscurity on Naruto screens. However, despite all this, it was a fun movie that enjoyed the ridiculous period of enjoying the annoying period.
