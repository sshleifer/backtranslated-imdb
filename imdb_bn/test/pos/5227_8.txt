Nobody said that "Big Trill" and I think it will be a natural. Nevertheless, it was one of the best Westerns I saw and I am a big fan of horses and gunmen. The scope and feeling of this photo is only surprising and since it has been mentioned in their comments, it has the feeling of "Napoleon" (1927) 3-camera Tritpic. Nowadays production costs and especially thousands of customs will be prohibited, but Raoul Walsh has done it. <br /> <br /> Cast was nice, though John Wayne was not good when his line was not there and just swaggered closer. Especially, Tyron Power, sir. There was a perfect arc - I had never seen him before and this was his only conversation. Ian Keith was a snake, but an acquired taste as a result of El Brendell Comic. He can be funny or annoying, but in most cases later - and he shows at the most inappropriate times. <br /> <br /> It was a bit longer and Indians took some time to show, but it is close to a documentary in the manifest destination and what you see is true and for fans of the film, of course, it is a favorite choice. I was tired of settlers settling in California.
