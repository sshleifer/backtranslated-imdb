I accidentally found this show and I was amazed by the fact that I did not know anyone. If in a few years I see that it was too much of the best shows and I could not wait to come out of the episode. The sleeper cell portrays the mental struggle of a secret agent inside a terrorist cell, which has to make constant difficult decisions in order to maintain its cover while being truly real. This is a very good show. This makes you doubtful from the first episode to the end and although it is slowly progressing, it is fast enough to feel at the end of your side. Very realistic and human, it touches important issues and presents an interesting question about each episode. This show is not 24 and no TV show on TV and trying to do anything. It's genuine and unique. This is a show about a man, his hard choice and the life of struggle, where a common mistake can cost him everything. <br /> <br /> I tell 10 great stories of this show, good progress, excellent cinematography, every wonderful music and realistic characters with a story.
