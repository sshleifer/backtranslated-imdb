221 episodes of "The Lone Ranger" were originally broadcast from ABC from 1949 to 1957; And then they played local syndication for many years. During most of the original broadcast, the series was the most visible part of ABC's programming. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <p> There are only 17 available for publication, so these are probably in the public domain). Most of these sets are rendered by "The Legend of the Lone Ranger", which is a total of three episodes collected in 1955, which were included in this film. <br /> <br /> The early episodes come back to the radio because there are a lot of voice-over descriptions that have been used as a role and what plot moments are presented. <br /> <br /> This series itself had a clear and bad difference in authentic Kindi Western-clear-cut and no romance. The title character (played by Clayton Murray) starts out of Texas Ranger John Reid. The first three episodes provide background for the transition to Lone Ranger's status, the partnership with Indian Tanto (J. Silverware) and his horse "Silver". <br /> <br /> There is a vague code of positive morality in each episode. Lone Ranger is perfectly good but he took evil hiding. A masked man in the west generally feared good citizens, and an Indian was a disbeliever, Lone Ranger was afraid of those who scared. A series of themes is that when Lone Ranger and Tonto meet with the first common citizen, they are greeted with suspicion and by the end of this episode the citizens have been assured of their value. The end of the trademark is a second character that asks: "Who is this masked man?" <br /> <br /> To really enjoy the series, you should easily accept it for morality story. If you do not take it seriously and wish for some self-responsive camp parody elements, you'll just be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Do you know again? I'm just a child.
