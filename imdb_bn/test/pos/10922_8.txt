Some movies want us to think, some want to excite us, some want to make us happy. But sometimes, a movie simply wants to laugh at us, and "in and out" are definitely successful in this section. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Indian high school teacher Howard Bracket (Kevin Kline) is going to marry a colleague in the teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack), but former resident Cameron Drake (Matt Dylan) is more excited about the Oscar nomination. But when Cameron won an Oscar for playing a gay man, he thanked his gay teacher Howard for inspiration. Howarda denies that it is denying it in a sunny conflict in true screen fashion. <br /> <br /> Kevin Kane brightens gorgeous, gay stereotypes. Joan Cusack really has a punch for the screwball antics. Debbie Reynolds is completely ridiculous as Howard's mother. And Bob Neighart Homophobic Principal as well. <br /> <br /> Gay Plate writer Paul Rudnik has really earned a fine balance here. He knows stereotypes and exploits them in a manner that is tolerant for most conservative Midwesterners and yet objectionable to most gay listeners. This is not progressive, but it's funny and irrational, and of course, one step above the previous year's "Birdcage".
