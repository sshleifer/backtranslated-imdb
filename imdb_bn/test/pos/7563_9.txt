What a great movie !! It's a touchy story about four high school friends growing up in the 1960s. For decades, friends become a bit different, but sometimes they can see each other. There are many tragedies, but a lot of sunny moments that make you smile laughing This is a heart filled story, love and friendly story. Of course, one play must be seen for fans.
