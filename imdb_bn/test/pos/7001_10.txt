This movie is about a crew of a spaceship, who, with three sunrises, crashes the land on a strange bright planet. Among the passengers, the serial killer, Richard Riedic (Vin Diesel), and his generosity, Johns (Cole Hauser) were convicted. The survivors of the debris are getting their bearings, but three suns are accepted. Shortly after, the fearsome animals started to appear and began to choose crew members one after the other. During acceptance, Riedic came in himself, because his eyes had shone under the surgery, he had a night's dream. The crew must rely on them to try for their safety. <br /> <br /> This is a very stylish movie, by the scene the color of the scene changes in the sky, it gives a very weird look. Vine is brilliant, really annoying like diesel radic but he is forced to help people who otherwise see him as a threat. As well as his performance has an underlying humor, which adds another dimension to the character. It is such a role that Vinti excels, the anti-hero, whos character is not one-dimensional to appear first. I can not imagine anyone else in this role, it can be specially written for him. <br /> <br /> Reiki Chronicles Roll!
