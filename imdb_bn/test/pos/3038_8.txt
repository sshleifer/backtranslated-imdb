This movie is a piece that made it ... realistic. In the late 60's and early 70's, movies did not have candy coating. The producers did not try to create some happy ends that did not exist. The lack of happy ending will create movement among the audience, it is expected that they will move towards their activities. At least that's what it feels like. This film will probably not be made in today's movie world. There, obviously, this will not end, but realistic. The tragedy is that the film portrays a scene which can not be improved without any steps to improve the relationship between white South traditional thinking and progressive movement of that time.
