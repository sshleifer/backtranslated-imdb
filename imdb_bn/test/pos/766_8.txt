I really liked this movie because it was Rupert Green (I knew Ron from Harry Potter films). Until this movie did not congratulate Rupert. I like the whole picture. Rupert makes this a fun, quirky movie a wonderful job. I think the movie might be fine without penis, but it worked in any way. I can not wait to see more Rupert's future. Julie Walters did an amazing job. She has a very small role in the Harry Potter film, so I do not know what I can expect from her. But he was wonderful as the Dame Evey. The part that she sucked was absolutely sunny. Overall, an amazing movie.
