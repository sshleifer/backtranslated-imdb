Melville's "Pierre; or the Ambulances" hit Melville's shop in 1825, after its first publication of "Moby Dick" a year ago, the response was similar to the "Pola X" IMDb reviews. Even the headline of the newspaper revealed: "Melville mad!" Which, of course, he does not. However, when writing styles of "Moby Dick" and "Pierre" are compared, then one is available from the simple and often announced style. Obviously, he now imitated the excessive florid style of forgotten Victorian romance which was easily outselling its immortal "Moby Dick". However, he wanted to launch such a product that his publishers wanted, and of course could not sell it. His version of a Victorian romance was perhaps a narrow, dreaded, perhaps, but bright in its synthesis. Alternative Title: "Blurring" is quite appropriate. Like Pierre searches, and thinks he finds, in fact, we become more uncertain and can believe. In search of happiness, he became more unhappy. <br /> <br /> "Pola X" is an interesting adaptation of this novel, set in modern or almost modern France. However, in some ways, it leaves the imagination a little and shows us graphically abusive relationships, which Melville can only indicate, the novels, and the message that so much of the conversation is so obvious that the ambiguities are quite obvious. It seems to ask several questions about the questions raised, but the answers go to the audience. <br /> <br /> I recommend reading a novel, which is much smaller than "Moby Dick". Watching this movie. I hope more people discover this tantalizing film.
