I like shepherd! The acting was not good but the fight scene was good. Van Damme threw some nice kicks and so did the addins. The story was average. A Texas police police fight smugglers. This movie is a Van Dam film which can do martial arts and action. Van Damme was never a good actor. I think this movie is better than Van Damage. 2. If you are looking for performance to win the Oscars, then you will not find it here but if you are looking for action and martial arts, this movie is for you. Scott Adkins is an amazing martial artist and unfortunately masses martial arts superstar got tired but this movie is great in his movies. Van Dam delivered a firm kick and it is better to perform martial arts again because of not having his last 4 or 5 films. If you're a Van Damme fan then this movie is certainly valuable value.
