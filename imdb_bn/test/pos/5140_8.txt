I took a team of youth who were the same as the protagonist and it appealed to us. I agree with another post, Wilson is a grateful scriptwriter in a remarkable minor character. The film is good for a specific age demographic film (it's too old for PG, at a very young age for R). It shows how they look and feel at junior high school. You had to love how well you were as a cool teacher in a hostage buffet. He kept our adults awake. Children's interrogation was kept reasonable at the level of the authorities. Their motives were specific and some are not like Eddie. Rebel. The setting and the music were beautiful. Overall, if you enjoy the hole, it's really similar.
