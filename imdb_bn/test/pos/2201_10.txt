I own a copy of this photo and always liked it. I am commenting here because I saw PBS presentation of a concert version of Swine Todd at the beginning of this week. That production was established by San Francisco Opera and starring George Hearn and Patti LuPone. In the early 80's, class lane replaced Kariyouk as a swini (Kariyi won Tony in her tune). I saw Swine perform on Broadway on Honda and Angela Lansbury (who won Tony for her performance as Mrs. Lovett) on Broadway. Often I have seen the show, the film must be created. Today, I can remember the most memorable moment in the theater when Henne is the song "This is my friends." ("See this my friend, how they glisten." "My hands are complete again!") <br /> <br /> The audience's performance in the production of the San Francisco Opera convinced me that he almost lost nothing in the twentieth century since I first I saw him split in Broadway and later on in the film. What a talent! He is sympathetic, funny, and fearful - all at one time; And she could sing, boy could sing. All this reminds me of how awesome the film is. Highly recommended. Ten out of ten
