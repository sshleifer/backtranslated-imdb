Hole is an amazing murder mystery which provides you with everything from Agatha Crisi and of course Poirot. It is set in a country house on a weekend. As always all the guests are suspect and it is poirot to find out the truth. With the help of such films, I do not always pay very well, so I will stop here. What I like about 'Hole' is the secret of the old fashioned system. When Poirot comes to the body, for example everyone is around. Everyone seems guilty. This suspicious look and atmosphere are perfect for the story. <br /> <br /> You can expect a nice time to guess how much and why and why and even until even the end will be astonished. A cup of hot chocolate on a cold winter night and you've got a pretty enjoyable experience. <br /> <br /> Actors are all very good. In a curiosity notice, Edward Hardwicke said in Sherlock Holmes. Who plays Watson. A few years later she was beautiful to see him. The suetet is always amazing and thankfully it is on the screen for most of the time. <br /> <br /> I found a murderer but it is still not convincing and it is very credible. <br /> <br /> <br /> So conclusion is a great movie and always as a pleasure. <br /> <br />
