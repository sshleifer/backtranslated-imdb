I've enjoyed Ramin Bahrani's Man Pouch Cart, and this picture is equally good. This part of life is about a documentary about how to live life in the end. <br /> <br /> Alejandro Polanco and Isamar's Gonzalez did excellent work as a 12-year-old brother and 16-year-old sister. Those who live in a small room on an automatic shop. There is no father; They are living their own. Ali supplied his income by stealing auto parts, selling boot DVDs and selling candy on the subway. Aji complements the work of a food truck by selling himself his income. They are trying to make money but their own trucks. <br /> <br /> The two children are tempted to express their frustration to impose themselves, and of course, one may be very upset that EG wants to sell their body to the truckers, but in reality it exists in the world's richest country, There is no sustainable land. Save the turmoil and do something.
