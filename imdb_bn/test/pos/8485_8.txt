Let's not beat Bush here, Taylor Hilford's undoubtedly shiny movie is a little bit of Jamie Fox's extraordinary ability to get out of other biopic styles without carrier-building performance. Remember they will have Oscars special effects on the Oscars Terminator 2 Bofyn? This year's best actor Gong should do the same thing. <br /> <br /> The ray Charles's story is not worthy of the film. Indeed, in his aggressive childhood many flashbacks are well-managed and intelligently used. But a life is so unique, the film seems incredibly formulas and familiar. It often follows the letter 'Defective genius history': letter of regret and abuse, women and medicines, recording wrangles, band squabbles, rehabilitation, yes yes yes And certainly he had more humor than his life? Here I realized the music of Charles, where the well-preserved Medelli rolled up the story, Hackford was almost full with himself - long gesture of many songs - Gene Joint, concert hall in the recording studio , Infinitum. Naturally, and for non-fans, they started working as a cinematic break. It may seem to be a strict verdict on a music biopic, but with a wide range of catalogs like Reyah, we do not need the whole dish to taste. Otherwise, we want to buy the album. <br /> <br /> I was silent, I was looking at my watch at once. So for the image of Fox, maybe it's a HBO like two-potters?
