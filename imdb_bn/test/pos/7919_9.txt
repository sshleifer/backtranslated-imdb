I believe that anyone who enjoyed Einstein's Iain de Terrell movie will enjoy this well-planned movie. This movie has acted like "Lord of the Ring: The Return of the King", but with special effects, good and good plays. <br /> <br /> We have German language who has been wearing KKKK, Russia won the Novgorod. Russia's Nevsky was called to fight against the Germans to save Russia. Nicolai Cherkassov, who played Ivan in Ivan the horror films, was a charismatic like Nevsky. In the first 10 minutes, how he managed to escape from Mongol. <br /> <br /> Many scenes were black and white even beautiful. No conversation was needed for the arrival of war, as "how many enemies we will kill" etc. Etc. Apart from some speeches, can be played largely as a silent film. The scene of war can look at the scenes of a civil war war civil war. <br /> <br /> Another powerful power of this movie is Sergei Prokofiev. The song gives an epic feeling in the film without dialogue in that scene.
