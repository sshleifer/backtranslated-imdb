Of course Alex has become a little stain, but they are still (for me) the greatest rock trio. I sincerely recommend this DVD to a fan. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed that they have canceled their planned Gibabytes of the latest Munich and are not trying to see them elsewhere. DVD is a small console - the best incentive for achieving a suitable DVD playback setup. <br /> <br /> Probably innocent, but I still do not understand the significance of the significance of pillar-dryer; I will be grateful for any explanation. <br /> <br /> Cheers, Ian.
