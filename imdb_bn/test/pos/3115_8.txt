In 1950, two very different and interesting Westerners were seen: Henry King 'The Gunfighter' and John Ford's 'Wagon Master'. The Gunfighter was historically significant because it apparently influenced the effect of the Gimmerman's 'High Noon' (1951) and the subsequent revisionist West. <br /> <br /> I personally find 'Wagon Master' rather than his contemporaneous opponent. Ford's short essay is not about the story; It should also be considered more like a poem describing the concept of the old West. Although optimistic and warm in the heart, we are worthy of the proximity because it is completely free from undignity underneath. Frontier's scenery is well-used because it fully supports poetic descriptions. Add to the work of the natural camera and we have seen witnesses in the Western folklore cinematic way among Mormon tourists.
