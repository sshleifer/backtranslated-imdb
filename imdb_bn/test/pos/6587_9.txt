I received great appreciation by watching this movie and heard many surprises about how it was "awesome". Do not take any loan from this movie, I think it is not such a horror or even frustrating. It's a movie about the people living on the dark side of the city. And point out a good one. Here are some great acting and manuscripts have a good idea. Pavo Westerbberg is one of the best-known authors of the Finnish film scene and the best in describing contemporary Finnish culture. (Although he is not the only writer of this movie, I dare to say that he is the original author. However, I am wrong. Casting is excellent, in addition to Jasper Packenon (pseudo-principal character, who in my opinion soap opera In the scene), and set, cut and the words have been done very well and this film gives a great atmosphere. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the interconnected tragedies Lap, which is a well known song of the famous Finnish band (Appu Normali "Muhlisten loujueen mother", which mostly translates as "foot mother" throughout the whole Finnish society) brings a tragic, dark end with dirt, loneliness and bad choices. There is no awareness of about 80% of the population for Finland's daily life, unless these films are made.
