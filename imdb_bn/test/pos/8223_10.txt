Some of the fun (both physical comedy and oral and visual gags) performances performed by Flirt of Flight and Clown Bagattels Bill Irene which I have ever seen. My father made this special touch when it was first prevalent in the 80's and my family loved it ever since. We continually continually quoted it behind. It's a shame that the copies are not easily available for purchase. I received a bad VHS copy from Special Properties a few years ago, but the performance of Mr. Irwin's ability to get a suitable DVD treatment with the restored version of the original work and interviews with the performers / producers as well as other examples of modernization. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I often share "Flight of Flight" with friends and although I always greet with a small amount of suspicion when it mentions that it is a mix of Clowning and Vaudville, yet I could not see anyone without love. . For the powers that can be made in this IMDB list, consider filling this and other bills of the work of the iris.
