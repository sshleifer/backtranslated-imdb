I was lucky enough to see the screening of 'el podino' in Santa Monica a few months ago. I was flying away. You do not see movies like this anymore. In the chorus vein, he told the tragic story of Chapa Kilo that he stood on the road to stand on the tough roads of LA from the escrowing ranks of drug addicts. Characters are complex and conflict. Emotion is real. The action is fast and furious. Stunts are spacious. And Tilly is hot. He does not like this from his 'dam' day. I want someone to recommend this. In the late 80's and early 90's, it was a great tribute to epic action films. And everyone has to find out? See it again; You probably were close to your eyes for the first time. Acting Congratulations to all acting. I'm counting the day till the release of the sigell. Does anyone have a date?
