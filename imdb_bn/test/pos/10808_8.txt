If two parts were physically superior, the ugly-charismatic actor Gerard Depardieu was born, but it was played as a Frenchman, of course, Cyrano de Burgerac and commentator George Danton were. Here he influenced the film through both the width of his shoulders and the strength of his voice; His career carries the part, although it has become clear that the rest of the character is blood on his hand. The people of Paris are hungry while celebrating Danton ... but he is a man who can challenge the oppressed oppression by the public's fearsome committee called 'Freedom', and is presented as a hero of the film - the source game actually mirrors his opponent, Robesiae! <br /> <br /> Those who know the character of history have an interest in identifying small parts: frogs of Tallinn, Kothan Cripple, Fukui-Tinil Tribunal Prosecutor, Dashing Fox St-Just, Epic painter David. But the script cut this respect slightly slack; Names are often delayed when minor characters are marked and there is no Hollywood-style 'info-dump' to ensure that the audience can establish events in their historical context. The film grants that you know what you have done before and what will happen next - sometimes it takes too much time to allow it, when it relies on the earliest knowledge of the dates that sting it on its tail, followed by Rabspeier shortly after Scoutold with Danton . <br /> <br /> is considered as a movie, it is not entirely satisfactory that it goes towards the end. The structure of the story leads to some fierce clash between the court's hero or some dramatic measure of trial, thanks to history, it will not really happen. Things just explode: There is no rebellion, there is no excuse for torture, there is no idea of ​​power by the victor, there is no victory for both parties. It may be historically correct, but it is not entirely satisfied as a result of a screen scene - it seems to be a strange place to stop. As others have commented, similarly it may be more logical to take the events till the end of terrorism and show the fall of Rabespierre.
