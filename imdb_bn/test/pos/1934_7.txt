One of the last films directed by Lionel Barrymo, "Ten Saints at Dance", in his six roles, has repeatedly played the Stanwick dance-that is the girl "Barbara". Stanwick shows this absolutely "plain Jane", and Dance Hall is chewed by the manager. Then the rich man comes to Bradley Carlton (Ricardo Cortez) who wants to stop his ties. (Corzes and Stanwick made three films together in the 1930s.) Then he met the AD, who is very different from Dashting Charlton. The author, Joe Swilling, worked with some bugs (It's And Wonderful Life, Guy & Dos, and Gone With the Wide), so I was surprised that such characters and scripts were so common. The story is becoming more interesting in almost half as well and it has been similar to "The Bride Woke Out" since 1936, staring in Stanwick, ALSO .... T.B.W.O. Much more clever, but much more, due to the hey code ...
