So I was completely love with this movie. Gaga for it, even with all its plots twists ... But one thing I found really annoying was the connection between team and Kyle's two best friends. The author of the film gave such a deadly moment between us, and their sexual temptation / confusion, then he gave us a plot twist that makes half of his brother?! (Although this thing has not been brought to the film .... and left unclear and ineffective) I thought it was a bad taste, and the issue that was discussed was not even bad. (Oh we've made a banned ... Now let's not solve the situation, because it will not really be P.C.) Otherwise a spectacular movie
