I thought it was a very brave representation of the popular old hockey 'Tarzan' concept by Hollywood, Wisempler, etc. <br /> <br /> Yes; There are a lot of stupid stuff. But then, the idea is stupid. It is almost unbelievable that the human child can be aged by chimpanzees. I was completely tempted to say incredible, but that idea was not tried. And there is certainly a bit too much anthropomorphism for comfort. Although in situations I can see how difficult it is to avoid it. We have now got a lot of insight into the issues of prosperity and know that a human being from childhood without human behavior will never learn them during adolescence. <br /> <br /> Yet if you can get head around, there's a great deal of praise that is both fantastic and bold. Lambberts do animal things with splendor. I said that I am playing the most strong and sympathetic role of playing him. There are also plenty of other nice performances. None of Sir Ralph Richardson and Ian Holmes are few. <br /> <br /> Especially annoying - and just so - the simian perception of humans. From the point of view of the poor, stupid, helpless barbarians we can see ourselves, on whom we regularly know the Lord. And how it shows our 'civilization' and 'morality' that awakens our behavior and justifies it, is not more than manifesting selfishness and arrogance. It may seem a little exaggerated at times, especially the detestable museum in the separation rooms, but what we can see is not true about Victorians; The truth about how we are today It is one that needs to be told, and often can not be described enough. As a symptom of civilization, the emotion of the character of Holol with 're-emphasis' - such as having a head hair, was also a primitive condition - it is a wonderful event. Old bearded readers take notes. <br /> <br /> The story is boring. Finally it is a tragedy. Because he has come back to the forest and the freedom of moral torture which is truly human 'civilization'; We know he's destroyed. Prior to the third millennium 50 years of age, Wild Simians will be hunted like extinct meat and their environment will be developed to enjoy developed humanitarian oppression for agricultural and mineral exploitation. <br /> <br /> In the end, it is a story that should be followed by human beings, as the way other Simians pursue themselves. <br /> <br /> Despite the moment of hockey, it is highly recommended for its moral steps.
