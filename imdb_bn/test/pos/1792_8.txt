Four seasonal businessmen, I would not say a happy movie, even someone who influenced me while praising the sky (for that there are other fascicular flicks, such as the Veronica Ves and the intrinsic Satan). But it is certainly not an interesting experiment to look at any society that you and I and others that we do not want to know. In Germany in the early 70's I imagine that there was a scandal to live with the coming out of WW2 but they did their best to get it. This is a scandal that floats everywhere in the film, and the functioning of the fasibindroid is generally in most cases, but especially because in four seasons he keeps an eye on the middle class and a special married couple - distant, frustrated, angry Hans Fail seller and his long-lost wife - realism in the spirit of Melodyram It is not smaller than trying. If the Casavets are a crazy German, then he might create this image, even as a lark. <br /> <br /> This story seems easy enough, where Hans's drink comes under control, it hurts his wife (this scene is thrown in a film, perhaps in a film, without a camouflage in the camera, The girl tries to stop him from his madness) and then he is ready to leave him. He stood in the house, his family kept him, he called for divorce and got a heart attack there. He restores, his business has suddenly started again with some help from some good (or not) employees - and yet it has only led to his long-standing, other women, and generally his disappointments. Still, the fasciinders try that the fasciinders try and fear most of the parts, go out in the kitchen or bedroom or on the street and leave the blood out with a knife. The weak part of all of these could be acting ... at least it was my initial impression. Hirsaler's acting Hans is with little movement between his face and eyes, and for a while it does not seem to be a good actor, it can be a dysfunctional presence. The actress is getting better renting playing with her wife, Arm Harman and her sister (Fasibinder Hana Shigla), but they are only given to do more to do the same as crying or worried. It may take some time for her own mental self-agony or self-sorrow to get her and her neighbors normally naturally with her. Especially when Hans is successful once. <br /> <br /> Not only do not click together in four seasons, but it is more than just a modern American movie to suggest it to look for a different life than you use. Here is a war between the musician of love in the fascinating world movie, and the harsh, tragic sense of humanism that he personally feels and put into character, that we have identified it for good or bad. Epps Are You A Family? Or could you even have them? Who would have to say. It is a systematic study of the unfortunate emptiness of the human soul, and all of its aim is achieved.
