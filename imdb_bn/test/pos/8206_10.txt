How nice! In my opinion, Net is a fantastic, nail-bitting, end-of-your-seat techno thriller that lets you feel better. I first saw it, I was feeling all the better for days. When Angela went to Mexico (Sandra Bullock), I thought to herself, "It's a great place to relax." Jack (Jeremy Northam) and Ruth (Wendy Gazelle) began to follow him right now, I thought, "Do not let him do anything bad! I took several deep breaths to prevent myself from shouting than I had already already. On the bright side, if you asked me, the house was very luxurious and spacious. In conclusion, I give four stars of this fantastic, nail-bitting, edge-to-seat techno thriller.
