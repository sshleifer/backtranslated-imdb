WARNING: I recommend that anyone who does not read this film yet. <br /> <br /> This movie was a shelf on the movie store and I saw a lot of scary flashes there. There was really low expectation for this one. Well, I got into it, and almost immediately I was sucked right. When watching, I got the story deep and deep and soon I was staring in full interest. This movie is amazingly spectacular and I like every second. The story is about a boat ride down a river in Australia. It seems safe until their boats are attacked by a crack which is ready for some food. When I looked back at this case, I thought that the film would have shiny visual effects like Lake Placid 2 and many others, but when I first saw a crocodile, it was amazingly amazing! I'm not serious because I did not say it, but it's one of the most fantastic movies I've ever seen. It really knew how to nail and make excitement with its acute condition, I mean, think about it; You're stuck, a tree, run somewhere, somewhere hidden beneath a hungry hunter with water depths. Do not tell me a little bit that it will not bother you a little. It even managed to give me some cool down in my hand, as is adopted by Adam Kroc and Grace and Lee are disturbed. This is a very interesting movie. Perhaps there were 1 or 2 parts where I found myself spontaneously, but the other I had said it was my favorite animal attack film that I saw.
