Joline (Heather Graham) after her husband Karl (Luke Lies Wilson), who disappeared to clear his head on himself and their marriage. Jolien, who is committed to their marriage, started her journey to find Carl, yet she discovered herself on the way. On his travels, he encounters a lot of interesting characters, who unknowingly helped find his way. <br /> <br /> This is a classic road movie that goes right at my sight (some visitors can find it too slow). It keeps her ridiculous notes throughout the movie, while Jolene responds with warmth, warm, intelligent, sometimes sad smiles around the world. All actresses and actors are amazing to give amazing performances and the musical score is immaculate. 9/10
