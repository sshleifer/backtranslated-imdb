The "silver screen" happily gets polished with this beautiful film about the aging and the enjoyment of life rain. This silver screen has a lot of silver hair, but the name of the movie is 85, 85-like, its power, humor and the desire for life. The story of the celebrant Oscar Frank, his fiancee Annie Tilly, and the residents of the local area's nursing homes, inspires us to "save yourself as a last day" and gives hope to those horrible golden years. . A great movie for young and old audience!
