Vinceenzo Bonavolunta, who has spent many years working in a steel plant as a steel plant, is selling an Italian owner to China, at the end of the session where it comes, where it wants to re-introduce it because he wants to make it new The buyers and he thinks he has solutions. He does not duly discipline himself to Italian old management, or new Chinese owners. He also struggles to translate the translator, even to express his concern. <br /> <br /> The next thing we can see is that Vinceeno is trying to communicate with new owners. For her surprise, the charge, the new church, tried to warn in Italy, she was fired. The next search translator, Liu Hua, got to the woman. He finds his work in a library, but he told him, in no uncertain terms, he blames him for his expulsion from the position. Seeing the frustration of Vincento, Liu agreed to find his steel mill plant. Thus, Vinsenjo and Liu started a journey through some chaotic villages such as train, steam, bus and truck trips in the remote parts of the monster country. Finding the right factory proves to be very vague, but Vinceenzo discovers a life that is totally in possession of it, as well as finding a good soul that does not hesitate to help the Italian people, despite its primary distortion for it <br /> < <br /> <br /> The image of Guianini Amelio is like a tour. He took the viewer into unknown areas. Some comments compare Vincenzo to Italian great tourist Marco Polo, although similarities are not quite real. The film keeps our attention in the early stages of the journey, but since Vinceeno is disturbed after being separated from Liu, it starts to be somewhat enjoyable. Mr. Amelio is an interesting director, because he has clearly shown this picture, for which he worked on the adaptation of the novel of Ermano Ray, which we did not read. <br /> <br /> The only reason the view of Sergio Castellito is to see the movie. These versatile actors come up with a lot of things in the film, which is a way, for them a tour de ball, because the picture is seen in almost every frame. Amelio and Castellitto combination proved a winning combination. Liu Hua, who has played her first role as Leo Hua, has some lovely moments and shows good chemistry with her co-star. <br /> <br /> Luca Biggei portrays all her painful Chinese protests. We see that a China Post post card is beautiful. Mr Bajiji holds all the gray, so in most of the cases where the movies are set. Franco PÃ©reti's musical music works well in movies.
