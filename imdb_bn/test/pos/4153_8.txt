"Nuovomondo" was a great experience. Many filmmakers say their stories bigger through dialogue Emanuele Crialese is very visual-driven to direct her film. He found powerful pictures for what he wanted to say that was able to stand up to himself. In this way, he understands the film as a medium that primarily tells his stories on pictures on the screen. Especially European movies are often driven very dialogue (and many young American-American directors are strongly influenced by it). The Crialese reversal attitude was really the point, that this film is special for me. It has a very unusual story that covered up with a very unusual story and said with humor. Vincentjo Amato is head of the family Salvatore as well as a wonderful Charlotte Gainsberg, I enjoy watching each and every one of his movies. There are many great sequences in this movie. Just choose one: when the ship leaves Italy and people simply look quietly. This scene is great, especially if you consider pop cultural references that go with it (Titanic!).
