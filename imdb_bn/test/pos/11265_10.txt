This performance leaves you with no regards. We saw it in Germany, and it's exciting. We just got cheaper tickets behind but there was a view on everything that happened. If you ever get the chance to see this live then go! It is valuable for travel and if I were you, 'cool' is waiting for half an hour after the show. Performance is exciting and there are colorful actors around the skin which makes confusion, help, smile and usually makes the entire tent. Music - live music !! - CD-version as well: perfect! I bought a DVD later, but there was less colorful clothing in show. It is the atmosphere in the tent that sweeps you from your feet. A great trip for old and young, and a great film,
