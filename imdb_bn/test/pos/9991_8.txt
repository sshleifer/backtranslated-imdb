At the age of 20, Francis Wyamet (Shia Leibov) took his whole life forward to him - on one side. In the late 19th century, the life of the immigrant living in the United States was very limited in the early 20th century. If someone is poor, one is poor; If any of the bourgeoisie is born, then he has a small chance; If someone is born in a rich class, then it is definitely made in shade. The British gold champion Harry Warden and Francis' Golf Figures (played by the criminal underlying Stefan Dillon) prove the exception. Born and raised in the poor British family, his skill in golf allowed him to upgrade the dirty mess of poorer slums to the delicious green vegetables of the English Club. He has not forgotten the lesson of this life. Francis wants to follow Warden's footsteps and likewise uses his great skills in golf in the United States Open in 1913 at the age of 20. But the way a tough course and a great opponent (including Francis' statue Harry Warden), Francis should not be confused with is everything. A young father and cruel social structure stand in the way of his own dreams. <br /> <br /> I know what you think - I thought it too - Walt Disney created the film about the 1913 United States.

Despite being seen on paper, one of the best sports movies ever produced is the greatest game of all time. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Break the barriers. Where the greatest game ever works nicely as a themed sports film, it only works with time-span films - the featured costumes in the movie and the real time behind the real time set. The film simply * shows up * The film is set to be a wonderful part of the song, by the great and influential music composer Brian Tyler. The British great golf champion Harry Warden, man of the man golfing Ted Ray, Hammy JosÃ© Fleetter, the pre-teened Caddy Eddie of Francis and suddenly a good, powerful Steffen Dillon, as well as Caste, The lead role as Francis. Actor Bill Paxton (Apollo 13, Titanic) has been run for the second time and is the greatest all-time best of all time ever. He created a fine product - involved many hearts, consciousness and attention to detail for filmmaking.
