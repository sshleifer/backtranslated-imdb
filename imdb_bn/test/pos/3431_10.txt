This thing works on all levels - it is full of reverence for Lars von Tier as a thriller, but also with his own film - and there is a message: happiness comes, which is the best person in the personality of the injured soldier (and does not believe, laughingly) Separator by organ throughout the film, pray for forgiveness of others for imposing them on all time. You smile at him, but you envy him as well. The central character is a well meaningful but painful writer who, after World War II, spent the whole film to help friends of the train from Stockholm to Berlin. He stopped parallel stories together, and really screws people into the process. An understatement to say things go wrong - and structurally, the characters are the perfect opposition to each other. It's like there's a reverse of each of them - just like watching the tough, anti-anti clash. You will not believe the sick stuff you end up ending. To be more apt to qualify as a spoiler - I can say that it is a shame that the film was not released in the United States, not even in DVD. Some moron probably will not get it by their Americans - which is crap, because we do not just "get" but produce things like South Park ... If this film is marketed in the US, it should be sold as a mainstream black comedy because it What Over the top, sick and roll, but fuuuuunnnnnyyyyy!
