<br /> <br /> I heard this in 1997 and decided to talk to friends about coffee first. The only problem was that it was on a small screen in one of my local movies. <br /> <br /> This could not stop the joy of seeing a great movie, with the opening of Eden Quinn, Donald Tops, Sutherland, and Ben Kingsley. In the whole movie, let me keep my seat glued. <br /> <br /> I did not find any flaws in this great movie, I would give my best suggestions for the love of thrillers. I am very proud to have this in my collection. <br /> <br /> 10/10 (I do not hand out this light).
