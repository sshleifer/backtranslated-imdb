Life Force is a highly schizophrenic film, based on Colin Wilson's novel The Space Vampierrers, this script ignores the notion of the novel and most of the structure (in fact it gives much more to Quatermium serials than the novel), but the scenes leave it, the novel is almost the same as the film. And the script should definitely be the most unfinished in movie history, although it was written in chapters in various articles. For example, hold Carlson, after the initial shuttle scene, he disappears, which believes in me that he has died. Then he returned to the film halfway through the film, so that the plot of the rebel Bright can be explained and it lacks the attention of the screenliters. That film spoils And there's a lot of violent scripting, such as the Hieroglyphic helicopter coming back to London and not realizing that it was run by the zombies until they were flying over it. <br /> <br /> I can go to the big holes about these plot holes but lifefresh is really enjoyable to enjoy your brain until you are using it. The Eliens were portrayed as a beautiful creature that hides in their composers, so that adults of very nasty people do not get their hands. Special effects and piratics are very good, there is a lot of work and one of the most memorable aliens as stunt and life force space girl. When referring to the life force in conversation with men, does it always mean a nation to say "the alien in a living life? He can be a life-threatening person at any given time" This picture is more popular than men. Women <br /> <br /> <br /> "Do not worry, a nude girl can not escape from here" can not she? <br /> <br />
