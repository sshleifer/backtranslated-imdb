I went to the movie theater, I had no expectation of the picture I was witnessing about, "Everything is enlightened". I rarely feel happy to feel American movies. Actor, Liv Screebber's director Abhishek, the film follows a man on his journey through the past, with a brilliant group of breakwashing English-language punks from Ukraine, his grandfather who believes that he is blind, and his crazy dogs. The first half of the film is fun and smart with the use of small but wonderful characters, but the second half of the film falls into a fascinating story of Holocaust. This little movie brings so much emotion and so much color to such a wonderful conclusion and it is more than just illumination stories, relationships and connections. Acting is incredibly powerful, mysterious and interesting for the story, and the artistic appeal of the film, to die. With some brilliant and absolutely sensitive scenes, "Everything enlightened" guided my heart.
