I was able to find the only print of Chikmatas Mangatri - I could not see it almost. This is shameful because it is one of the best Mijoguchi movies. The story - which I previously believed by Japanese directors and before - is a little hard working, and largely tragic romance story, from my favorite Mijoguchi films (Sanso the Bellef and Uggtsu Manugati), in this case a violent romance that touches strict class boundaries. There is always an incomprehensible vowel voice with Mijoguchi, and - on one side of the bad print - I was very happy. Like all the movies of Mijogchi, I'm hoping for a restored DVD release - whenever it can come ...
