In bad times, if not generally terrible, the King of the Comedy, King of Queens, is more than just fresh air, it is a complete oxygen tank! It's one of the 5 best comedy shows in my opinion. This has been something good to marry with children. Kevin James and Jerry Stylan Kunic genius! And believe me, it takes a lot to label me as a comic genius. These guys really understand what's funny I could see the seven episodes of Safefield and I could not see Keowe once. Career, Jeanette Hepharanan, Spence and Doug Pruden (Carrier Boss) are other interesting personalities in this list. I'm so happy managed to get many seasons from this gem. The show has been a ridiculous winner during most ridiculous losses. If you check it out !!
