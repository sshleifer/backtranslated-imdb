Russian legend Sergei M. See some sequences of a film directed by Eisenstein (wrong, total film 1/3 of the ice film), (his only significant director, Dmitry Vasilev Credits), I have come to understand how far this way, on such a scale, should be guided. If I was a member of the awards group during the liberation war of this movie, I would probably reward Eisenstein with the director's award after the death. This crazy stroke of cinematic genius is dragged into something that can be dragged into the film, even though this director might have stopped doing his best work - Battleship Ptcatkin and October - it could have been something that he so dreaded. At first. But sometimes in a movie that is a little frustrating about how black and white content comes in, it's a wonderful phenomenon of about 70 years after celluloid. Lord of the ring fans, to meet the grandmother of the film, to say so. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br> <br /> I said, some part of a promotion already makes a payment to it, and often bad. This is something that has a complete message and a view to it. It is still published in a great way with regards to the matter of hot debate (see controversial dispute over Moore's films), which can come out of a spectacular picture in a particular way. In this particular case, the Russians against the Germans When it was near WW2 and Russia then again the German attackers were confronted, and it is very important to remember that the Russians will never forget an important part of their history. The end result is going to be something that is actually common in battlefield and in October; If nothing else comes through these movies, it is very concerned about how Eijenstein can come together for visitors and visitors together, that style can spread completely to the complete failure of the viewer. Alexander Nevsky was uncomfortable in that position. <br /> <br /> But there are a few moments in the roles that are less rigorously highlighted, with the complete idea of ​​'Russia's Great, German Bad'; For example, when we first see Germans in Prague, they do not have any disrespectful blobs who are totally barbaric and none of them are blind winners (they can not do anything). They also have their own national pride, which will not help them to move forward with what their Christian-led leaders say. At least, the image of the film was confronted, but it was the lowest minimum for moving towards the more endpoint. Before the ice cream war, there is also a short scene where a trick of the Russian troupe can be told and laughed, and it adds a little extra depth where one can be of little value. Often, because of the complexity of the characters, especially with Nevsky himself (who played in a very heroic fashion, just asking for a start with Nicolai Cherkasov), perhaps because of the battle of pride in his war of war, more than Alexander Nevsky, perhaps Einstein would have given him such an impossible force Must be in this way to keep it as. Finally, in order to find the nature of Eisenstein film, try to find the feet of non-kosher pigs in Dellie. <br /> <br /> The actual reason to see the picture is not played, however, but for the appearance of the film, how it can run and accept it in a broader environment of the phenomenon. On the epic scale it is aspiring as its 20 films, not only in the main battle scenes, but also in hundreds of people in the city scenes. Actually, I would say that any director, Hollywood or anywhere else, is thinking of doing huge epics, especially the war, it would be great to watch the film, even stop the word. Think of it as a silent film if it's even better, with visualized accentuated at the visual stroke. An entire month can be spent for an analysis of the Battle of the Ice, how it started with the German soldiers, and then how the bugs came forward, and then how to fight with the closeness of the actinist actors and then how to catch them in wide shots. And with the spread-up editing And, of course, Sergei Prokoviev can not give up the power of the music by providing one of the great stimuli of any epic work. Always the director's execution keeps our eyes going on with this deadly act at a boring pace. If it was just a small film, it would definitely rank with the great, which is similar to the sequence of Odesa stairs. <br /> <br /> If I think I'm a little less than superb but it can cause errors. That's more silent than the words that come from a director silent medium. Although I still can not see Ivan the Terreval, one of my negative critics will be from the direction of the actors, which can actually be expanded, such as one of the high-pitch melaudrams, with its cool (two sub-plot) soldiers vying for Olga I can think of the best Example). But it is also considered, ignoring Alexander Nevsky as a whole is extraordinary, and leads a layer of action and film making to a level that puts a benchmark for movies and even even tries to try it till date.
