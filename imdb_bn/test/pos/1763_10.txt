Could this be the first color film? It's actually second. It is a very nice piece produced by Thomas Edison. This was one of his many other pictures. <br /> <br /> I think it's the most beautiful of Thomas Edison movies. It turns a girl dance and turns red with the film, which shows her dress moving around. It's just nice <br /> <br /> You are watching history when you see it. Seeing what you started to start great movie cinema! It may not be a plot or something interesting but it is a second color film. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone, especially if you are learning something about filming or sorting of students, you have started coloring them in colorful movies!
