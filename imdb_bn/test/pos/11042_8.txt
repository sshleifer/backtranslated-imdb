039: Anna Christie (1930) - 2/21/1930 release; 3/10/06 saw <br /> <br /> October 24, 1929: Black Thursday, Stock Market Crash. Now the country, and in fact, will look at Hollywood to flee from the Great Depression worldwide. Born: Anne Frank, June Carter, Yaser Arafat, Bob Neighth, Barbara Walters, Doris Roberts, Ed Asner, Dick Clark, Roy E. Disney, Gene Hackman Doug: For a long time, our AdGree began to warm up with Garra's first sound film, this is a common characteristic study known as Ana Christi. Miss Garbo, who could carry his talent from a silent era, showed his bat correctly (I wanted to see some of his silent work, but the netfix does not seem to be stocking them.) How wonderful! One thing I noticed above was the sound like the Swedish accent word, a letter word replaced with J. Anna's last character is over; I really will not care for her for her estranged dad. It sounds like the sound-recording systems are better (none of the mysteries), but the camera is still not running. We will be sure to see the changes in our ODC. Kevin: The first film of 1930 is the silent starlet Grey Garbo, Anna Christie's first sound film. This is a very easy movie, where there are five different locations where we extend the 89-minute running time of the film, with a longer stretch, often with a static camera. It was very good to see the word as well as Marie Dresler, and what we heard is quite laughable, though hearty, but the incessant churn of the addicted slurry. I've enjoyed Garbo's performance, since he's still holding the movie through the most horrific moments. I really did not like George Marion or Charles Biffford, because I was not sympathetic to any of them, so when Anna finally stood up for myself and I showed them that they were not related to anything I was worried and excited. Her father or her muscular-bounded Irish lover Famous Muni painter Frances Marion did not move slowly from the silence to the word gradually. <br /> <br /> The last picture seen: Fast (1928). In the end of the last film: The Love Parde (1929). Next Picture: Blue Angel (1930).
