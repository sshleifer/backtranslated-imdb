This is an excellent anime movie It is well animated, has a good complex plot and very good music. I realize that someone may think a little longer, but I think it's a good length and animation is a good traditional anime. <br /> <br /> Three characters using <br /> <br /> They are masterly in the way using Tenkai. For example, in these locations the body looks twice as much as the unexpected sound of the film. Tennkyai's design is also very good, as she looks as a monk and she wears the last armor. <br /> <br /> Old people Andu came down to earth and very desired character. When Zero meets with her, it's a bending point in the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is mostly in the background of the film, but she is really one of the heroes of the movie. <br /> Plot: Plot is good. It is traditional without unoriginal. It is interesting during the historical times, Meiji Restoration After the reconstruction of Shinunath, wealth was sought after Tenkai, when Zero found it to be used to help the Shogunate anti-Shogunate overthrow the Shogunate. <br /> <br /> The tactics Zero is interesting and it's a kind of "Hamlet" If Zero was not able to become Shinobi, then I do not think that he was able to kill him eventually (perhaps through surgery, but because of not giving arms to arms). <br /> <br /> All the death plots make it very dark, but there are some light moments when we see the memory of a few small childhood memories. It's all a good, dark, complex plot. <br /> <br /> Music: For example the opening theme is very good with electric guitars and drums. Occasionally they use pieces that I believe are Taobo drums, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> There are many good music. They played when going to IG Shinobi. I believe the piece is called "numato" and it has an incredible flute. Steam can be a pan flute, but perhaps a shakuhachi. <br /> <br /> The last theme "Kamui no komoriuta" is cool and delicate. The voice is beautiful and so the song is simple. <br /> <br /> Animation: <br /> <br /> When the animation is good, it is not perfect and the blood that the letters run is sometimes displayed as orange. The transformation is interesting and I think some changes are very beautiful. Zero and Ega Shinobi are an example of an excellent transformation running, sunset in the background and music is underway. Converting is easy, but functional and very good feelings. <br /> <br /> My last word: I think plot, animation, music and characters make it one of the best anime movies I've ever seen.
