The harrowing novel of Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness, was illustrated in the 1994 film. I read Conrad's novel, and I must say, even though I like the novel, the film is a great illustration. After following the journey of Mallow, sets and costumes designs conrad novels on the screen. Characters bring life through acting methods, voices, and personalities. If you read novels, I recommend you watch this movie. If you do not read the novel, then the film may be difficult to follow. Conrad's Heart of Darkness works, emotions and information made into a complete film that is almost one and a half hour long. Therefore, if you do not read the novel, the film's plot may seem very tiring to follow. Overall I gave this movie seven out of ten. The basic plot of the novel comes with a big set, dress and acting in front of the screen. However Joseph can replace Conrad's original work.
