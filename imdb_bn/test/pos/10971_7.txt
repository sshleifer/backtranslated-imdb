It was really a pleasure to see; The dialogue was - in the most part - absolutely outstanding (I think the role of women was a little better, which is a wonderful surprise). Performance uniform was very good. When Frank Gorsin leaves his competition, he does a little more, but it can be overwhelming for what I see as a weakness about how the character is written; He is otherwise very good. Harry Gonner played well in a similar way with a little underlighter character (Tony), visible in some aspects of the character. Usulah Burton is very nice like sister Theresa, she really carries her film through some weaknesses. Semur Castle and Lewis Flowers are not a little unused here, though I always like their work. Sheryl Jones, Windie Malik, Jill Eckenberry and Fay Grant are very good. (I could not help Grant to remind me a little Catherine here); Clarice Lichmann rather tears her role, with good results. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Closed, or weird looked. Closups overused (or erratically used) in my mind. And we just do not want to go to the scene from the scene as much as we want. Some of the methods of "tough guy" until the federal agent (music, costume) were at the top for me. And a few fantasy sequences really do not work. But there is something that has been done very well; For example, the first opening set in Buffalo near 1970. And, frankly, Theresa's work-related scenes (I liked the character and actresses a lot, which helps). Malic and Ikenby's scenes are very good. <br /> <br /> This plot may be slightly disconnected - It seems that at some time many schemes will have to hold them all at once, and the coincidence will be a bit more. And I was a little annoying at the end (should we really be successful for their biggest contour?), But along the way, the journey is very enjoyable. It would be nice to see a better movie made. <br /> <br /> 10 of 7
