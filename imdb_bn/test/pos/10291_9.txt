One of the most interesting movies that I have ever seen in the apartment. As I experienced extreme depression while watching this movie I was gunning for two leagues to revive. That finally happened to me that finally disappointed me. But the ending lends an even more cynical touch to an ordinary cynical movie. It's not a movie that people have a chance to review, but at a glance, there will be a deep impact on people. So far, I have not restored the movie and I do not think that I will. <br /> <br /> This story follows a man's experience, Max's marriage to Maxwell. While talking to Lisa, she accidentally heard that her old girlfriend Lisa (she considers the love of her life). So he tried to find Lisa. Here begins his highly frustrating search for Lisa. This movie has many levels. There are jealousy, vouyeurism and so under. There is another character named Alice who is involved in complete confusion. The film then goes through a complete range of divisors and finally ends, which can be interpreted in many ways. How are four main characters in this movie that makes it interesting and unique to cute but clever writing? What I love about this fact is, a movie about passion, jealousy is so light-hearted. This is a very fast speed which is probably likely it can appeal to a larger audience. The main character, the highest, the gray color and the felt I felt was perfect. I do not think he has been considered as a perfect character, because he is searching for his long lost love and he is also quarreling with Alice. <br /> <br /> Elise's character is worse. His manipulation and his obligatory lies can really irritate the audience (that point, I guess). The scene he broke in front of Lucian actually shows another aspect of his character. It shows an aspect of what he wants to accept and he is tired of lies and games, and he wants to live a normal life. Finally, she realizes that she has to get out of here. The end lend a cynical touch. Max's love for Alice seems to be temporary and fake. It is naturally to say that love is a temporary emotion and it is best to choose the safest option (like the Muirille) rather than to follow something like that (i.e. Lisa or Allis). In many ways it's not really a romantic movie but a mockery about romance (a way). <br /> <br /> Performance deserves high praise. Vincent Cassel as Max gives a great performance. He has completely portrayed a person who is not sure about his instincts. It perfectly fits the character to show its geeky an added advantage. But Roman Boehner, like the real star of the film Alice Below is Alice's love for women and her love for Max. The scene where he shouted, "I'm not even a nutritious" he really wants to live a normal life with his frustration and love of his loved ones. <br /> <br /> BTU also thinks that another explanation of homosexuality can be drawn from this movie. The actions of Alice can be explained in many ways. And her illogical emotion with Lisa can be interpreted as the desire of homosexuals. Encouraging Lisa to forgive her current boyfriend may seem like it's too far away. But I felt that he was gay for a long time. She avoided questions from Lisa regarding a boyfriend. He spent a lot of time with Lisa and at that time he was happy. It may be too much to question his sexual orientation <br /> <br /> Overall I'll give it a 9/10. I think it's worth it, but I've reduced the reason for the reevaluation. I think it is otherwise a perfect movie.
