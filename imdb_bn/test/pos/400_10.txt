The filmwork was a very delightful bit that was widely distributed. Ian McKenna is committing suicide in the house who is playing the soul loving DJ, who does not "go along with the program" and does not let the world know what they are missing. Supporting Cast is also awesome and the music is "Soul" movie. I just want to get the film released so that I can get a copy for my film library.
