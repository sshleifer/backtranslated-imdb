Like philosophy, it is difficult to blame Nihon Chinbotu Japanese people have benefited from their close relationship with the sea, and the concept of film is at the risk of the whole world and the life of the world - thanks to its volcano tradition. From the point of view of reality it has a drama rather completely disappeared under the wave of Japan shamelessly shameless; Why just Japan? So, we have the reality of film, it has been illustrated by spectacular (and popcorn) and some may have a great effect on it. It is more mature and better than traveling with Japanese radioactive monsters. Psychological elements are underplayed, and it really works. (However, it gets a little less with the theme's song on Climax.) <br /> <br /> Is Nihun Chinbotsu credible? Most likely not, but thriller explosions, and comfortable pacing one night hopes that made for more delightful entertainment.
