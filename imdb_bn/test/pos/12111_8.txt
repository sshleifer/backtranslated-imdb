Clouse Kinski popped up a huge number of Spaghetti Westerns in the 60's and early 70's; She is usually cast in second part as nasty villains. Kaki Claus has given herself a juicy leadership role like Crazy Johnny Luster, who is a dirty, bitch, and screwed sex worker who came up with a plan to kidnap a lovely heir to achieve her legacy. Johnny and his gang wanted harmful after the plan became devastating. The author / director Mario Costa is cruelly brutally ill and sternly working piece of stomach: The plot is expressed at a steady pace, the tone accurately captures impressive and serious and thrilling action scenes with real skills and brio (shoot-out in rock quarries, especially gripping and Is thrilling). Wickedly dressed in white clothes, raises oily charisma from every hole, and gets a chance to jump on beautiful women, Kinski's Jonny is an impressive curious and monk created for atrocity. Kinski is simply spectacular as this gloriously annoying character; He is a sweet, fiery salon girl, Jupiter, Steven Tede's screaming screamer Ricardo, Giovanni Palavicino's ruthless band gang leader McHeight, Giuliano Rafaela as a smart lawyer, Gary Pinkerton, and Johnny's sensational starter glenn as Paolo Casale. There are also codos for the studio Moody's and confident scores for the studio. Kinski sees good value for fans.
