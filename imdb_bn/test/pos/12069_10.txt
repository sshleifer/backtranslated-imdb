The house at War is very good. This has become my new favorite show. Me and my neighbors see this watch in Curly and April every Sunday together and laugh about how true life is. I love how everyone is so busy and so concerned and they live in each little problem. Once someone does nothing stupid, they never save it and thus have a family. Parents shed all the little things on three kids. I do not know how I can cope with the kids. It is true and true in a real family life that parents feel so embarrassed and there is no way to solve their teenage problems, only to keep the show above. The house is so cruel, honest in the war, and the truth about the world. It has become a milestone for sitcoms to come. This is not the happy day or the Brady bunch is this real life.
