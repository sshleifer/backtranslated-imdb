The head should have been a proud moment not only for his star (Munkyce and Victor mature), or his director / co-author (Bob Rafelson), but his other co-authors (and briefly), Jack Nicholson. As it stands, most of them turn it off and the movie is considered as the best Qiao for the outside. <br /> <br /> The TV series was based on the famous Beatles mockery. Help! ', This film is also judged by the same compromise. Sharp and painstakingly from Beatles films and even dated Monkees T.V. Head of the depth of the head, away from the series. An intrinsic nature of people's dark nature is working here, and when it is about a pop band, use of some themes and images (women can be sound as an odd thing to smile at, miserable and vietakon's real-life footage). Shoots the dead body on the range) The film gives an edge that many 'serious' films are ambitious Do not raise rise. <br /> <br /> There are also funny moments which are 'Big Victor and my personal favorite from James Bond Parody, under Mickey Dolenz Bareige by the Horde Arab soldiers. (One of them Mickey and thesis pssst !, to be present in subtitles for 'pssst!') This group is aware of the image of the image they created ('I'm Dummy, Mikey ??' Always Dummy ',' Tark ', claiming series One-dimensional foil briefly introduces), which means their character ?? They are acting here and not acting ?? Are more open, and ultimately they are less generic and irritating than the series. This level of parody and self-awareness comes with their fak-four sources, admits to the underworld, and the out-of-the-face acceptance with a waitress, who asks: 'Well, if eight sticks are not a gift to God, old people? ? Are you still respecting the ring star? 'Listen for the' Strawberry Fields Forward 'touring while also in the bathroom. <br /> <br /> Then there are songs. Six of them, a little more cyclical than normal, which separated their fanbase, even a Frank Zappa can not even become an adult audience in their fat at this time. Probably the best is the Commonwealth 'As We We Allang', although the first, Carroll King-made 'Pippaz song', discusses the desire to live in a lively way, while the time goes away shamelessly and the death is very close. In the lighter note, 'The smile of' Pimpsi smile 'seems to be annoying,' I woke up directly from Walsh '. <br /> <br /> Continuous innovation with direct references to uninterrupted films and drug culture, perhaps the headline of its headline is its narrative structure. Just not ?? But most important ?? Why it progresses with more than one philosophy, the story goes through different levels of left, right, front, back, round, and reality. Basically the sketches have been hanging together in a consistent way, its compositing is consolidated by plus-time defying plot which combines internal integrity through flashbacks, dream sequences, mind jails and remote control channel changers. <br /> <br /> With the perfect start and finish, this intelligent-written, intelligent film was not expected to pre-teen viewers of Monkeys and later had a negative critical reception. Now that the prospect has gone, this one needs serious reappraisal terrible.
