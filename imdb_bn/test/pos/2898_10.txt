How do these guys continue? They are almost 50 years old and they work as 30 years old. They play music for 3 hours every concert and rarely break a sweat. This DVD is their first concert in Rio, Brazil. Although people do not speak English, they try to remember these words in the most famous song songs and try to sing a foreign language in concert with their best friends. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Radio of Spirit from Tom Swar, this concert DVD will not keep you in a chair which you are young when you hear that break or move from the classic Do not want to. This was their 30th reunion tour (started in 1974). I went to their Scruton PA Concert, and it was just as good, although they could not play the freewill on PHY, so I became upset. <br /> <br /> They have their freeways, have their trees, they have YYZ, Pass, Drive, Dreamline, Red Sector A, Limlight, Holes Roll, 2112, and more. 10 out of 10 reasons do not compare any other. If you do not go to a concert, at least buy this DVD.
