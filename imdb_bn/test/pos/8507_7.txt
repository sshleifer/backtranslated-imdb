I watched Roger Moore-film and saw the 'NSNA' and I must say that it is good to see the Konqueror again. He has always proved that he is the only and only bond. <br /> <br /> This picture is not really an excellent composition but it is really valuable. The trick to sit here more well, the effect is interesting and interesting, Connery Connery and Brandauer are really a good villain. But Von Shido is just a waste and the score is often not good and there are several scenes which seem pretty unnecessary. <br /> <br /> 7/10 \ 2.5 / 4 \ 3+ (1+ - 6-)
