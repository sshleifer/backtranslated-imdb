Sometimes one of the most poetic stories made, Wagonmore is still a solid film like immediately. I love this movie, but I look forward to seeing some of John Ford's other western areas before looking at this. For the first time I saw 18 years old and I did not see much of the West, and I hate it. I think it's incredibly annoying. I kept waiting for something to happen. This photo took me a couple of years to love. Firstly, I fell in love with Western people - heritage, character, natural scene, conversation, etc. - and it helped me realize when I saw Wagonmaster again that many things were happening in it. <br /> <br /> I was more easily a moviegraph at that moment and I was grateful to tell the visual story and heard every picture telling me. WAGONMASTER is a very visual movie on the scene of one of the most visual managers of job managers topped in his career. <br /> <br /> This movie is a festival of life and its subject is more emotional and intuitive. Compared to other Ford Westerns In fact, it is not right that it is not saying that it is far less outward than the other western side. (Other westerns have external actions and internal emotions.) In the context of nature, it keeps nicely in front of its pioneers. There are many shots of animals and children - not for a page, descriptive purpose, but to describe this idea. That is why the movie can be called poetry. It is about the background story (which is just existent) almost as it is not nearly a mental concept, and it gets this idea through formation, editing, sound and music. In fact, some might be justified that it is a complete form of filming because the images are directly "Story" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It exists in its own position, allowing other Western or other movie terms.
