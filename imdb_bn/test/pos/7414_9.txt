It is not about how the film is widely judged in the world. <br /> <br /> I've chosen this for Â£ 1, and when I say it's the best pound I've ever spent <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Using some big melodies of time and portrayed in real clubs, people actually want to see that they want to stay there. <br /> <br /> Actors' performance is all round high quality. Especially Jason Donovan is standing for me (he's making a film with Frank N. Furtter at The Rocky Horror Show in London, so his drag phase was in full flow!), And certainly Tim Curie who spoke ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, ugh as the story however <br /> <br /> highly recommended.
