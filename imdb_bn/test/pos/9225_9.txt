Rainbow Bright and Star Stiler, in my opinion, is a wonderful masterpiece. Rainbow Bright (Betinina Voices) and Chris (David Mendenhall's Voice) came out of Ronald Bright (Ronald Allardrich's Voice) to retaliate. If you ask me, the princess was absolutely ridiculous and misleading. To me, he wanted Rainbow Bright and Cress to retaliate. However, I like setting the rest of his castle as well. In addition, I thought that Lurky (Pat Fr√©lez Vieille) and Morkie (Peter Coolen's voice) were horrific. Before I wrap this up, I want to say that everyone is completely throwing, the direction was shaky, and Disney has scored a big hit. In conclusion, I do not highly recommend its best viewers who did not see it, especially the deadly fans of the TV series. I guarantee you'll enjoy it.
