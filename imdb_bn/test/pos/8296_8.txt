When family happiness is growing, from the beginning, the wealthy parent's ward (Michael Ontkean) gets poor, and the family can no longer support it. Then Mother Fai (Jacqueline Smith) started to act as a routine in the family and started working to support the family, and at the same time, alone family has to manage family life. Not always that good, but as well as he can do. When Father Lennel (Joe Flanagan "Stargate Atlantis") is homosexual and living together with his boyfriend John (Joel Gracie "The 4400"), family life becomes easy, thereby giving a lienel to parents and welcoming his family No Lionel wanted to tell her sister Anna (Leslie Hraan) the most, because her family ignored her. That's what Lionel has cut off his father's ropes so he can not stand and he escapes from the house. This was not enough, son Greig (Brian Crusaj "Charmed") is enlists in the marines and sent to war. The story in this film can feel a bit slim in some cases, yet it has a lot of reality in it, which makes it look good. Since this movie describes many sensitive relationships and situations, I believe that it is best appreciated by adults, although it does not hurt to see teenagers and can not think before being adult.
