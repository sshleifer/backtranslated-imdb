This is a remix of anime classic from the 80's, and this one is even better. Silia, Nane, Linna and Prius Robotics have returned to their hard-knights as a night subtle fight with Boomers. The animation is crisp, well-developed characters, and action rocks. Priss is a singer in his regular work, so the series features some excellent songs as well. There are several violence, but most of it is against robots, and there are some fan services, but there is not much radioactivity. There are many additional DVDs, there are comments, which increase your understanding and the enjoyment of the show. Must have an ANIM fan for. Also recommend: Explosive Angel, Armitage III
