Enjoying art and architecture (enjoying the nearby modern art museum) after visiting the Kimberley Museum of Freshtho Worth in Texas, USA, and having a pleasant conversation with a woman in a knowledgeable bookstore. I hope this offer DVD ?? And at least not frustrated. <br /> <br /> Theatrical method, dramatic excitement, publisher interview, archive footage and stunning architecture are also the last quarter of Louis I. It is well-mixed to explore Khan's life. <br /> <br /> The documentary starts: In the thoughtful classical music dramas, the archives are sculpted with a shadowed face sculptured, crossing a spectral landscape, blocking the symbolically described characters in a train window ?? A journey ??, out of focus and focus, is finally the end of an article in a newspaper. Nathaniel Khan falls on the first page of the New York Times where his father is living together as the best American architect and announces his death. <br /> <br /> "When I first read the ego, I must admit, I was looking for my name, I also had her son, her only son, I did not know my father very well and never married my mother and she I have never lived with us (??) when I died at the age of 11. <br /> <br /> So years later, this illegitimate son is still frightened by the vague thoughts and feelings about his father. Personality like the person and the people, but the secret personal life escapes from there and influences him for doing something about it. <br /> <br /> For years, I struggled to be content with a little piece of my father's life. Viewing was allowed, but it was not enough. I asked him. I wanted to know who he really was. So I started to visit his house. And to find out what was left there. It will lead me to the other side of the world, to find someone who questioned me a lot. <br /> <br /> So, through the gradual discoveries of the two most famous renowned architects, we can know: 1) his views, buildings and architectural perspectives, and 2) his family, colleagues, man's life and he's human perspective. /> <br /> DVD provides a question-answer writer / director and an additional insight into additional footage, including the great Louis I. Khan quoted "Everyone is saying what is true, it is true of them, it can not be real." And "there is no idea what can be a good idea." <br /> <br /> The journey to discover this movie. Self-searching and discovery of a human, a great man, yet a man, is imperfect like all of us. We can respect him and know with the eyes of a little bitter son, but without openness and intentionless decision, and without justice. <br /> In an important interview with the people with her in various capacities. We gradually cut pieces of pieces from Bangladesh with this person till the last interview, who actually came back home with Vicerol and intelligent comments. <br /> <br /> Brilliant architecture, brilliant documentary.
