The impressive screenplay allowed some fantasies in Mixa, when Raman himself wizards left the bed and traveled through the underground natural landscapes of the last seafront, where he enjoyed many cruel cruelty for three decades in prison. This film is not completely free with a smart intellect and sometimes humorous voice, which does not soften the effect of the final act of the story.

This is a cruelty that is truly converted but not entirely by the definition of the movie; It is a must see and a year's best.
