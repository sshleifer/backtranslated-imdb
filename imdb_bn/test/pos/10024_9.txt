Although Larry Hama never saw an old cartoon, writing cartoons, file cards, and some comics would count for some writing. <br /> <br /> Old cartoon for fans, it's a series of new characters and similar continuity - and more insane Cobra Commander <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We still have old favorites Personal note, one thing that always tricks me, was "Duke Incharge" stuff, when there is a lot more officer *. <br /> <br /> The order of war is similar to the old series; The main strategy here seems to be CGI. It is fairly good, if not a little higher.
