I do not particularly care for Michael Jackson. Along with being a pedophile, I do not really like his music with the exception of some of the songs from his music album, Thriller. This is one of them. I like this video because it is one of the first and most important music videos ever made. <br /> <br /> It is directed by John Lindes, director of AN American Warloft in London. This music video is not so much a music video, but less or less, a small horror film. MJ and his date is a Verbabal movie. When they left the movie, they were attacked by a board of bloody jammy, when Michael Jackson danced his famous "Thriller". <br /> <br /> You know, it's actually a beautiful song with good synthesized bits. This and "Bit Bricks" are probably the only two Michael Jackson songs I can tolerate over. I especially love Vincent Price's Camio as a narrator. Its unique voice is perfect for a horror-themed video video. If you m J. You do not like its music, but you will have to watch this video at least once. By the way, he was good before becoming a vague white woman with a fake nose.
