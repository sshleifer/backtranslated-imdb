Clint Eastwood plays an injured union soldier found by a girl from a Confederate boarding school and she is replaced by confederate soldiers and returned to healthcare. It seems that there are scary intentions of men and women in this place. Headlestin pajji, the Prime Minister, does not support him for confederations and even closes him as his cousin. Of course, when people feel better, they become mostly female and make most of the rounds, but when she becomes barbarous then she actually becomes barbaric, she really cuts her legs, but she feels her own, of course, not out of punishment. Although some women do not get what they want, but a bit more. I have not seen it for years and it still has a certain tears that today's values ​​are still quite weird. Usually not all is Eastwood. If you have not seen this one, it's valuable. 10 out 8
