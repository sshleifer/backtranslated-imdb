Emanuele Crialese has done a fantastic job with one of those films back in the back of your mind over the years. This is the Respiratory (see comments and summaries here in IMDB). <br /> <br /> Now, for the first time on the screen, carrying young possessions near him, he took the viewers to a dark inefficient condition. A literal crown in dangerous water. The subject is migration. In this case, the new world from Italy (movie name). A big deal calls for its American release "The Golden Door". <br /> <br /> <br /> I hate to laugh about telling the story, So I will live somewhat in the crease and all its teams will work so brightly. <br /> <br /> First, he knows: as much as possible direct words. This means the whole film. Textures, pains, perceptions of reality always match smell, heat or cold, sweat and blood, life and death, as in real life. <br /> <br /> Bent metal and grinding wood, the air's notorious drone and the hazardous sound of the big engines and the horn of the ship are among the points involved in this film. <br /> <br /> A French couturier with cinematography in hand. The symbol of light is the first shot from the first shot (again, almost the first shot from the reaction) and the horror of intimacy and frustration, including the whole film. They are expecting very gray and great screenplays of people who have been struck by deceit and dirty boat. They are <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Again, as he did, Vinceenzo Amato himself also himself. He is the father of two sons (the same actor who was fifteen twelve and twelve, and currently nineteen and 16 years old) he has played with his most complex character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I guess he's reached the cement garden that perfection is achieved again and never achieved in his first film: L'Effront√©e. <br /> <br /> Maybe he feels a bit weird in his role. <br /> <br /> Position and set are stringent and compulsory, almost playing their character. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most outstanding character is Filippo Pousilo, a foolish little boy. Here's complete contrast with his first role. Then, he was uninterrupted as something that surrounds him that played a supercharged child. Now, all the expressions of his character. And just that: there is no sound. Tell the whole story with great power in his eyes. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is a film that will not be very well accepted in the states. It's all about Italian. It is so Italian that most of the time the language is one of the many older dialects than the Italian language. Americans may be too much for Americans because of this film in the United States. But after reaching out to the state, remembering the stories of their family, they can see these movies with surprise. <br /> <br /> Again, the handiwork of Christie's ideas has closed again, the water scene. Only this time it goes from water photography to ventilation. <br /> <br /> Another great and very good story by this filmmaker, which has only won 6 awards this year (2006) and was nominated for Golden. Lion Not a little work!
