I just wanted to say that when I was young my favorite TV The day came back in the light. I like characters and shows in the show. I thought it was an excellent show and still thought of this day. I enjoy watching reruns and I am a big fan. I love the characters acting off each other. I had a big fan who lived up late to those who see my favorite show with my mom. Now I can see my show again and enjoy listening to the theme song. Which I think was a great song for the show. My favorite character was Scott Hilland and Jeff Wincott. I enjoyed these handsome boys to take bad boys.
