Wow, it's the best sitcom from a friend in my opinion. If you have a shit day just sit down yourself with a beer (if you are old enough that. Do not have to make a bread beer.) And see a few episodes, it is the perfect recipe for happiness. <Br> <br /> The thing that I like most is that everyone is very fun at the show and they all have fantastic comedy timings. After some time you attached the characters and really care about them. I think the secret to the success of success is a lively life for them. Doug is greasy but still happy, he loves his wife and loves his friends. The father-in-law is flying to the soil, but Hey is perfect.
