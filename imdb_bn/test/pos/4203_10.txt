As a fan of the old Warning brothers gangster films, I tested it, it was the second best movie of the Adventure Classic DVD set which was one of my favorite movies; Its Antarctic Scott. It was a great warning for many movies in 1939, a great cast, John Garfield, Cloud Rains, Anne Sheridan and the dead children, who would later be known as Boyau's son in monograms. A good boxer (Garfield) who was not ready for the assassination, became ready for him and was rude to him by a harsh New York detective (Cloud Rains), he ended up in a fruit picking run by a beautiful woman (Gloria Dixon ) And dead children (Hunts Hall, Leo Gorski, Benard Pencil, Billy Holop, Bobby Jordan, Gabriel Dell) Come back to boxing but try to keep a low profile. It was directed by the famous director Bobby Barclay, who was directed by the non-stop classic such as the 42nd Street, Sonargaiz of 1933 and 35, Football Parade and more. I'd like to scream for the adventure classics like DVD's for Platinum DVD / Video to get a better budget price review (see my Scott of the Antarctic)) I gave them 10 out of 10 criminal, a great movie. The sick should say that I only saw 2 garfield movies, this one and body and soul. I thought he was a very good actor.
