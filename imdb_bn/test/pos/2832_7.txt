It was a good movie in full regard, but it has enough flash of power to be valuable. Pack made this movie in the same period as he created The Gunfighter, apparently he decided that he was a monument rather than an actor. A sad expression! He was a great actor who is perfectly willing to deal with characters that are not very interested, and they do very well. She is driven here in character and when needed, ruthless. The mission is the mission and the "men" with whom to do it, are essential. <br /> <br /> Without making a fool, think of this movie as a primary, great example of the Dirty Dozen genre. <br /> <br /> In this movie the dialog is transferred to a little ham, but it tells the story of atmospheric and intense and explicitly speaking. It works well by all character actors and even Barbara Petano is a credible performance. <br /> <br /> This is often not shown on television, so your local video store can be the only place to find a copy. Go ahead! It's an evening devotion. It's worth your time!
