Just go to see this movie. It taps into everything awesome about Rock and Roll, the band comes with some great songs (Classico, Choose Fate, Master Explorer etc). With all these Humor of Tianas De, it's the best movie ever made. <br /> <br /> The rear-back figures are sung in Mite Laugh and DOO Jeb. Ben Stiler and Tim Robbins are fantastic, I really like Tim Robins's character. You find out who the devil really is! Music and musical references are colorful and extraordinary. It is full of great songs from plain songs from The Who, DO and others. I personally think the band did not keep D's superb tracks at the top, but they gave songs like classics and master explorer. Seriously extraordinary music. <br /> <br /> Just look at it, for anyone who loves rock!
