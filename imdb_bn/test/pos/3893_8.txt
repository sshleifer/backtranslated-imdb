Not a stunner, but a good movie once or twice to see. Bill Messi shows that he can do more than just work; His writing was beautiful darn well. Great Supporting Cast, especially Jamie Cromwell as an extortionate personal eye <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He has seen many scenes where he is very thin, captivating and deceitful. It's enjoyable to see a adulterant, and for a little while I'm happy that things are going well for him. *** Out of four ***.
