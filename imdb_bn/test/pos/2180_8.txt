The five star finals were one of the best films of the 1930s. This is Edward G. Played Robinson and expressed a lazy newspaper and wanted to do some of them ... going to sell the newspaper. In particular, an innocent woman plastered across an old story page and helped to destroy her now happy life - many years later she was involved in a scandal. Because I love this picture so much that it was unnecessary and there were no fifty pieces - showing how many publishers could sell fewer papers. <br /> <br /> Here in the world, it's a remake of five star finals - with a few changes. Instead of Robinson, this film plays Hamfrey Bogart and he is not a newspaper, the head of programming at the radio station. Otherwise, the story is basically the same - a little less than this and lacks the intensity of the original and lack of sensitivity. This picture does not look bad - it just does not pack enough as a punch just like the first movie. In other words, if you see one of these movies then first see - though this movie is quite powerful and enjoyable. For me, I like this story a lot, I've seen both movies and enjoyed both. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Muck - Lots of muck claims One part of a famous carnage that happened more than a decade ago was one way to discuss dramatization - though the killer was expelled and he only killed himself. However, they decided to pick up the story, as he was guilty and even pretending to be a minister (!) To send a writer to the lady's house and to preach his current name and anywhere. Needless to say, this woman leads to destruction and a tremendous tragedy. Then, and only then, Bagart felt any real remorse for making garbage - which gave Dundee Finlay to journalism about honesty and modesty. <br /> <br /> Good acting, a great story idea and a message that is as important today as it was before the 1930s, it's a story you'll see. In particular, see the wonderful and very emotional scene where the girl attacks the owner and Bogart - this is a great example of acting and writing.
