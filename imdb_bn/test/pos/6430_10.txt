It's just ten minutes long work. Its a hunting piece but I will pay ten bucks in the movie, to watch it, there is a full-length movie to watch this moment. This is a simple piece of reflection of a man. He came from a young man in this place and was coming from a room and music ... and now he is sitting here, in this place he dies at the age he is so heartwarming to connect his young man. The music is bright on it, the gitters are like jazz-room cats, like the music of the young man of the dead. If you get the chance, check out this movie. Its worth more. Roger Haur has made more such films, I think he gets more respect. The moment you hear him, "Everyone's favorite monos" is sure that the king does not want to remember as an actor. He has directed this film, so it shows that he is a very artistic actor / director. Changed from a B-grade movie which he has been doing since the first 90's I hope to see more of this Roger Hour because he is my favorite actor.
