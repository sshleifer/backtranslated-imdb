The marriage of a new New York City couple divorces with the wife when the wife wants ("She takes great courage to go outside the door!" A neighbor tells us); The busy, confused husband takes the responsibility of "mother language" and is close to his son, but soon the wife returns. The very impressive picture does not give us a very realistic family unit (young Justin Henry must of course not be the same as the wedding product between Dustin Hoffman and Merrill Strip!), But the dynamics are stimulating and involved and director Robert Benton keeps pace with cleverness, extraordinary classical music, sunny editing and Lots of popping with a sure bit of humor The strip's character was designed to be a cold, self-centered witch, but I was probably ready to feel more about it than wanted to be a Benton. How difficult it was to Hoffman's Sheikh Hasina and how to make it a black and white, good and bad step by getting a second chance from being a good parent. The film never fails from its predecessor and plays very well, but I'm not sure that Benanton was steering the film in the final act, and the last scene was surprisingly uncommon. *** *** to ***
