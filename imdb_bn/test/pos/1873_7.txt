To get this project from the land, this culture icon Bruce Campbell has taken a few years - but finally, here it is - and how much of it is a scholar entertainment! Looking at plot It sounds like two things. A great foundation for a very stupid B-movie, and a shameful excuse for Bruce Campbell, which he does best - the Evil Dead II style snapstick humor, and this movie both count. The Man of the Scream Brain is the best of the comic book Nonsense - but there are some great scenes and it's almost impossible to get annoyed with this movie. Bruce Campbell wrote in this movie, ordered, made and took it - and although it was not bought by most citizens, it can be said that it is a credit that is a man famous for protecting himself from a wooden cabin. This plot follows a business trip to Bulgaria with his girlfriend American businessman William Cole. The trip goes wrong, however, when he, his girlfriend and his taxi driver dies; Thanks to the same woman. Mad Scientist Stacey Keech is in the hands of the club and the driver of the taxi driver; And we got a goddamn flick in our hands. <br /> <br /> The first half-hour or so entertainment and a few smiles feature; But once the main plot point has been executed; The movie really takes up. Bruce uses scenes of all sorts of situations, to decide what to do in a restaurant (with his brain taxi driver) to decide, to change his clothes in a waste manners. Humor is mostly the variety of crystals and anyone who enjoys Evil Dead 2 (which anyone saw it) will also enjoy it. Campbell seems to be playing a little harder with this whole project, but if you see it and you do not see Bruce well, it would have been frustrating. In addition, there is no respect for human beings; But he has not been the actor with the greatest range. Despite having a lot of fun; The film is not great, it sometimes becomes too stupid; And there is a complete sub-plot with a robot that I do not like; But overall, The Man with the Screaming Brain is a film that we sadly do not see too much nowadays. The film is an all-out, forbidden no bar, B movie; And if it does not do anything else deserve respect for that.
