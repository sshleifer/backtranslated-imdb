I just got the DVD for hardware warfare, in a shiny new package, looking overwhelming. To find a slew of extra fun things, my DVD player stuck it out. Extra content in DVDs is more than a movie. For those of you (shame!) Hardware war never seen, it's a fantastically fooled Star War spoof (course IV, IV). Time fighters, X-wings, R2D2, and the dead stars, as well as household appliances (such as aaron, toaster, vacuum and a waffle maker) are standing. Instead of Princess Lea, our princess has Anne-Dori, complete with the hair of Sinobon. If you get points, I'm sure. Mad Silence, and a fun journey for a Star Wars guy (like me!) <br /> <br /> Now, DVD - Wow! A director's commentary, where he originally went to the movies, made fun of himself and the project. An interview with Fozielius on Crayer's features (remember?!) And ridiculous "director's cut" and "foreign version" of the movie (of course all joke). However, this is great. I like the hardware war in the theater, and I was very happy to have my collection DVD - MST 3 was involved in: Movies and Thumb War!
