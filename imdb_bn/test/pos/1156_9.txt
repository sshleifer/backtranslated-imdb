1904. The North African country of Morocco is facing a small independence, such as Europe, France, Germany, Britain, Russia, Spain and now the United States is trying to influence the region. Sultan (Mark Zubar) is a weak doll; His uncle, Vladek Sheybal, who is being conspired by French and German, is the real power behind the throne. Reef tribal leader and "the end of Barbary pirates" repeatedly write Chifan Roussilli (Shan Connie), who kidnaps an American missionary, Eden Pedekaris (Candie's Burgen) and his two children, and takes them hostage. In the United States, President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) threatened war on this issue: "Pedekaris Elive or Roussillie Dead!" - The problem is seen as the perfect way to practice his "big stick" diplomacy, though Secretary State John Hey (John Houston) is not so confident. However, there is less bad planning for the Raisuli pedikigeses, more than managing yourself in any event. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A middle-aged man, a wonderful bit of escapism. It has some wonderful action scenes, a malicious, well-written script, a delicate cast to enjoy yourself with the material, and does not welcome such films as "Caribbean pirates" or "Lord of the Rings". This is not actually an "epic" movie in the strictest sense, but it is also one of the best pure action films ever made. <br /> <br /> Historical context suddenly, the story is interesting, and as some critics point out, today it is more relevant than it is made President Roosevelt said, "America is like a tropical bear" - strong, strong, but sometimes a little blind and lazy. During the film's setting, America has been driven on the world stage as a highway following the triumphant victory in the Spanish-American War - and Roosevelt assumes this phenomenon as a way to prove America's worth. In real life, it did not work in a number of ways, but figuratively it works well. While writing from right-wing perspective, Milius's screenplay is quite accurate in determining its position in America and the world. He praised Roosevelt and his "big stick" approach to diplomacy and correctly (in Roosevelt's words) that America will fear and respect even though they will not get true "love" around the world, whatever they do. And there are some scenes - such as the shooting of European leaders of Ruswood and the comedy attack by Marines in Bashor Palace - which shows America's helpless and violent points, others - Climatic showdown with the Germans - show their heroism. </ br> <br /> In the historic / political context of the film, essentially meat on an action / adventure film bone. The rescue of the Rasuli Rezuli's Pedekaris has taken some brilliant steps from the double crossing tribes, which highlight some of the best features of a film in the movie. The opening of the Raussuli and the attacks on the Marines and the attacks on the Marines before the Braves were set in pieces. And the final war, which combines elements of "Lawrence of Arabic" and "The Wild Bush", when a major historical imagination (a battle of three battles between German, American and Rifle), a fantastic stage, adrenaline-pumping sequence. <br /> <br /> Excellent Cast gives some awesome performance. Everyone seems to have fun with the film, and it shows. Shan Conreei is incredibly believable with repeated accent with a Scottish accent, but managed to take away his striking, disciplined and impressive character, who show respect for his hostage and boasts of modern, disrespectful warfare. Candice Bergen, the actor I never liked, he did a good job like a congratulated Eden Pedicris, who is as tough as his captive. Brian Keith is an incredibly trustworthy TR - You really think he must have liked it, like an athlete, cunning, yet practical and intelligent people with his famous feelings. While discussing foreign policy, Roosevelt's boxing and goal-shooting scenes are some of the biggest "bad ass" moments in movie history - and "why does the beauty of the law loot with legitimacy?" Who can forget lines like this? John Huston provides more firm support as a tired, cautious hey, which acts as the perfect foil for the more robust Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> Among the best supporting cast, Joprey Lewis is like the best of the political gimmicks, as well as the ambassador, and Steve Kanali, the Gong-ho Marine Captain who happily endorses and carries in the middle of the political plot;) "Military intervention!" Completely complicated situation as a curvature and simple solution. Other familiar faces such as Vladimir Shawl, Nadim Sawal, Ray Jenson, Larry Cross, Mark Zubber and Darl Fatty also work well, how small their role is. Spanish Western fans can recognize Antonin St.-Jan (as a "dynamite boxing") as a German general and Aldo Sambral as one of the Raussuli tribes. <br /> <br /> "Wind and Lion" is a nicely done adventure film. This is something for everyone: wonderful guns - and swords, many humorous, a difficult, capable heroine (and two cute kids), a wonderful (if incomplete) romance, and an interesting (if fantastic) political / historical context. This is not a great composition, but hey, it has not been tried. I do not have a stirring "wind and lion" and they give me the highest recommendation.
