36. Hospital (Comedy, 1971) A series of emergencies have been stuck in Manhattan hospital. Due to the vicious and right side of the patients, and an illiterate worker is dying. When a resident doctor was caught in death, the chief medical examiner said. Boke (George C. Scott) is called for investigation. He worked as a doctor for many years and through the crisis of his life, he said. She decides to commit suicide. But then he met Barbara (Diana Rig), a youth-hippie beauty. Curious insights into life help the depressed. <br /> <br /> Critical: Black Comedy shows the performance of the famous actor George C Scott's 'Tour-de-Force'. She is strictly tested strictly, who is good at playing harsh, serious characters. The first half of the film expresses a melody, which gives a good description of life in the hospital and sometimes they are there. But then, look at the thing for a dramatic climax as it skews in the slapstick comedy. If Paddy Chifsky's script maintains its dramatic sense, I would be surprised if Scott could have played with another best actor Oscar (he had previously won 'in absentia', the previous year). His separation (suicide) scene is one of the most stylish true movies in history. <br /> <br /> I have been sitting in my hotel room for a long time, criticizing my shoulders, life and suicide thoughts, I said, 'no one will do it, you are a doctor, a healing person. A necessary person, you are meaningful. ' Then I know that my doctors were murdered by some nurses, how can I maintain the sense of such meaning? "
