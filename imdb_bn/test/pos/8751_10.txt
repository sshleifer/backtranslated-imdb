It was in PBS when I recorded a while ago, but it was not a chance to see (probably due to favoritism for sitting in the Masterpiece Theater for 5-6 hours, it was made for its BBC TV production style (or music, all one room in the settings) , No outdoor scene flat TV look ...)) but after watching the movie traffic (which I think was quite good at that time) I dig the traffic tape Ahayya could not. They could sit for an additional 2½ hours. <br /> <br /> Boy, my idea of ​​this TV series was wrong. It's much more involved than traffic. Characters are well-forgotten so that their actions are more credible. And the whole subset of Pakistan involved in attracting the attention of the peasants to the end users in the complete supply chain. In Traffic, the Pakistan story was reconsidered and a good police versus v. Police super police was reduced. <br /> <br /> There were many meaningful discussions and debates about alcohol and other types of drugs, but most of them became Traffic in reference to the significance of reference. Together with social problems, the traffic was propagated with reality. When in traffic, the characters are made for Jas T.V. TV's "Issue of Issues" films as they make it a statement. <br /> <br /> Traffic was not for a bad person versus a good person, but even a dealer was portrayed as a junk sold to support his practice instead of "no one can match me" in the traffic. Before watching it, it was not difficult to compare to the scene, and the scenes were not the same, although I knew what the outcome was going to be. Thanks to God for the Pakistani story, which is quite different that it gives me a chance to fully enjoy and think about which one compares. Although I think medicines were thought that Helen returned to Germany (such as in the story of traffic) in ceramics of the brain. Thanks, God is not a traffic hockey and was not expelled.
