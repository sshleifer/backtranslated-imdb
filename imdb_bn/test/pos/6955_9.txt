J Crayven's criminally ignored movie is a tranquil breath of fresh air in an independent narcissistic and derivative world of independent films. First of all, photography is pure aesthetic pleasure, assuming all the sad beauty of North New England during the autumn of the autumn (cinematographer Paul Ryan Malick's second unit on the days of heaven). Secondly, the performance is absolutely amazing - Nike Lourdes of Rip Torn is uncommonly charming and the Venture of Tent Cardinal's is not once called a sensitive and enthusiastic, excellent supporting cast. Overall though, it is a tribute to the descriptive power of the film that keeps the strong and vivid motion during its own time, and the film comes in natural and true conclusions, but it does not seem to be expected. This is one of the rareest films in independent film world, it is a film that invented a small part of the intersection between humans and history.
