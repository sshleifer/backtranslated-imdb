This wonderful 3 parts are one of the most sweet love stories I have seen in a while in BBC Productions. Actresses display a very high level of talent, especially Rachel Starling as Nan Austly. She is funny, seductive and clever. Love scenes and close kisses are very erotic regardless of sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> The characters are well defined and very credible. I think it is a good adaptation to a well-written novel, a tribal product. <br /> <br /> is a really remarkably well-paced drama that starts at a quick pace after two annoying (but necessary) scenes at the beginning <br /> <br /> My vote: 9/10
