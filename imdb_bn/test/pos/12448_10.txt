A hardcore rock band from Sleeping Dude Moines, Iowa. Nine band members who wear customized boilersets and personalized, homemade masks (for example, # 6's Clown Masks, # 0's Various Gasmasks, # 8 Tatters + Dummy Mask Crashed with Dredlocks). It seems that the song itself is moving towards the final screen between the senses and the other, but it is so beautiful and psychologically edited. <br /> <br /> "Welcome to our surroundings" rather than a general title, but the footage itself is something else. Interview with the band, their last, cellfilm album, 2 live performances, and a forbidden-by-MTV music video (a glorious tribute to the classic Kubrick film "The Shining"), and even less than half of the film. One hour, but of course it's worth it. It is perfect for the introduction of any metal / hardcore fan in Slipknot.
