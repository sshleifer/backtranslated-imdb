Ed (briefly a editor) is hired to spend horror films in Europe (where standards are more stringent). But he is very mind-destroying movies and is becoming a bit crazy. Okay, "a little bit" might be obscure. <br /> <br /> I'm the only one to say the best: the best. Opening View What A man in a office who pushed his head up with a grenade. His boss then says - with a direct face - "you are fired". The whole picture does not hold this layer of intensity, but it certainly does try. <br /> <br /> Take clips from Shotgun Scenes, Dispatition, "Lost Combos" (which my friend Jason Wishwa was a real movie). The author of this photo gets raped by a beaver and then after a face shot with a bazooka immediately thought of a woman's idea. You will not get any movie (at least, I will make you very suspicious) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is not as crisp as the 1997 film and the word can be touched (though it is not bad). I thought I was looking at the pictures of 1980s. Although, it gives me a bit of increase in my mind - the film was based on the 1980s text style and it was operated on: a funny idea and a little extra over the audience. I miss those days <br /> <br /> I would like to say more, at this moment I can not remember anything powerful enough to appreciate this movie. I think you ought to see this. You've seen your video store box share it ... maybe you've passed it a few times. Maybe you think it will be cheesy. Take it out Taste it
