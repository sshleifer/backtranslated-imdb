All that identifies it as a simple emptiness of 'Elephant' - you can make a comment on your own opinion in favor of a movie (in spite of it being mixed in other movies). <Br /> <br /> Those who question the legitimacy of this film - In terms of its stereotypical characters (compulsory gay, joke, disabled children etc.) - I'm not sure how long you've been to school - but despite how amateur can be acting - The events that may happen are surprisingly close. <br /> <br /> And those who do not think this movie is so easy: only six teenagers regularly teenager Angst, who pushed one on the edge ... no one could think, and the girl who took her life, she was not six ! Point out as a comment - he was probably the screen time of 2min max (excluding the final scene). I think the point of the film does not just excite the teenager and it is not even how much it can accept - but it is not visible to anybody who is always in danger of doing such a thing (a suicide) ...
