Britain and France declared war in Germany in 1939, but then, almost all Europeans fell into the progress of the Nazi war machine. At the time of entering the war, Britain started with less than ten to more than one person with less supplies and an air force. But Bright's will was strong, his new Prime Minister Winston Churchill declared that "we would never go down" <br /> <br /> Britain's war was going on August 8, 1940. But for the first time Hitler had hit the wall after the announcement of victory over the world. Although broadly expanded, the British Royal Air Force invaded the offensive and the number of casualties of the German German Lufthaffe on eight days in September 1940 and October in October 1947 reached thirty-five thirty-five lost aircraft and crew. Hitler's anger was frustrating, but he had to find a passing time. Reaction year after year, Hitler carried out extensive bombings in London on Christmas Day 1940. I say that there was no disaster rivalry to compete in London's real live footage during the attack. British people are coming out of their underground shelter to resume what happened after the bombing of perhaps the most influential influence of this chapter in the series "Why We Will Fight." Even as you see, the city of London has no way of understanding the living horrors that go beyond virtual destruction. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the Nazis became frustrated. Everything wanted to believe in Hitler's independence and democracy was now his head. Rather than being deliberately deliberate and self-confident like the French, the British were not going to leave without war. And they fought, took air warfare in Germany and responded with German homicide. It was a turning point, Hitler forced to reconsider his strategy.
