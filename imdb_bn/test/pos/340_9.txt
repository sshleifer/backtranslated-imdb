Kannathil Muthamittal is only seen in a long time between most sensitive and cinematic movies. The story of the girl who took her 9th birthday teaches her parents truthfulness. He tried to know more about his real mother and his mother asked for a terrorist now. <br /> <br /> The film's glory is in its simplicity. Moni Ratnam usually shows the tendency to create unreal and exaggerated impressive characters in this film, each person feels real and their interaction is sensitive and sincere. This is why it is considered as one of his best movies. <br /> <br /> This picture has been lost emotionally in the heart of viewers, and as a nine-year old Amyadha, there is a symonan like Karthon and her adopted mother. Only bright. Their relationship is the foundation stone of this movie. There are some notable flaws here, especially in the scene where Amudha learns that the child she has received seems awake and completely unrealistic. It is hard to believe that such sensitive parents would cut news that they did. Another flaw, surprisingly enough, bright songs <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said,. This beauty is not only in script or characters but also in technical glare of Tehran, Rabindranath's camera work is mere poetry. Perform all the characters creditworthy and realistic humor, especially in the teh flashback scene. <br /> <br /> a sincere 9 !!
