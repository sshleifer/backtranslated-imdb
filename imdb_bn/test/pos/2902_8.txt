I saw this movie in a double bill in "Valley of the Kings" in 1954. These movies have helped to inspire a lifetime of interest in Egypt. (I went to Egypt in 1975!) Today, the "Egyptian" flat talk and some of the carvings are in touch, but it's a glorious movie - a thing like Hollywood, now does nothing - and it's a great story ... just The daughter of a normal child-girl or a revenge-is not my case. This recovery print seen on the worst 20th Big Screen will not be reissued.
