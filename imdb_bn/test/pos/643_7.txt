This could be the most exciting movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Actually, it is so nervous-viking, I have not been able to see it again after seeing it two years ago, but I Since I have the DVD. Here were some scenes that are almost too much to watch .... So if you have trouble and "run away" for one and a half hours, then this film will restrain your mind from anything else. <br /> <br /> Russian actress Mourina Juddina did a great job in facial expression, which was done in a silent way because of her character. She plays a cute and delicious makeup artist for a sleazy filmmaker. After the shooting of the day and "delivery" is about to go, he listens. He travels around where he is drawing and discovers that he is now shooting "snack film" and is actually killing someone. Billy's secret information is discovered and he drives for his life because the murderers are looking for this big warehouse-type building. <br /> <br /> Here are two extended scenes in which our heroine is going for her life and both of them will wear you. I mentioned above the first. The second scene, the climatic one, goes very long and is not as good as the first. In fact, the film should have been pruned a bit, but overall it was good for our attention, so it served its purpose as entertainment.
