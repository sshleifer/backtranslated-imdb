Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice" had at least half a dozen silent-film editions and there were several television productions. But no one has ever gotten to create dramatic features of big budgets from the game. . . until now. The most memorable character of the game, Siloque the Casey Jew, it is a good assumption that the small displeasure in Europe in the late 1930s and the late 1940s might have disappointed the filmmakers' enthusiasm. The original inspiration for Michael Radford's new movie is Al Pacino giving screams, bra, broods, motors, and the opportunity to suffer - which he's pretty good. Like Richard III, Shylock's role is a scene-chaser's dream. It is ridiculous to call Shakespeare anti-Semitet because he never met the Jews. The Jews were banned from England 300 years ago before his death; And its unlikely that he never travels abroad. At some level, the Jews may also become a mythical race for them. However, Shakespeare may not be anti-Semitic, certainly his game Pascino Shylock gives a peculiar pronunciation Perhaps the suggestion of Jesus is the slightest indication. Unfortunately, the result was 16th-century money, Fajji Beer's unreasonable fiction and identity. The version of Radford started with a crawl on the suffering of the Jews, and then Antoine (Jeremy Irons) spontaneously spiked Shylock (Passino), who really stood in the mind of his own business. It will buy when it comes out DVD, definitely! Sarge Booker
