But as Opera is considered as the head of the House of Representatives, the real story of wild gypsy las made by Prospermemi in 1845 was never told by the Spanish director Vicente. Aranda ('Juna la locke AHA mad gain', 'amantes', 'they told you I fell down' etc.) José, the author of the novel by finding a story from Carmen's lover, is the only proper benefit for the story of this famous Gypsy Wild Lady. <br /> <br /> Carmen (surprisingly beautiful and gifted Puja Vega) works in a cigar factory in Seville, which is a factory in the very center of the military station where José (Leonardo Saberglia) is set up. Carmen is intensely focusing on a Gypsy in a war by a factory worker, Carmen colleague is murdered and arrested. Jose was physically attracted to Carmen, and when Carmen flirted with him, he allowed him to flee - the promise of emotionalism with Carmen back on his loan. Carmen kept her contract, faced her first sexual encounter, and Jose was destroyed. Because of his lack of military discipline, he lost his position and was imprisoned for a while, but in his liberation war, again he faced Carmen, killed a fellow officer and feared that Carmen's runners and living with Gypsy. People Many incidents happen to try to make exciting ties between lovers, but when Carmen's real husband is released from prison, destructive behavior ends, Karmann's cruelty and relations with Bulfighter and Carmen and Jose's emotions come in a sad end. <br /> <br /> A story that produces the story (adapted for screen by director Aranda and Joachim Jorda, played the role of Prosper Marymy (J. Benedict), in this way: In response to his question to Josie, the story of the budget is complete only the outline Fantastic acting, painters by Paco Femania and excellent musical score by Jose Nieto scored the success of this very subtle film. Contribute greatly to innovate. This is a must for lovers of the opera Carmen, a great action and drama of complimentary historical pieces. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
