I did not see any file in a language that I did not understand because I wanted to watch the movie and I could not find it with English sweetie. I do not know how much I missed but it was not much. The speechless simply gives details only until you probably interact with the emotional level and characters of this movie. I want to mention Desmond of Germany, there is no reason to feel 'sucks' while commenting on the mental energy of the film. As I said, I can not understand the Japanese language - at least in a little bit I have come to read a very long novel - all my favorite books that I could not keep down and the next day was closed. Just finished reading from the work! I do not know if there is an English dubbed or subdued version, but if the movie is there then I would like to see it. The film was incredible in Japanese, something good for icing of cakes !! Slainte ', Maegi
