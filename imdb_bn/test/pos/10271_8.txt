Max selects a ring in a jewelery shop where a slick production holds interest from the first scene. Most of the later reminds Shakespeare's dream of "mid-summer night vision", where Demetrius and Lisander love each other's girlfriends. Here at first glance, Max and Lucian both mix themselves with Lisa and Alice, and Elise addresses herself as Lisa. At the top of Marie Mix-Up, Mac wanted to get involved in events that brought back memories two years ago. And because Mac has a lot of dreamy episodes, our next fall under a flashback, many of my opinions are because I was not sure whether I was present or past after seeing this movie first. Running through many aisles, stairs, doorways, elevators etc. I accept all of the movies in the fast paced, but do we have so many people in the conflict with each other? It can have any impact after four conflicts, if you forgive the penalty. High mark for industrial design! The apartment itself is really beautiful with its taste decorated, but I myself asked how a few women can afford such luxury in Paris. Jumping from a window is always exciting to save a person's motivation on suicides and when it exits at the same time around the Mac. But a kiss or two soon makes him feel better. If you can manage to find your way through all the flashbacks, you will eventually find yourself at the airport where Max's dedicated sister gives her the most affectionate kiss. It can be said that he solves the complexity of love, such as the "mid-summer night's dream".
