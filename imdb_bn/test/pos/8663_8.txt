A bus drops off an unnamed man out of a run-down standard oil gas station in the middle of a bus. Where did the bus come from, or why he did not fall on it, or he did not even know. Why is he the only passenger? Is he prisoner? Did he mention the title of "boring people" movie? He died and went to heaven, or hell? Like our people, we do not get a chance to stop and wonder. She is met by a gatekeeper and shuttled off a nondescript city. From the first day, it is all liked for him. An apartment has been rented, found a work, an office allocation. In fact, his life is not entirely unlike corporate cubicles and suburban condos virtual life in reality. Woman heartless, a drag in the dinner party, suck in the office job But some pieces will not fit the puzzle. Cleverly skilled, gray-clad goons roam the streets. Are they any kind of paramedics, or secret police? And why there is no child? Is the story set in the real world? Whenever we think we get some answers, the new mystery will be exposed. "Boring people" half of you that you refine half, more than half more. I hope they find it in a computer game soon.
