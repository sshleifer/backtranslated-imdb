I've been writing rude criminal fiction for years now. When a writer develops a story, he always has a character / actor to live in the story. Last weekend I found a new man playing Paul Benny in Eddie Monroe in Paul Vario. It was a slick film highlighted by Vario's presence both on and off the screen (its voice-over description is also heard). I especially like actresses like Ben's nephew and former wife of Eddie, although everyone has done bad work with bad guys and the dual crossing with them. A nice work around ... and Mr. Violet bright. That day I must be Tony Ganguly ...
