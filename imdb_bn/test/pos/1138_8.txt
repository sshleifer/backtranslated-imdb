Ten years ago, "The Matrix" and "Hot Live" were hot due to the healing of low budget science fiction film. If you like a weird, unusual, intelligent challenge, David Lynch meets John Carpenter-style filmmakers who will like you to split up. Framing and cinematography have true genius moment. After a view of an art opening party closely watch a chain of shots through wine glasses and involving the right cou card. This plot involves a man named Starker, who lives outside the community who want to wake up from the dream. Similar to "Live live", "1984" and "Matrix", it proves that we always keep an eye on the shadowy Big Brother type public agents, which knows everything about us and invisible robot searches keep the city in constant surroundings. All this is expressed very soon in the plot. Possible spinner: Starker discovered a drug that when water is stored, everyone will wake up from the real delusion. As well as cinematography, the director works in an impressive way with his shoe budget, the other highlights of this movie are single. I challenge anyone, remember and challenge the classic quotes from this movie for the upcoming year.
