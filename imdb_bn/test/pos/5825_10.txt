Oz TV shows which are intensive non-stop adrenaline. This is not a show that is not intended for a big audience, but it is a very adult based on theme specifications. Apparently, it did not achieve mainstream success, because it was unlikely but there were many fame with his audience and the famous actors played the guest or became part of the show. <br /> <br /> The Oz is a series of fictional stories in a New York state where a prison is located. There are many ethnic groups that represent some minor role. These groups include Muslims, Homoebians, Aryans, Bikeers, Italian, Latinans, Irish, Christians, Gays and others. Some people are related to each other as bikes and Aryans, although Arya has many groups like enemies of Muslims and homeless. <br /> <br /> Oswald Panantari (its official name) is a policy that can not be approved by many members of any ethnic group. It is called the "General Population" or "Zen Pop" in the Maximum Security Prison and Regular Prison where sometimes the prisoners are sent or sent from them. The main character of the show is Augustus Hill, which describes the story before and after the main section, crossing through a documentary style and a biographical picture. Hill is bound to use wheelchairs as a consequence of its unknown past. He is part of the "others" group, which coordinates a person who does not fit into other prison gangs. <br /> <br /> It is small in many groups, which can protect themselves from most problems. Twice as the greater ones engage in conflict with each other. Some of the most notable characters are as follows: 1) Ryan O'Reilly is in charge of his colleague Irisman, and in some ways voluntarily involved himself in lethal activity for the weakest link. 2) Miguel Alvarez is seeing Latino who has constantly struggled with his own gang and dealing with his popularity with others. 3) Simon Adebse Nigerian, who was a former leader of HomeBS Gang. Hyss are very big and hard to physically For these two reasons he is one of the most powerful prisoners inside the Oz. 4) Karim Saeed is a Muslim and black nationalist who is very much defined in his opinion and desire. He fought for the rights of his people at different levels through his own Muslim group, his Greater Black Group and even against the wrongdoing of the authorities for all the groups. He characterizes the character in some way, similar to the Malko X, the famous Black Right warrior who was Muslim. Finally, according to his custom, probably Oz is probably the greatest (fictional prison show or ethnic-based show) relationship. If it is not like a series of your own, you probably should not try it, but it is certainly worth watching if it is interested. The biggest problem with the show is how it is addicted, some people might think of seeing such a lot of stuff wrong. The researchers do not argue whether it is risky, but ultimately it reflects the world society we live in. It means it as an indicator and an indicator of the world than an attacker.
