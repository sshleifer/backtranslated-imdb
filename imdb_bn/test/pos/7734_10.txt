I can not believe the low score for this movie. For a possible reason, few votes mean some people have seen it. This is just a fantastic movie! There are many stories inside but it's not complicated. Each character grows with the movie and we experience them with life changing. The scene is just amazing and the last credits I have seen in any movie (like the best Shakespearean) Yes, it's a short date (filmed in 1982) but the characters' face is very recent. It may be imprinted in 2002 without changing the story line. Raul Julia is amazing, the best part of all time in the movie - this is his signature piece. The girl is born from a young girl, a young Molly Ringwald is wonderful. Susan Sarandon is perfect as a young insecure woman and John Cassavetes is the one that puts it all together. Find yourself, find this movie, enjoy it and enjoy it. Come back to IMDB and this movie is always in the top 250 where it's really related.
