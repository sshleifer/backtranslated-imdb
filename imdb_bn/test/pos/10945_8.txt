Twin, Econ Chen and Edison Chan should not expect the superiority of a movie with a movie. However, what you get is a fun movie that is easy for eyes and brain. There are loads of Hollywood-style vampires (there is no honeying Chinese bleeding here), cute girls, handsome heroes and sometimes a very funny moment. And Jackie Chan. <br /> <br /> Of course, Kung Fu depends heavily on Wire Work and CGI. Sure, the script reminds you of blade. And sure, forget about the whole thing immediately. <br /> <br /> But for the really enjoyable piece of cinematic Faffe, you will be hard to find harder.
