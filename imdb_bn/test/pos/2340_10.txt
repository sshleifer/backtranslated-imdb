Seriously engaging, intelligent and excited drama at its very best. Average, gripping, moody and captivating. Every home should have a copy! Do not take my word for it to see yourself. A life stand lets you consider your own lifestyle and how you treat your family and friends. Beautiful photography and impressive performance make one of the best film-graphic experiences of the year. John Quetti's debut adds a real touch to the truth and realities of a delightful and profound film. This is a film that is disrespectful in recent years and has a fairness. No car, but a humed film with us and passion. I first saw this film showing the Edinburgh Film Festival in 2000 and now I am happy to be able to copy the DVD.
