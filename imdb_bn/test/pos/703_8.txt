Perhaps it is the first film in Colombia's color, because the colors are particularly different in the internal scene. They seem strong, sharp and the result is a bit unrealistic, but very pleasant. Randolph Scott Sheriff, a good guy, but the real star of the film is very young Glenn Ford, who is trying to change who is a person. Evelyn Kiss is the woman who started the fall of Ford and Clayer Trevor, the Sunun running county. There is a funny character named Nitro that does not think twice before it runs out. I particularly enjoyed two moments of the film, one horse stamped after one and you see thousands of horses, then there was no computer to help at that time, so I think they will collect all the horses, not an easy job. Another shot final shootout, technically very good. There is quite a fistfight. By seeing this western retreat scene in 1943, you have come to the sad conclusion: they do not make them anymore. They can do if they want? I have a doubt.
