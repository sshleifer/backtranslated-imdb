I like this movie's previous story as a life poem. I captivated it completely at the movie channel last night, and captivated enough to trap it with the whole way. There is only one unique voice in the film, a poem describing which is meaningless without refraining from the trend. There's a lot of sunny moments in the middle of the wari, which is crude without strange humor. It is very sad that this movie is so low-rated. Such a number of people think that numbers have been cooked - I do not see how anyone can view the movie as unrealistic. Of course, this is not a standard romantic comedy, but it is a unique aspect of a very unique life, that the person's very objection comes from his isolation, before defeating him in an isolation must overcome him. Give this an opportunity to flick. It came from somewhere for me, and I feel rich for it.
