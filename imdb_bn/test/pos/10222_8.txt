For a movie like this, come years always have to follow. Clive Barker, who brought "Heelryer", created a horror film that created part-goths, part-mathology, and all the horror in it. "Knightbrid" is a bunch of mutants that only come out at night and travel around Midian. Now a person named Boen (Craig Schaffer) has claimed that he is calling for this collapse. Help Boone with Decker (David Kronberg) who has been threatened. Unbeknownst to this situation, Decker claims that he is merely the hideous character of an incognito. But Bion went to the media and claimed that he was one of mutants there. But see the Boeun as a mutant (Oliver Parker) named Pelequin! But his bite, robbing the knot, that he died as a victim of surgery, he is now one of them. After Decker's confusion, Bauen did everything he could to protect Laurie (Anne Bobby) from him. Lori saves a mutant from the sun, and helps others back as well. I like female mutants who show a "death of smoking kiss" and the Pokakupine woman who saw the dream of Buuen, which at the same time is catastrophic and deadly. I've enjoyed this horror movie, and its rule is, never believe in a shrink! Rating 5 out of 3.5 ratings!
