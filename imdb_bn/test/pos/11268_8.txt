This will be one of the most beautiful morbid films I have ever seen. Mariege has created a living image that is open with terrible violence, sex, and restoration of the life of Jesus Christ. The high contrast and high level of grains make you question yourself what you see in your own time, but the use of combined textures on the extreme contrary creates an incredible viewing experience. This film is not for everyone. I think you should keep an open mind and it is not too quick to condemn this content for its content, which is very rough, but gives a fairly important statement about creation, God and humanity. This picture is a work of art, or shock value is open in the trash talk.
