For my life, I do not understand why the ratings are so low for this movie. This year I saw one of the most beautiful movies I have seen. It really hurt me with a heavy blow. I have kept this movie for several months and I was thinking of myself, the expectation I had that was probably not possible ... I made it as much as I did. Not saying, it not only met my expectations but it has overcome them far enough. Jordan Brewster and Cameron Diaz were all nice. Remarkably acting out of them They were both completely natural for their components and roles. Loces were absolutely fantastic. Each shot imprinted perfectly captivating and perfectly suited to the mood and atmosphere. I got to touch this film very much and it took very close to the heart. I would be thinking that maybe even one of my all time favorite could be one. Very rarely, I could see it again. <br /> <br /> I swear that I can not find a fault in this film. It's hard to tell about any film. I would highly recommend this one. Touching it, it's meaningful, and it's saying a lot about human nature and family. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
