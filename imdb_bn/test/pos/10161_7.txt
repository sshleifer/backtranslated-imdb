"The Man Who Knows To Make Me" hits the middle ground of Hitco, which in the 1950s has portrayed many movies: is not the best of suspense in any way, but a terrible lot of fun. <br /> <br /> A leisure couple game to get caught in a plot of heavy stakes on James Stewart and Doris Day foreign conspiracies. The famous climatic scene is performed at a classical music concert, where someone talks of being killed during a particular jolt collision. Of course, we can tell the wrong people what the point is, to stop the killer from becoming a nail repugnant nation against fascists. <br /> <br /> Most of the picture reminds me of the 1978 Chavy Chase / comedy comedy "Fawl Play" which I must believe that the film was inspired. Not a big deal of film, but both are easy to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
