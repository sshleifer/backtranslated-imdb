An entrepreneur boy living in the body shop area outside of New York is almost all of the original, the documentary is real. Real light Real words Most movies less edit in the entire movie than 1 minute. And there are very small scripts, there is a story. Almost all red, white, blue and yellow in primary colors, we get the real money in a boy's life which makes nothing from nothing. She has a place to make her own life, she has a good job and trying to bring her sister into her little universe. Chap shops also look at our culture which I do not know. They mostly feel worthwhile and pay Alle as a daily think, which is really concerned about his recovery. Actors (I think) are playing Alele more than face face more than one. It reminds me of what a real small movie can accomplish. It shows, it is capable of many children, besides support and love. Definitely recommend.
