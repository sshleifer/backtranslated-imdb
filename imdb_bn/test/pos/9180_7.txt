Knowing what a romantic comedy might look like; How many years have we seen them, how many years they can go to learn. There is a formula, which often produces movies that became popular with successive viewers ... not always related to their true quality. How to play that around, and make something more interesting? This movie has a suggestion ... and it works relatively well. Instead of just following the leadership, we follow him unfortunately to help men unfortunately, who are not attractive faces, which allow them to release invisible good qualities near women they have. This plot follows Smith because he works in his most self-declared difficult case; Kevin James. Apart from James's support, we also follow Mendes, who are annoyed with those who are upset about what they want to achieve (a particular scene of respect for Smith's character fulfills a quarrel and places him in his place). After helping James Smith's disaster, we saw him with Mendes ... and despite his talent to help others, he got badly involved ... badly. Making a wonderful point of love and how we fall in love affects us. For a romantic comedian, it can mostly avoid such losses (often depending on the emotion of the musical mockery), although these films have the sweetness and emotions of the past few scenes. This review will not be published if they follow the formula. The speed is quite good, it is not really slow, and very rarely moved very fast. Acting is great, far enough beautiful everyone. Characters are nicely developed, and come off as real people. Humor does not always work ... sometimes there are some gags that are fatally executed and one or two jokes seem to be forced. However, in most cases, the film was funny. I recommend this to anyone in romantic comedy and anyone who loves or has been loved. Those who do not believe love will have a hard time with the last few scenes. 7/10
