When a saboteur pushed up a controversial government research lab, two experimental animals in a small community of states in Washington are loosed. A dog with an unusual intelligence. The other is an "outside expirmal cobbler mammal", or "oxox". Because more reason has been expressed in this picture, Oxx hates the dog, and so is trying to kill it. Visitors expressed concerns about the involvement of Trevie's Colonel (Corey Heim), his mother Nora (Barbara Williams) and his girlfriend Tracy (Lala Slatman) dog and Oxmom with two national security agency agents, Lem Johnson (Michael Iranside) and Cliff's accident. Blue Manuuma), track them. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < It's true. But it should not affect your rating. If you want the book, read the book. Judge the film on its own merits, how closely the book does not match it closely. Bill Fried and Damian Lee, who wrote Screenplay, many artists like Quantage (this is not a quality comparison, just a statement that they all artists). So director John Hess. His work as a filmmaker does not have to follow a book like a script. They're adapting books as artists, to create unique artworks. It's based on the book. It's not identical. When you look at the movie, you need to reduce your preconception / expectations, because you are facing an artwork that you are not already familiar, even if you read the novel of Quantage. <br /> <br /> So, wakers are good movies? It's nice, not nice. A "B", or an 8 earn is good enough. In a while I started the thing on the right foot with one of the most beautiful improvised explosions I've seen. Unfortunately, he was a little intense, soon after he heard the astronomical exposition went. After that scene, Watchchurch has been threatened as a threat to the film in the 1980's, just as we will be meeting with the first tragedies and tracy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But it is only a skew. In most cases, the smile is able to cross the well-spreading area with interesting interesting twists: both Trevis and Tracy, from their single parent's home, their jeans flopetted. Both are unique, have mature relationships with their parents. Although it's a horror film, it's an intelligent, intelligent dog, and it often seems like an adventure movie, which is a horror, thriller, or science fiction, which touches on all the styles. A large cast of characters is played on the laugh, some do not enter until it's late, but the film is never confusing and does not seem like a letter that they go to dust - all the threads are nicely tied to the end. The structure is also complex, it has two major volumes, the second is becoming clearly corrupt as the film progresses, until a strong violence with cruel violence makes an opposition clear. Soon, Hess gives us a wonderful moment of suspicion with another opponent. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake in my eyes is that at least from the 1980s a horrible, common one with horror films - very dark, very close, very focused in the "attack" scene, and they were shot outside I'm very sticky edited. It makes it very difficult to know what's going on, which is the highlight of the scenes that should be highlighted. Of course, Hess's style is part of the motivation, and for this problem it was generally justified, the concern would be ridiculous and ridiculous and would be added as ridiculous and / or fake instead of being suspicious. In my view, presenting the audience with a dizzying blar is not a satisfactory solution. We can only see animal clothing / makeup in the end of the film. It is well done that good shots and edited attack scenes bring at least 9 movies. <br /> <br /> In spite of having any correspondence between novels and movies, watchmen use a smart, alluring character by presenting a secret story. This is often a nail-bitter and horror scenes are more serious than you can expect, if not good (in some scenes there is a fair amount of blood). Viewers are undervalued due to the misconceptions about the role of the film while accepting literature - it does not pass it or miss it briefly according to the wrong idea.
