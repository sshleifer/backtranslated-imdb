Well, when I hired these years ago, I had the worst expectations. Yes, acting is not great, and the picture itself shows, but I sit there, a strange thing happened. I started to like it. The action is great and there are few scenes that make you jump. Bruce James, perhaps one of the best B-grade actors next to Bruce Campbell, is always cool The stories are not bad either. Now I will not be in a hurry and will not buy it, but at least this good B-grade post will not waste your time while watching the Appoclipatic Western.
