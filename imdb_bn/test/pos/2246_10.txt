A little overlapping of the recent week's episode has not been paid in an uncertain position with an episode of hitting hits. The Cliffhanger resolution had a certain deus pre-machina smell, but it was a good start for all. With this doctor now it was the center of moral, moral and mental considerations of his actions as normal. They were always there in the classic series, but they had a side problem, when glossed when the doctor was at war temperature. Sorry for this rebirth even a cyberman during the war! This episode finally embraces Mikey's heroic side, which was indicated in the previous episodes. The hero from zero to complete his journey, and it has been a completely believer. There was everything in this episode of fear, humor, and scenes that brought a stick to your throat. After many considerations I can finally say that the new series betters the classic series in every respect. Coming from a die hard Whovian you can get a better recommendation than that.
