For me, a ten-star film that never dies in my memory, and for the first time the same joy can be seen again. This can be a technically flawed movie; There is nothing to do with spit-o-Polish (my personal top 10 gestational, at least!). John Carpenter's "The Thing" is just a few films to fit this benchmark. <br /> <br /> I was a science fiction fan because I was a child in Sixty, and I shortened the John W. Campbell film-based story ("Who goes there") I have seen the original, black-white white Howard Hanks (eg Many people met on TV, when I was in bed!). This movie, in which case you see many as a child, it got closer to the perfect: the mysteries, mysteries of malicious nature, photography; It just worked. A few years later I saw it many times (and still, when it was shown on TV). For this reason, I went to avoid the carpenter version for the year - I've always found that I'm always wrong to see a remix of my favorite movie. Finally, in 1988/9 I never saw it, because there was nothing else on TV, I realized that I must change "usually a mistake" from "always a mistake"! The presenter made the original film, close to the original story, and really amazing things. From the scene of the helicopter and shaking opening, through a very annoying scene of dog-pounds, in the end (sorry, there are no spoilers here!), I was hooked. The only sound track I have with me - what I have to hear is a close resemblance to the bus-trap-drum beat, and I again * in the final scene * <br /> Seeing "The Thing", I'm just another - I put the vendor down as a guest, only based on comments and reviews on mainstream news. Since watching "The Thing", I think I have seen most of his movies - I did not go out of my way to do that, but if someone comes, I see his name as the director but my mind is enough to look at. It's about He is thoughtful, and knows how to make a movie so that it reaches a point that is stuck in memory. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen "Things" and you enjoy science fiction, do yourself a favor - Ready to sit in a dark room, warm up wrap, and improve your memory!
