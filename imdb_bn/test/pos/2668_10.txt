Sometimes I am disappointed with the species to read IMDb user comments. To dismiss the 2001: There is no interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or film making industry as a "spotty" space ODS. Finally, I understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and neutral - they understand their audience. <br /> <br /> Thank you, those who can not understand Kubrick's achievements are still minorities. Most visitors were able to see the intelligence and perfect virtuosity that went into making this epic. It is a film that puts science into "science fiction" and disguises the space in space and the future picture of mankind. It was far ahead of her that humanity has not been caught yet. <br /> <br /> 2001 is basically a technical film. Because it is slowly and minutely filled because it was conceptually conceived in the future with the technology (and in the view of the past, inspirational opening of fear). The photo's greatest power details. Keep in mind that when this image was made, people still did not get out of the moon ... but it started in 2001. Even after 35 years of making such an incredibly detailed view of the future, it is still best for us, beyond faith - I still can not work on how I completed a shot. The only significant error in the film was optimism, which predicted the development of the technical (and social) of mankind. It is our shame that the image in 2001 does not look like 2001, not of Kubrick. <br /> <br /> In addition to the incredible special effects, camera work and set design, the Kubrick Viewer offers lots of food and what is the meaning of mankind, and where the human race is going. Yes, the end is weird and difficult to understand - but the nature of the future Kubrick and Clark have started working intelligent on it, now continue watching it up to the audience. There is no specific resolution, there is no fixed full stop, because viewers can stop thinking after the final relay. I know that most listeners seem to want these days, but Kubrick is not going to leave us so lightly. <br /> <br /> I'm glad to see this image in the top 100 images of IMDB, and only wish it was high. Stanley Kubrick is one of the world's best-known filmmakers and the greatest achievement of 2001. 10/10.
