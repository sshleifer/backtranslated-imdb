This French revolution is one of the best movies ever produced. During that time, a person was well aware because I was surprised at the level of detail. Clothing is in the spot. Even ink wells, serving plates etc. day items detail all small to perfect. Napoleonic Alliance I can not understand how much I was impressed with the visual accuracy of this film, as an American living in the United States through access to film sites through its membership in various historical organizations. <br /> <br /> The conversation is where virtual quotes are known and where the characters are not recorded. I was very pleased with this movie and was disappointed that it is still not in the DVD. How should this historical drama be done? Of course.
