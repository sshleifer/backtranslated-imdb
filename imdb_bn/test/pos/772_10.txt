A beautiful film One that reminds me of God but is not guilty and does not feel embarrassed. Remind me of death but do not fear, think about life but do not hide from it. I love both a movie that I love for both, and at the same time condemn it to the deepest stacks of hell. A movie that remembers my love and which is lost, but some strange reason, there is no sadness in my eyes for relief. Two worlds, a child of God and theater. And a good bit of alcohol and taunting! I highly recommend ***** <br /> <br /> "When hit S *** fan, get a tent" Oh and we should all be camping. Every day
