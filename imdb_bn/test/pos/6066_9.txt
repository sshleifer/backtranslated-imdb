We only saw the last of the series shown on SBS Network and missed our weekly dose of Danish Dealite. After the end of the Swedish show "The Eagle" and my wife and I showed the show and compared it as a very bad option for our favorite show on TV. Week of the week, the program grew on me, and did not shine as the Swedish show, and certainly certainly boasted in the investigation of daily crime, but it must have provided a very satisfying weekly viewing meal. I was not really interested in the Cop style before these 2 shows, and now I can not say that I am now, but Scandinavian shows really provide us with insight into the life of the North European region with their special eyes.
