It is important and only fair to remember, at which time this was produced short, there was a situation of war between the United States and Japan empire. At the beginning of the war, as well as the death marches and other events, and the only wonderful thing about this little and the others that is a great woe is that there was more to them. One other thing: My only problem with this short is that it seems to be funny, but it is not. I'm not sure anybody associated with it has tried to joke, even took care of him. What Disney did by learning to execute the death penalty, it would have been better and completely serious. But this short gets a bad rap and should not be considered outside the context. Time was then different and that is an important consideration. Anyone trying to save energy to save the world from the 60-year-old cartoon will have to take action. For example, I extend the same cartoon protection energy. Not even this comprehensive circulation, the interested parties should get. Not a nice cartoon, but sometimes life is not nice. Recommended
