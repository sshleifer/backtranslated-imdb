Andy, I am always my second favorite comedy, first is Namak Halal (although it was technically a play). Ground breaks nothing, but it is added that the complexity is extraordinary. Amir Khan Total Cartoons Just look at the song and his expression on Yay's night. He's amazing at the comedy, I did not know. Salman Khan was also good with some frustration in two letters. Aamir's face is almost funny. Ravina and Karisma serve their purpose but not surprisingly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They do not believe in hard work and just want to become rich . So both their brains came up with an idea for a rich man (Paresh Rawal) daughter (Ravendra Tendon) coming to India to find a husband. So with this love immortal and love meeting and handing hundreds of men to ruthlessly to marry this girl. If they succeed, now they will get rid of each other. At the same time he was in the house of Raven, as a wounded person injured and as a doctor of love. From here they try to eliminate each other. But Raisen's friend (Karishma Kapoor) falls for love and follows him some complicated. And tries to get rid of the rich brother of the rich man (Rawal) Virus and his father so that he gets the heirs and send two credible but foolish people to the dirty work. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you do not want to miss. Look at it! It will be worth it. I even own the DVD, it's that good. And if you like this movie, but if you have not seen it already, then I'll recommend the Gull Mall. Other good comedy halal and hara ferry (new)
