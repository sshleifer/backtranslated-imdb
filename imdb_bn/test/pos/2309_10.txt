Especially when it looks at the odd amount that it has created the DVD. I found this movie very funny. Rip Tornado is classic with its Barbes; Rob Schneider is too annoying as excessive compensating ensign; Bruce Darnen makes a great "villain". The entire cast seems to be an explosion, and it does not cost the audience. If you just like the usual funny comedy and do not look very deep into money, you can only fall in love with this.
