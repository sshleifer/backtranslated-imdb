Steven Sondheim's swivel lad: Fleet Stream's Damon Barber played a leading role along with Lane Carri and Angela Lansbury on March 1, 1979, on Broadway. Although it almost captures almost every award, the box office expectations decreased and the original production ended at 557 exhibitions. Fortunately, the game went on tour - and along with the path, the film was caught. The result is approximately George Harne near Broadway staging, which replaces Carrio and Lansbury.

There is no exception to swaddle. As seen in the film, it is a "stand and geese" quality, and it seems that both Herren and Lansbye have corrected their performance for the camera, as it is not like Josephine's warrior; His performance bigger than his life goes unexpectedly to the film as insane and unlike the overall Caste voices when his highly optical voice goes out of the place. Considered to take effect on this stage-on-on-film, however, this is really a unique and macabrely comic musical an exceptional performance in operetta style. Lansbury is a mix of surprising, screaming, stupidity, and intelligent evil, it is truly the role of the psychologist sailor, whose clients are "ruthlessly shaved in their graves". The overall cast is quite fine and even though the movie set does not allow enough viewing, but there are enough displays to be effective for it. And music! Who can argue considering the best work of Sandham? The story itself is well-known, especially in England. In 1846 Thomas Pecch Perth wrote a few short stories of urban legends for the short story; It was turned into a stage for one year or so, as the Demon Barber volunteer for Floyd Street - and in an era that knew a little bit of copyright law, the variety of games would soon start playing in England. But everyone was the same: Sweeney Tod, a sailor who killed men coming to him for a shave; Mrs. Lovett, her associate, bakes up in their pies and feeds them in an unsuspecting public. The Sondheim version was specially based on the 1973 edition of Christopher Bond. <br /> <br /> The story is very grand guiginous, many bloods, body remains silent and wonderful humor; However at the same time, a harmless mistress in the temple's songs, songs, and mistress will not expect a lot to open the topic of charms. Songs of Sondheim are often ironic, but not so much more than here; He is involved in a major disaster of wicked rebel art and capitalism, and of course one can not blame Victorian-elegant of his strange complexity. <br /> <br /> "The concert version" Loopon, performed by Harne and the Foot Actor, gave us a number of selections that were spun off from the 2007 Team Burton Film Editions, especially while presenting "Presentation of Steven Tod's Presence" which covers the game Running like a thread. It is, in my opinion, a lot more humorous than the movie, which still reduces the comedy on a bigger show of blood. Anyway, if you're a fan of the story, it's legendary Broadway show of travel, and it's a knockout out. Recommended. <br /> <br /> The GFT, Amazon Reviewer
