This movie, one of the most thought-provoking small movies I've ever seen, with its complexity and flushness. The topics that it illustrates are ugly, ironical and sometimes even Macbroere, but the film is beautiful in its language, its camera is equipped with angles and mastery in its style, masterfully retains the short story of the same name as the master's writing. Short stories, Tobias orphs <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How proud of it is, and it does well. It shows the most important memories of life, all of which can be topped by the foremost feeling: unexpected happiness. This film, through my own development, has created me the same feeling that the main character (Tom Nunan) thinks when the words transform their very existence and it is an impressive achievement.
