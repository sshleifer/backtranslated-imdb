I've enjoyed movies and stories incredible! I saw the original (1939 I believe) and enjoy both of them. To be truly familiar with the story praises will be familiar with an English culture and customs. Professor (Peter O'Briel) was dedicated to his school and "boys" in the school. It was an English "public" school, which we refer to as a private school in the United States (EG Andover). He is a very skeptical person and gives the surface look weak, pointing to being tough, stuff, uncaring, and effeminated. He was strict in his education standards because he took care of "his children", that is, he did not want them to get cheap or weak education. He ("through introduction") is a "dance girl" (Petula Clark) met and is completely smitten. In England, the references to "Dance Hall" refer to extreme sexual immature and were clearly "lower classes." We see that Professor is really very hard and brave and loyal to that person and organization and he loves and / or respects. Clark becomes more than a boyfriend and a wife ... she "undermines" her personality and lets her become like a man and a person for her favorite school and her own happiness. The first film was set before WWII, it was also applied through WWII II, it was 1969 (our "British aggression" ... Beatles etc.) Clarke was hitting and was very popular ... still to me), music is great, Color and photography are excellent. I think O'Toole has played perfectly! There are dedicated people like "chips" ... but many people around us are not recognized. Very enjoyable movies and stories!
