I recently saw a test screening of Blurard, and I'm surprised that it was really good! It's a film about kids from different groups, your hill, your rich snobs, your usually teenage couple, plus two geeky guys and a post-hippie babe. Together, but as a separate story, each group is traveling to Gold Coast for school weeks. Australia has never had a problem writing comedy, and Australia is not a small actress, who can play the right amount of comedy and curiosity with frustration. Cast is full of starry Australian actors with excellent talent and screen attendance load. Keep an eye on Craig Horner, a young graduate, who has expressed a long-standing party expectation on weekends, in his friends in Schengenin. Trevies Cotton and Mark Prestley, who successfully tackled some cute body comedy, as one of two rediscovered Boogan and Jessica Gower was successful but fell in love for sorrow. Veronica Siewak debuted for the first time as the daughter of her elite boys, and most of her experienced actors took her into an array. Search for Matthew Newton, cleverly throwing as a cruel Limo driver. Excellent Australian
