The subject is World War II and Robert Ryan is a reputed soldier, who is appointed as a lupineo handman. She is a widow of war <br /> <br /> The set is limited but the acting makes for this. Robert Ryan contradicts: At one moment he feels pretty, then he is confused about where he lives. The first lupinos tried to help him. She feels annoying but nothing more dangerous. But how do we know? Create suspicion I really enjoy this kind of movie, which depends on the human element for the mystery. Are these people able? O.Z. There are some scenes with Whitehead and D. Pollock have seen something as a boring grocer is wrong. Remember we will be helping him, then Ryan's personality turns again. He became like a Jekyll / Hyde character and eventually chased the loopino with a knife. <br /> <br /> Watching these two gorgeous actors is valuable. 9/10
