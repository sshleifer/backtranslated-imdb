Based on the real story of Gerrit Wolfert, this movie was one of the best films I saw on ethnic relations in South Africa; A very good history lesson of 80's South African atrocities I have put it on the Scale of American History X, where it is described how a young person can be inspired by the Aryan doctrine and how "specific" parts of the Christian Church teach false doctrine of the nation with justification of justice. <br /> <br /> It's a bitter message of forgiveness and release, a boring one in today's movies. Violence has been done well for the publication of Gerrit's crime and the greatness of his transformation. <br /> <br /> A word about Zer Elise who played Gerrit Wolfgang. He carries you through his illuminated transformation through darkness at the beginning of the GERT. She went to some dark places as an actor and her performance is appreciated. <br /> <br /> Another standout performance was that Mepho Lovinga had to play Musa Moremi, the victim of the crime offense. She was able to pull from some place in the pain as you really touched up seeing her performance. <br /> <br /> To showcase the very best movie teens.
