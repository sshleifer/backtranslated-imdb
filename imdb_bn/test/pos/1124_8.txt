I was not sure what to expect when I was dragged into this show, who was in a pan-helenic stream. After seeing so much drama in the "Made for TV Film" and the Fear of Reality, I found out if the Greek could show true college and Greek life experience. <br /> <br /> The program was very pleased to see how the viewer was able to satisfy the known character of this genre, but it was also able to add depth to the letters. Greek life is not just about parties and minor conflicts. Although these events occur in Greek life, they can happen in another person's social life or social circle. It is a Greek organization who will be lying to mark it as some special experience. In Greek languages, most story lines and situations can be done everywhere, in each circle of friends, in sports teams, in real life. But I've seen both episodes and my "little sister" which I've seen so close and I've both hilarious episodes and reminded me of how our college years and experiences really hold true feelings. <Br /> <br /> I love how characters struggle with other aspects of their life; Schools, relationships, goals, etc. Tell Capi Rastie that the school first comes and goes to your brothers for help, which makes life real. If you are bad quality you can not be in the organization. Rastie took away his professor from his way of appointment, but it was entertaining. Even KC and Dynamic Between Bread; It happens, you grow up and change your relationship with your siblings so that it can be adjusted so that you can adjust. <br /> <br /> The following line: Greek is a great show, great entertainment value and enough "real life" there will be credible time and definitely be the time of viewers.
