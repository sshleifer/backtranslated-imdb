I wanted to see this romantic drama for a long time (with the WWII setting) and now I can say that I am a worthy creator of Russian film! <br /> <br /> Soviet movies are known for their intense circulatory system, but grateful, such emphasis is not free - with the interest of the central tragic romance between an intriguing artist and a lively girl is destroyed by the outbreak, she is happily volunteering for the war. But from that he did not return. The girl (An unusual performance of Tatiana Samoslovako) loves the cousin of the young man and, when she does not get the sound from her boyfriend, then she gives him her and then marry him. Although, he, however, began to ignore the ambitious pianist of the ambitious concert about war, and he was loyal to the Buddhist soldier by reducing the chances of success in the war about the war. Finally, the girl reaches the girl who loves her daughter of death, but at the end of the film, she has learned to accept as a sacrifice in her own country and has content to live with her memories. <br /> <br /> This film has some amazing camera-work that uses intelligent screen space and often gives great power to the emotional drama emerging, taking tracks, low and high or lower corner shots. Separate sequences are equally impressive - especially two: Stunning scenery, spontaneously edited and boot up to boot, where the girl protects a abandoned boy from a truck by snatching; And in front of the unfortunate incident, the youth died prematurely, I have undoubtedly seen it in any kind of best way (the sun was moving away from him, symbolizing life out of his body, as he thinks he will not be on the wedding day!). Also notable, however, the scene where the girl goes to find her parents in her home, who has been frustrated during the hijacking in the air; Concerned Pianist's final violent character - which he repeatedly tries to confront him face-to-face - after using air-raids and a set of billing screens specially useful! Unexpectedly, this outstanding movie and 1 DVD are a bare bone affair (RusCiCo version has some supplementary features, but an export is too heavy and hard to track for boot!); The standard match with the Russian classics, the Belgian of a Solidar (1959), of another war of liberation war - found me at the local DVD rental outlet, coming near me ... <br /> <br /> The only other film I saw from this director was the Arctic epic Red TET (1969; though rarely by the US-free version!), Based on true facts, is a star-staid international Production; Unusual artistic quality of the cranes was flying, I was missing many times in his famous documentary AM Siba (1964) that I was in Hollywood at the end of last year: After playing one week's dramatic, it was shown multiple times on television, a feature-length "Making Off" !!
