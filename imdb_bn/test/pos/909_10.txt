Impressive, sophisticated, energetic, emotional, strong ... I could think of a hundred adjectives for describing this fantastic work of art and intelligence, and still I think they were inadequate. I can really say that I am inspired with this movie. Applause to Krzysztof Kieslowski, Zbigniew Preisner, Ir√®ne Jacob, and Jean-Louis Trintignant. May "Rose" can live forever.
