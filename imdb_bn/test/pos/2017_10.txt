After reading this film, I thought it would be frustrating, but after getting 1 DVD in my region (DVD before film being hit in UK cinema) I was happy, strong performance from all cast members is a very enjoyable movie. The script is very weak, meaning that you will not be bent down in the story and therefore the frequency of viewing it is more. I recommend this movie and all <br /> <br />
