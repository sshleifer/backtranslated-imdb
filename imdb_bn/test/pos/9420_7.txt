This is one of the many plots and settings of Basil Rathban's anti-war Nazi Sherlock Holmes films (Washington Terrorism, SA in SA Washington and one of the paradoxes). Despite being an intelligent air-tired hairstyle, he was shocked by the bites and attacks in each scene, so little is registered that how much you registered the plots intensively. Here he also starred along with Lianel Attil, who created the surprisingly annoying Professor Moriarty - with a nice hint of sadness and cruelty (it can not be played, children's work), a heavy loaded joke. In Climax, Rothbone's blood drops to dropping "drop drops", which is considered to be the most sinful of the Arch-Nimeses Newman of Safefield. The film itself rented the old Quiddy Mattine, but the director took attention to the staging and atmosphere of Ray William William. It looks fairly sharp in the DVD's UCLA recovery - do not even think of buying any other version, all of them are pale, official-domain prints spread.
