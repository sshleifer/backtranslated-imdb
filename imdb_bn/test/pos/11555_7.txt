This movie starts somewhat slowly and continues towards the end. That's not bad, it's characteristic of character of character of the protagonist is depression. As a result, if you are not in the tragedy then this is not your movie. This is an inspirational philosophy of this movie which makes it worthwhile. If you like Dostoyevsky's 'Crime and Pensions', perhaps it would be preferred if you would prefer it relatively. The question that provokes the film is, "Does a famous writer completely disregard the proposed ideas of another set for another set?" The new ideas are in conflict with the status - if you are a conservative you would not like this movie. <br /> <br /> In addition to the other philosophical questions, I must admit that this movie was pretty nicely pleasing. Grassy hills and beautiful scenes helped me gradually slowly. Also, color symbolism was used to represent the symbol of letters. If such things are not affected by you, skip it. Overall, I will film this movie 7.
