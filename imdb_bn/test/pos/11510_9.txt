I've seen this movie many times. I read the book, Igar Elhamines, which was written by Inner Maure Gourmundson, who received Scandinavian book awards for this work. The movie does not start the movie at the same place. It happens in Rickshaw and the main character, Pala gives a good life to the young and his girlfriend. But after breaking the relationship with her, she started some headaches that bothered her and became angry. And soon he started to have big mental problems and then the movie is starting. Soon he was kept in an Icelandic mental hospital called "Kappapur" and there you see some great characters like Victor, who Hitler and Oli think he wrote all the "Beatles" songs and sent them to them in the mind. Transport. Ingvar e Sigur√∞usson whose main character has the role of Pall so well that it leaves you breathe. The music of this movie is also crazy by Sigurasses and you only need to watch the movie for music costs. Overall meant to see a great movie.
