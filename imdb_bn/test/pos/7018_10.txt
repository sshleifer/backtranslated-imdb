I have seen this movie about 50 times and it does not seem that I will always disappear. I always find it my best friend and it has been arranged as a tradition for us to visit it often every month. We see this movie every time we both become really emotional and we cry together in front of the TV and sing all songs loudly and till the end we always dance. Now we know the whole conversation with the heart and the film looks like watching our old friends on TV. <br /> <br /> This image is perfect! Although I must admit that the story is very impressive but you forget about it in character, dance, music and even everywhere it happened and you start to believe that such things will really happen and that the song "All you need is" is actually something Has the meaning <br /> <br /> I am a really ordinary person and I am not very serious about this comment, but I can not wait the next time. We will be able to see dirty dance.
