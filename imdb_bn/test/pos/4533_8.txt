I think after the release in 1995, "Tommy Boy" has to be turned back by every critics and it should be seen and it is not bad movie. Each critique has influenced the films of Chris Farley and David Spade. Yes "Coneheeds" was fun but was kind of a comedy premiere and with critics I agreed with "Black Shape" that it was one of the worst movies ever made. But "Tommy Boy" does not fall into the category of "Coninhes", which is a little fun and "black fox" that can be a part of the Tripe. It's very fun and entertaining. I agree with critics that Chris Farley was not John John Bullushi or John Candy because he claimed that he had made those figures and those people were a gifted to the comedy, but Chris Farley was very funny and I hope he has long been able to prove to the critics Hold on yes he was not John Belushi, or John Candy, but he was very funny. The scene side breaks between Farley and Spade as Nemesis are pleasing and the premise also laughs out loud. It is very sad that Chris Farley is not here to make us smile but we have a movie like "Tommy Boy" which he thought was so funny he was. "Tommy Boy" is one of the best comedies of 1990.
