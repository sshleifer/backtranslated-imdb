I love tv competition It's hate to see the end. There are many talented competitors. It's a shame that only 2 will be sorted. I love watching judges. At the time they are as entertaining as competitors. I have been watching shows on every Sunday night loyally. Do not miss it for the world. This is the best television show ever in television. Best wishes to all the contestants, although I have already chosen the two guys who want to play Danny and Sandy at Broadway. I am concerned to see if my decision is correct. I do not know how long the competition will last until Danny and Sandy are elected, but at the end I will keep an eye on them.
