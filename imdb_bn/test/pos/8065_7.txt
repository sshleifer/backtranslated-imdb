Although a 32-year-old woman illustrates a 12-year-old girl, the concept of a woman can grow for the most recent audience, but the fans of Mary Pickford liked and expected them from her favorite star. The opening scene shows Annie's domino character as a clear leader of a multi-purpose street gang comic "battle" with the rival team. Being a sorter girl in the jaw and kicks can be a little weird sight, but the scene is such that "our gang" is acting in the fashion that it will be difficult to take it seriously. However, he can take it as it does the symptoms. Once Annie returned to her tannery home and replaced her street buds with more street clothes, making it more difficult to imagine this beautiful young girl as street urchin (especially on close-ups). However, those who can strengthen the suspension of unbelief, the rest of the movie is rewards. The tragedy (Annie plans her birthday surprise for her father's father) tragedy (Annie's gang kept on a show), this picture allows her to show different emotions in Mary's era. . <br /> <br /> Of course necessary "happy end" is achieved; Offenders are arrested with the help of Anime's friends and opponents and for the last time on a sunny day, they meet their friends to travel around their busy streets. This is a good way to end the film of Mary Pikeford in any way. <br /> <br />
