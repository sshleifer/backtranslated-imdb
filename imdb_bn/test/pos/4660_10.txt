WEEE This is still jolly good fun! With most of my friends, when we were young, we saw this movie in HBO, and then searching from a copy of it. They finally reprinted it a few years ago, we had a midnight Madness party ... and the movies held up well. Sure, it's a pure cheese, but it's still a lot of fun. When you were young you did not see MM, but you would not appreciate today's value.
