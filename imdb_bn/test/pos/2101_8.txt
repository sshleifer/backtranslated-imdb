You might be surprised about those who are like an art-house giant movie for those who are more surprised. The Dimejin Trilogy, circa 1966, was such a series. Another time in Samurai Epic, than anything else, these three films are even one of the most (literally) giant docks and instruments. These gems are not a single aspect of obscure scenes (s) of performance from filmmakers' craftsmanship. Even special effects are managed well-high-quality, and films (folks) are almost evenly integrated (in most cases). If you are a fan of Gogir Fan or Samui film or one of us, who likes a good movie regardless of continuity, I highly recommend the Dimimian Trilogy.
