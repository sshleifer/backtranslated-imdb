I would recommend this for those who are a fan of late John Cassavetes. And for those who do not know Cassavetes. This is a wonderful film. This is my opinion why I do not have time to get the details, but if you are looking for a little bit of detail, but it matches many scenes, then it is for you. Cinematography is probably one of the most interesting aspects of the film, as well as the story itself. This "review" film does not do justice. It will be an experience to see for myself. Many lotteries. Very genuine
