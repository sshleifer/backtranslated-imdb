I have a lot of hope for Zen General's signals. Thankfully, my hope is true. You got a whole bunch of action, comedy ... stupid comedy, and surprises. I think Edison is the new actor, the movie is really hit, but I've found the really annoying Sam's 'Alien' in English. Although there was some flaw in the movie robot graphics and silly conversations, the process always keeps it strong. Action setup is stronger than 1st. <br /> <br /> 60% of the film is in English from Cantonese, this film is more like Americans. This movie will not disappoint you. I recommend it to the youth that they care about pure action-packed fun. <br /> <br />
