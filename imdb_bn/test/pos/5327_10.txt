I'm not an ebert. Am I a sympathetic and I'm Leland P. Feeling more than Fitzgergard did not feel more compassion for the imaginary character. Sorry if I do not offer criticism, but I do not see anything except the perfection of this movie. I'm sure those who watch this movie will never see the same thing, but if you work hard enough, you'll see something you do not expect. I read that Leland's character was faulty. I think this author can not see the question presented in this picture. I'm sorry for anyone that does not see the answer to distribute this movie. Keep your mind more open to your mind and you will be able to return this Leland PK. The Fitzgerald shows you a world that is really meaningful. Excepcional story with extraordinary acting Ryan Gosling demands to talk about.
