It's actually a brilliant movie. The story is amazing, but the actor brilliantly. Especially Mads Mikkelsen performance as Svend, excellent. It's a simple story about two people with a desire to create their own, but it reveals to a weird and strange story, many people are accidentally killed and work like chicken steak. If only more people understand Denmark ... it may be a great candidate for an English version. It is notable that Ole Thestrup, which always spins the platform, with its little crazy character Holger. I can only recommend this movie to the Danish viewers. Also see Adams Ã†bler (2005), a film by Anders Thomas Jensen, a good game with Madd Mickelson, with Thomsen.
