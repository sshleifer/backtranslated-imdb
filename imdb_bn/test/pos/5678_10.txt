I have seen this movie in London last week when I came out with my friends. We did not know what we could expect, the poster kept a little bit, and I would not say anything else to not waste the plot, but we found it as an excellent film with extraordinary performance, strong plot and fear. Like hell! After doing some research on filmmaking, I have to give this film, filmmaker, actor, writer, etc. together with such limited organization. Post-production is very good, too. For this, I gave them ten 10, and I hope they continue their good work. Keep it, guys. You rock!
