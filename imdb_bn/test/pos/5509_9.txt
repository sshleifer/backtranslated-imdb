I do not understand where this is coming from bad comments. The movie was at the edge of your seat and at the end of the night you got a little bit scared to go to your car. <br /> <br /> The portion you got is all this can happen. Not the amount felt in the film, but the whole idea is reality. This movie has taken that reality and it has become a nightmare of a De Snyder. <br /> <br /> Three thumbs (third from the body of my fridge).
