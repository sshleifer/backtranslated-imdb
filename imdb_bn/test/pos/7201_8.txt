How nice! The French really hanging it up If we look at their first Asterix movie, we see a good story with excellent actors (especially thanks to Gerard Depardoo), but very special effects on hair. The story of a fantasy like Asterix special effects is really important. Well .. they have fixed this time! It looks awesome. I personally think missions Cleopatra is the best Asterix story ever written. A moment in the movie you're not bored. Go and see this! A thing! They did not run the script which I think is a little different. For example, in the comic obelisks, the nose of the spinx breaks, soon all small shopkeepers begin to break the nose of their small spinx nose. (Really fun to see) .. Well they did not make it in the movie, instead they burried the nose under Sphinx Asterix: "They Will not Find It Here" (guess again). Funny but not as original as well. I dislike about the movie, another thing was their choice for the song. It has made the movie a movie. But not less ... it's a C! <br /> <br /> Grace the Gene Holland
