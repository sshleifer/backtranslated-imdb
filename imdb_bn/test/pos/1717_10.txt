If you are a doctor's long-term fan and when you hear that they are creating another series, it will be easier - than to meet the high expectations of the original. Panning is much faster than the original, usually more than 90 minutes in the 50 minute episode. The author is excellent, acting superb. The most difficult - and the best - the price of the new series used is the price of production. Compared to the original, now there are some. (Even though I will always keep the bubble-wrapping and darling memories of hand-puppet monsters.) If you are not a fan, or if you try the original and do not get the handle on it, then now enter both feet! They will tell you what you need to know about the doctor. This series was written with a brief reference to the doctor's great back story, especially to encourage new audiences. Confession, I'm just looking at the first new series because it is being shown in the SI-FI Channel (in other words, probably cut in Ribbons for time limitations), but I'm waiting for broadcast episodes on DVD on DVD. (Will not come soon on July 4th!)
