In the end, it is clear that the murderers put a gun in Mrs. Columba's car and it was in the police ballistics lab. <br /> <br /> But where the gun was used in the demonstration? Killers do not clean the goods under the hood? They were all week? Or did colombo copies the camera / gun under the hood used in police protests? How did they break that and without entering the car? Perhaps this murder takes the last surprise. But how does Colombo create a copy of their camera / gun device and how can they calibrate the phob? Colombo certainly got the gun back from the gun and it was re-planted under the hood of the car and it was very lucky that other devices with cameras were still there and were transmitted. <br /> <br /> This was a 10/10 at the end of this glaring plot error.
