All the emerging filmmakers will see this movie - it's just like a masterclass in the digital film - creating itself. Some scenes seem like they have shot more production costs than they actually did. It is very encouraging that a good engraving piece can be made in less good budgets. The acting is very good, and the characters are very interesting, especially the lead boy (John Kiety), who really encourages teenagers to experience problems while having a choice. Her beautiful but isolated mother was also very well depicted, and the relationship between her and her boss was very playful. This is a very quirky, attractive piece and I will be looking for something else created by the same team. The director must be one to see.
