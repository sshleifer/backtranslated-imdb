Venice's death is a movie that I will see every ten years. It's always different, because I'm always at different stages of life. <br /> <br /> The film is about art, beauty, passion, death. Some scenes are painfully slow, others are annoying only to see, especially if you think before them. Yet I do not want to miss a single frame. The main theme of the adagietto is repeatedly used in music repetitive, from the fifth to Mahler. Yet I do not want to miss a single note. When the last image fades, the last note dies, I have numb and tired left. <br /> <br /> This movie is a memorial monument to filmmaking. The best of the movie will be away from the crowd on Saturday evening. And this is simply the best movie ever.
