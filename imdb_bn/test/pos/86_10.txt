This movie was all boring. It is the police with reality. Open your eyes to the real problems of our society to those who think it's boring. Our kids are dying The consequences of alcohol and drug misuse are not ignored. I work in a corrective advantage as a chemical dependency consultant, and I deal with this problem every day. People of all ages and all living people are affected by the consequences of their alcohol and drug abuse. It destroys the family, hurts the people, and leads to severe brain damage, all kinds of health problems and death. It's all preventable. This movie appears in every high school in the world. If anyone is owner of this movie and wants to sell it, or want to sell me a copy, please email me here: Ottenbreit2@netzero.net Thank you
