I'm a talent manager. I've been there for 15 years now. I have discovered some extraordinary talents. They have movies, comics, broadways and television. My opinion is that Eddie Monroe is throwing surprise. I love the power of real people. Not just a name. The actors of this movie were very natural and trustworthy. I was very entertaining by this film. I love a movie with a few twists. When I solve the puzzle at the end of the movie I still enjoy. I still want to know what happened to the huge money. (You'll understand what you're saying when you see Flickr.) Mobsters see all the real ???? I would like to see this picture on the big screen. The footage is shot really well. I knew New York's view in New York. There is a Happy 2006 and this movie awards can do it.
