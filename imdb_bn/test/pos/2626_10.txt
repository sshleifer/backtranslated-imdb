34 years ago I thought of seeing this movie and it was full of senses and twists. It captures you at the beginning and guides you throughout the whole film. I've thought of this movie over the past few years and checked the video stores to see if it was available, but it was not able to find it or anyone who heard it. I think such films are ruthless, and I know it will be enjoyed by a whole new generation of movie viewers. I hope this will soon come to the video because it would be fun to see that it has had the same effect on me in the early 70's. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This was an impression, but this was still not many years later.
