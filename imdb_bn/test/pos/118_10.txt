One of the best films of all time ... fire ... It is not much about the history of today's Indian sociology ... it is not a light which does not light up, it never stops, it never happens ... even when ... even when In this sense the movie is almost remarkable ... both sides are very good quality ... Das's source as street actor is quite clear ... its performance is a fantastic "camimo" ... but use light ... I see it I've seen it again and again ... blown after age ... There is nothing intense in the story ... but the "pure" way to face the issue ... It is tragic that in today's world of chaos we live, a main artwork is usually a gender The movie is known as ... The Jereid D'Arc of Diary or Ichikawa's Virumaa may face T-Tatto or Fire. Chief Kursova movie, just "some" name. Wish my input wishes to help her in this little way in this movie.
