I was a little worried about the actor and acting in Italy then came "Le conseguenze dell'amore" and Tony Servillo came. It was a long time that I do not see a charismatic actor on the screen so much. Paulo Sorrentino wrote a wonderful story about the loneliness and Tony has built one of the most vivid characters in the recent years to watch the movie. The film is not perfect, but the film 'Tit De de Guarlomo' will be with you for a long time after the movie's views. Tony, please continue acting in the film, you are sure to be today's seratom (and not only in Italy, his performance is worthy of international promotion). I rated this movie 9/10
