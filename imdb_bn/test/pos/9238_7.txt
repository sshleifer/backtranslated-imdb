See this movie. This is a really good journey through the problems of indie cinema, and what will happen when it comes to the face of the filmmaker. There is a lot about punk rock and there is a connection between this movement and this project. So if you're old Punk, American Punk, you'll dig it .... But be careful, there are some bad bits from the failed project ... but they're occasionally fun. And, in fact, some good sections listen to people who are not involved in filmmaking and they've heard what they did in three years to keep them together. So anyone is going to make a movie there, especially if you have not done film or field work at school, you have to learn it and learn from the filmmaker's mistakes.
