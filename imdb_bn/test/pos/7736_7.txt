William Shakespeare probably did not consider a gay doctor, Antonio as an unbelieving wife or a group with Caliban as Trinteron, but with Bird's time it became worse for his good work and could even enjoy the spectacular page of life. His "Tempest" reconfigured by Paul Magarski and co-author Leon Captainsos <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After the discovery of Alonso (especially Gaussman) Casino, especially after the discovery of Alonso, Philip's wife is dealing with a relationship with Antonia (Guyna Rovers). Along with daughter Miranda (Molly Ringwald), Philip Miranda and her new owner Aretha (Susan Sarandan) escaped on a distant Greek island, a wonderful Catholic girl who struggled with the life of Philipp's heavenly life. Suddenly the storm will end up? OK? <br /> <br /> There is a concept of casualties: How many other actors can create such a movie that is so annoying? She often depicts film critics for her previous work, often with her real life wife, Roeland, she represents a central character who suffers for her art here, but enjoys herself and we also enjoy her. It's not Prospero, but something rich and weird that makes an alteration of its own for an awesome sea. <br /> <br /> "He's all here," he says of his faithful companions, Aretha's dog Nino. "Beauty, magic, inspiration, and solitude." That's it "Tempest" relocated 1611 London to 1982 found some excellent resonance in the isolated life of Manhattan and Phillip. "Show me a sorcerer", he grew up with storm-stormed city skyscape, and Mozartky's version of Donald McAlpine's purple sashak starlighting cinematography and naturally with the sun-burning Greek natural scene. <br /> <br /> This is not a perfect movie in any way. Actually, the only part of the movie that follows in a big way the Shakespeare's story follows with a loyalty, it is a mess. Roland's character is very much carefree for this movie, and after seeing her in full Brisish glory, it is difficult to understand Phillip's concerns for her wife, her left-wing desire only restores the natural order of unhappy "sacrifice" goods. <br /> <br /> There is a lot about "Tempest". In addition to Cassavetes, RINGWALD's film has started as its faithful but unstable girl, the desire of the primitive "Calibanos" (Raul Julia) like playing here. Here is the ringwald special guest teenage magic that will inspire John Hughes, but with the emotional depth, Hughes films did not appear later. Ringwald and Julia did not pay attention to an Oscar, but they both won the Golden Globe for their playful work here. He is tempted by his 15-year-old body, trying to woo him into his island isolation with his TV reruns, "Gunsmoke" in his Greeks. <br /> <br /> <br /> "I want to make you balonga with my bonny johny," Kalibanos announced, move on one side but anyhow winner of our sympathy, especially "New York, New York" goat after performing with a chorus . (When hit "Tempest" screen, Julia was on the toast of Broadway's lead of "Nine".) <br /> <br /> This is MazarCee's show, although sometimes it seems that Cassavetes improvisational line reading and lots of emotional breakdowns. (Philip said to him, "I'm fine in the middle of nervous breakdown.") He tries to make his happiness crystal by creating a theater on one of the most exiled islands, plays like a touching emotion. Like the other person involved in the enjoyment, Gusman's rich performance, which is quite appealing to Julie, is a young folk who says to Philip: "We do not have as much as half the funds we have." Nervous again ... and they make love behind an old sports car. "Many artists have made much fun for travel like" Tempest ", its extravagance and recreationally Shakespeare, despite numerous artifacts such as spots and excessive blame, although her dreams were not included in the stage behind the smoking pot in a go-go concert.
