SSCTT is a very good sum of recent re-publication from the Soviet Union. In 1977, director Larisa Sheppitko examined the moral restrictions of loyalty and respect in German occupied Russia during World War II. On foot and in a membrane, a part of the Soviet part of a partition leaves to detect and is captured by Nazi soldiers. The focus of the movie is how each person manages his or her moral alternatives. Like one respect and honesty, the other decides to cooperate with the enemies. However, to the end, he can not comply with his selfish decisions. The film gradually uses wide-angle pans that are transferred to extreme mortgages and highlight the spiritual conflict between the souls of each person. This is not a great movie, but it effectively depicts a profound moral conflict against the retreat of a harsh and terrible Soviet desert.
