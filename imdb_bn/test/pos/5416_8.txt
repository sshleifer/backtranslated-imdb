It is a shame that achieves a limited rating, probably it will not be seen by the viewers that this movie seems to be the most useful. <br /> <br /> Imaginary heroes follow the life of a teenager after his brother's suicide. Of course, this is not the main story in the world, but it spends a lot of time with the son of their parents, which is the fictional heroes' failure in their eyes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We have to deal with our problems and we all make our own way. <br /> <br /> However, like any other film, which seeks youth freedom, it solves problems between parents and children, and for this it becomes a strong unit. The big boy who committed suicide is tragic, but later did not give up in the film, and the responsibility of all parties for the tragedy is fully explained. <br /> <br /> Though the cover has been covered earlier, this is quite covered - the film pulls very little punches. Now, why a rating it is confusing - you find it impossible to become realistic to a teenager in this age, but still giving reality limits the audience too. <br /> <br /> My junior was shown high school class this photo, two could be preventing suicide. In this case, the sensor seems to be using extremely poor judgment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
