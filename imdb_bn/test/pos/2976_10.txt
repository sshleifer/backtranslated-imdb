I got the first release of this movie and enjoyed it perfectly. What a movie I am in my 40's now and have 2 teenage children and I want to see their movie. I'll recommend it to anyone who loves romance movies or old Elton John Music. <br /> <br /> I searched most of the stores that sold both new and old movies but there is no difference. <br /> <br /> I bought several old movies like Hong Kong's "Melody", which was mostly old movie, but it was not for them. <br /> <br /> I'm also looking at Siegel, Paul and Michelle. <br /> <br /> <br /> Anyone can get me a VHS or DVD or VCD copy. <br /> <br /> really appreciate it <br /> <br /> Many thanks.
