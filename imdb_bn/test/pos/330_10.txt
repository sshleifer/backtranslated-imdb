To speak the truth, I do not speak Tamil, and I did not understand the film. My good Tamil friend, Kanswaran Kumaraswamipilai (wow, what is a long name), explains everything to me. What a great movie !!! After watching this movie, I think I have seen many more movies from Tollywood (Tamil film industry). Battle scenes are amazing, camera works excellent, and beautiful plot. Actress "Simran", what a beauty. Give a reward for someone looking for the best. Ding, Ding, Dung, I come to the winning smell of an Oscar. I did not understand the song, but they were nice. Mani Ratnam is a great director, and I hope his next film will be successful.
