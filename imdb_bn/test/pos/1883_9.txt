I saw this past week during Bruce Campbell's book tour. I thought it was amazing. Almost all I would expect from Bruce Campbell's science-movie movie. Its camp and very funny. Ted Raimi was also sunny and very stupid. The plot is frustrating, an American businessman goes to Bulgaria and dies. Stacey Kech is a crazy scientist who, in the former KGB turned into a cabbie brain, brings half of Bruce Campbell alive / alive. Bruce Campbell spent the rest of the film trying to take revenge on his death and there are many internal arguments between himself and the KGB agent. The movie contains Bruce Campbell slip stick and humor. The film is somewhat predictable, I knew once he had killed his wife, he would share it with the brain. Anyway, I did not see this movie because I think it would be an Oscar winner script, I went to see it because it was a science film by Bruce Campbell and I was not at least frustrated. I highly recommend that you see him on his book tour or wait and see it next month in scientist-channel. Prior to the movie, she said that the Saif-Fi channel cut the movie slightly to make the TV friendly. If you're a fan of Bruce, I highly recommend it
