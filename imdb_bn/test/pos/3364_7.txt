In the 1970s, British television was often considered as a golden era of comedians, which saw sketch shows as many classic sitcoms as well as "Monty Python's Flying Circus". But by the time the British film did well in the golden age of comedies, did a good job on television, which could possibly be successfully transferred to the big screen. The most winning exceptions of this rule were provided by Python, but their best films ("Monty Python and the Holy Grill" and "Brian Life") were very different in their TV shows. <br /> <br /> The main problem is that the film-making sitakamaguli the BBC's 30-minute slots (5 minutes aitibhite, which will have to find room for ads) in order to fit the ideas are made. Long time Some people remember the film version, "Pompeii up!" Or "steppe and son" with the same affection as the television version. Many of the classic TV comedy show ( "Some Mother Doe AV" M "," Yes, Minister "," phaoli Towers "," The gudijasa ") them in a movie making no effort at all, for which we can be grateful. Characters like Michael Crowford's Frank Spencer or Bessil Fowlie of John Stays may be smiling at half an hour, but I doubt whether they will be funny for two hours. A comedy program (although the normal sense of the comic book instead of a sitakumera drama) films, which "The phola and Rise of Reginald pererina" to work on, but unfortunately the film has ended any hopes. Death of his star Leonard Rocitor. <br /> <br /> "Baba's army" was one of the few television sitcoms of that time, which became a decent film. (Only one other can think about "Porridge"). It was probably an unusually great quality character, and most of the humor was obtained from the interaction between them. Between 1968 and 1977 the main city was going on and a home guard platoon in Walmarton-on-Sea small oceanic city was mentioned. (Initially the home guard, known as local defense volunteers, was a helpful militia formed during the Second World War, most often men were old to serve regularly). The film version plays a three works. The law relates to the formation of platoon and the appointment of its members. In the second law, they created frustration during the training of the army. At the law-23, they were successful in catching a group of Nazis, whose plane was shot. /> <br /> There are three main players in this drama Platoon <br captain, Captain George mainaoyarim (Arthur loye) and his two Sergeant Arthur Wilson (John Le mesuriyara) and karparala Jack Jones (Clive Dun) subsidiary. MineWaring, the Basic Life Manager, the local bank manager, is a fat young person, cheering across the globe with a pair of thick glasses. This is the one who initiated the formation of the Home Guard unit and who appointed his commander. He is like a foolish, persistent, man with his own importance and exaggerated feeling of leadership, who is not fooling with joy. (And most of the word "fool" in the world scene of George Mainwering covers mankind) He, however, has his good qualities. He is inspired by a genuine patriotism ideal and is able to show his face with the Germans, with great physical courage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The two male characters are very different, with some emphasis on appearance, Wilson is tall and Being thin, mining is small and stout. He comes across being more intelligent and well educated than his boss. (His pronunciation suggests he may be a former public schoolboy). তা সত্ত্বেও, তিনি বেসামরিক এবং সামরিক জীবনের উভয় ক্ষেত্রেই দ্বিতীয় ধাঁধা খেলতে শেষ হয়ে গেছেন, কারণ সম্ভবত তার এমন প্যাসিভ ব্যক্তিত্ব রয়েছে যা হতাশা ও পরাজয়ের দিকে পরিচালিত করে এবং একেবারে গুরুত্ব সহকারে কিছু গ্রহণ করতে অক্ষম। Jones is an old soldier who has now bought local slaughterhouses. (His campaign for corporation's ability to man warrant bribe mainly with black market sausages) His enthusiasm for his new role is simply met by his incompetence and chaos. Although his caffease "Do not be afraid!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . (Catchfrej: "We're destroyed, man, dumped!"). The private Godfrey is a gentle adult, whose main concern is the position of the nearest lavatory. Private Walker is a sharp spinach and a private pike (another bank employee) is a spoiled mummy's son. (Pike's mother Wilson's Ratnik, though Wilson tries to keep this communication secret from Mainwaring obsolete). Two notable outsiders are gentle-wise Viqar and ARP Warden, the abominable enemy of Mainwaring, and mostly equal to their populations and offices. /> <br /> Sometimes the enterprise doubles baudda <br ( "hold my husband's hand," referring to soldiers who visits the mainaoyarim visible), which is much more than a TV show was incredibly open shamelessly. (Its creator, David Kraft and Jimmy Perry, is going to create comedy shows later "What are you serving?" And "High-de-High" which were notorious for the proposed comedies). However, the film preserves the mixture of gentle intelligence, nostalgia, and sharp characters which makes the TV series so successful. 7/10
