I protested against observing 15 Park Avenue despite the recommendation, to exclude the film as a subjective issue of extreme emotional dramas and extreme sensational dramas. <br /> <br /> Once in 15 Park Avenue movies come and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Aparna Sen did a great job to hint the audience of every line in the film. The development of the obsolete character, the "right" amount of emotion and a mysterious ending to finish it ... <br /> <br /> I have a new respect for Konkana Sen Sharma, who has played a strong schizophrenic Mithi. He again came back to Pan-3 and Mr. and Mrs Aire's expectations. Professor Anjali's role is very well developed and judged full of Shabana character. Rahul Bose, Shefali Chia, Wahida Rehman added the incredible smell of the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm defining the "moments of the shower" as incredibly picturesque movie scenes in your shower, until your wife / girlfriend / mother bangs at the door. 15PA distributes many "shower moments", especially the conversation between Anjali and her mother, while the mother is careful while talking about her thoughts about Anjali. It immediately finds Anjali's personality to the audience. <br /> <br /> The director is a very bold statement at the end; Perhaps very Western for Indian viewers; Still providing elements to promote the movie in "good" to "great" status.
