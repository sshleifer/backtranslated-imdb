A few years before the pre-marriage contract became a regular issue, Ernest Luische created a screen comedy that they had on their basis. Bluebergh's eighth wife is married to Gary Cooper with many millions of dollars living in French Revieu, and she is now married to Cloit Colbert for number eight. But Cooper's good game about this, he always signed before marriage and settled with his ex-wives for $ 50,000 a year for the contract. <br /> <br /> Certainly the clout wants more than that, and it seems that Cooper does business completely just like getting married. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And of course my favorite is behind Colbert and detective Cooper Blackmailing sends spy on him. Hormon Bing played the best supporting role of the film's best surrender film. <br /> <br /> I often thought that how many people in Hollywood could be swapped in French. A film like this. Of course Cooper is an American and the only Calgary French background in the castby Colbert. Although David Nivon is always impressive, though he is a French man, he is laughable, he is very tsunami of the British <br /> <br /> Blueberry's eighth wife is an exquisitely illustrated film and a lavish example of 'Lubitouch touch'. Give it back.
