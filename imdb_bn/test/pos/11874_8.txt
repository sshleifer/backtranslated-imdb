McCullum is one of the very funny movies of the night, more intelligent than him. His form was more sophisticated than I expected, and his shuffle was fantastic. Thinking behind the movie (mysteriousness, sorrow, foolish man) children. What I should say about this movie does not hate women only, but it hates men. It really does not have any sympathy for men. It seems that way due to the form, but the end tells it all. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The first 2/3 of the picture tells Flashbah with three letters: Dillon, Stupid Bartender; Reiser, mysogenistic stupid lawyer; And Goodman, fool, you're more than Holly-Pullie. The stories are always distorted by their own images and changed reality. Imagine Reiser's BBQ is a great touch. Finally, we do not really know, and do not think anything. Dillon was never innocent, etc. <br /> <br /> In fact, the rest of the movies are also fun. From the over-transparency of Tyler's manipulation of the movie's last 5 seconds, the film seems to have its own power. Everything is out of blue only, and nothing seems to be in the sense. Is it really we do not care? <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a very dark comedy, but there is a shallow presentation. Think of the nurses Nurse or Javrekar. Very candy coated outside, dark chewy inside. Check out this movie if you want your films to be random, dark, or just to fully complete. McCul's One Night will fulfill your requests for this oddity. <br /> <br /> 8/10
