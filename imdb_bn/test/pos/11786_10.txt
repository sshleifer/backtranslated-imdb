I just want to say that I was excited to find this comment about the show. I've tried searching online about shows in the past with no luck. I love the show. It's hard time for me to be inspired to exercise but this show makes fun. Another comment noted that such a routine nowadays was so complex. This is a standard workout that worked! I would just give something to be able to buy a copy of a workout. I remember many moves but not nearly all. Some try to get back into the air and make it available on DVD. It is very good to know that I do not love that shoe! Thanks for making my day!
