The Merchant of the Four Seasons is a film about the lack of love. The movie starts with the main character; Hans Appp, returning from a spell to foreign troops. He returned to his mother, he was not told how much he loved him, or he missed him; But it can be said that he is worthless and even worse, he would instead prefer to go with the person he went back to. This is the relation of women's character, which makes this movie so disgusting; The other gender that is taller than his wife is symbolic of his relationship; He was constantly humiliated by them, and his life through his relationship with them was not as much possible as possible. It is clearly shown in the manner that after dealing with his wife after the drink. A woman, even her wife, lost her job as a policeman; A woman who seems to love her does not really show any affection for her. Even at the end, her daughter is more annoyed than her daughter than what her husband is. <br /> <br /> Four seasonal businessmen are completely unpleasant movie. There is no such scene in the movie where no one is happy, not only this; But the film seems odd to look at the sufferings of its central characters. The film is certainly not recommended to everyone who has a hard time, it must be sure. Despite all the sadness, the movie never goes beyond the limits of reality; Every event in this movie - and probably - happened, and it only works for the movie more frustrating. The film is directed by Rena's Warner Fasibinder; The German director, who had committed suicide in 1982. This was the second taste of the second person's work, but it was easy to get the idea of ​​the type of art that he had created through only two films. Both films are frustrating and radioactive - still the realistic piece of art. This movie is its characteristic delicate; We simply do not know the characters through their character and through their character. It is a clever way of showing the audience that it is the area around them which defines the film of the human being, not the people - and almost everyone knows that living in urban society does not know whether it is difficult or not it is related to the majority of people. <br /> <br /> Four seasonal businessmen are not easily forgotten movies; The film is less on substance and substance, and it creates a very memorable picture and that everybody should be a fan of the movie themselves. It is in my mind that I give my highest recommendation to this film; It's not sweet and it's not nice, but you will not see more realistic scriptures of depression and it's definitely a movie with you.
