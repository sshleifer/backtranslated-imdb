Sergei Eisenstein's most famous movie is facing real-time testing. In 1905, there was a sense of Soviet propaganda in the story of rebellion on war, but a good act that leads to rebellion shows. The Odessa step should be hidden in anyone's mind. Okay, so "The Blatehit Pottmkin" was not the first movie to use Montage, but they did a great job here. Certainly no movie history classes should have seen this movie. This is a great historical drama (although I will admit that I do not know how accurate it is). A 10/10. <br /> <br /> Oh, and now we have learned that "Potemkin" should be recorded as "Potyomkin".
