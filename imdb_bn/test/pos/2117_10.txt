My mother and I basically went to the Ft Worth premiere to see George Street, but got the chance to see the movie premiered on Bus Bus. What a nice, beautiful movie that has not only portrayed the beautiful Texas landscape, but it was also a great feeling-good tales. It is well written, guided and produced and my mom and I love to start from the beginning! Thank you for giving us a chance to be part of this great movie premiere. This one night we will not forget. As the movie was not enough, we were lucky to sit in front of my favorite singer George Stretch 4! Thank you, thank you thank you !! Please continue the great work, thank you! <br /> <br /> Debbie McClendon and Marine Doughtyte Fees Worth, TX
