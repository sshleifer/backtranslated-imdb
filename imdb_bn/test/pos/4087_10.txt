Like some people here, I love Stenger / love! It has been circulated much later in Norway. This means that we are in the 176th episode. (Yes, all right) I say that I really love Stingers! It can make me cry, laugh and laugh. I think we are going to die the day that we reach the episode 192. Stingray series (except Gray's Anatomy) that I really see! The actors are amazing! Especially Jacketta Stapleton! Personally I think he is the best access to us! I know he's not well-known, but he's really a great actress! Stingers want me to be a policeman! I love it <br /> <br /> PS: What do you know if you can buy an episode?
