OK, so I love the silly movie. If you enjoy movie SkyFI films, in top movies, or if you Bruce was a fan of Campbell but I would go see this movie. This is what I want to do in this movie. Having a fan on the top movie, this fit the bill. Every time I thought to myself, "This movie will be the best, best film if * empty *." Then as I thought, * would be * empty. This is a wonderful foolhardt 'B' movie. If you are a fan of Campbell, then I'll say 'Watch it', bring your friends, smile at it. It's a fun. It's classic, or nothing, but if it's on a TV in a few nights, check it out. This has become for me, a movie I'll file under "Celeb Film". A movie that might not be good, but after hard work I could come home and see ('Harold and Kumar go to white sickle', 'army of darkness' and 'helpless cruelty'). <Br /> <br / > If you feel like the upper side, look at the little bad movie, surprisingly. If not, rent "Buba Ho-Tape"
