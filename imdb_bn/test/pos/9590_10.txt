Like the rest of the fans I love this gentleman, I was waiting for the DVD. I received VHS and was very excited for the release and I expressed concern about destroying the tool for getting my VHS copy on DVD. Pictures and sounds are wonderful to my wonderful superb. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, what? And you get it in the post. £ 7.00 Just added more expenses to my cost and record delivery etc. So I'm not after making money from it, I just want to see this neglected gem in a comedy of the world. I recently saw a copy of ebay. £ 26, got for amazing. How they can not release this classic. Email or payment details such as check or paypal etc.
