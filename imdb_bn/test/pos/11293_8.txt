<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said that the person based on the Nilik philosophy is referring to the spamming on the ground (title sequence / presentation ) No more than this, it's probably the most intense and intense imagery you'll see in a movie. <br /> There is no conversation after describing the life cycle, only pictures. The addition of the picture to the structure of black and white photography sounds like a truly obscure background that works to run the Creator's message. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with God (portrayed as a bandage and definitely insane man) push with a straight razor and later dies in his own dirty. After death, the nature of Mother arises from her body for blood and semen and gives birth to people by representing a brain that beat people on earth. <br /> <br /> <br />, populated by hulking shrouded humanoids who eventually happen on maternal nature and man. After the violent assassination of the nature of nature and the rape of rape, these humorous bodies carry corpses back to the ground and the life cycle is restored. <br /> <br /> I really hired from Blockbuster in one night, based on cover art and hype content, but it is definitely not a blockbuster-type film. Do not expect narrations, dialogues or any stretch marks. It's a dark subject based on intense imagery. <br /> <br /> I give this film some high marks for filmwork and audio, but I do not think that I want to see it again. I love my movies dark and unique, but this is more than my expectations.
