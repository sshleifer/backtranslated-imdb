Many people are having fun out of Steven Seagals acting out of power And why do I really look down on why I remember the fire down. Well ... okay his other films are acceptable (related to his acting!). <br /> <br /> I did not expect anything from this picture after reading reviews about Patriot. I just came down from the fire and I was much worse than Patriot. So I was really surprised about this one. In my opinion it is one of his very best movies. It would be better if it had more action sequences and a couple more battle scenes. I like stories and stories from actors. Cammilla Belle was just incredible. In the future he has a great movie-career. A few action scenes are made very well. And Steven Seagal was very credible in his unusual role.
