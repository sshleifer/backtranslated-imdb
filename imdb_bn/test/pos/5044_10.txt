I found this film to be one of these great heart-warming gems. Story lines are tightly woven and the characters throughout the gorgeous development are! I have a big fan of whatever the US movie is and right up with this: "Feeling," "Closer" even "King of the Heart." Vlastimil Brodsky as Fanda, Fantastic. In the true sense of loving life, it takes a love story and enjoys the twist and counter viewers to enjoy the life / fundamentals of the life (which is almost the cost of it <br /> <br />) Wonderful His co-star Steel Jazzovkova is as unforgettable as his fed-up wife. I highly recommend this movie for families - my kids like it.
