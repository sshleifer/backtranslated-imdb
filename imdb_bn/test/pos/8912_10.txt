Alien Warrior (King of the Road) is one of the 80 jewels on the road that you have accidentally caught, then look at the strange clock, surprisingly miraculously and at the top, it's astonishing. <br /> <br /> A tempestuous alien came in the world (to be correct in LA) and stumbles in the world of drug dealers, gangs, and corrupt police. She falls in love with Flexen-Haired, beautiful teacher who just wants to help read more about the inner-city kids. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, but you're right for filmmakers Can say if their heart was in place, and if things do not work! I'll just pray it on DVD soon. <br /> <br /> This is a hot soundtrack, break dance, violence, nudity .... all with a positive, healthy message! See it.
