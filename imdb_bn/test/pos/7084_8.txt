One true fact proves that it is a character that produces a movie. The strip definitely receives an Oscar nomination for its role. A beautiful drama, One True Thing is a major example of filmmaking in the late 1990s - there are still people who care about creating and viewing movies without the special effects of millions of dollars more than the big blockbuster. It's not a good picture or anything ... not silly. But the emotion that both the actor and the author distribute, sent me a shock wave. I cried twice in this movie, which says a lot for 24-year-olds.
