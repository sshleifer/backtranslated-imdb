This short, a constructive cartoon featuring Pep La Pieu, expresses the concern of a cat that he thinks he will solve all his problems. The problem is that he draws our unintended attention to honest and true scandal (our hero, peep, and left entry level) are undoubtedly more attentive, we say, more than M cats. Every great plan has its drawbacks, but this one is a crescendo! I am surprised that both Jack and John had received calls from the Office of Heres, and they were both male and male. Finally, there were attendees for production codes at Betty Boop. Later "victory" was clearly and mostly female. Very good cartoon, but Pepe is a character who works as well as focal points, instead of supporting them. Well worth watching. Recommended.
