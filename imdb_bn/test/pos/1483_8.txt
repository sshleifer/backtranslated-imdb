There was someone in my family (who does not tell this because of personal reasons) who always thinks that Mr. Bian comedy series is always stupid. Imagine that I felt that time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, this is the first time in my country's local television. The one in which I grew up to show up first, it's just one of the things stuck between my head. Even once my friends even talked about the selected episodes and we laugh together. <br /> <br /> It's always evil, funny and fun to play Mr Bean in each role as the Rican Atkinson. Although sometimes it may show some repetition, but it fails to bring back my childhood memories. Actually, I can dare to say that this is the first event that introduces me to the type of event that can come out of the UK. <br /> <br /> The comedy series ... Of course it's really mischievous, as Brittes is saying.
