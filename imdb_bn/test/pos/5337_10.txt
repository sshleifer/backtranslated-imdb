A great animated movie to reach the level of older people like "The Lion King" <br /> <br /> I went to see it with one of my best Belgian friends who saw the series on TV. I was lucky because I do not know the people of Belgium were aware of "Wallace and Groome". <br /> <br /> I started to bring it back to remembrance when it started and that old old theme started. <br /> <br /> <br /> Some nice sitcom style scenes, some wordplay or just plain joke. If you know the series, the animation is not impressive but it's still fun to see how it is realized how it's done. My conclusion: It is not only for my happiness and pleasure, but also some ridiculous applicants can easily apply to the elderly so I say: Go and see you as soon as you can see the "curse of the roar"
