This picture is a great comedy drama. Christopher Walken wakes up his supporter's role as manager, and his commentary will keep you smiling. Robin Williams plays a major role as a quick knowing "John Stuart" and you will be amused if you are a Central fan of the comedy. The show is good, because if the audience is half-brainer, they can see it as a very important cultural attack of the policies of the current Republican government and the American democratic process ... mention the ways in which most politicians are elected. <br /> <br /> I was impressive in sub-plots and the film seems to be very liked and entertaining, no ordinary "non-brother" I do not want a comedy movie less than the market, however, currently the theater is without question of 90% garbage Better without. Just my thoughts ... Don
