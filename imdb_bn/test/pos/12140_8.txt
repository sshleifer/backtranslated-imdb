It is a black and white film from France, <br /> <br /> Simple plot, gangster to run and get help etc. We have seen such a movie many times in years. What makes this film different is mainly its performance and style. All actors perform quietly, no one cries and rarely loses his temper. There are several deaths, some amazing. Beautiful women as well as sex scenes. There are no cars. <br /> <br /> <br /> It is very refreshing to listen to people / people, and here we must read the subtitles. <br /> <br /> acting is absolutely perfect. Especially led <br /> <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura and a small but important role played by Jean Paul Belmondo. These two actors were among the best. <br /> <br /> I said above that the film is faulty, some scripts have some script deficiencies, they are small, acting things in this movie. Production is also the first rate <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (out 4) 88 points (100 out) IMDb 8 (10 out)
