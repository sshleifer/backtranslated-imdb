/ * Can be a spill, but of course it does not matter :) * / <br /> <br /> A great view of ceasefire patchkin hunting images. The visual aspect (good, and has) inspired, the intensive scale of the film is impressive, and the strategy must certainly be advanced. What's really amazing, I think, a film's depth and effectiveness, appropriate literary script, sound (soundtrack protection), decent image quality, today's deep-rooted (self) referentialism, exceptional acting, love, etc. What you get is a completely visual experience. <br /> <br /> BTW, the previous poster mentions: "Eisenstien felt heroes after many disappointments they wanted." You think Eisenstein is building a great final war and then he cheats you, it's a little cheaper, I'm rather a finalist. The final step is seen in the scene. "<br /> <br /> I have to warn you that the end is not cheap, and Einstein's heroes were not generous. History, however, was there. Potemkin is really going through Squadron, as shown in the movie. Finally, I strongly recommend to show Bottliep Porterkin with more importance in the movie. Watch it with a fellow movie buff, keep me talking for hours on it. However, if you are considering filming, accepting as a "cool" or "classic" can be "slow" or "annoying", but this movie can not be for you yet. There is not much cheaper entertainment here. <br /> <br /> This is a complete 10/10 for me.
