Like many movies in Wajda Krajobraz Po bitawi, perhaps, is not understandable for "the rest of the world". Based on a few short stories from Tadius Boroski, who was detained at Osimism, Dachau and Dotmargen camp during WWII. Borosky describes the inhuman life of the Nazi camp in his books, the Terrible of the Bourbetter - Port Perol, which earned the privilege of captives. Boroski was ruthless for humanity and was vain for himself. He described human history as an endless chain of exploitation and humiliation. Wickedly, after returning to Poland, he stopped composing artistic prose and became imperialist preacher, creating clauses of imperialist and American-American press publications. A few years later, he committed suicide. Wajada changes the picture's view in the film. Vorarbeiter Tadek - character created by Tadeusz Janczar - plays only supporter. The story has been destroyed in poet, destruction, war and prison, and a day's love relationship with Neena, a Jewish girl fleeing from Communist Poland, though she really hates Jewish life and mentality. As a background, we can observe the tragic unrealistic of life in the so-called "Deputies" (detached people), who settled in the SS Barracks after the release of America. March, mixed with excessive levels of patriotic ugly food and / or German girls find prostitution. <br /> <br />
