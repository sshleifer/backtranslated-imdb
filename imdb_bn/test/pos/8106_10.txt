Before I could see this picture, I did not really expect much from it, though my friend was otherwise advised. Because of my friend's request, I decided that I'm really going to see this movie. The moment I was looking at the film, I just blown away. From the credit I was falling on my seat; I just can not contain myself The film is about the glory of Hitler's joke. Heinel is twice the number of times for the Jews, who returned to the war. Due to the valor of the sailors, he managed to save one of the Germans and became a member of the enemy by doing this work, which helped in the struggle of the Jews. But things went wrong and Stalves was arrested, but only then was the escape from Jewish Serb's 'The Gatoro'. Due to this escape, the German army started searching, which means repeatedly and Stalz was arrested, but again they escaped, only for the sake of Minsk and mistakenly resulting in his cruelty. ***** The lecture that created at the end of Chaplin is ridiculous, it follows the monsoons that the society can only dream of. In the lecture, it produces the universal money of the film due to constraints and constraints and it definitely works, because we pray for forgiveness about how we live our life, as the smallest matter is the biggest, the most primantant, such as war.
