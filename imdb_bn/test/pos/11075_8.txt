From Eastern P.H., on the right side of North New Jersey, I still think it was a documentary more than a movie. I have friends from New York and New Jersey and this film represents the "still" existing lifestyle of low-income areas outside the lifestyle of "Big City" Lifestyle. If you do not see this movie and are wondering what is actually going on in the urban jungle, then check out this movie. A big name actor, as they pulled off these guys and said that acting, which adds to the reality of the movie, the performance is less than anyone! Check out this picture!
