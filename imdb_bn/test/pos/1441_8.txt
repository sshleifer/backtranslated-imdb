The reality of the world is a real nice look and heroin addiction. This movie is a subject which is very close to those involved in drug culture, and has knowledge about heroin addiction (or near). Good movie, which is not really old. All involved and the ultimate set of amazing performances are the way of Premmingera that shows how Zuni can live in the world. The value of an appearance - an education of sorts. The golden hand is a worrisome look in the painful life of a painful life.
