This movie describes the DVD jacket as "uplifting and ridiculous". Those words I did not choose - not by long shots. I will never choose a word like "sombre", sometimes even "depressed." This is not a bad movie. It's a pretty good movie, which makes you feel good enough about what's happening and what's going on, with good performance from Leads.

How did he want to live life in the most fulfilling way, then he faced the anger that he felt in his growing weakness. In a similar way, showing family contracts with such a crisis reminds me of a "ordinary man", even though the film is very emotionally intense. Was there. So, "Raising and ridiculous" (with the respect of all those who write a survey on DVD jackets) but very good in their own way. 7/10
