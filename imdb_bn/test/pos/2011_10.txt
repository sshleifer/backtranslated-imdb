It was a modern TV classic! The story goes like this, Bob is a girlfriend named Alicia. Bob and Alicia love and want to get married. Bob has a bud named Oven that works with him. Oven Alicia jealous. He likes hanging around with Bob. Now Oven hangs around with Bob and Alicia. There is a secretary named Bob and Owen's Heater. Heather too is prone to accidents If you are not guessing it, either, kind of isolated. He is also traveling with Bob and Alicia and Owen. Sometimes Alicia wishes that Bob has no friends. <br /> <br /> At the end of the first season, Oven finally found himself in a real longtime girlfriend. Bob and Alicia were driving in the night before their wedding, came out in a small car and then got stuck. Somewhere in the middle of the road! What happened next? What about poor Heather? Someone got married ?? Sorry, the series has ended. <br /> <br /> Fox does not even think about bringing an application back to the air from TV Guide twice. It was a great show with a great throw. I very much liked Heather. She looked glassy cool and was lovely. I miss this show a lot. This is the last missing ...... like reading a good book with sorrow.
