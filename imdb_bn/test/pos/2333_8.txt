There was a recent documentary on film making, it showed a long list of actors and directors who are talking about making movies. A common theme was that you can make a great script, great cast, best director and lots of money and still create a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Down Percepathy is the proof of the theory of that theory. Do not have an original or horrible good written screen. Some strong actors, but mostly unknown, and this movie laughs loudly to you! It would be easy to say that this film was carrying the grammar of the film, but it is not really true. Other characters like Rob Sander have been significantly added to the heroes of the film and the ridiculous Harland Williams. <br /> <br /> kastamaijika kastamiksa, or the mysterious "movie magic" here is what really happened, which is to create a film that is easily flowing, well written and well performed dialog line and the line after the conversion is incredibly good death. <br /> <br /> Plan an incoherent compound, lots and lots of technical flaws and only stupid things that can not happen, real world, or real navy, but you just do not care. As a merchant marine I have seen that the overall feeling of the film, though not convincing, was as far away as far as the sea could live. This is a very interesting film <br /> <br /> A good family film, and especially if you are a fan, kelasira grammar intelligence, and extraordinary majaratba brutality.
