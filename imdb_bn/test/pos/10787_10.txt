Okay, for the first time, "Talk Radio" video was a video store for VHS only $ 2.00 or did I believe it was and I think it might be about a horse star, because I saw it at about thirty times of seconds, then Just do not see it again. Then I went to another shop almost a month later and I found "Talk Radio" in DVD for only $ 5.00. So I thought it was managed by Oliver Stone, and I picked it up. So I was stupid after the movie ended. I have not seen such a film. Here's the main plot, then I'll say what I say. <br /> <br /> This is a Dallas talk radio host Barry Simply, a Jewish radio host that talks about other people and interupts them, and everything is taken seriously. Now, a network wants to keep its show throughout the United States, so Barry's show has received many interesting phone calls like Chet (a Neo-Nazi), Kent (a rock n roll child with intoxicants), John (rapists), and others. . Now some actors sound like the same actors / actresses. But still I think it looks right. <br /> <br /> Now my love for this image is dark and the paranoid atmosphere of the radio station. Dark music fits nicely in the background. It also has a flashback scene in the film, how did he start on the radio, which I think they did well. <br /> <br /> But the great thing about film is ending. I was surprised to see it, and as a result, you feel a little paranoid about the hello off phone callers and everything is amazing about it. It also tells you how to tell the right things to people in a big city like Dallas. One of the underlying / weakest films of Oliver Stone is mentioned, but I think this is my best. <br /> <br /> Obviously, get this movie if you like movies with Paranoia - like dark atmosphere with horror music, it seems like in the background. I still have seen this picture many times when I was bored, I saw it this night. Yes, if you really want to get a real feeling of real movies, then turn it off at night. I might be crazy, but it makes the film even better! <br /> <br /> Another reason I forgot to mention is that I do not think that this picture was so good, so perhaps it would be my point of view. 'Talk to the radio.' It's not too tricky or some sound, it's kind of plain. The book "Taked-to-Death" or "The Obsessive Radio Host" is not a good title or something interesting and ordinary "talk radio". Or because of the universal photo? I do not think Oliver Stone is generally not universal. Paramount could have been a good company. I do not know, there is nothing good about this movie, but I love it. <br /> <br /> "Sticks and stones can break your bones, but the word can cause permanent damage."
