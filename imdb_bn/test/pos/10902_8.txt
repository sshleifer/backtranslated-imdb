After reading the comment about this movie, and seeing it now, I understand how the person felt it. The decision made was after listening to the common sense. When the movie comes out, I have heard the information about how it came. The storyline was created from an actual event. During an award show, an actor, thanking the people, unpaid this award unexpectedly to a former school teacher. <br /> <br /> Of course, many people come 'out' from the closet. Every day Each outing is different for each person. In real life, the results of a person may be different. And to reach personal interest, they want to accept the most important thing in life. For them around, joy and honest recognition can make life more complete. For the film, Howard's outcome is far more ridiculous than real life. And community recognition showed others that Howard himself was nothing else. <br /> <br /> Overall, performances were crazy. The use of memorable quotes and music adds to the world's stereo-type, but the tongue and cheeks get rid of humor. This is a movie. Sit down, look with an open mind, and smile at your head.
