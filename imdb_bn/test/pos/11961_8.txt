Brilliant aspiring cartoonist Hoops McCann (a fantastic performance of John Cusack) and his best friend George (delicious death Joel Murray) went to Nantucket for summer after graduation from high school. Hoops, George, and several new friends, Kassandra (Demi Moore, in her most charming language) have come to help, a singer who threatens to destroy the descendants of greedy Bakerstas. Writer / director Savage Steve Holland has often acknowledged the ridiculous and shocking nonstop barrage of wide and stupid, but still very funny joke. Constant Medak Lunancy is a real cruel, good nature, and an infectiously passive life that is impossible to dislike or oppose. Moreover, the performer and enthusiastic performances from a delicate game add to Joey Marimet: As the Bocat Goldthwaite Spotty Egg Stark, Tom Wildard has his stupid brother Clay, Curtis Armstrong as Sweet Acaque Raymond, Mark Metcalf as Achilles Bakerstead, Teddy, as Kimbaly Foster Facting Cookie, Joe Flawworthy Gang-Ho Enarela Raymond, William Hickey kryanki bekarasteda Old Man, Jeremy pabhena smipi prappi pink tie and John matusajaka hulim Stan biker. Excellent cinematography of Eidodor Mancofsky, Hip Trashy Soundtrack, Corrie Larius's 'Cool Rockin' score, and Phunky Animation all are nice together. Single funny scene: A pod dinner party terrorist in a Godzilla case. An absolute hooter
