I have seen this in the movie in the 80's and never forgot it, though I have never seen it again. <br /> <br /> I do not know if I can see it, it will seem like a date, but it should be compared to the terrible modern film that has been remembered and seen in the zones. Stand up very well <br /> <br /> I still remember his coffin coming out and opening and all the bodies are rebuilt, and blue electricity. Seeing hundreds of horror films and still remembering it, it is certainly good.
