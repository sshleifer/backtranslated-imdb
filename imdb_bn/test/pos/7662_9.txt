Elisa (Elizabeth Muharan) daughter of a farm coming from the city in search of lover of the country. He has met a person who told him astrologer who would show his star. A journey of these souls ... Elisa is examined, can she realize her true love when she sees him or not? Tommy (Tommy Lee Jones) is a construction worker who is trying to find himself in his local heritage. They show different ways to each other looking for things. Elysa is still looking at love all the time and Tommy is trying to protect the reservation that protects her grandmother. It's a wrap-up story to look beyond the obvious and searchable beauty of everyday everyday things. The style is full of artsy symbols and symbols. Psychedelic camera styling can scare the average moviegoer, but deep messages and interesting frames make this movie valuable. This is a movie that explores the underwear of strange, cruel and devastating people. This strays from one way but certainly worth watching!
