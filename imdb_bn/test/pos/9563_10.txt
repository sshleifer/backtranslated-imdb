I recently saw this movie for the first time. I've enjoyed the fact that I just went out and bought the DVD. This movie gets pure genius and funnier with only watching each. Anyone can write jokes or funny dialogues and the actors can remember them, but the film's foundation is improved !! How do they do it? Thanks, Christopher's guests!
