After a little slow start, I think this film was about the Italian occupation of the Greek island during World War II, and initially it was quite enjoyable for two hours from two sides. <br /> <br /> Love triangle is a fun and trustworthy hit to me, because I know it happened in different places of the profession. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl (Christian Bell) associated with marriage to Mandr√°s. From the beginning, I had questions about depth in their love, but when Italy attacked Greece, their future collapsed, and Mandira went to the war. After the German intervention, Greece conquered and occupied Italy by occupying the island of Pelagia, in which the Pelagia merged and began to fall in love with Captain Correlli (Nicholas Cage). Of course, it was a very unfortunate woman occupied land. They knew their captains, as they are their enemies but as real people, and sometimes fall in love - began to see their neighbors humiliation. I was able to read an interesting book about the German occupation of Britain's Channel Islands, which was a big issue. Once upon a time returning to Madrasah Island, Pelagia burst among them. <br /> <br /> The second background issue was Italian occupation, which I think was truly illustrated. The first was the humiliation that the island had treated with their Italian captains. Greece defeats Italy (fully true from the historical perspective) and is truly won by the Germans. Instead of surrendering the city to the Italians and blaming a German officer for surrendering, I was hit with something that actually happened (and was really funny. I prefer the line, "We would rather surrender to Germany) than dogs in Italy". ) The screenplay of the Italian soldier hit me as trustworthy. The Italian army never shakes their German companion and is not encouraged to fight them. Though Hitler and Mussolini had close friends, their soldiers tried to insult each other. Here the Italianians are more interested in the song than the war (which the German troops on the island can not readily understand) and when Italy retains peace and they withdraw from the war, they are glad - until they discover that it can make them better captains, the German It was all good, I thought. <br /> <br /> It falters a bit at the end with a very predictable finish, but still worthy of praise. <br /> <br /> 7/10
