This production was quite good. Normal fabulous scenery, interesting, quirky characters. The issue of having Captain Hastings, Miss Lemon, and Pierreot's office / residence was so strange that it specially featured among the main PBS / BBC mysteries. <br /> <br /> In the original series, the office Hastings read the paper, Poirot "his little gray cell exercise." Mrs. Lemon pitching whenever needed. <br /> <br /> Peirat without Captain. Hastings will be like Homes without Watson ... He certainly can solve the crime, but it's not interesting. <br /> <br /> and how a Pirot mystery falls, for some beautiful, unreasonable woman, without haste, with its illogical behavior.
