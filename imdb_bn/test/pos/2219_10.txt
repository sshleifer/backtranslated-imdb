If this movie does not create a whole new section with unbroken incomplete - laugh, truth, fun, talent and situations that make for Magic. <br /> <br /> To stop cough comedy from creative musical numbers that included the actors very well, if I did not know well then I thought there was a huge script here. <br /> <br> What you get: Interviewing with God in the air meets a new and new and delightful thing that makes it its own entity. <br /> <br /> PETA and both give star performances and return it to you immediately. The rest of the cast is also phenomenal. There are no small parts here ... only small actors, and everyone involved here should be beaten back, should be taken to dinner and should be considered for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> Good!
