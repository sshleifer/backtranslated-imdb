This show was incredible !!! I saw three and it's the best. The mystery of this movie, a bit romance, stunt that will hit your mind (Gobi), great character and amazing position Where was this impressed? What will be more? I really liked the story lines with his brothers. Looking forward to Crameleon 4 and see how the world is again saved.
