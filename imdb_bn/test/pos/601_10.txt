First of all, I want to say that this movie is the greatest thing of all time with mankind. It's the best of all the nice Muppets movies and the best of all the other movies there! So Jim Henson's bu-ya! <br /> <br /> This movie is the best and best of all Muppop Movies. (Boo ya) This is a frog (kimit) trying to make Hollywood. Along with awesome friends, along with the girl he met, some of the greatest songs have been created which are forced to be classic, including "Sunny Connection" <br /> I conclude that the movie was the greatest thing ever seen in it! If you do not see it already, turn off your computer and get tunes in your closest video store !!! (If they do not have a great movie then I will claim them big time)
