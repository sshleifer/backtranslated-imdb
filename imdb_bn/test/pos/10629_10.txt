After my review of the cache ended, I wrote that I planned to make Henne as a filmmaker. It led me to get a DVD for La Piano, which I finished about half an hour ago. <br /> <br /> It has been published on IMMb and in external reviews - Hippett's Erica, who has been trying for years now, to make her mother happy, to spend with everyone she starts with herself and everything else in her life. Like insects that can create twisted pathology. He has imposed everything that will free him from his forbidden slavery, of course, his sexuality, which is literally insane, insane, where he can no longer understand the true love of emotions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think this is related to all of us - we all I am trying for autonomy, but there are many contradictory needs, most of which are not at the most conscious level. It also stimulates the idea of ​​how one, sex, and the realization of those fantasies, among the consequences of deciding to share sexual fantasies with another person. He gets the character of Huppert that he asks for the film, and this is what he thinks is a fantastic experience. <br /> <br /> About the well-known scenes of the bathroom: I am really grateful that what was the possible erotic charge of this sequence (for the viewer, I mean) it went out due to the previous scene, where she kept the glass in her pocket. At the time he is playing his role, let's see - this guy is an appropriate bath room, we have already found that he is dangerously annoyed and so it is not a little dominant session of our hatred. <br /> <br /> I think another incredible achievement of this movie is how I forgot about halfway through the way that it was not in English and I was reading sub-titles. Before any foreign movie, did not happen before, and I've seen quite a few. <br /> <br /> In this picture, like a cache, the last is not covered by rich ovens, but against cash, we can at least get the ultimate idea, even though we have to make sure that even Hupper's character is alive or dead. Know about After the experience of La Piano, when Michael Hein comes, I do not mean, more than a trifle plot.
