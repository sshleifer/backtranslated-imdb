Although, this episode was objectionable to the Tuberculosis Syndrome Association, others thought it was funny, others thought it was a bad way to start a new season. <br /> <br /> This episode is fun and just frustrating. Created history as the first episode of history in the South Park, unless you count this episode as an episode. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed how I enjoyed Chris Hansen and his television show. Hunter I did not like the idea that Chris Hansen would make a show of touritas and allow a boy to talk and impose on the Jews. <br /> <br /> One thing that I do not like is how the South Park thought people with tourettes syndrome would just blurt the bad language like that. I saw people on television with the lookout syndrome and they just do not waste bad words. If I'm not mistaken.
