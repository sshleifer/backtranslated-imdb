I saw a lot of bad reviews on the Superviventes de los Andes that I was forced to stand for it (or at least I'll try). First of all, it certainly shows that it was made in seventeen years with a very low budget, but it is part of its character. I like contemporary films but they excavate old ones which they value. I'm not the one to feel the desire to see or choose movies with modern treatments and effects; Besides, almost every movie buff likes old fashion motion pictures (who do not like movies from Al Santo or do not like planning 9 from outside, does not matter overall quality?). From speed, it is only a low cost (again) one tool, and I think constant dialogue is a good character and the situation is for development. Sure, Elive has got good FX, but I will not only hate Purototo, and I do not feel very excited by the English speakers at Uruguay and in an event for me, which is the Superviventes de los Andy. Canono based on the fact that the canoe can now repeat better due to the advancement of technology, but I think that I will be based on the proposed emotions regardless of its production date. <br /> <br /> All of this influenced me because for the first time I saw on TV, and nowadays I do not think it has lost some initial power. Of course it's been a long time and I've seen tons of good films in every aspect of the movie, but it does not diminish the real value. This is not a bad movie, and I keep it alive above without hesitation. Just give it a break.
