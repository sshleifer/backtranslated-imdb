Is it a mystery to me that I was not caught in this great 50 candles ?? So far the brooding turned silent, but I certainly are not disappointed that report is happy to report. I have not seen American movies of Jules Dasin for several years, but based on this, I'll probably go back and see "The Braun Force" and "Night and the City" again soon. <br /> <br /> Gene Svarice, a name unknown to me but a face familiar to her world-fatigue and coolness, has recently finished her stay in the prison and there is a way to go to this film (Hey, otherwise the story will not be straight) Is not coping well with life. An opportunity presents itself: an easy multi-million dollar jewelry that can be done at night by fear of the discovery of some men. The impressive filming of robbery, total silence half-hour, people must definitely remember about the film, and in fact it is amazing. But at the last moment of the theft I like half the place, once the robbers thank the big mouth of a thief. Nice painted silken party of Paris in black and white stark; And Servais' channeling in his extra but cruel performance both of his Eddie Constantine and Humphrey Bogart. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it's a bit too emotional, but this classic is what really says about the status of the people living in it, even pure entertainment as fame is not just deep or thought-provoking; George Auric's modernism, romantic, and jazzy scores are another highlight that turns active.
