After all, I saw this show because I was a little kid, and I always like it. Surely, when I was young I could not understand, but I still enjoyed! And now I've realized it for so many years, I love it more. This musical score is the most wonderful detail I've ever heard! Every note is perfect, I do not even listen to the song to enjoy the song! <br /> <br /> Moving towards this special generation - it's great! Of course, someone could not play Mrs. Lewat without Angela Lansbury and she did it perfectly. And he should have, he has been playing this part for many years. George Hennon is absolutely brilliant. I've never heard of the best Swine Todd. He has a wonderful voice, yet he can throw his voice so well! Its "epiphany" is incredible, as you can say by the response of the audience. Judge, Toby, Antony, and Perrelli are also very surprising in their role. Everyone is perfect! Well, I still have to go ahead with Johanna's Green Fin and Lynn Birds. <br /> <br /> <br /> This event can be admired in all ages, but it is not always acceptable. I'm not your typical middle-aged theater lover, I'm only 15 years old, but Sweeney Tod has given me more comprehension for music from music than any other music.
