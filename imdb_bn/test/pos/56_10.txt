"LakeWana Blues" was so emotionally strong in the portrayal of urban black in the early 50's and early 60's. The specific joy and sorrow culture of the working class that existed outside the mainstream culture. Santiago-Hodson's characters portray black people who lived incomplete life but maintained a strong positive value of love, loyalty and respect. Although the letters had sometimes turned away from that standard, they did not deny the value of the values. Rather, they got recognition and their own imperfections and other characters, without verdict, which went through "grandmother" life. The central letters were strong and credible, the settings were realistic and the personal memories of a past era were brought back. Pre-Integrated Urban Life was a time of sensory addiction, sight, sound and smell, which can often be enjoyed by watching the play "Lacavana Blues". I'll see it again and again.
