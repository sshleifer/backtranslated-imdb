I have taken my 11-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son in this movie and I can not remember a movie where I laugh loudly aloud to loudly laughing loudly. Guess the story line is expected, but the journey is so enjoyable that you do not know how it will end. The ridiculous feeling of the time actors was unreasonable. The actors are completely cast. My kids have mentioned that Amanda Bains is such a young girl actress who is not endlessly ruining her life. She is so refreshing. My kids said it is now their favorite movie. In 2006 our money was well spent.
