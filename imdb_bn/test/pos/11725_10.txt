I'm fan of the films of B grade 80, in which the hero is a cat of a bad guy, a strong man, who finds love - and distributes this movie! <br /> <br /> In the end you do not know how Shark will not be killed (and he does not beat up! I truly believe). However, he does not do it with some extra 'die hard' stunts. The 'past' team works together, so the title. All the characters in his team - people are sideline at work because they do not perfectly conform. This screenplay is funny and sympathetic - they have a real feeling. They stand with a good team of their own against an assassin's attacker. The result is a great movie silent.
