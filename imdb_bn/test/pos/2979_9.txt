Great movie! Soundtrack is awesome! Very loose words Elton was even ahead in 1971 even more than his own time. Luis Gilbert has done a great job of creating and managing this film! The movie was a breath of romantic and fresh air. Soundtrack by Sir Elton appreciated the movie. Rex Morris has done a great job with the song "Hole Roll", the song Tenor Sax, and is incredible for Richard Le Gallien's poem "I'm My Two to Work!" Kudos everyone involved with this fantastic film! Many people involved in this movie become best in their case.
