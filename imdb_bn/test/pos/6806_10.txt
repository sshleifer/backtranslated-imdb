My daughter already wrote a review of this movie in my sign in this ... but I want to add a few words. <br /> <br />? National Velvet 'was as a child of my two favorite movie. (The other is' Wizard of Oz ??) Cinematography, acting, script, and music all together, a wonderful little heart-felt drama that can still be seen in my eyes. Based on a book by Anneid Baggold, this script is very well followed. Characters are so created to think. Easy to engage in emotion with the whole family and live in the short-lived village of Irish village. The courtyard ... completely exhausted enough to support his horse and to try himself in the world's greatest horse race ... Any young man, especially a 40-year-old woman fears ... a time when people are sometimes as sportsmen alone as athletes Is ignored. You will not be terribly harsh to appreciate her merit. <br /> <br /> But the view I love most about this perspective is that it is unreasonable in its moral message. It's almost narcotic how the 'Mother and Apple Pie' films are back then. I was really surprised by the IMDB Critic, who asked ... 'Was the world really believing?' And then, two main characters involved went on to curse the director for relentlessly managing travel overnight. Answer to his question is a vague yes to me !!!! The world's running film was dependent on 40. <br /> <br /> My grandfather remembers to release this film to this mother. Then my mother saw me in my childhood, and my daughter was lucky when she could see it on a video tape repeatedly. Now we have the DVD. It was loved for families, although the generation of horse lovers. It was never about sex ... age is coming! It's about hard work to reach your own faith and your goal. Also, even in the oldest metaphor sense there was no reward money! It was the girl's daughter who understood her horse? And yes, the director Elizabeth Taylor was really concerned about the lack of physical physical development because the book has made a big deal about her belt brown hair (Liege Taylor's character) to spend her hair, so that she could pass as a male jockey, went to Grand National Steeplechase. . It was a boys only sport ... I think there are only 12 women in the competition. It is almost insulting that anyone would refrain from thinking about Lolita about this particular movie ... Besides, anyone who has anything to do with the girl and her horse knows that they just have four hooves and a tail of the eyes that they think. <br /> <br /> And now for a huge variety ... stunt horse is now famous ?? Horse Whisperer ', performed by Monty Roberts. I believe he is referring to his riding in movie credits. <br /> <br /> I 10 out of this movie 10! I did not get tired of seeing it again.
