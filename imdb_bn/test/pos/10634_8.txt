In the first 20 minutes, we are moving away from some strong emotional emotions: a hateful and provocative mother in 40-year-old daughter has debated violently with her violence; A piano teacher (and music professor) expressed unreasonable assessment of love for his students; The joy that music can inspire both the audience and the actor. In this short time our senses betrayed very real characters. We are strongly away from the music performed and Nuance is showing the difference between great and medium performance with a lot of attention. The extensive application of this type of material alone was the basis for an outstanding film. But the trend of French film is its growth, it is a deeper, teacher-suppressed sex, expression of sexual freedom and passionate attraction in the context of the subsequent breakdown and the inevitable cycle of real abuse. We are dragging his sorrow and at least initially wonder how much trouble can be with the achievement of the talent, especially he appreciates the musician. The piano teachers graphic dialogue and scenes contain imagery of sexuality and cruelty that some people can not keep an eye on. The scenes are essential for the dilemmas, which can be said to increase the film and therefore can be called totally absurd. It can be a great film, but the mainstream does not see it.
