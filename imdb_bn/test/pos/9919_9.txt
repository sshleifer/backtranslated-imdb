Title: Opera (1987) Director: Dario Argentine Cast: Christina Maasilacht, Ian Charlesson, Urbano Barbarini, Daria Nicolody Review: I have seen that the only Argentine film was selfish and it blown me with the lines of my style, color and wonderful story. I decided to go with Opera as I said it was one of its best. People, I think I discovered that I want to be one of my favorite horror managers. <br /> <br /> Opera is a young opera singer who gets his big break when a strange modern opera gets hit by a car by the main star Max Beth. Betty is undoubtedly herself to take part in herself. Very bad for him then a monoco who shows him a cruel assassination of his friends and colleagues. <br /> <br /> Wow, ID heard something good about this issue, but I was not prepared to take the level of greatness which this film would take me. Yes, the film has its flaws that I got later. But in most cases the movie blows me out. <br /> <br /> Firstly, this movie is not a lot of color filling like Susparia. I hope that it will be something like that in the section, but no, it was his surprise because it had its own appearance and feeling. The film is somehow color void. Some scenes have plenty of color (such as in a beautiful kitchen / living room) where Argentines fill the screen with plenty of greens and blues, but in most cases this film is a gray, black tone and the most by it. It was liked to have its own individual look. <br /> <br /> The sequence of these shows are incredibly well orchestrated deaths of this show. How nice. Every death scene was like a work of art. Beauty in Destruction This is not just your normal hack and slash death sequence, but this death has been carefully shocked and found more than its circumstances. Love them every second, there are lots of blood and greatness, but with the style. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This one really has some original and beautiful shots. I liked using this one camera innovator. You thought that Tarantino's assassination was shot in the valley. 1 Where was the bullet out of the gun chamber? Well, he took it out of this movie! I honestly believe that Tarantino was greatly influenced by this special film in some scenes of the Kil Bill Volume. 1. In creating the feature he mentioned that the entire scene with the Beatrix of the hospital and the Eli driver was coming to kill him by the Italian gaolos and my friends here are proof of this. Anyhows, references to Tarantino aside, this movie has some remarkable camera shots, flying through crowds in those opera houses, such as broken voodoo ... great things. And why Argentina is becoming my darling is one of the main reasons. <br /> <br /> Most cast performs were correct, but Cristina Marsillach was best known as the oppressed young opera singer Betty. Looks like the killers were doing great things in their eyes. The rest of the cast was a bit woody and hard, but nothing that would stop you from enjoying your movie. <br /> <br /> There was very little about this movie. The first closed argument is to throw out the window in the specific view. Especially those who witnessed the murder of Bettys involved in the post-mortem attack. I think that for the longest time, he just took his business, not telling anyone about the whole thing. Even the police do not. I mean that if you brutally kill a boy in front of your eyes ... you will not just move away from the murder scene and do not walk with your life. Someone could have been involved with the killers. She might even suspect herself ... but not. Also the end is a bit anti-climatic. You need to understand it, but the film seems to be somewhat unnecessary, it felt like it could end. It will not feel so ineffective. But about it, that was not a real problem for me because I was enjoying the rest of this beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> I'm still across much of Argentina ... but I devouring every step of the way I was eating a plate of the most expensive caviar. These guys are really good. I think her films as art works, and I just saw two! Wait to discover his remaining films. Argentina, you guys! <br /> <br /> Ratings: 52 to 41/2
