This episode is the best of the series so far. The story is completely called. I especially like how authors have made Desmond episodes; It was his best acting and he definitely claimed Emmy for his performance. <br /> <br /> Some of our questions were answered in these episodes, but since this program is called Lost, we know that there will be more questions too. The first answer: Walt was reunited with his father Michael, secondly, Michael's betrayal was open to Jack, Sauer, Kate and Harri, and because of this betrayal, Kate, Jack and Syair were captured by others. It was a great way to finish this event. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the island we break the mental breakdown with the lock button. This leads to another answer question about how the plane really went down. However, there are some inappropriate questions: First of all, what happened to Lask, Echo, and Desmond when Desmond became an incomplete key and what was the deal with scientists of the Arctic electromagnetic anonymology search. We will find out the next season, but the best show on TV will finally end.
