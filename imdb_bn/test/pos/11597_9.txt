If you go to movies, be happy, to fill your time, do not go out of your way to see this movie. <br /> <br /> If you appreciate the depth of the movie, then explore the role of personality, feelings of the human nature, if you go to the movies to absorb astronaut photography, make sure that you put this movie at your place very first in the list. Experience causes deeply rewarded, intelligent visitors to create different reactions on life's meaning. Alanandroo Amenbaar with 'Mera Adentro' has surpassed her previous date and even left some deviations in her previous movie, which reduced Hollywood's targets. This visual poem is not kept in music: Hollywood can not be anywhere near this disgusting inspiration - and the impact of human stories. <br /> <br /> <br /> As an apology for euthanasia; Based on the real life of Ramon Sampadro, this story is crying from the bottom of the heart for life and love, it is a feeling of understanding for human understanding. Sampdro was a clear and intelligent man, after a diving accident on the Gulf of Galway, a young man was condemned to live on the bed for the next 27 years. 'Condado A Vivir' (2001) (TV) is the first version of this human life that I already commented on. However, Amenabar has been remarkably successful in portraying this person, with his lasting humorous humorous humor and humorous feeling, as well as clear and intelligent way. <br /> <br /> and Jabir Burdhem were present on this occasion, meet with the challenge head, complete with a gallery accent, creating an electrifying, compulsory, provocative performance, so that actors and fishermen can become the same person on the screen as the same person. Here, in fact, an occasion for blaming your hat, and gradually drunk 'Chapau'. Bardem operates in a remarkable part of an extraordinary cast of specially, especially Belen Ruda, Lola Dunas, Mabel River, Sales Bugula (Los Angeles Al Sol) (Quivi) and Clara Segura, Galician and Catalan accents. <br /> <br /> The Amenabara created wonderful dialogue because these six combine with exclusive chemistry, or the parties, thus Chilean born Spanish director who knows what he is and how his results get; In his worldwide concept of film, he has his own music, pieces of Beethoven and Puccini in Sameddado's record-player. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> While watching 'Mar Adentro', I compared myself to a few times with Stephen Daldry and the film with his best composition 'The Hours' (QV). As the conversations work with sensitivity and emotions and work in every scene with caution, I say the same way. <br /> <br /> Javier Aguirosheb's photography is pretty cool as usual. Since I mentioned the IMDB elsewhere, it does not only film events and scenes - it also captures the feeling of the moment and the atmosphere, shows shiny eyes, light and shadows, as the story behind another camera is another story. A superb artist. <br /> <br /> Among the top five or six art works created in the last 25 years is another landmark 'Mar Adentro' in the history of Spanish film. This movie is based on the songs of 'El Tune' (QV), 'Los Santos Innocentes' (Quivi), 'El Abuelo' (QV), 'La Lanagua de las Mariposas' (Quivi), 'Las Rauts' Aman '(QV), and I think I must add the' Miss Ozos' (qv). <br /> <br /> A nicely arranged story about a man, and those who love him around his bedside: will not be missed.
