This is an excellent James Bond movie. Although it is not part of the original and more famous series, and it is an independent film, it's done very well. He made a brilliant genius to return to the famous role, as did the title of the movie in such a way that he mentioned his previous commitment to not to play Bond again. Connie was great as the presence of her previous 007. The script is outstanding, photography and performance as well. This is the first movie I remember with Kim Basing, who became even more famous after this film; Barbara Carey was excellent; And Claus Mariah was perfect as Brandon's original villain. The continuous reference to the increase in bonds and the changing times and attitudes of British secret services were the most ridiculous. 007 Gadgets are similar to other bond movies. The only thing missing was the famous 007 music theme, which, of course, can not be used by this competitive production. It was amazing to me that being able to see two wonderful James Bond movies released in the same year, one with Roger Moore and Octopussy. An interesting aspect of the movie is emphasis on video games and computer graphics. At the beginning of the 80's was the first day of such things, and their use in this movie made it a contemporary movie. The film is actually a different version of Thunderbolt, updated with new technology. Regardless of the theme, it has enough differences to make the most entertaining. I will watch this frequently.
