A man has been wrongfully accused of murdering his friend in a fire-fighting plant and has to cross the cross-country to avoid the police and discover the true nature of the situation. A plot line that was later used to burn Hitkou's classic northern Northwest, benefiting from some good performance in Sabotur, as well as some master's suspense order master. <br /> <br /> A bit of plot for any Hitkouk fan was very familiar, but he was always able to infuse stories with his own memorable supporting letters and charades. Here, the likes and impressive Robert Simmons lead and soon see themselves coming out in a strange and playful character, circus does not meet a group of actors, secretly with a rich businessman and a blinded dungeon, who show the best way to judge him. <br /> There is a little lack in this area for neutral fundamentality and quality, especially the opponents Desya. However, there are some excellent chemistry as comedians and blind women by her lead lady, much less acclaimed Priscilla Lane and along with true ongoing performance, Vaughn Glaser. The best part is the final sequence, which reflects the use of Hittkk by the northwest north of the north, only at Claymax's New York statue. Of course not his best, but Suspense Master gives us some great moments to wait.
