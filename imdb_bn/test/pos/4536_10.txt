This is one of my favorite comedy movies. Chris Farley is an accidental accident and is as pleasing as David Spad, Farrell is acting straight man. <br /> <br /> The confusion between them is brilliant. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
