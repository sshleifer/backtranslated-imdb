In fact, first, I saw this movie because I have heard that I heard free sex scenes, but actually seeing this movie, I realized that there are still good and intelligent movies there. Really, it's one of the best-designed and sensitive movies I've ever seen. I talked to a teen about both bisexual and about my predictions - sex, religion, love, acceptance etc. It gave me an idea to deal with these problems with the help of others around me and others. Who am i for Cox's Bazaar really handles the movie with dozens of heart-warming lines and a few springs of sex. This made the movie more interesting. Some people compare it to Brokeback Mountain but I do not agree with myself. Lockerback Mountains are more dramatic and the lotter days are balanced.
