I was very impressed with this movie, if there is nothing more than comedy. This is not always a supernatural, wonderful comic, but I think it is appropriate for every scene. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/ Sometimes, we're watching a small slapstick and rolling around a decisive speech on the relationship of other scenes. It may be a bit frustrating for some viewers, but it brings me closer to the discrepancies between the characters of irregular chaos. <br /> <br /> acting is great from everyone. I'm a huge Andy Ritter fan, but I did not have the head on the heels for his part that looks like another. He did very well, but Julian Nicholson and Lorraine Graham steal thieves for them in both of them. J. Moher acted as expected, if you have seen him in other movies. I always liked him. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is very interesting and provides some nice grounds for some kind of relationship. Some films try to surprise when it comes to relationship problems and problems. There is nothing surprising about the decisions given here, but it is entertaining for them to be published throughout the film.
