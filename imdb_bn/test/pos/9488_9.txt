Before this DVD, I found that the only footage of the Zeppelin film since 1976 is the song "The song reinitions the sem". We used to spend time looking at these friends for a few hours, but I never liked it and hated imaginative shades. <br /> <br /> So what is this DVD? I do not know it existed before browsing the physical graffiti CD ... 'When did it come out?' I think <br/> <br /> <br /> For some reason I thought the page was not a great live guitarist, but seeing this DVD, I think that my opinion has changed. <br /> <br /> The "White Summer" guitar wizard is from 1970 to 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is an acoustic set since 1975 - 'Bron-e-Or Stump' has a brilliant finger - choose Impov category. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Demonic resources of raw people !! <br /> <br /> The magician Kebberte continued to pursue 1979. The presentation of 'Achillies Last Stand', considering their various narcotics-state only the beggar believes! A song on the complex gitar overdoses, the page is arranged in such a way that it only lets him 'pank et out' - the effect is completely submissive. 'Evening' - I did not like it on disk, but it hangs around here. 'Sick again' - great piece of puzzle-rock. The footprint of the Cabaret is very interesting, big screen, various roastmum and cutting effects in bootleg footage. <br /> <br /> The plant across all acting is amazing. Although the page is painfully thin, the six-year-old child seems to be the most interesting thing in her life at the concert - and looks contagious. <br /> <br /> One thing that confused me - 'Black dogs' performance camps since 1973! Robert Plant is always a small 'mince' and those jeans are absolutely ridiculous - and nowadays shipping will be arrested. A different $$$ studio version from muscle-locked kicks <br /> <br /> I like this DVD. It reminds me of how good Zeppelin was.
