Najrin, by the acclaimed supernatural Bunule, is an attack on the Catholic Church and its prized losses. This is not a visual film and I think it played well at the stage. Bunuel takes us through this man, living as a living Christ, Najrin lived; What comes after the actual followers, such as in poverty, and property care the next day. Some may call it parallel to the story of Christ, but a follower and practitioner of the word, life should certainly be like Christ. But basuell also wanted to know about human selfishness and the need for sin and how godliness can save us all. This is a bold statement that can illumine something, or send the film to memory. True, Nasrin should also be called selfish because she asks for or without asking for her return. His selfishness represents the side of his folly and the two female coins of his followers; On the side of each side. Many people represent the currency aspects in this movie, both of which are similar to face. But the movie is not entirely memorable after the end and most of its moral disguises and effects can be influenced by the movie's own ideas. Does not take the top of Bunyuel, but the continuation of a "miracle" dream, which shows you the power of the director Bunuil, in Bunyel level where the message of the movie is made and valuable to it.
