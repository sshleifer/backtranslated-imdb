Latter day is a very, very independent movie. And it is lacking in many parts of today's many modern films. At the time of shooting sounds quite amateur, the dialogue may be a bit cut-off and the letters are not impressive complex. So, there is not much hope for this movie because I said it is very independent. But whatever in the concrete aspects of the film can be ignored due to the story's comedy! I can not claim that this plot is an extraordinary origin, but the story is still very beautiful and hearty! It's not going straight to gay vs, it's about faith, and how you decided to run your own life! This is a silly story, which you both cry and want to laugh at the same time! To be so honest, Latter Days is far from perfect, but I really liked the movie and I highly recommend it! This is very critical and homosexuality for the religious aspects of our society - but contact the open mind, and I am sure that most of the people will enjoy it like that!
