This image is a brilliant retelling of Shakespeare's classic love story that is complete with "strange sex, body piercing and separation". It followed the same spirit as other trompo করেas [except the combet shock ... the drying that was depressing] but it is not only for trauma fans. Anyone who admits combo-visual and a hilarious script will fall in love with this movie. <br /> <br /> Shahbag, artistic, like R & J version with Claire Danes and Leo de Caprioos - this one knows his silly movie and that draws his humor. Acting is also wonderful, and you can only feel the pain of Sami Kapullet because he tries to get his brain back on his head. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack, which has many original and high power bands like Wesley, Willis Fayasco, Supernova and The Metman also have four stars. This film should be seen by everyone, because it remains faithful for the original story, though it is still trampling trademarks / sex-jam-packed with laughter.
