- Facts (i): "Mat Adentro" is a well known (at least Spanish) story about the Galician quadruple known as Ramon Sampedro, who killed himself after 28 years of sijdah (helped some friends). The judges denied the request for his active request several times. <br /> <br /> - Event (2): "Mard Adentro" has become the year's film of Spain. Everyone talks about it: politicians, singers, ordinary people ... everyone likes it, even critics' opinion is unanimously. The film won many awards (Golden Globe, Oscar, Goa ...) and annoyed the quaternary of Catholic communities and life lovers. A star was born. Factus (third): The intensity and quality of "Mar Adentro" actors are amazing, and it makes me wonder that we should see the same bad Spanish latest movies Most young actors Javier Bardem is a great actor or a great imitator (I do not know whether there is any difference between things or others); However, his job is just impressive, Lola DuPanus, Belen Ruidas, or all guest starring work. This is the strong point of Amarnar movie (acting actor) <br /> <br /> - Subjects (Fourth): Alejandro learned his text in Amenabar's school, which is doubtless: he got a special brain. He takes good control of every technical aspect, he knows what the audience wants, how he will touch the right character, even if it turns him into such a barbarian (even like Spieberg - one of Amner's statues). <br /> <br /> - Factus (and V): If you criticize a movie like "Mar Adentro", then it seems that you have a problem with moral problems. There is a trap in this type of picture: You must distinguish between film and moral connotations. If you do not like "Schindler's list", it does not mean that you agree with Hitler's philosophy (or you?). So, for me, this is a good film and an extraordinary story (this is a real story that makes it more remarkable). Everything glorified, self-like, and neutral (no matter what Amnabar or Bardham says about it: those letters are not favorable on euthanasia, all the good things come !!). 50% hard / 50% way too sensitive. <br /> <br /> - Appilago: "Mar Adentro" has no meaning for the best ranking of the top 50 Spanish films ever. There is no special feature in the story but Ramon Samadoro himself. He's in the movie. Now, Amandora will become more international Spanish director, maybe he will go to live in Hollywood; But some of us would like to draw him a simple story, without the final twists of the bits, dead dead or living alive ... "Others" are still his best movie. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
