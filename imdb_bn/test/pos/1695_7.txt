"Landscape After War" opened with escaping the prisoners on a snowy field open - rather than the funny movement Vivaldis along with four seasons. Opening a touch. But we soon learn enough to know these prisoners as people, and when they (people who do interesting acts) crush the living, the protagonist stops at one point, but soon the more involved in finding books from unarmed camps than taking care of his neighbor Is. <br /> <br /> The rest of the picture is placed in the American camp, where the prisoners are not released, no semi-freedom, half-camp A perfect set for research on war criminals, American camps, Polish nationalism, Catholicism, sorrow and human suffering. <br /> <br /> The movie is an important turnaround. The woman comes in, and changes the light, color and mood of the film with them. At the same time it was seen that these detainees were slaves in Holocaust. I think a major underlying political theme of the film must be given under the wars of the world and after the treatment of mankind, Nazi separatism, but mankind should do this - and even strengthen them from Europe after the war. At a psychological level, the film has problems of sadness and sadness, how the environment makes hard work harder and how difficult it can be to express regret for people with different experiences. <br /> <br /> But the image is based on intrigue, humor, taunts and casual beauty carpets. A gypsy prisoner played dramatically on a musical instrument a few times during the film, a mental tone ruthlessly rejected by silly (cinematically commented). This example highlights the film's style and an important element of the theme. When it comes to humor, how the character decreases continuously and finds its glasses, crowds, heap stacks and so on. <br /> <br /> It is not difficult to understand the respect of Spielberg's wizard when you see this movie. Great treatment of light can be compared to its superiority with Spenberg. Grunwald intermezzo speaks for itself. Nargisili, it only brings the film from the camp, but filmmaking brings with it the beauty of the film and its eternal beauty. However, another view I can not let go without comment. It's a Christian feast Undoubtedly ironic, but simultaneously religiously, we see transcostration moment, everyone kneels down, when the priest is protected from isolation to serve as a dramatic altar boy. His bells are mocking the scene, but it gives passion and love. When Nina gets her bread, the sun's light is her and the hourly ring is spherical, it is the highest moment of the film. <br /> <br /> The main actors are excellent in their roles. Olbricksky as the perfect Wajda hero - unable to keep the mind in mind, his mind and all aspects of emotion in life. Beautiful Selinska is acting with a character unable to express her body performance in her proud movements. <br /> <br /> Those who try to describe everything often do not think anything. Wajda handles it. His films are very moving, deep or beautiful shots, but focus on the specialty of life and society. For one moment the joy of one moment, the moment of ridicule for one second, the sad moment for the third, nothing for the fourth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wajdas Films of this period. The first profound political impact is an extraordinary expression of expression. This country was the first to overthrow Communism twenty years later. The second is a cinematographic and descriptive language that is glorified in Castro.
