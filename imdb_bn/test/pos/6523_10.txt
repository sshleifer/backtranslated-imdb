"Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Island!" A sunny show that is on Saturday morning on WB. It highlights coconut Fred and all his friends on the island, and each episode is very funny for them. Most of the time, it makes the problem of coconut Fred antonics, which makes it fun, and at the same time other things on the island are also going on. Humor is very great and no one is very bright on the island, it is adding it as fun. I do not think this could be funnier. The character's genius of character is nicely superior and hugely, which adds joy to the show. If it is on DVD then I'm getting it ASHP <br /> <br /> Strongly recommended for a good smile.
