I'll watch this film 4 or 5 times a year, and much more, Hollyweird moguls now seems like it is suitable for DVD, because it's classic with a capital "C"! This film is ruthless! How can people today pay $ 10.00 to see the June from Holi Wired with movies like Egypt; Ten Commandments; Ben Hur; Captain Newman MD! DVD; And cable movie channels; I could go forever, but this picture is so big, and for a relative unknown, Edmund Purdum carries a world-like film that carries the world and carries the world. The story is amazing, the first rate of acting, and the graphics at the end is so powerful, you sit in your seat for a few minutes, just try to sink the sound! Really a film a knockout If I give these 15 stars they will give me! They do not make them like this, but they should !!!!!
