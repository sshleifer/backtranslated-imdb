Overcoming the Bridge: Istanbul's term received the most rude worship from the audience and it ended. I have not anticipated too much from a musical documentary but the movie proved much more than that. It was also a visible documentary of Istanbul's old and new, western and eastern, poor and rich, modern and traditional contrasting contrasts. The world's famous Armenian photographer Aara Guler's old and new Black and White photos were exceptions. But certainly the main theme was music, and by God, it's different! It was similar to the Buenos Aires Social Club; Interview Love and Honor - Anxar Hack Replaces Ray Cudders Here - to get the singers out of the screen and bring all of us together. The music was mostly very interesting. The jazz session was a leak in a small West Turkish city by a group of Romani Gypsy. After the release of the film, I would not be surprised if the train agents started receiving group booking requests for the case. But I love Mujien's army, who saw a striking elegant beauty, and his "Rakki" boldly declared: "My voice and I'm 86 years old!" Good faith Akin completed I bet many other guards who are feeling left left: Please go for Volume II.
