I enjoyed this for a few reasons. Sometimes confusing and defectively solved, but combining the newsreel footage with the story of the film was often compulsory. The other element I admired was VERUVALVAS, the fantastic Nazi, who fought after formal surrender. I do not know that other film that deals with them. For example, on December 1, 1945, they killed Achan's Burgomaster Oppenhof and created problems for the occupation. Then, the film confronts victory with some malicious reality and the sanitized version of the occupation. The "human problem" is not so much represented by letters here, but according to the historical reality, those who were captured by Hitler survived - both victorious and victorious.
