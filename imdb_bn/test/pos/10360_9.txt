I first saw it on January 1, 2009, and one day later I saw it again and I want to see it again. It's all about good (well, almost, so 9 stars). No color, beautiful naive stories, funny gangsters, brought, camera work, music. Well, sometimes you just want to listen a little more and the music just stops. But this is not a musical after all. I like acting Ana, gangster girl, how she talks, keeps a gun, everything smiles me. No, it's not funny, even though I'm a little laughing at some moment, it's very fine. Excellent job by Samuel Bencherit. Although the 3d novevels seem to be weak, they are gangsters, perhaps worse, because they steal the idea. And the last scene is my favorite. I feel very warm and romantic. Yes, I would recommend this movie as the taste of art-house movies for the romantic spirit. And I do not agree with those who compare it with P. Fing. It is not about action and fixed story, although all vintat intersects. It's cool, and probably very slow movie for most people. It's about letters, their feelings, very subtle. However, perhaps this review would not have much help to anyone (my first), but only wanted to express my gratitude. <br /> <br />: This movie does not have detective groups. Surprised, the abductors decided to go home, did not anyone see that part? Like a part of the crew, hehe. I know I posted this post well, but I do not agree with some policies here.
