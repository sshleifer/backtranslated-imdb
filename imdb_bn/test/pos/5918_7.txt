The biographical story of life in Charles Linberberg, the first person to fly exclusively across the Atlantic in 1927, his plane is located in St. Louis of Spirits. <br /> <br /> It was not among the best Billy Wilder movies, especially proud of some very impressive production value for a movie created 50 years ago. The story is well said and the performances are great but it is good. <br /> <br /> One specific limited factor on the story is that Lindberg was alone and without a radio, which meant that there was no one to talk to him. It has the need to speak in a variety of internal conversations such as an internal psychology, and sometimes a separate story in sleep, especially when talking to yourself once. Also to avoid the increased order of famous flight, it includes the procedural preparation for the flashback and flight of his life included. <br /> <br /> Charles Linberg was a great hero of his era, but his controversial beliefs made his inheritance a little upset. Despite this, he will continue to contribute to the aircraft and assisted WWII as a civilian aircraft consultant in US efforts. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart certainly had a flying background behind Leibnberger's painting. During World War II he was promoted to the post of Colonel in the US Air Force and reached Brigadier General in the post-war war.
