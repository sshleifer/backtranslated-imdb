I can not say this movie was sunny, but there was a smell on my face all the time. I like this dark kind of comedy; "Very bad thing", "8 heads of a Duffel bag" or "cold blurred" <br /> <br /> The main character is so much fun to see the way out of the assassination. It was not surprising to me that how it would end, but the way to end came. Another thing that sticks out, is the way they are engaged in the audience. Terry looked at us and said, you almost can assume you are his partner.
