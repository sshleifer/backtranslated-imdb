It's great! Everything from scores - when the role of final credits This is a masterpiece in the movie. It's really weird and its functional violent setting is enough to cripple anyone. It is visible that the film was not captured and there was a clear and brief picture of what David Seymolar (who would later work with Full Moon of the Puppy Master series) to point out to him. The film's professional viewpoint is surprising considering a relatively low budget. It depends on fear without impact (basically due to budget restrictions) but still creates an exciting environment. <br /> <br /> Stephen King said that this is one of his favorite movies and I can not blame him! It will be one of my favorite horror movies and always be. This is my favorite flowermoon movie and I bought it several years ago. <br /> <br /> Money Well Spants! I own both VHS and DVD versions <br /> <br /> 10/10
