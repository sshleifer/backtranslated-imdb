The gentle and genetic film seems to have been neglected as a triviality ... and justifying it is a little tiny and lightweight like the drama .... But I feel the simple wonder and scenery of the scenes that show the effect of an alien and suspicious society's new industry There is an illumination and naturalness which is a hundred percent of the film and the audience compared to the year's film Capturing long romance partner. Jared Harris's extraordinary sympathetic acting (who seems to be heir to all of his forefathers ... hopefully, Richard is not developed for hellishness and despair) .... And the costly off-the-cut cutting from the expensive Yu Zia combines to make it a real heartfelt. Radiant location photography (including a great glowingly beautiful view of the wall) and the effects of adding sensitivity to the film by Anne Hoo. For a short time nobody ever enchanted by flickering a shadow life ... and must make magic in the dark.
