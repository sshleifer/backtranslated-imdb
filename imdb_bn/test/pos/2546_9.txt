It's one of the things you see when you're watching it or it's a documentary or fiction. After the movie, Ramin Bahrani answers many questions and we know that there is a script in this movie. <br /> <br /> Baharani camera is silent, it is not the issue, he has often removed the director from the movie, not the background is organized to beautiful the pictures, but I am not wrong; There are a lot of preparations for this movie. It's being ignored when you ignore the movie, as part of the environment, starting at a personal level. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The main character is a 'real' actor in every sense. <br /> <br /> I want to thank all the crew for this movie, in our NYC, showing other countries. If you like the stories of others, I strongly recommend. <br /> <br /> Bora Kizil irm a
