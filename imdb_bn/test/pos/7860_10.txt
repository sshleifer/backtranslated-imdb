Director Don Siegel really influenced me about this image. It is firmly expected to expect the expected naturalness in any other film by almost hoping that the shot, graphic without visible graphic, acting well by all concerned, and working on the most banned topics of a day. I can not wait to see what it is: a civil war film for civil war for South civil war or something like 70's soft-core plugging with Eastwood. But not in fact they are men, women, women, women, women, children, women, women, children, women, women, A critics earlier mentioned that none of the characters - does not like the end of the movie - and yet everyone is interesting, complex and mysterious. Eastwood playing CPL. Young Pamelin Ferdin, a union soldier McBurney (as soon as you hear that voice you hear), a girl in the school led by Girlline Page, which was in civil war chaos - especially in the south. Soon, there are psychological / sexual relations from the page, teacher Elizabeth Hartman, lovely, young seductress Carroll, and even Ferdin (Emmy) Eastwood - each have their own needs and secrets and problems. Eastwood is not an excellent man. She always tried to get the sexual benefits of girls off each other. In the disclosure we get some real interesting things to reveal enthusiasm from hidden homosexuality. Beagle, for me, is a wonderful composition that has exceeded my expectations in front of many creative people. It may be (the best of Segel's films without physical masters attack). It is certainly one of Eastwood's best real performances. The page is always so nice and good at Hartman, Fe5rdin, etc. Gothic manse set for school is effectively clastrophobic. Sexually provocative scenes are some annoying. And what happened in Eastwood, it's a frustrating, weird, abstract movie competition.
