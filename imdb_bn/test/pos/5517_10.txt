I enjoyed the movie, and it is rather higher than working on some sophisticated material. I saw a preview screening image, and it was not destroyed by a stupid video box that was over. The performance was quite good, especially Andrew McCarthy's more mature roll. I also enjoyed the look of this movie, which has given it a mysterious, forbidden wind. I enjoyed some "twist" in the plot, and if the video boxes of other countries are not far away, do not want to be too far away! The script was at the top of most of the time, but I realized the fact that filmmakers are not afraid to challenge viewers with interesting and confusing questisons about the rolls of our world beliefs. And, some may end up in the end, but I'm very grateful that the film has humbly refused to push everything. How does life work?
