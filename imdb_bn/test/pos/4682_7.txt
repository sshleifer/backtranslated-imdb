My reaction to this "Italian job" repetition is that I saw it when I met the event of my life hopelessly; After 8 months of unemployment, I only saw one job after coming back to school for a recruitment and after returning to school. The money was still tight, but to watch a movie and pay bills (or lunch) in the theater, and at that time I feel that the feeling of relief and gratitude was huge. As a result, my "Italian job" experience probably was beyond the proportion of its actual value. However, I used it in DVDs a few weeks ago and saw it again, and I still enjoy it. I have never seen the real (although I have heard it is a complete classic), but your modern day opponent can taste the old film plots and themes for modern day production prices. <br /> <br /> What I primarily won in this movie is Soundtrack - IMO Don Davis wrote most of the spiral, textured and cozy delightful soundtracks. IJ is open with a style, malicious, pulsating system that combines strings, guitar harmonics, brushing and quiet moments - it won me the first time as a whole. And the whole movie is like this - I could not hear the sound of such listening, witching, soundtrack music because Stuart Copeland left the police and soundtracks for movies like "Rumble Fish". Here there are at least dozens of impromptu motif motifs along with some pop music remixes from "right" to "inspired". For those who soundtrack is important, this movie is a pleasure. <br /> <br />: I can go to Mark Wahlberg or leave, but he is right here as a leading person and the film is not asking him to do something that he can not do well. He is the weakest "main" actor in the film, but the reason is that the rest supporting cast is so strong, especially Donald Sutherland in some parts. Moses Def, Jason Stadham, Ed Norton, Seth Green, and Charlize Theron all turn into solid, lean performances. Norton mostly seems to be talking on the phone in it (rumors that he really does not want to be in the film), but he has 1/2 energy even a natural. "Wrench" is an impressive characteristic of casting and acting, which seems to be a male model by pretending to be an actor. His part seems to be adorned in the movie, and the rest is his small chemistry with cast (although you can blame a bit on the part of the letter and in the nature of the character "late walk"). If I was dizzy, then I would be surprised, the actor who played such a role in the film? No, it will never happen ... <br /> <br /> Production prices, camera work, stents, plots ... everything cooks pretty well and Gray and its production crew drag together a bit together (without exception " Wrench "character, see above). <br /> <br /> There is a nice, light touch in the dialogue that will reward your grace, along with the way there are many satisfying big and small plot salaries. (My favorite moments - when Norton's character tells the character of Wahlberg that he has just lost the wonderful stuff, Wahlberg goes straight to the cold dog Norton with the right cross and then asks him, "Are you surprised?" Hmmm, you probably have to be. br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A safe water cracking, or through a laptop The potential to be able to hack and manipulate the traffic successfully), you will get a fun journey. <br /> <br /> "Italian job": It's a lightweight summer fluff, but it's great for it, and it does not try to do anything else. This is not good enough for an "8" but I want to give it a "7.5"
