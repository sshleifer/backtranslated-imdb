Tino Valerie's "Il Prizio del Potre" Wu. "Power of price" is a fantastic and impressive spaghetti Western, which reflects Kennedy's assassination. A great leading performance by Giuliano Gemma and a wonderful score by Luis Bachlau are just two of the two reasons to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> In 1881, Texas wanted to abolish slavery and live only in peace, and those who still want to restore solidarity after 16 years. Despite the warning, President James Garfield, who wants to establish a new policy for equality policy, has decided to visit Dallas, where corrupt law enforcement officials are planning to kill him. Bill Oliver (Giuliano Gemma) and his two friends, Jack Donovan (Ray Shandars), a black man, and Nik (Manuel Jerzo), a crippled man, determined to resist the killing of the President. <br /> <br /> Since James Garfield was not murdered by racist, who wanted to restore the conflict in Texas, but mentally unstable Charles Gutter in Washington DC, the story of the "Price of Power" story, of course, is a historical abusive. Since this film does not claim to be historic accuracy, the 1963 Kennedy attempted to kill the carnage in Dallas, which is a fantasy. <br /> <br /> Zieliano Zuma's protagonist has done a wonderful job like Bill Willar, Benito Stefenelli is as great as the terrible and corrupt Sheriff Jefferson. Other good performances are Ray Shandar's black friend Jack, Warren Vanders, Arthur McDonald, President's Advisor and Fernando Ray. Luis Enriquez Baclov's score is great, cinematography and places are great and (like Valerie's "angry day") reminds Sergio Leone, for which Valerie worked as an assistant director of "Off Fish Off" and "a few dollars "<br /> <br /> Everybody said," El Príjo Del Potre "," Day of Rage ", another fantastic spaghetti Western, which is directed by Sébez Gialionano shows the wonderful talent of James and Tino Valeri both directors. "Prices for Western fans" must definitely be seen and I also recommend each other.
