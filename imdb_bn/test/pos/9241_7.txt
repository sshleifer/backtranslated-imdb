Everybody can see this documentary after being surprised that any film can be made in a budget. Everyone's determination in this project was very simple to me, and we should contact them who have ever participated in any part of the show business, like movies, music or writing. I think filmmakers can undo an event that probably led the film to be a documentary through a narrator. Nonetheless, the film comes as a real example of "business" rather than "show". <br /> <br /> I hope the project "Reppo Man II" for the purpose, can see the light of the day. I think filmmakers have done the best thing to do with them and it did a good job with everything to accomplish.
