About this perfect cinematic Renaissance Roberta (Bobby), Phyllis, and Peter and their mother's life of Edith Nasbet's novels, their father is unfairly accused of sedition and sent to jail. They live near a railway line and live in a non-resident house? Mom wrote stories to make enough money for food and candles, although children spend most of their time around the railway station and in particular, 'Send love to their father' on a particular train. Always involved in an engaging and clever novel, the characters here are brought to life under the perceptual aspect of Lienel Jefferies (known as good character actor). Jenny played Bobby Bobby, Sally Thompset and Gary Warren, her sister and brother. Their mother Dinah Sheridan and other memorable characters are run by Bernard Cribbins (Rail Station people) and William Marvin (old gentleman of the train). <br /> <br /> 'Railway kids are gentle' Entertainment from other age, but they work beautifully. When we grow up with Bobby's unhappy parental concern against our need to live alone and have fun, then we can be happy to see the events happening together with the closure. Have a sense of our time and space ?? It is from steam train, behind the university paper or through red red flannlett peticotate (and used to prevent disasters!) By girls.
