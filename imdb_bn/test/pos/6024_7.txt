I own this movie and I like Canadian movies but do not hire actresses like Rose. This movie is completely useless. This is only a name that is left. The rest of the cast is good, this little adventure is good enough to do. The plot I used was not the first time. But those who acted very well with unknown actors Jerez, I'm not his big fan but I love him in this film. If you get the chance, see it for it.
