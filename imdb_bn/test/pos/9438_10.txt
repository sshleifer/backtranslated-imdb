I would like to say that I'm the only creator of this movie and his sister, The Entrador (which is operated by the wonderful stylist studioist Outerie Jopi Bernama), hopefully only they can expect how much they have arranged for me and my friends in the Northeast city of Jerro <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the first initial credit sequence, a motorcycle with a crash in a window Beo, so that drag a little, malicious destruction of silence lab, films and clothing designs in the history of the boring and monotonous, which exposed the role of bad boy Jean Paul gautiyara ota and find garisa. Make no mistake; This is a really unique experience. Early Highlights - An explosion (Use it, much more from where it came from!) Our drunken rhythmic ties and in the living memory follow the most ridiculous line of reading the word "dad". And then ... the theme song ... <br /> <br /> Yes, it's worth your paragraph. Written by Aung, who should really remain anonymous, it makes writing for the words like Rocky Film Schubert. It's 80 heroic motivation atrocities which is always higher, such as "its only you and you, it descends under the wire" and with lots of conversations about "crossing the line" (this time understanding - our hero Fida deals little for the border of the police work) Too much Do not congratulate the Indonesian superfine, the film's title is impressive. At this moment there is no pulse for anyone who wants to switch officially. <br /> <br /> Our hero, the Semitic police, Peter Goldson (superfunded by Starter Peter O'Brien), titled "Stable" Draws attention to the clash of people in a shop in China's shop, and deliberately left much less than his unclear secret work, but he did not get any questionable instructions through the streets of Jakarta, local city of Captain Jane, in the local question-breaking ball connection, as well as Peter Fashion Partner Spread Partner Waste Creative C Ebhiya Nash, who worked a little. Highlights, so little time - "Slow Please" is not a very strong case against Peter's arrogant, chief badge Greg Rainmaker (the infidelity fans fierce frustrated Criste Gigin, the shocking John White - Halloween name, Ah? No ... good ...), X-spot locations The map identifies stupidity, our hero is one of the vulnerabilities of his heroine Tina Probate's terrible advantage Rahana, and the latter is a particularly interesting dance man dressed like Sting into operation. The army <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> or turning up a funeral equipped with an extra at our hero Boogie Knights. Or a little strange crazy among Captain Johnny and Gouldson - two people did not create more heavy weather than friends in these clothes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Inexplicable and gross listlessness Oh and shoes people - look for shoes!
