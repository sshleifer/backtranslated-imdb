When I was young, I actually saw the last part of this movie. Thanks to the search feature of Plots I was able to find its name. For years I did not know the name, but the movie got stuck in my mind. The last left hope is that the original character will eventually return to Earth. It was a shame to find it in a series. This movie reminds me of my journey in the sun's distance. Also known as Doppleganger. If you like this feature, then the other watches. It was made before the stranger, but shared the same plot. Is still different I just picked Ebay Off Stranger on VHS. They hope to create a DVD, but it is suspicious until the dollar goes out of DVD. A few pilot budget DVDs are made of it and are probably one of these.
