Get out of summer without leaving your family or friends school and meet new people. Or yet, this is your first time in which you are not a single person and the only person who can count you is from the camp. "Metables" packs a lot of comedy in this movie. In the camp, a discreet counselor (Bill Murray) who knows what time the boys and girls can have. Enter a child named Rudy (Chris Mckepse) who has no one to look for. He does not fit with anyone, only the tripper can make fun of him. The rest are crazy like trippers. Camp North is an average camp with an upper average group. Camp Mohak, on the other hand, is an elite camp running for their money. Basketball game, got the groove pants! And at the Olympia, Northstar Til takes revenge when they take out volunteers. And Marty (Harvey Atkin), if this poor soul does not try to get herself gear. A very, very funny comedy, and it's a big keeper I'll say. This movie shows that the camp can be fun, if you wanted to be! 5 stars!
