Often the Argentine's last "great" film is considered, this entry of Geelo Canon is better than the success of any Argentine film (though I still see "tears of mom"), but it is known as its latest "cool" film, it stretches a bit may be. <br /> <br /> The hallmark of all Argentine films - actually present, his sequences of his senses are his best (especially memorable in the "peephole" sequence), and the movie of Ronnie Taylor is outstanding (the fluorescent light is beautiful). <br /> <br /> - Described - which is hit and missed in all the Argentine films - not being here. Indeed, there is a strong sense of mystery and conspiracy, but the plot is basically a string of continuous killings that follows each other, resorts, without any real time to create full rights, does not leave any real time to solve the secret mystery. All this is the result of a climax that ... well ... anti-climatic, since the film did not invest enough interest in our real care. <br /> <br /> However, it is the only disciplined direction and beautiful imagery that raised Argentina due to the proposed. I would not recommend this as a starting point for Argentine films (but I would recommend "Deep Red" or "Suspiciar" for that), but if you enjoy them or even a goose, then this is a very good view of your repertoire.
