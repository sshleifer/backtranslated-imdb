Yes, it is one of the black action genres. The confusional mix of racist comedy and racial violence (sometimes reaching a series of pitch, even for a series of fans) is not the film's shadow of your park. Rudy Ray Moore's wonderful bits seem not quite funny, at least not like a white boy like me, but in the context of the cool. Better than its different seagull, "Human Tornado"
