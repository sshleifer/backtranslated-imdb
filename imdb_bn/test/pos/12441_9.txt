This suspect is not an extreme example of British humor, the Germans understand. In one of the greatest series of British film history (St.Trinance) film, one-on-one tactics in the film thrive heavily. In the story of bureaucratic inadequacy during the post-war trial, Frank Lander was able to handle the highest talent from all castes. This is probably the only movie that Margaret Rutherford meets in his match, in Alastair Sim, for the strong character (though he has still won). Joe's Grenfell (bless him) and Richard Watts both deserve a significant mention of Dieton's remarkable emphasis on the hard and hard upper lip pressures of both English etiquette. <br /> <br /> No Rutherford / SIM / Grenfell fan will be out of their collection. Absolutely awesome Why 9/10? Just 83mins long.
