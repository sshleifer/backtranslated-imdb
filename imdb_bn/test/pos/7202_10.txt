While admitting the first confession film, I admitted to sleeping in the film ... but it is easily fascinating! It's really fun and it's the first one mile to leave away. There are plenty of goggles and funny situations that make me laugh from the first minute of the movie and when I arrive at the car to come back home, I stop laughing. I repeat: This movie is spectacular ... Obelix is ​​really fun and Cleopatra is a real babe !!
