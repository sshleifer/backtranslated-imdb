The young man who raised you for ages? Have you just left her life? That woman is your mother Should you honor him, you should respect him, whether he is sick or good. But at that time, it can be growing. Especially when he becomes very tolerant. Oven (Danny Davito) had to deal with "Trow Mom freon the train". His mother (Ana Ramsey, 1929-88), the worst one. He is doing his best to be a writer, and he is grateful but everything is. He is called "Clamy Pop", a "larda $$", and "fat" and "fool" Her friend, Larry Denner (Billy Crystal), had problems with her own wife, her ex-wife. He is trying to ugly him. So what did the ove? Press on its overboard. What does she do? Get back to help, get rid of Mrs Lift! In the kitchen scene, I call Wayne as Larry, "Couscous patty". And Moma said, you have no cousin! And the voice shouted, 'You are telling me lies!' And with El Cabongs Larry Frying Pan. Then the interesting part comes when they try to kill the train and wax lift. That's wasted, and he kicks Larry off the train. Well, everything becomes normal, the former wife lives, but mother kicks the bucket on herself. Maybe he should have seen errors in his domineering ways. This is a fun movie, and Cast is great. A classic! 5 stars!
