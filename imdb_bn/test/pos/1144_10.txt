I saw this film at school and absolutely loved it. Based on a true story, it is a pretty fantastic composition in a film. Seriously, I can not find anything wrong with it. A specific plus is how it is pictured. In 1904 set in Morocco, the wind and the lion were particularly full of horses, like the classical Russian. Cinematography was faulty, the editing was crisp, the costumes were fantastic and were visually exciting. And I need to mention the music from Jerry Goldsmith, it was extraordinary. I have used this phrase very recently, but Golds Myth is not something my favorite movie composer. Here his score is so passionate and thrilling, it shows the true musical talent of the people, and with the secret of Goldsmith's legend, Rambo: First Blood, Patan and NIMH, there are the highest scores. <br /> <br /> This action is fun and screenplay intelligent and sophisticated. The direction is sensibly handled very well. The performances were very surprising, with Shan Connery, sometimes Charishas and Subvitti, great like the Great Raisuli, he prefaced almost the entire picture on his own. He is joined by a feisty Candice Bergen, an impressive John Houston and a captivating Brian Keith among his more a different performance. History is fairly accurate, maybe radioactive in some areas, but acting, music and visuals are so good that I care. 10/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
