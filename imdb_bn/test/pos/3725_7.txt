Luis Besson's first work is his first fay in science fiction, a genre which he will return with "fifth element" (1997) after 14 years. Even if this movie is strongly influenced by the Hollywood movie, it is still very enjoyable. In 1983, "Le Drenier's Combat" published its own method of science fiction. He takes a threadbare topic back and his effort is visible to make a stylish job. WideScreen and black and white shots, a disaster has destroyed almost all the world's population and we never know that this disaster and why people can not speak. Some are made of barbaric boards. Parallelly, a person (Pierre Jolivitt) is on his own and has reached an unrecognized Paris where he received a doctor (Jean-Buis). <br /> <br /> There is no noise in the work of the seedlings. The actions and actions of the characters show progress and through gestures. Although the starting point and the retreating of the movie are never seen, the film has never seen the frustration. It seems that people and doctors are trying to reproduce the gestures and actions associated with mankind before this disaster. The film opens with people having sex with an inflatable doll. Later, the doctor tries to talk to him through a machine and he is a painter in his spare time. These images appear from prehistoric times, it seems to be even more provocative. Following this argument, someone can claim that the bearded monster (Jean Reno) has created evil and eventually threatens efforts by humans and doctors to end a man. At the beginning of the film, Dieto is a bad gang <br /> <br /> The image that can express is undoubtedly frustrating, is not really the front and shows the way in the light of hope. Personally, the film could not be achieved without any music, only a person could hear through his cassette recorder. Lose Besan is good and still able to insert such films, he also received inspiration from Pierre Jolievt, who will leave a great job behind him: "Force Majeure" (1989), "Simple Montel" (1991), "My Petite Entriprip "(1999) or" Feelless Uniches "(2003).
