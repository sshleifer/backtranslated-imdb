A few days ago I watched the awesome "Sand and Fog of House" and I was fascinated by Ben Kingshal's outstanding performance in the lead role. I agreed to see "Ray" trying to understand how and why Ben Kingshen won the Best Lead Actor Oscars. After watching Jamie Fox in the role of Ray Charles, I agree with the academy: She was really worth the reward. I like Ray Charles, I'm not his fan, but it's amazing with the same thing as Jamie Fox. The film was fully supported by Jamie Fox, who was the partner of most shooting, and her movement on stage seemed to be seeing as if she was resurrected in Ray Charles With the story I saw an extended version of the DVD, very long but very nice, with many beautiful songs and scenes mainly showing a junky ray Charles. My biggest surprise was that Charles was addicted to Ray Charles and how he treated his family. Her childhood presentation was a boring part of the film through the shattered flashbacks. Not my vote. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "verdict"
