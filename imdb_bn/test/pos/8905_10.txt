Joining this movie was an excuse for exemption from what I had to do for my class, but it has become one of my best experiences in France. The film works fast to build multi-dimensional characters and it's a nice smooth story. The characters really had the voice of hope for you to read graphic novels and artistic talent exceeded my expectations. The music was interesting and comedy entertaining and light-hearted, almost a playful of nearly plain entertainment entertaining items. The film was grabbing attention, knowing and action packed at the same time. An amazing story spun expertly. I will show it to my French students.
