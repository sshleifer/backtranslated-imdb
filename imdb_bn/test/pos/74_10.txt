Darling Lily is fantastic! This is one of my favorite films! It certainly did not deserve poor reviews. Julie Andrews, playing the title role of Lily Smith (Schmidt) is the best part of the whole movie. He entered and spectacular! Julie Andrews is my most favorite actress and as far away as singer, I am most surprised by how surprising she is. This movie is just great ... (I'm going out of adjectives!), It's great, wonderful, amazing, fun, awesome romantic, sad, and just an all-time thriller and all thanks to Dame Julie Andrews! Her husband, director Black Edwards. Oh, yes Rock Hodson was very good :) <br /> <br /> Julie Andrews is beautiful and love singer Lily Smith. Rock Hudson depicts Major Larbi, who quickly falls for Lily and he is with her. But their case was not historic. There was a plan planned for the German government (I'm not sure exactly what you say, but you get points), because warm, happy, singer Lily is actually a German spy. Libby is asked to persuade Major Larabi to get information on the new Top Tech Secret Operation (later known as "Craig's Budget"). Even though Lily has done a perfect mission, she was in love with Bill (Major Larabi) for the realization, making her real challenge challenging. But after finding out Billy's true fact, Till the Lily pulls up and completes the AR task. It is amazingly layed up and will remain unsaid by me in the end. If anything, you will enjoy this movie thoroughly, I've done it !!!!!!!! <br /> <br />
