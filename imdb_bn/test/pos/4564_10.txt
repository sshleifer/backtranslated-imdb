To face it, folks - "DK3" is more challenging, innovative, and clever than its predecessor. Challenging - ridiculously difficult for a sufficient amount of its dimensions. Especially a difficult level is called "lightning lookout," which may be played by you at any time. Innovative - it's a lot open doors. Very bad SNES did not die long after this title. And the clever-level names are astonishing in the references to the trademark play-on-sound ("Lake Arangatanga") that the target audience of the game will not come for many years ("Blake's House"). <br /> <br> What concerns me about the criticism of most people in this game comes mainly from two words: Kiddy Kong He is the heir to DD Kong, the successor of "little friend", and certainly not as "the disabled monkey". "DK3" will be a classic until the end of time.
