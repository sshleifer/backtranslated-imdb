Based on the true story, Charlie Wilson War, a Texas Congressman and CIA agents working to protect the funds of the agency, to help Afghanistan's Mujahideen after Afghanistan's invasion of Afghanistan in 1980. This clash plays a major role in the final years of the Cold War between the United States and the USSR. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson War is a definitive winner for filmmaking. It's good writing, well played, and good shots. Although much of Tom Hans's attention was missed for another fine performance, I was more impressed than being celebrated as Philip Cemur Hoffman's CIA's director, Gast Awacakotes. The views of the Soviet attack affect the heart of the underdog and refugee camps. The film shows a good backwards towards the wheeling and congressional Wilson has to go for the protection of the preferred fund. <br /> <br /> I have two complaints. First, there is a theorem that involves a scandal investigation that is not better and it only acts as a minor damage to the story line. The second complaint is that the movie lacks the film in some context. The film looks like Mujahideen innocent victims, and when they are victims of large civilian casualties, Mujahideen actually used the rebels to overthrow the government of Afghanistan. This government completely disregarded the film, did not fight to suppress the rebellion surprisingly, then called on the Soviet Union to support their efforts. By ignoring the picture that the US helped Mujahidin before the Soviet collapse in Afghanistan. The film indicates the unexpected consequences of our secret work - as a result we still feel - but it seems that screenwriter Haroon Sorsin and director Mike Nicholls were willing to sacrifice some historical references to provide a unified report. (I do not know if George Cray did the same deal, not reading the book.) Despite the allegations, I was happy to see Charlie Wilson's fight and would recommend it. Even like Stephen Gaghan in Syrians, I liked a film that illustrated the complexity of the situation, but the audience was more well-versed with the comparison of Charlie Wilson's war than the ambiguities in Syria.
