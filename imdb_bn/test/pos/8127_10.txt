I was delighted to see this movie for the first time several years ago and whenever it will be broadcast anywhere (which happens sometime on European TV Television) I also feel the same thing, I moved, entertained and ultimately wanted there <br/> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Playing by Brendan, James Purefoy dashing, J They are all straight after so active. Throwing as the next letter is equally great to see the great story of Tom Hollander and Hugo Knitting for which the story alone, Simon Callow as the leader of the men's team, is sometimes becoming as wild as acting. But it is really difficult to pick some people here, because every character, Jennifer Ehle, Julie Graham and Harriet Walter have also performed very well. Even Kevin McKidd shows a little pale in comparison to his co-actors, but it benefits some of his low-quality character. The concept behind this movie is simple: sometimes black and not white, the categories are difficult and may not always be time-tested. <br /> <br /> Leo is identified as gay but ends up being a woman as well as turns out to be her teenager sweetheart and Brendan's long time girlfriend. Brendon is starting straight but gay learners can not be that bad just after being bisexual and can be more than just an option for him and gets. Darren and Jeremy (Hollander and Woven) are gay and loving and cinematic people even as far as Leo's female roommate, their love and fun uploads to the end of the movie. Comedy Bits (especially Tom Hollander, who is only sunny) are funny and point-to-point and emotions are trustworthy, confusing as they may occasionally read this summary. <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie is actually a positive idea. You are not gay, straight, bisexual or simply not sure, but this movie makes you feel that it is not right to be sure that it should not be confirmed and "make sure" it can also find something better! Sex is featured in this movie and there seems to be no problem in any of the main characters, except for other gay / live camps you are sometimes fed into other gay themed films. I can only perfectly agree with the film seating, which you think is certain in one day, when you feel that you are gay, straight, whatever, can be different on each other. I have never seen (what can be said?) Hesitation or maybe the absence of the segregation of sexual classification is being illustrated in such heartfelt and true lifestyles. <br /> <br /> This movie does not play on labels and stereootic assembly sex and depending on it, some movies, gay or direct movies go where they go. It goes on and on the assumption that after the well-known classification, sex can be and I think it is more than time for it and it is one of the first films to find postmodern themes! <br /> <br /> And for those who do not take care of others, Hack, this is a funny comedy that you can see with some popcorns on your Saturday evening. Try it! <br /> <br /> Love it!
