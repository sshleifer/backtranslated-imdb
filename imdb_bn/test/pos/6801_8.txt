"National Velvet" is a young English girl named Velvet Brown who dreams of her favorite horse entering the talented Grand National Horse Race Competition. The image follows her horse to follow the training of former jockey and her parents in support. <br /> <br /> "National Velvet" is a family movie that does not actually show a person with such ridicule as films. The film is indeed one that will appeal to the whole family, not just the attention-grabbers of young people. It even submitted five Oscar nominations, it was not a sign of a sudden shutdown for a general audience. <br /> <br /> Anna Ravevar actually won an Oscar for her performance in the role of Velvet's mother. She was really nice in the role but 12-year-old Elizabeth Taylor who stole the show. She displays a talent appearance and a talent beyond her years. Also, Oscar winner Donald Kris as the father of Velvet for the board, Mickey Rooney, former Jockey M Taylor and Angela Lansbury (among her first film roles) has played as a big sister of Velvet. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The editing of two Oscars of the film was protected for an interesting viewing experience. In addition, the film was nominated for its direction (Clarence Brown), cinematography and art direction. Ten-time Oscar-nominated candidate Herbert Stothart is notable, though it has become unnamed. Finally, "National Velvet" is a wonderful family film that deserves high ratings. I understand that the expectation of seeing a movie about a girl and her horse can not really excite some people but it is worth taking a chance.
