Already sent to one of Miyazaki's movies: For readers, he is still in the top form and has made another suitable experience. All right, do not have to read anymore. I have already guessed that most of the readers are older than these two plays, so I want to say that Pony is not such a family movie. Opportunity to feel the feeling of being a small child: You wanted to see it, discover the world, create your own rules and boast an enthusiastic enthusiasm for doing things for yourself for the first time. Poyo also stepped away from all the problems faced by movies of all ages. It is never too restrictive, all the characters have good real heart and credible problems. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < They are not easy minds, arrogant or naive, just curious, enthusiastic and learning the ways of the world. They are so easy to love, but easier to identify with. Many films consider the child from outside, since only one child can enter the search for an adult in the world. Ponyo brings everyone back to that world. In Piano, learn for the first time and choose for the most care, which values ​​the film with high honors. It seems to be worth remembering, again.
