Begittle I was one of Eastwood movies a few days ago, until I spin the DVD today. And from his open sepia-tinged shot to macabre climax I was completely enthralled. Many filmmakers have replaced these camera-work alternatives instead of special effects, quick editing and character-driven stories, but director Don Siegel knows how to make the most impact from this relatively simple plot and the characters are credible and compelling. <br /> < > This story is a woman on the edge of various pillars during the American Civil War Reveals concerns related to the school. The South-supported woman finds a deadly wounded union soldier (Clint Eastwood); She started nursing her again for her health, and she began to use sexually exploited women for her own end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For any film that actually happens in a location, it never lose sight of interest. Even an opportunity that can come back when long-abandoned, while the normal conditions are uncovered, the machinations of Eastwood; But girls and students fall into a dark street ... <br /> <br /> In the same year, it is a completely different style from the same director's dirty Harry, and yet they are equally impressive. Eastwood has played very well against his usual anti-hero film, but his character has some mysterious qualities. We have not learned a lot about him before his prison, and the audience is free to decide on his good films personality. Willene or Victim? Whatever you think, I can say that I enjoy it thoroughly.
