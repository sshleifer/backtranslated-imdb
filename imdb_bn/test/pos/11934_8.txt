I saw this movie a year and a half ago and I like it, I decided to get a DVD for my birthday last year. It has the right amount of suspicion, action and drama. This film is known as Prip School. Regis School and it is packed with rebellious children, among which one child William Tayper (San Austin) spent hard time adjusting due to the previous rejection of other schools because they could not control his rebel law and now regiments work more at school. Due to a rebellion school is taken by the terrorists on a random day, and the real reason is that the leader Luis Cali (Andrew Divph) has been sent to jail, and leader leader killed students, placed bombs, so to get his father back. <br /> <br /> As well as William Taper, his rebel friend at Regis School, especially Joey Tratata (Will Wheaton), in which this man is a resident of the boring past Mafia family and is being sent to O Regis School because of his hatred of his father. And now he should take these terrorists to school, so William, Joey and friends there must definitely be the terrorists' violent acts and dangers Strategies should be brought together to close. <br /> <br /> This film was really awesome and I believe that people should look more like this because when people think of a good hostage film they are "die hard" and even if they have to agree with them It should be recognized that the toy soldiers had a good thriller, my heart was frustrated because the students were my age and they took our school if they had to deal with terrorists like this Be afraid ... but overall this movie is really 112 minutes better your time and if I had a decision to rent or buy it ... I would buy it! I recommend it with a lot of hype! 8/10
