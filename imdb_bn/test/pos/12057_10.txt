So many times, Bollywood has tried to rebuild Hollywood's hits, only to produce total duds. Thankfully, Yash Chopra's interpretation "The Dinning With the Demi" is a very stylish and orderly film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When he realized that Jehu Sunny Deol was a fianc√© There, he does not stop anything to ensure that. <br /> <br /> This photo is happy to see each frame. Whether Shah Rukh is answering his trademark, "I love you, who ... k ... kya ... Kiran!" Or Sunny and Juhi (who make a perfect match) looks good muschi scenes, you do not seem to be going to eat you in disgust. <br /> <br /> Every song in the soundtrack is a lovely song, especially the magic spell and you're in front of Murray. I said, Juhi seems to be goddess in this film. Maybe Shahrukh may not be the best movie (which goes to Bazigar), but it is definitely one of his most shameless performances! Sunny okay. He has played the same role before, but he is good. <br /> <br /> Overall, Darr is g ... g ... g is great! ;)
