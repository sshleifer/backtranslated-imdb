Between two slater movies, this is even better and though it is rarely on Scandal's complexity list, but bloody fun. All men are goods or bad and women are all laughing and emotionally necessary, for example, daughter girl. It's bloody fun and the proceeds have always been the most fun movie pumps, you can not drink enough of that hat, purple yarn, gold chain and gym patai. The best bit where he has a harem around him "You are UN UNSTANAN BITCHES". Everything about him is bigger than life and it is memorable in Mauritius on the bright rain. Jim Brown also proves he's a private dick for all girls and again he kicks whitey ass in every direction. The car scene is so unrealistic that they survive, but O this movie. Definitely the best Blacks Flick and it crosses Shaft (1971). Even the first movie is quite good.
