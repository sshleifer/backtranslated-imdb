"Queen of the Damned" is one of the best vampire movies I have ever seen! The film was mystery, action, and gore. The combination of a great assertive attitude of the Queen and our star Rock Mood has been performed very well by Stuart Townsend, it creates an amazingly accomplished movie that can only make this combination. I always want to hire movies to give advice to my friends and family members and when they ask me if "the damned queen" is worthy, I tell them it's worth buying. This movie is definitely certain that all the horror film lovers must be in the house!
