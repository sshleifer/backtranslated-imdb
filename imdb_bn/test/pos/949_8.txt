Tobacco Anbar's "Tumbling Dale of Flesh" is a Japanese Shankar about three thrones who express sexual anger against women during sexual assault, torture and the filming of their horrific activities. Typically Japanese pornography, which causes excessive adulterous sexual violence and severe miscarriage. It is not possible to talk about any plot, only a lot of hard-core sex scenes (optically sensors) and plenty of blood. Special effects are very influential - The details of the Japanese porn actress hijacking have been shown.

"Psycho: The Sniff Reals" actually reminds me of "Guinea Pig: Flashes of Flesh and Blood", but it's not as memorable.
