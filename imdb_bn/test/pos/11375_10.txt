This image is a wonderful composition. It was delightful from beginning to end. The story of Paul Thomas Anderson, a writer about a pornographic star, has been told with style, grace, humor and even brutality. They are the performers and characters, with Mark Wahlberg leading the lead rate, which can prove himself a strong actor and carry a movie. Burt Reynolds probably played his best as a pornographic director who discovered Wassberg. The film starts from disco scene near the "Miami Vice" group of Dale Johnson, beginning in the beginning of the film, by the end of the 70s and early in the 80's. Most regular filmmakers will definitely compare this with PULP FICTION to watch this movie, but it is also more common with the films of Robert Othman and Martin Scorsese. Film style is a win The opening tracking shirt that launches the film is as captivating as the player and ABSOLUTE basics. Editing by Dylan Tichenor is simply extraordinary. I could not believe that the edit was not an Oscar nomination (Good Will Hunting was a well-edited movie?!). The best view of the film has to be one with reducing. I had butterflies in my stomach because the scene was incredibly intense. When I first saw the picture, my scene had the same reaction. Unfortunately, it can not have the same effect on TV in the theater with good stereo sound. It is a shame that many people did not see this movie during this dramatic run, because it is the best way to watch. Use of Android's widescreen will be damaged on TV (so get DVD or letterbox tape). It is amazing that Anderson makes all its appearance easy because it is only her second film. Music, set, costume, photography, offbeat characters, sex, violence, happiness and heartwarming are caught by a man who clearly expresses love for filmmaking.
