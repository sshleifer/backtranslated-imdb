Among the Korean films I saw only three people stuck with me. The first wonderful horror is a story of two sisters. Second and third - and now fourth - all have been sympathy for Park Chan Uk's movies, such as Oldboy, Lady Vengeance), and now thirst. <br /> <br /> Park Park reminds me of the Conventin Tarantino with its helplessness to the Convention. All his movies are frustrating, but not in an intuitive sense. It shows us what we do not expect to see - usually in situations that are fundamentally against morality of society, such as turmoil or freedom fighter, bloodless, still devoted priest. He is very artistic-spontaneous about cinematography, and in his movies I saw that in more fantastic. <br /> <br /> That the thirsty is said - the priest said and suppressed, the lesser of the conscience he read for and much more. It disarms its viewers in horror, drama and even comedy, many inappropriate but humorous situations in the park. In this way, it could still be his best work for me, since I saw two other films in them, there was a lack of humor material, which would make them more attractive for the recurring philosophy.
