Until I saw this picture, "Life is beautiful" was my favorite movie all the time. This image will be a great film in everything. Great script, unfinished acting and direction that does not come forward to sensitivity, does not rebuke it and leaves it without its emotional impact. This film has a taste that can not come from Hollywood and there is a lack of prints from France. When I see the handmade films logo I come to expect even a wonderful movie on top of the caliber. There is no need to include everything in this post on why everyone on this planet will see this movie.
