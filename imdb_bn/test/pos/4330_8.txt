This is probably the second best of the Death Wish films. Death Wish 5 is the best. <br /> <br /> Death Wish 3 reminds me of a new turn of "West Side Story". Even the latest flick "New York gang" can not even be measured with the surrounding areas of David Weiss 3's New York, which is damaged by two rival gangs - but a big gang. A gang that violates his dog, wants to spend at the death of a person. <br /> <br /> Dabora Rafin, who plays a public defender, plays quietly in this action-packed movie. Many shoot-ups are filled with violence So in the second death of Death Wish, like Gary Nicholls, Death Wish III scores with her gentle, romantic moments as well as her violent moments. Only James Bond will make love scenes better. <br /> <br /> and along with its 38, Cursee Wilde plays with this new gun .475 Magnum. Kalhan was named Magnum Force, suddenly Impact and his 44 in Wentley Harry. When I used Magnum, I was reminded of the movies of the Wendy Harry. Wildi gun packs a big punch and when the crew is killed with him, he does not care whether it is a big kick in the gun. <br /> <br /> And the antitank missiles that kill the main gang leader? Well, that's something Curcy will not use an antitank missile as his regular warning weapon ... that is very military for him.
