What to say about a movie like Rock Star? Actually a lot! This movie type is almost the same for critics' slam. It's a movie I've enjoyed, such as a Hard Hard Rock fan- there was not really any love- although he was consciously aware of many of his mistakes, and although the movie was a good effort in some cases it missed the opportunity to escape into greatness and a rock The movie becomes classic. Oh well .... <br /> <br /> I like this movie - and I want to see it again - but I know that it is entirely based on my own personal taste - Rock Star is a movie that anyone would appeal to Have rock or hard rock lifestyle lifestyle experience and nostalgia wants to go down the road. It was a great time for metal heads. And effectively, there is a movie that effectively affects (which many have ever forgotten the non-rock fans). It seems to me that Rock Star did. One of the film's strengths, the concert footage. Do you feel like your right with them and how could you not love any hard rock fan? The atmosphere gets 10 10 as the Rock Star set-up. It gets 10 for 10 pure entertainment. If you want a movie then leave yourself and go to the free flow of past few memories, then it's a movie for you. That's why I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> But this is not a great movie. I was able to understand it and it was my actual job to review the film professionally, maybe I'd like to have some difficulty for it. Rock Star's development character develops. <br /> <br /> What is wrong with the development of the character, it is not there. None. There are some scenes in the film - few and far away, but they are there - which can be seen in the greatness: Warning spinner spinner: 3 Example: 1) When he makes his debut at the Easy Stage (with his collapse). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Is done) sets the stage for the full "business as usual" tone coming. It played very effectively. <br /> <br /> But the problem is, nothing comes up. There is nothing in the development of any character in this movie, people's personality is touched only but it is not fully searched. I do not think the actors / actors' faults, especially Aniston who tries hard, do not get too much to work with them. It was just the weak of the script and the ability to overcome the "formula" was lacking in the true depth of the movie. The rock star was so sugar-based (including the last side) it was almost ridiculous. And although, the scenes I mentioned were outstanding and very credible, there was nothing sad in the movie. <br /> <br /> Another critic mentioned lack of build-up in the end and I lacked the buildup about anything I agreed. Why did Izzy leave at last? Because he misses his girlfriend and the band does not allow him to write songs? It checks the limits of credibility. And, eventually the end was just corny. <br/> <br /> <br /> It's almost like watching movies, where its producers said: OK, it happened here and then it happened and this Etc. etc. Etc. In the end, it is not a movie movie that has made the dream come true, it's just another dense formative love story. <br /> <br /> I hope I'm not working hard on Rock Star because I really like it - but not for the right reason. I like to like this as a great movie about rock fame high and low. Instead, I like it for the 80's, clothes, hair, lamp, life .... Although many people like it, I suspect most people have lived on a rock fan, as I did or some who play it. I liked watching the movie cross and want to be respected instead of just a nice, good movie instead of a cliche. I think, there was a length of problem. I hate myself in a long film, but it was something that should have been for a long time, if a movie is really correct, the length does not even feel - much more than a story smaller than that - that is why the story of the people in the film or a lot of people Development does not seem to happen <br /> <br /> So decreasing the wind - it's a movie that you can get in a lot - but not a great movie. See it for fun. See it for entertainment. Look back to that great, when the metal was not just part of life, it was a huge place, it was life- and for those non-rock fans - see this for a brief look into a life that is meant to mean and still mean so much of us .
