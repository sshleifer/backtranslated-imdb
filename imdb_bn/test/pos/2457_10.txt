This movie is strong. I saw this movie at 3:00 and I asked to work at 6:00, saying that I'm late for work. I could not get myself up to get up to bed to work. The most powerful movie that it has seen in a long time. And that caused me to cry and felt the pain of the family. I think Emilo did a great job of managing this film. I agree with the previous comments from other comments that this is the only movie I have seen that brought the battlefield and showed how to go to a family, how a gentleman has left. It is heartening to think that people think again that you can come home from life-changing experience and be the same person before you leave. Cathy Betts reminded me of my mother. I believe he really shows how women felt and then played again. I'm surprised that this picture is not for more rewards.
