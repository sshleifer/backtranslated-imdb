For us, an Abbott and Costello film that you have to be in the mood. I'm very happy I recorded this - my wife thought it was young, but I have not seen it. The family wanted to see something very serious before the bed and this was selected. <br /> <br /> Our daughter saw many old movies with us - always complained at the beginning, but it is often getting closer. He mostly ignored it at the beginning, liked to check his email, but he started enjoying himself - smiled and laughing many times smiling. <br /> <br /> It may seem like a nice evening. 55yr old. The role of mono-color that mixes in full-length alphabets. This is a fun collection of a story that everyone knows, it has a small song and a little dance, which you expect as Lou and Bud delivery. <br /> <br /> See it with your children and a very fun evening!
