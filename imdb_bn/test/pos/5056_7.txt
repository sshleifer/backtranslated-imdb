Most of the time, Almodovar and less interesting than many of his later works in his own way. And why is that? There is nothing to be excited or embarrassed, and I guess that such effects are deliberately more than deliberate. No, extraordinary humor arises from an inherent, almost miraculous, curiosity that is sown in the scene: almost complete lack of banned characters. This is similar to 'Comic Suspense' which is available in its next work, although you can find it here in more rough versions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, find this movie pleasurable. I do.
