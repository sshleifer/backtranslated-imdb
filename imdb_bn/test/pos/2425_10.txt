Many of these films require patience. Because it focuses on the development of mood and character, this plot is very easy and the scene of the same scene in the Austen (character of Sandy Dennis) apartment in France. But the film made a boring climax. <br /> <br /> Characters create an atmosphere of sexual tension and emotional tactics. It is very interesting considering Robert Oatman considering the style and structure of his other films. Still, the trademark Altman audio style is clear here and there. I think this film really works brilliantly by Sandy Dennis. It must be one of its darkest characters, but it is so completely and firmly screwed that it is scary. Michael Barnes works as a "silent" young man. Regular almanac player Michael Murphy has a small part. Seriously, Moody's set fits the content of a very good story. In short, this movie is a strong study of loneliness, sexual abuse, and despair. Be patient, consume the atmosphere, and pay attention to the wonderful written script. <br /> <br /> I appreciate Robert Oitman. This is one of many of her films on the amazing, interesting topic. This image is annoying, but it is sincere and sure to release a strong emotional response from the audience. If you want to see an unusual movie - some may say weird - it's time-consuming. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find in the video stores. You may have to buy it off the internet.
