Ben (a fine Charles Bateman), who is his younger daughter (A trick) and his new girlfriend Nicky (very interesting Ahna Capri) Who On its way to the birthday party. They unexpectedly go astray in remote southern cities, where no one can leave, and Ben, K. T. And without the exception of Nikki, none can come in. At the top, the children are invisible and adults are being killed at dangerous rates. Ben helps locals - Sheriff Pete (LK Jones), Toby (Alvy Moore), and Jack (Charles Robinson), local pastors, try to solve the mystery. <br /> <br /> This 70's devil-themed horror film actually expects "The Exorcist" and adds "Blood Rock A Black Rock" type plots to a rural town with a big skeleton in its closet with a horrifying element for interesting results. . It has actually been sent some cool down to my spine, because it unknowingly came along its evil path. Moody and serious environments are quickly established and persist for a long time; Panic's growing ideas give it a real kick. Some notable set pieces include the opening of a toy tank bizarre and the opening of a car flat squashing, without clearly mentioning Nikki's tweaked nightmare, the director clearly understands the stylishly by Bernard Mackavity and the crew. Jaime Mendoza-Navas' song is cruel and it gives extra generosity. <br /> <br /> The firm and professional cast works well, especially Strath Martin's rich Doc Duncan and producer LQ Jones and Alvy Moore. <br /> <br /> Just the whole plot under our nose nose is right that it is more scary. Jack priests begin to lead them on the right path, but will they have time to put a stop at the time? It's worth enjoying a little bit of fun; I'm just talking about myself, after giving it a second chance, I could have appreciated much more. I can say yes now, it's really a low rating, an interesting, unusual and effective way of saying a good story. <br /> <br /> 8/10
