VHS has seen this picture among them, I recommend the DVD for you. In reality VHS is completely rubbish. The main reason is that the film was shot on the widescreen (2.55: 1) and the producers went out of money making VHS version and released it as 4: 3. As a result, most of the actors are not screen-wise and many are being seen in half of the cars on each side of the screen. DVD is actually a reasonable version of the movie. Before the final release, many scenes were spent in the film. They are seen as very obnoxious for minority groups. Indeed, in the hope of a US release, no one else has anybody else. For example, Americans could not fully understand words like gasoline and stride. <br /> <br /> Mike's father and mother were called Hippies. Grandfather survived the father in the film as a punk smoker guitarist. But with the mom the following scene was cut. The scene took place on the roof of the house, which was filled with aluminum foil, fluorescence and vegetation ... you get the picture. The producers created many plants for the front and when they saw the fruit of the big winter, they became very beautiful and the scene was cut. Covers! <br /> <br /> Yes, this image is well-known as Australian culture classic. Road instruments have # 2 voted the top 100 movies, rarely missing in Mad Max Lakes. Later the ROE budget was 10 times higher. In fact ROE's budget was so small that the director could not break a car ... but if someone was truly defeated, the public would have been warned. (Compare with Smoky and Bandit or Blues Bros, where dozens of cars have been destroyed.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> The GTAH Country Boy tracks the faxes from Kotar's local indigenous community. The car was meant to burst on the car.) Because the budget was so strong, because the car was made of ordinary brown masking tape instead of the gold trim color of the original material. <55 br> <br /> 55 TVs are absolutely real. The car was easily opened with 4 doors and '55 'appeared brightly and quickly in the film. The motor was a deadly 545 that made about 1000 bhp. This film was reduced to around 600. This film was easily able to have 170 MPF shows in a number of scenes. <br /> <br /> Only for record, more than $ 12,000 people could take out all the cars after the film. Ho, dodge, '53 camel, ramer 53 shaves ... a lot. Where are they surprised now? <br /> <br /> SW
