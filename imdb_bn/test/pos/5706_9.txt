Last night when I went to my local PBS station to see "What was America?" I was expecting a dull documentary, instead I got very good and credible reenactment of main events during the time. Now I see the causes of the American Revolution, and the parts that adopted Indian battles. Larry Neighring George Washington, and he is perfect for that part. Camera story, fantastic job I look forward to waiting for the next week. PBS really uses our HD format to get the 1700's properly done in our living room. <br /> <br /> I hope Larry Nehher will be seen more in the future as he is a talented actor.
