Last evening I had extraordinary pleasure to watch the movie hit. I was surprised and amazed. Smith has done a tremendous job in a role that he is not always associated with. He was once proven that he did not need a gun to become a great actor in the movie. Kevin James was very impressive. I admit that I always like him in "Queen's King" but this role really brings him more light and I hope he will see him in a bigger screen in the near future. The movie was funny and adorable and I could imagine that you can imagine that any person as the best date movie. Comedy, Romance and the mix of plays I felt In the feeling of tears and sadness it is not like most "touching the chick", but it holds itself and I think it can be enjoyed by men and women alike. I encourage all couples to see this film in particular, but if you are not involved with anyone, then you can take some great ideas from the hit. <br /> <br /> Big Thumps UP twice !!!
