I think the movie version of Northenja ABB is actually quite good. It's certainly fun. Well, this is not a nice composition as Pride and Prajoujis ('95) but it has a very good thing in it. Especially the city's bath setting !!! .. Royal Crescent, Roman Bath, atmosphere of interesting Georgia .. It's nice. If you're a fan of me like you, you love watching this movie! The performances may very rarely be "melodramatic" sounds, but I think that this film deliberately makes romance, terrorism and popular stories of time society as fun as novels. Another idea of ​​physical appearance of Catherine Moorland is limited to myself personally. The music is also somewhat "unusual" But I suppose it is strange to be acceptable, although there is nothing to illustrate its historic time. I wonder what the dear old Jane would think ... :)
