**** By the speaker **** it is a very strange film - especially for its time - respect for it. For six years, American films showed American soldiers as sons, brothers and fathers. <br /> <br /> In the best way of life and in our last moments, our hearts are bound by this difficulty, sweet sack soldiers have peace and harmony in their families. Yet in the same year, this movie shows viewers worse than the audience - a message from the movie - "Lie your daughter." <br /> <br /> Even the best soldiers - they have been gambling for a long time, they become drunk, and completely indifferent about whether their wife is there. Their reaction to police's investigation of their assassination - conspiracy against them. Mikum, the most sympathetic soldier says, "I do not know if my wife wants to do this, since the war she has not seen her in two years now. Do I care? No. Maybe we will take it, maybe not. <br /> <br /> Another soldier is shown to be unusually sensitive because after some years he wants to see his wife again. <br /> <br /> Later, when this soldier told the police station that he had spent a night in a whore's house - except his wife sitting next to him, his wife would be better, whatever seems to be a question. Actually, he - I think it's "hey, the soldiers will be soldiers". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Am I worried about anything else?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " No. I did it a lot, I guess. <br /> <br /> A man looks at the whore's apartment. She said, "I'm just a man like you," interested in the whore. Then he said, "It is not false, I am her husband. I want to be a military, I have become before." <br /> <br /> She said, "No, it's a lie, why do I want to be a soldier?" When the police asked him, he went through another false accusation. At the end of the film we have no clear source why he is and why! He is one of the weirdest characters in the history of the film! <br /> <br /> A man is standing with his girlfriend while talking to four friends, when an intelligent soldier wants to drink his girlfriend. She changed her dress to the page - and behind the back of the other, no problem. Yet the man does not leave his girlfriend - that only disappears - but after following one of the soldiers when he goes to another area of ​​the bar! He has come out of the amount of information he has received about the soldier - promptly summoning the soldier due to his philosophical philosophy and the drunkenness of the soldiers' return problem. This is strange thing Similarly, a dance is the girl is disturbed by a passionate soldier who wants to take her for "real dance and dinner". Yet he dances with her - and immediately gives him the keys to his house! <br /> <br /> Did people just ask them to come to their home after meeting with them in the late 1940s? <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan killed his host, a stranger, when he was angry that the Jewish host tried to find out the drunk ryan outside his house. What is the reason for the murder? "How did a Jew tell me to drink?" "How to drink?" is not it? What does that mean? <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Still the movie is shaking completely! How do you just do the idea that these people are going to work - or are going to pop up a new bizarre character - anyone who thinks of their behavior is least weird - for example, the behavior of the wife. <br /> <br /> Robert Young, Robert Ryan, Galleria Aartem (who earned an Oscar nomination), Paul Kelly and other actors I've never heard of. 'Never heard of this movie - and it's a complete joy that I've discovered something I want to see again and again. It is really weird but impossible to look away from because there is no idea what you will do next in this animal.
