Short lines are some men's wet dream for the ideal woman ...; o) Although critically, the film has a classic film written on it (the image is made and fully literally shown in the picture, as you see it)! <br /> <br /> How can anyone make a silent movie at this year's age? It's not completely silent for once (take music for example). The answer is with great cinematography. And it's no wonder that it won the prize in this region (as another user)! But it sometimes falls on it. While the pictures are great, it sometimes distributes much more to them instead of going forward (by plots and time). You can cope with that, you'll enjoy it more than I I did not tell you anything about the story, but I will never do it, because I do not want to make anything for you ...
