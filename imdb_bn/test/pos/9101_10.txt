I like this movie !! Jack Black and Kyle Gass probably made one of the best comedies from smoking. This movie has something for everyone: rock, medicine and Satan. Anyone else want? I want to sit back in this movie and forget all the problems of the world and want to laugh a good one. Although not good in the movie theater, it is sure to be a classical classic. I'm suggesting someone to choose a movie from D'Aah because you heard the songs (such as the expression of the Junk with the Cascade and the epic war against the devil) but many cats are just funny. If you have not heard of their music, then the songs are laughing, but the songs are so big that you can not pass them.
