Just got an advance screening out, and this movie was ridiculous. Probably better than the first one, but at least its equivalent. If you do not like jackasses, or men prefer unnecessary amount of nudity (more ways), stay away from it. But if you dig the whole Jackass thing, then this movie will not be disappointed. Toro Totter is the greatest invention of all time. OK. So my review was not long enough ... I would all say that poor, poor Dunn, they really kicked her crap in this. So if you enjoy mascotic humor, and good male nudity, and as far as the most detrimental female nudity (John Waters is involved, tell me more?) Then this film will be completely stitched for you. I did not stop smiling, and actually came out drenched in sweat.
