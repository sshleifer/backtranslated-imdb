In the early 1990's, I saw this movie as a little child and it was afraid of Jesus. I love it a lot and I'm going to die on her hand. <br /> <br /> In 2002, I think this movie was present but I had no idea what it was said, so I went. To know the section in IMDB and explain the name of the movie and try to get its name. However, at the end of the IMDB's no one told me, so I did the research and tried to buy a movie. So finally I grabbed it in DVD, and now I keep this movie as one of my most expensive horror films. I really love it, and I think that anyone will see it, the next time they will go too afraid in the wood. 9/10
