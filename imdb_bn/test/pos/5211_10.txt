For the main criticism of the movie ... Love Story: It was not a love story. Anyone who is trying to find humanity together is distraught together. The same thing happened with the soldier and the Russian boy. It adds a feminine touch, but look at American cinema ... no love story closed. There was no story: Is there a story of war? I think that's a stupid criticism. This is the story. They start with 400 men and show the lives of about 10 men and show how each of them participates and dies. Death is the final end of any story. There was no happy ending because it does not mean there is no story. <br /> <br /> There was a tremendous truth in this movie. I do not necessarily call it "anti-war". It was definitely a political statement, but the film was not everything in politics. Actually after a few episodes of Captain? As shown, Nazi Germany was not a stifling wind. They were enough outside the reach of the main Nazi team. Fat cats are not going to Russia! <br /> <br /> Perhaps Hollywood hit is not perfect, but shows the subtle knowledge of the general soldier (I talk about almost any nationality and war) and what they have to go through. This is a losing war, certainly the movie is going to be frustrating. And the person who said that it is portrayed as serious (and stupid) even the Germans: Every war has a victim of all (no real soldier will tell you this). <br /> <br /> This movie has a fine balance between film and documentary. While arguing for only one, it has some problems with it, but it instills the best in the world of the world. See it as such. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Perhaps it will be many and very controversial in the same theme, I want to see who has the significance of doing the first one.
