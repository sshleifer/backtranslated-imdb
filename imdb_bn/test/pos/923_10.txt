Well present each scene so perfectly. I've never seen a movie that meant almost every scene. <br /> <br /> When I was watching this movie, I remembered "Amili". Amilio is similar to the same funny movie and fantasy touch. This movie is based on both the same plot line. But both of them are perfect in their own way and able to create their own world. <br /> <br /> Red fate and Desvo are able to stimulate many thoughts among people. And I'm still thinking about it. <br /> <br /> The story is great and the last is a little fun. I was laughing at the last scene. It's amazing how these three movies have been connected to Red White and Blue. <br /> <br /> A great job in all industries. The job of a masterman <br /> <br /> 10/10
