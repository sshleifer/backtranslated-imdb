I followed this whole series when I was a child at grade school, according to the choice, it was not needed for the school. I used to read drama at series speed. Experience gave me a long life love for Shakespeare and history. It even gave a bit of a buggy acting, even at an amateur level. When reading Shakespeare's plays in any of the history, the pictures that appear first are available from this black and white production, it is seen on a large "furniture" TV, which is set with a rabbit ear antenna, all of which are "ghosts" and vibbles <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At that time there was no idea who I was an actor. Now I have seen that many of them have become well-known for many years. I especially enjoyed the Hotspur and the Hole, which I now saw with Shane Connery and Robert Hardy. I like to watch this perception on video, especially since most plays are rarely played and even less available in the video. It will be valuable as a document of television production in the mid-20th century.
