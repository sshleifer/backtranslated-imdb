Michael Shane shines like a sunny afternoon in this bright illustration of a comic genius. If you are familiar with the Kenneth Williams system and diary, these plays take them to a complete summary. When I read about Kenneth Hovering in his Swimming Transcend, I laughed and then brought life to the screen, but this time I did not laugh because it was highlighted from the point of view of the perspective of a repressive and torturer. It was the existence of loneliness like Kenneth's skin, but focused attention but it was run in real scale! The last 20 minutes of heart breaking down, as you can see, Kenneth slowly is deeply depressed and is considered as the only alternative to suicide. I have seen it a dozen times and are still at the point where he weeps uncontrollably on Louise Goodnight I can not recommend this drama enough. Sexually explicit but it can run on home that Kenneth can not give anyone attacking his world and this is the man's sadness lies. A gifted person who brings happiness to many, his shame is ashamed that his personal life was filled with frustration and sadness. Pauly.
