I really enjoyed this film, it definitely puts on the edge of your seat. It was very well directed. I think they showed Terry and Bobby alongside another couple's life and showed them as people with passion. This film needed to show Bobby as a cold and degraded person. <br /> <br /> I agree with another review that it is sick love, not true love. To give a wife to her wife, she does not have to go a long way to kill. She should have been honest with her and used to tell her that she was stupid and decided to take a baby together. Some reviews say that he was naive, I think he came to accept it, but the best actor is all round. Great movie to watch !!
