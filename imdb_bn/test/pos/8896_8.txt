As much as I hate to disagree with the original poster, I think Estrichs and Vikings are very good and each step is greater than the previous step before the animation of each of his favorite Gaul. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is not familiar with the famous comic series, will be difficult to follow, but it is a pleasure for those of us who want to know. <br /> <br /> The first and foremost, the animation is much more than the previous comic adaptation. You can say that they have taken time and effort to recover the look and feel of the comics at this time for time and effort. As mentioned, the film contains elements of other Asian titles and I can see how the fans may feel confused or somewhat downtroded, but I have actually seen that I have faithfully represented a screen of my favorite childhood comics Any comparison I was relatively small Follow the smaller spoilers ... <br /> <br /> Esters and his trusted friend Obelix have been captured by Vikings, who rescued their village's main nephew, traveling north. Viking thinks that the boy is teaching them about their fears, they will be able to fly due to drunken advice from some of their poor people. In this process, the boy meets the father of the Viking Chief and he falls in love, etc. etc., if my explanation sounds, do not worry. It is easy to follow the plot! Surely buy a great .. you can buy this DVD via Amazon France, but be careful. Your DVD player probably will not be able to run it. My computer had to change its settings to see it on my computer.
