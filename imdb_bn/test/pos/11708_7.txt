I was very impressed with Mick Molli's latest production. As a fan of her, I used different humor than appearing here. Naturally, he chose the more delicate, elaborate style of the crackerjack comedy, rather than his usual sharp, face-facing Rampal. It is sometimes inconsistent and non-even, but a decent script makes it work past, and makes for some recreational viewing. Operated by Paul Moloney (who has directed almost every Australian TV series fantasy), the only reason for crackerjack parking is the story of Jack Simpson, a block of local Bolt Club. When the club hits the financial crisis, the club is forced to bowl competitively for the collection of funds to save the Hen from the insect. A familiar, and successful formula, that is well managed. This movie can not be denied the responsibility of Molly's great casting. He shows a great deal of good chemistry with Samuel Johnson and Judith Lucie and when the character is probably not too far from his personality, you can not think why he is not trying his hand in the film. Before that In order to smooth the experienced experienced actors, the delightful Frank Wilson and Bill Hunter support and often steal their scenes. They pair two fine actors and easily cruise through their role. It was not for the huge success of 'Big Big Fat Greek Wedding', crackerjack could make it number 1 in the Australian box office, but when you consider what it is and what it is involved, even it creates numbers 2 an extraordinary Had the effort. All in all, a malicious, feeling-good movie. Great cast, great crew, and a great soundtrack combine one of the best Australian movies of 2002. 7/10
