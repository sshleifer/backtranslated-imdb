This is an interesting fact about platoon and Aristotle's databases, formal reasoning and abstract anthology which is not interested in more than one person. However, after almost a thousand years of Aristotle, the computer started to strengthen human thinking and people who refused to reflect questions other than biological, physical and chemical, suddenly felt the feeling because they could bring these computers "night" with the results Could not cope. Arabic Fossbinder's "Welt Mango Dahat", Tarkovsky's "Solaris" and Gordard's "Alfavil" together, probably the first film to receive the philosophical questions of computer science raised as the basis for a story written in the film. Confusing questions about detection and realization have been made cleverly in spontaneous criminal stories, which really strives to follow the audience as it is interested in resolving the cases. The phasimbindera embedded theoretical knowledge on real, hungry forms and was a master to sell extremely unrealistic material to his public. The basis of understanding is the fact that an identity defines a reality, but on the other hand, identity is needed to realize the reality. A person's idea with multiple identities is known only to us from the perspective of psychology. However, logically speaking, only because we have only one identity, our argument has only two values ​​(rights and lies). Now just consider one more value, like three: then, you can easily see, you already have three identities. What happens now, tell me, Dr. Stilar is killed? Then, it is possible that one of the three identities is abolished and the other two survive and able to recover the person from death. Another question is, if a person with multiple identities actually realizes this identity. The idea, though, is that the down-down or down-way path is shown below the visible scene with the view of the hotel lift, it is misleading, because of the identification and the fact is that the realities are not formed in hierarchical but Heterarchical way. Strictly speaking, there is no "artificial identity", because each identity is defined above two objects that share all their properties with each other. Therefore, it is assumed that only a single identity of each person is not a result of the ancient two valuable arguments (the second identity refers to a person who exists at the same time and does not exist). But now look around and one and the same object (which is by definition of self-help) is provided in its own way in every way. Therefore, if each subject can see a different object, then why can not a person separate the boundaries of two precious personalities, so that different people can exchange their individual person with the effect? Fassbinder will take this issue five years after his Masterpiece "Despair. A trip in the light".
