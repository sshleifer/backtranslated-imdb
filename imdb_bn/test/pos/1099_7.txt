It was a wonderful film. It was an interesting storyline, it was quite well executed in the next part of the film. The storyline reminds me of the city of God. But this is done more inferior than one. It was really what I liked: a tinge of surrealism Some beautiful painters (with wooden cameras) I'm not sure if it's culturally correct, but it will certainly expand that you are looking at South African perspectives. The actor was good (for the first timer, most of them are), I especially like the character of Estel, which makes this movie quite enjoyable. Although interesting, it asks you about your own life. Do you really love you really? Or you are ideal, agree to the conventionalism around you. Of course a clock value.
