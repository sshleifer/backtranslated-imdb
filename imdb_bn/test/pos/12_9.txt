I was surprised to be surprised to see this movie sneak into my local theater as a preview. <br /> <br /> We all see this plot line before (top song, GI jane, an officer and gentleman) but a good script still works. This story is basically with some side story lines about training a side guard rescue team. Kevin Coster plays Ben Randall, a very successful rescue team leader, who is forced to lead the training team after a tough mission. This movie takes us through the hard work of the training process and the personal stories of Castner's character and Jack Fisher, which starred Ashton Kutcher. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no great surprise in this movie and you will probably understand how many days it's coming. However, to use humor, to explore the training power, and Ben Randall to "work as a trainer" to make fun, to cheer me up and to entertain thoroughly. I really enjoy watching a movie which is full of laughing and laughing through the whole audience, and ending the film with respect. <br /> <br /> We all have a good time playing hard moments in film) and, I think, you too will be.
