Piano, written and directed by Hayo Miyazaki, is a little story that reveals respect for the sea, respect for the honor of the young and the old and the cultural differences. This is a new story of a little goldfish that wants to be a girl, rather than the recovery of Disney's Little Married. Miazaki is a scary, magical film for the animated, young and young-hearted by hand. The film starts with the sea anime, the jellyfish gradually starts with blue-green palettes and the little fairytale goldfish with a small face. There is no need for the story, the speed of the organism and Joe Hasey's music say at the beginning. Japan Academy Award for Pok√©o Best Animation Film and Best Score (Jezebel) won Japan's last summer release. Fantastic little gold fish, Brunhild, leave a jellyfish house in its ocean. After reaching patronage, he was caught in fish, garbage and mazar fishing. The five-year-old Sosuke (voice by Frankie Jonas) rescues it where he is rolled from the shore, which is driven into a scarf. He broke his hand while breaking open jars to release the little goldfish. Brunhild is delicious to treat her blood, which is Sosuke's cut, and keeps its transformational speed in humans, throwing out the nature of the same time balance. Sosuke puts a little goldfish into a green pel and its Ponyo (Noah Cyrus), which means soft and jelly-like. Sosuke's mother, Lisa (Tina Faye), lets her go to Ponyo School, which she works where the nursing home is right next door. Driving a beautiful dry road like Lisa's crazy street, fishing on the street, and a tree-lined road in the nursing home, representing the wonderful series representative of Miyazaki and completely portrayed in the scary morning of parents. Miyazaki Lisa made another powerful, independent, female character. He made both Sosuke and Ponio a loving, intelligent, modern mother. Lisa's telephone conversation talks with upcoming upcoming husband, Kauchi (Matt Damon) because the captain of the ship that she needs to run another, usually a normal wife's reaction. Later in the evening Sasuke interfered using a signal lamp to talk to his father because the ship crossed the mountain sitting in their home. Lisa Kiocchi's apologies for accepting and "bug-off, bug-off, bug off," this is a ridiculous scenario. However, when Sasu takes a signal lamp and tells his father, "Good luck, you love me," Lisa embraced him and said, he has a good heart, this is a tragic scene. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite is Miyazaki's elderly, wheelchair-type female, nursery home, Ichchi (Betty White), nirico (Clarice Lichmann) and Tokyo (Lily Tommlin). Their exchange on Sosuke's little goldfish is wonderful, and the memories of the cat in the West of Last (Lorraine Buckle) and Sophie (Gene Siemens) are the reason they leave the longest flight of the Moving Castle steps of Haoul. Pioneer's magic is like the father of the sea-god, Fujimoto (Liam Nisson), to return Panoe to his ocean house. Fujimoto tries to maintain the balance of nature by using one of its elixers, but magician little piano again upsets this laziness in this process and creates a tsunami. The giant is following the dolphin to go to Sosuke, this red-faced guy, the little girl, reminds the viewers of the dirty, brave little girl of my neighboring Totoro. Adventure and enthusiast as ponyo as maya. When Fujimoto realizes what Piano did, he would call the sea goddess Gran Maamar (Kate Blanchet) to help the situation. This cute, goddess of peace comes in a blue flowing dress that does not end. His personal discussions with Lisa have been discussing the future of young boys, which helps the audience to understand that Sosuke and Pinoy are not lovers of relationship, but brothers and sisters Living-peaceful final end is the ideology of Miyazakaki film that has fulfilled the expectations of the audience.
