"Four girls" starts with another clone of "Little Women" type Meladrum. The single father holding hands on four musical genius girls, and tried to manage them on their doings. The sudden appearance of the new Hollywood star often turns the film, before critics James Dean took big screen, long before he became the first anti-hero. From that time, Mikey Birden (John Garfield)'s dark, predictable figure is displayed on the gate of Anne Lempe (Priscilla Lane), his self-pity and demeaned philosophy on the rest cast, "the four girls" are more than just dogs <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> Although the main reason to see Garfield "Four Darters", there are other brightness flash. Hungary-born director Michael Cartidge, who is later responsible for such gems as "Casablanca" and "Milled Pearce", sticks to the minds of the audience with specific images (with the help of fame cinematographer Ernest Holler "without film-based disputes"), for example, Anne's first scooter screening Gate, Felix Davit (Jeffrey Lin), so gently swing The people who use it to reflect changes in mood and love became. <br /> <br /> The garfield standout performance is obvious, but the cast rests mostly with it. Undertified Jeffrey Lin plays the role of perfect identity, because Anne never loves his love for a neglected relative when he is with other people. Cloud Renaissance, a misunderstanding as the father of four young young women, gives a subtle screenplay of a set on a family head lost in snails. Three Lane sisters, already famous for their musical power, turned into a completed actress, well plays their part. This is a rhyme supporting actors, including Dick Foran, Frank McHug, May Robson and Eddie Akph, making it all credible. <br /> <br /> How many opposers are attracted to touch the imagination of visitors. Ann is eternal hopeful, even when he and Mickey are down and out. He always looked at the bright side and those days were caught like a large number of people across the Great Depression, he only saw prosperity near the corner. Mickey has a complete list of bad things in search of company in her starvation, which refused to anne. Mickey hopes to come out with a bolt of electricity due to his death in the round corner of his life. As a musician, Mickey has very little talent; Ann has extra rental talent as singer and musician. Anne beauty is big; Mickey is a way big on personality in a warped sense. And the difference and go over. Do not miss an important part of these films that are ultimately combined. <br /> <br /> See "Four Girls" for John Garfield's Dosage on the big screen debut. Seven years later, he came in better, when he combined Frank Cembers with the movie "The Postman Always Rings to Twists", in contrast to the rich charismatic Lanna Turner, sometimes with the best screening of the film singers. But if too much density is kept in the star of the show, you can also see "four girls" to catch the important elements.
