Or any story memorable in the case of Leopold and Loeb, you can find this movie entertaining. The college cast is accompanied by Stephen Caffere and Garrison Hershberger with Robert Coolap's <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Caffeine ("Longtime Companion", "Buried Alive") is excellent, and these deadly roles should do more. Basically, the two broken friends are tired of their parents demanded, who do not expect anything less than academic perfection, if they obey, only the best in the school will be paid. There is a nice view where the potter gets low grade on the coalfield of the caffeine, his belief threatens to fund and the caffeine tells his friend: "I hate him, I want him dead" ... <br /> Beverly Heels is not good at all. This is always a wonderful theme. I believe this movie came only after the murder of Menendez in 1990. If you've seen "Minehead, a Killing in Beverly Hills" and then compare this movie, you will see some interesting parallel.
