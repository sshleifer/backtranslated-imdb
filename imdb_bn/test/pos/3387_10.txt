There are 2 complete sets of my time life, it's my favorite movie all the time. Love all actors and actresses .. great pictures .. love patrick swaaj ... this picture, which showed her true talent. But still, he is not getting credit for professional display! Most credits have been missed in this movie. Love the way to highlight dry and dusty monologues of civil war. Creating it in the greatest love story of all time, and showing through all the problems of life, no true friendship means how the two divided countries were divided. But so far and all independence remains firm, although war split between war criminals and independence. But at the end of all this, they finally teach us to see how true genuine ships can still be up to this day! Just the best ... this picture can not be compared with the wind. Her best Patrick Swazi After watching this movie one hundred thousand times. I became a big fan of Swazi ... and I came after his career..after now all the movies in the north and south!
