How nice! A wonderful, lost piece of Australia and the Lost 70's Glam-Rock film is one after another. This movie shows only encouragement to see what can be done next to a budget. As the reprint of the Oz story, the film is becoming very clear, but it is stored by its fool. A glimpse of how Glam Rock was published in Australia would delight the fans of this fan. This image was used as a double with the Robi Horror Picture Show, which is based on the Oz film-type index. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully, the age of Ojus was very good - perhaps a tribe of how firmly set in the original Australia in 1976. . The passage of history shows that most of the concepts are being discovered mainly in the mainstream. The film's desire to give special importance to gay character is significant, especially with regard to 'revolution' period to push Australian gay rights. <br /> <br /> The performances range from dazzlingly fine to flexible brightness. The lack of side reduction and most of the conversations can benefit from additional drafts or two. Somehow, these errors add to the appeal of movie, which is kindly submissive. Like the Australian in the 1970s, this film has a neutral charm. <br /> <br /> Rocky Horror Show has many connections with the real Australian stingings that will keep obsessives on their toes. <br /> <br /> Oz is certainly a classic and review possible possible potential civilians. To laugh at the 70th fashion, the Oussarker swings with the soundtrack, gives up hope of the door, and the oz may be happy.
