66 years later "Flash Gordon" still has an interesting Sesipi / adventure / epic feeling which struggles for today's many science fiction events and fails to deliver. The only way to fully enjoy this series is to sit and do not pick anything (why not go for the impact of hockey, dialogue, flash princess Aara etc). And people of your age who have returned to the "flash gordon" serial screen or have seen "Back in the Day" on TV, if you want to apply to this good successive future generation, your kids / grandkids are young when they see it! It worked for me (males 18 years of age or older). 10 out of 9
