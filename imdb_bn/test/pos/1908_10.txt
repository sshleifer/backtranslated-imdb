Yes ... I read the autobiography of David Lee Roth, "Crazy from the Hit" (which is a great read in the way), and the DLR says it was the favorite blackplash movie as her child. Actually he said, he always imagined himself as a black guy in South Cal. Mr. Roth has been cited by quoting: <br /> <br /> "We saw every blackpluption picture, and those movies had a huge impact on me." Trouble Man, Superfluous, Foxie Brown, Shoft, Cleopatra Jones, Blacklaw, Rudi Ray Moore <br /> <br /> <br /> She said, "Dualight - Rudi Ray Moore - really the real thing. She is a blue ridiculous, blue laughing. He was on the primary party records like Reddyx Fox. So he was the most perfect to play a new secret agent. His answer was "Bond. James Bond." His answer was "Dlmeight, sorry *****!" We will wait for that line in all his movies. "Whitey" can be seen in every movie at least once, and we're waiting for them too There was a car. They had their shoes, they had guns, itching, slang and scams. And we all knew that the coolest solution was white bull at the end of the movie *** * She is trying to feed the hungry baby, but she really is a pump ... ... ************* **************************************************************************************************** ************************************************************************************************************************************************** So after reading dolmeight in the book of Mr. Roth, I bought the DVD immediately and I really liked it. Yes, this is a very low budget, and yes ... I hate Rap ... but as a fan of the Tarantino movies, I can see most of the matches, especially among 70 music / Folk Ala-Jaco Pastrias covers music. I love the scene where two policemen push him for Koki and then snort his whole bunch of them, as he did thousands before, and some said, "yes yes ... the true maxi!" ... and then He keeps talking and there is a little crouching on his lip. Classic! A little bit on the edge of violence, but frustrating, which I would consider a positive quality. I guess it is not as predictable as it is. Of course, soon the "human tornado" is going to be sorted. 10 out of 10
