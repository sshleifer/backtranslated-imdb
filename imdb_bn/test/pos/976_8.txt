I do not understand why IMDB user will rate this image 5.2 / 10? It's really great, very fun. I strongly recommend this movie for you, adults, teenagers and especially children! <br /> <br /> The story is about 14 years old, which is always a lie at home and school. One day he had his homework to write 1000-word-story. But he did not do it, so the teacher asked him to write and gave him 3 hours, or he had to go to Summer School. Yes, he wrote it at 2:45. "Big fat liar", I think it was a story. On the way to school, he hit a prominent Hollywood producer in Lima, and he gave him a ride. But the boy forgot the story in Limo. He told his parents and teacher, but of course they did not believe him. And film producer, she took the stories of kids as her new movie, "Big Fat False". When the child saw the movie trailer, he told his parents that he wrote it, but they did not believe. So, he and his friend had to go to Lae to prove one thing: Truth never disappears <br /> <br /> Enjoy this great movie, you will not be disappointed. Do not believe in 5.2 / 10 rate, it will be 9/10! Believe me <br /> <br /> P / S.: Sorry, my English is not good enough to comment well!
