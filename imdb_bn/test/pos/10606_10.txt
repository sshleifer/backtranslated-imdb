If you are looking for a movie which does not take yourself seriously ... Haggard is in your favor. I must say before writing anything, if you do not see any CKY (Camp Kili himself) video than the movie, it probably will not be fun. My suggestion is to see some clips of videos that make the left and his friends. Haggard himself did not take seriously, and that was not the purpose. There will be a random moment throughout the film which has nothing to do with the plot, which can be boring but there is nothing beyond its control. Even the plot also focuses on and the story of Ryan Dunn reveals quite nicely. This plot has told me the real story of Ryan Dane's ex-girlfriend (mostly in the case). Brandon DeCamilo is one of the best characters in the film. He has a lot of talent and knows how to laugh people. You asked me if he stole the movie. Overall I love this movie for this simplicity and straight-up curiosity. It's a left movie man, it's not going to be normal. Haggard is filled with a delightful quote that used to be from the first time I and friends first saw it. I've seen movies 6-7 times and still find new things. Soundtrack is just as good as well. Everything from Gnar to new orders and kill some techno. Just do not go into the movie with high expectations, let it all unfold and then judge it for what it does.
