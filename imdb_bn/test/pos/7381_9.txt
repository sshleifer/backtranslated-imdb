... silent set pieces of this picture are crazy words (at least, as shown in insufficient tools for Seattle and Maine film festivals) and have been found to be harmful plot, but Rickman suffers from an American accent, old tennis shoes and baggy sweats. However, there are moments of most star showy chewing gigs and the film gives the opportunity to look at the beautiful looks of the physiological figure of Maine and Rickman, and to the wonderful polio walker and the fantastic ending (the telescope to the filmmakers) Due to video release in March (after a cable wind). No Rickman will be missed by the fan. Do not ignore Hua.
