In his second historical martial arts film, Chib has portrayed his true life as the mother of Omaha. This image also revived the wonderful incredible achievement of Omaami to kill the ragged calf with his bare hands (Omaa did 50 times in real life). Dynamic combat choreography featuring authentic Kyokushinkai techniques. It is maliciously one of the rare Sony Chibo films, in which he does not tear the body parts of opposition. One must definitely look for one of his Top 5 films for Sony Chiba fans
