I thought I was going to visit this movie, my precious 50 rupees. But Aparna Sen's strong foe, who sincerely requested my friend, I decided to launch the film. It has really bothered me to go to this cheap theater, because I saw King Kong for $ 50 in the best theater in the city. The movie started and surprisingly I was not complaining. <br /> <br /> Shabana Azmi and Kankana Sen are an excellent story and some wonderful surprises in the part of Sharman. Shabana Azmi is a divorced man who dedicates his life to his mother and daughter-in-law. Kankana Sen Sharma is a schizophrenic (keep me spell-free), which always portrays the thing. Rahul Bose also gave a great performance. <br /> <br /> The story is Mithi (Sen Sharma), a schizophrenic, and as a journalist after rape brutally in his field service, his level has actually increased, his drunk leaves him, he becomes. All her world comes down on her. Her elder sister, Shabana Ajmi, is taking care of her, and in her imagination, Mithi believes that she is married to her marriage, she has 5 children, and they are at the 15th Park Avenue (which is actually a place in New York). Mithi is planning to become suicidal because she believes that no one believes in him and she is detained in her house from her husband. As luck would have, meet both Mithi and her fianc√©e when they are both out of a trip. After 11 years of brutal rape, her mother tongue does not exist in her real world, she can not recognize him. Her grandfather, now married and the father of two children, said that it was her duty to correct the mistake she had made 11 years ago and she promised to take him to Park Avenue. And he did. She took her to a place in Calcutta, which seems like her husband's house. As Jaideep / Jozo (Rahul Bose), his drunk talking to his cellphone, he lost track of Mithi. Everyone looks for him but he is not available anywhere. He finally denied his own family, his family, his own fantasy family at the 15th Park Avenue. <br /> <br /> I would say it touched my heart. I am now the fan of Aparna Sen's guidance. Camera work is fantastic. And the value of performance is spell bounding. Conkona Sen Sharma's strong performance as schizophrenic children. Shabana Ajmi Divorcee is another big family member, who has a family of family members as a big sister. Rahul Bose, another happy and quiet role (I do not know why this guy does not get a big break, he has so much potential). Finally Aparna Sen, she is still attracted to the audience in front of the camera and not behind her. <br /> <br /> A very good 8/10 ....
