Robert McKimson's 'Acrobatie Bond' is one of the director's best shorts. Circus-based setting can uncover the horrific "Big Top Boney" harmful memories of McKimson, however, 'Acrobatie Bondon' is not really close to the blue like that quarrel. Setting up bug forests against a harmful lion, 'Acrobatie Bondi' from the beginning is fresh and fun, it is not very interesting to see. There is a classic scene where the bugs run a lazy lift directly into its hole directly to appear directly in a pair of lions. A brilliant Disney parody, he hollers "Pinocchio" down the lion's neck! This is a sign of things coming up in the bright opening. In the beginning, there are several skilled dancers antics around the lion's cage and around, then there is a hilarious and annoying presentation of 'Smile Clown Lighthouse' which I regularly disguised! This gives the cartoon its name, which culminates in all this a small acrobatic sequence. I have never liked the circus as a setting for cartoons, and it usually creates a dull and predictable set of giggs, but it's a surprisingly short summary of McKimson's best.
