While driving on a highway on the marriage of his beloved Betty-Anne, Adam (Eric Jungman), his former classmate, Harley (Justin Ehrich) was surprised by the backside of his car. Adam Batty-Anne broke Halesz due to inconvenience and illness due to illness. Along the way to their street, Harley makes some red fun of a bar and is followed by a giant monster truck on the street after their car. After some incidents, they gave the lift man Sarah (Aimee Brooks) a lift and were scared by a scary monster driven by three giant trucks as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Collection of clich√©s started with the story "Joy Ride" or "Duel". Then it became one of the countless rip-off of "Texas Chess Genocide"; There is a wonderful wrapping, ending with a hook for a sequel. Has a sunny view, Aimee Brooks is extremely sexy and this film is really entertaining. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Monster Man"
