Every American who thinks that World War II has realized that these two films must be seen. Some Hollywood movies about war are being followed by inhumane barbarians without the thought of Japanese soldiers. We believe that every Japanese man was ready and was able to fight with death, until that day we carried out Nagasaki bombings. "The fire on the plane" shows a different reality: the army is pathetically undersupplied, hungry to demoralized and cannibalism point. They refer to euphemistically "monkey meat" as human flesh. Films and novels that it was based on, also killed the idea that Japanese soldiers preferred death for surrender: They believed that their enemies were not at any moment to catch the prisoners. This raises a question to me that most Americans would want to avoid: If the Japanese army was so fatal at this time in war, then why Hiroshima need to be ruined?
