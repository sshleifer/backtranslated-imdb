Love this movie !! Acting by Carla Gagino is great. Interesting story about a kidnapping that makes terrible mistakes (they all do?). The film was easy to follow without some wonderful twists and convoluted so full of turn and plot completely unavailable. It was a totally unexpected pleasure. More than "Quantin-Ies" are being seen in most movies.
