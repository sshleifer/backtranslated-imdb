I got to say it. Gary saved this image on the bus. If it was not for its acting genius, then the film was sub-par. I recommend the picture but only barely <br /> <br /> The biggest drawback of the film is its massive disregard for historical, geographical and physical accuracy. For example, why light green and mountain? How to ignore Buddy's producer Petty? Where are the daily trips to Clovis, New Mexico studio? Why is Nashville regarded as a racist hate camp for the destruction of the word? Why did body body two weeks of marriage to Maria treat as complicated, banned, race-mixed stereotype? Body's tile box as light as birds? Finally, why the cricketer is portrayed as the problem of road building in hockey talent? <br /> <br /> Those mistakes facing them will blame themselves for a movie, "Body Holly Story". However, on the bus he painted a painter, whose death had finally died.
