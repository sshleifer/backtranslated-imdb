I found the episodes interesting and well written. As a TV show, what I hope for from the fantastic entertainment was entertaining. I like the "relationship" between Professor and his female security guard ... but occasionally his Scottish accent makes it harder to understand what he is saying. I hope that there will be more than just four episodes. I acknowledge that a commenter / critic in this series comments on the doctor's opinion. I understand this gentleman's comment; However, it is a fictional television series that does not offer specific information such as a documentary ... for entertainment. Patrick Stuart performs well and makes his character credible. If you want to see a documentary, this is not a series for you. But if you want to see the unique scientific-based theories of entertainment-based media, you will enjoy four episodes.
