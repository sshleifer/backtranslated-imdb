While browsing on YouTube, I discovered this vague movie '70 of horror. For a low budget effort, it is a compelling moment for the pacing to slowly lead to a surprisingly frustrating finish. Although a woman who has kept her shirt continuously, she considers those scenes as a nymphomaniac story important, and a scene with a curly-haired young man, because he tried to turn me before trying to erase him. Make her scream crazy. The young nurse who comes and hires herself enjoys it and I am not surprised that she has released for the cover of the playboy. Some characters are very annoying and some scenes seem ridiculous. In most cases, do not show up in the basement (the title I watched on YouTube) provides enough drama and cool for an entertaining B-movie.
