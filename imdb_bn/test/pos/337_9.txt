Finally, I hijacked a copy of Kannathil Muthamital through Netfix and saw the new Yarar eve publishing a great drama. It starts with Shyma (a Nandita Das) marriages on the west of Sri Lanka and then their war is thrilling. Shyama must flee to India and have to be in refugee camp to give birth to a child. After several years, we see Amudha, a playful love child (P. S. Kearthana), who is the darling of a teacher, parents, and fellow classmate (or burden) similarly to Maria Cromwell to solve the problem. On his birthday, his father Tiru (Madhu) and Indra (Simran) said that he was not his biological child, he was accepted. This tilts the world to fill his confident love and he continually dwells on why he leaves her birth mother. Parents taking several attempts after quarters go to Sri Lanka to try to find out their mother. The country has been isolated by a democratic civil war and three are inevitably caught in the world. But this new Shyma leads to their meeting - ultimately faced by unity and asked why he gave up his daughter. <br /> <br /> The story of a child who was released was born at the time of birth, the mother of her birth, the reunion guardian, the reconciliation of unconditional parental love, the mother who carried her mother, the naturalness of Chennai and the fear of terror threatened Sri Lanka - Gem material has created a nice movie which is a lot of elements in a saga that is stirring the spirit. AR Rahman's music beautifully completes magical and crazy moments in the film. This movie is directed by Madhuban, Nandita Das, Simran's excellent performance and child artist P. come. Kehrthana has played an important role in the non-neglected discharge. This performance won him the national award. <br /> <br /> The movie is a visual poem - each frame is beautifully made and fired sensationally. I am joking about Moni Ratnam with terrorism, love and obscenity. I think his search of this topic is absolutely outstanding. Mahadeben's character was quite unique - his passion and idealism did not make him selfish, rather he met with how much he cared for the little girl. Her one liners were delightful. Mao played by Simran was quite multi-dimensional - she was an idealist, liked the adopted daughter but was also worried about her biological children. Children's shocks, fingers, and emotions are uncommonly p. come. Was portrayed by Kehrthana. Talk to most of his widely accused eyes. Actually there was the mysterious character of Nandita Das and her husband. Perhaps Moni deliberately made them mysterious so that they can not think like us - why is she a terrorist? This prevents him from being judged - this is another conflict that he did not take any side but only report it when showing human tragedy. <br /> <br /> Kannathil Muthmatal Visual Poetry and Spirit Incentive Drama - I rarely cry movie, but this one left me moist eyes and a little heart. This is a beautiful movie - you can find a copy of a treasure and a champion; Today is happy or steal and watch the movie!
