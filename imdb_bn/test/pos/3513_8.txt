I've been waiting 25 years to see this difficult to find the scary thriller and I've finally done it after the proper rebirth in the DVD. Of course this did not have the same effect on me because I saw it in 80, but director Lieberman (his picture "Skirm" is awesome) uses excellent Oregon position and takes time to develop characters, not just sent them in creative ways. A high note, Brad Fiedel's whistling music really adds loneliness to making this great fun for vague and consistent fans. If you want underrated horror films a must see. To illustrate this, "Intelligent 13th" will be an intelligent "some delicious bit of liberation war." On one hand, there are some really cool and real moments like my favorite when a couple is swimming in a lake and the person disappears under the water to make a strategy on his throat - when you think it is normal fear, he suddenly sees the shore and ... I can not honestly loot this - you just have to see it for yourself. Also, the last one that you just have to believe ?? It came from somewhere and it's weird and wild! Include commentary by the DVD Lieberman.
