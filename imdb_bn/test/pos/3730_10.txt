Awesome movies. Post-Mysterious Films Kick-Ass. There is no alternative to it. Conversation is mainly without a spec up to speed and interest (mainly through the development of some good character). The fight between Reno and Hero was tight. I like to use cave painting and medieval like arms to show how ancient and barbarous mankind became without their technology and guzzaline. The connection between the beginning and the end was a bit sparse, that is, the distance between the hotel and the opening ranges was difficult for me to understand. In a nutshell, the conversation without dialogue cushion, story, story, and most importantly, an apocalyptic landing ground always desolate the scenes kick.
