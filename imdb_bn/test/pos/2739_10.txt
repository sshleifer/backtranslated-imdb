MCBOING BOING has been one of the cartoon stuck on my head for years and finally decided to surprise it, and the people involved in production were surprised at it. If I think I think we would like to see it in a UHF station and this means that any time UHF is not using the converter for the local station in the local TV station, the cartoon saw a big deal in those days, which makes the show more and more. Mysterious I think Gerald used the sound effects that I used to speak. A great memory from 50+ years ago. I would see other memories could be hidden on the web. Anyway I try to do computer animation where johnl3d comes in the picture
