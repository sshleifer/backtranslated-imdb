Jack Webb D.I. Is riveting as a marine corporation drill instructor. Webb play Sgt.Jim Moore, a tough but fair Marine whose work is made possible by young teenagers for the war. Any role Jack Web can play any role. As a former Marine, I can make sure that it is the most perfect film that deals with technical training with basic training.
