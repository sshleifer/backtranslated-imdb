It was an excellent movie. I'm talking to a child, which I am raising, with the FAE, and explaining the word can see the film. I bought the book and it was great I want a copy for my own use and so my boys teachers can also see it. I want to know if anyone can sell me a copy of this film, use it for some time or read me where I can buy it, where nobody can buy it. Thanks, Mothers I would recommend this film to anyone who would deal with children / adults with special skills. This movie should be seen on TV again. The team of my son's tracking doctor will also want a copy. His special ed teacher asked me to try to find a copy or he can borrow. <br /> <br /> Thank you
