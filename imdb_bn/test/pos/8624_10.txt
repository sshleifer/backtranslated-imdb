What they were John and Caroline were very personal, so writers had to combine what they could do. I really liked Portia de Rossi as Caroline, but Jacqueline Bisset's voice grated over my nerves. She should use her regular voice. I liked that instead of focusing on the entire movie of people and Caroline, we already knew about John.
