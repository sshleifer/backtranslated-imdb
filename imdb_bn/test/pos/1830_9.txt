This movie is sweet-closing, just kind of warm soul and kind. I found it very gentle, and the premises * is unlikely impossible, but the letters were so appealing (especially the mini driver) that they had my full attention from the start and were very soon my affection. <br /> <br /> Bonnie Hunt did a great job of making her director debut, and did a good job as well as writing. I highly recommend this movie and will see it again, I'm sure.
