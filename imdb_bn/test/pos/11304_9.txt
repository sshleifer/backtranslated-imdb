I want to say that the general Barbie movie influenced me. My 5 year old Barbie has a curiosity nephew and she has always watched that I saw many Barbie on these holidays, but I'm not sick of them. <br /> <br /> This image, apparently, has many improvements, especially background, and character animations improved with each new movie. Especially I noticed that this film has made huge progress in the animation of Barbi's hair. It has a nice range of quotes from classical music and I think it's great because it reveals the new generation of classic. This movie is very valuable, especially if you have a young reliever. They will be entertained for hours!
