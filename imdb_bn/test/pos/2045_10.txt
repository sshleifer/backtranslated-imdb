I'm a Geena Davis fan for life due to this movie. I always liked Samuel L. Jackson. And make a great pair of two screens. By saying this, I think the 'TLKG' which I saw is the best action movie, the viewers have forgotten the last moments of anticipation now, and filmmakers are now trying to include them in movies (mostly fail). <br /> <br /> 10/10
