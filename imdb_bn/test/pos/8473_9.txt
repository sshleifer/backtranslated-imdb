A great performance of Jamie Fox's only one of the highlights of "Ray" is the 2004 film, starring Kerry Washington, Regina King, Curtis Armstrong, Richard Schiff, Sharon Warren, Patrick Bachau and many others. Film <br /> <br /> There are several main topics in this movie: The first is Charles's childhood - his brother George drowned, who hated him for many years, his glucoma blinded him, and power taught him his mother. - Do not break, do not break, never become a lame. He eventually sent him to a special school where Charles's gift of music was discovered. The next focus is on Charles' artistic evolution, singer like NAT King Cole, Gospel music, his music music, and the unique word for Ray Charles. The third focus is Charles' personal life - his marriage to marriage, many of his issues, his heroin addiction and last rehabilitation. <br /> <br /> Because Charles was 74 years old, there were many left. Although Charles was orphan at his thirteen years, his favorite mother, his rock, is not in this picture. Although he sees the Chitlin Circuit and refuses to play in a separate club, his closest appetite is not covered as a musician. At one stage, he found a jar of jelly and tried to eat it, but broke it. He was down and out that. In 1979, the state of Georgia accepted Georgia State as "Theory My Mind" to ban them, and while bringing her back to her homeland, Bia was shown with her, although she and B were divorced in 1977, which were not mentioned. She was probably there. Also, he is not his only wife - he married once before meeting him; That wedding is not covered. In the film, we were called an illegal child - there were 12 people. It was impossible to get even more into a movie. <br /> <br /> Can not remove its glorious song? Which seems to continue throughout the whole film, makes her talent and artist steady. <br /> <br /> Charles's story is compulsory and attracts the audience's interest. Those who blame it as a television production movie, do not deserve it. "Ray" gives a good pace at the direction of Taylor Hankford, and the film has plenty of environments and beautifully decade beautifully. <br /> <br /> As Ray, Jamie lives in Fox and forgets that he is playing a comedian apart. Fox wore fond of music, played his own piano, and spent a lot of time playing for Charles. She nails him, but it is not an incognito - She is a flesh and blood man with hallucinations to stand in blood and find her brother's body; A man refuses to deny his addiction, hate the word junk and believes he is not hooked; And he has denied the life of his house, believes that his wife does not know about her various issues and illegal children (film, children); And because of his darkness, later, a man, taking a terrible advantage of his early career, refused to walk. He claims to pay $ 1 bills so that they can be calculated; When he discovered that he was a serious train for a club owner and his partner and he was deceived by almost a record deal, he made his own contract and gave up his job. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that he took the decision as a verdict and appeared for the first time on camera. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful biography, abstract with the superb music of artists like "Walk the Line". Whether or not you have Ray Charles Fan, some of the "judgment" experience.
