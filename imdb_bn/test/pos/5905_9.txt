Do not be fooled by the nostalgic Aura surrounded by "Mon oncle Antoine", because the darkness of the Canadian film's superlatives just hides under the surface. <br /> <br /> Perhaps set in the 1940s rural cube, this story discovers the developing sensation of young Benayet, because she can learn to deal with both sexuality and death. <br /> <br /> The look of the film is astonishing, especially as a high proportion of criticism for Canadian films, by general public surrounded by the science of cosmetics. Outside, stupid Benoit is a seductive protagonist for the audience, with an innocent eye looking at his corrupt community. <br /> <br /> I recommend reading Jim Leitch's critical essay in the film for the best feature of Canada for any person to see the film in a historical context while filming the film's size. Definitely check out this one.
