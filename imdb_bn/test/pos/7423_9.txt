'Terry & June' is one of the most heavily managed programs of all ages '70s and one of the most popular sitcoms of the' 80s. It started life as 'Happy Hour of Ever', but when Eric Mariman decided that he did not want to write anymore, he changed it, so becoming 'Anti Lucy' and Fletcher's Medford. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was comfortable, domestic, middle-class material; Plots carry clich√©s towels from the sitting to come to the drug shelf, sold and sell the afternoon and unwanted relatives come to stay on weekends. It certainly did not have 'awesome lazy comedy'. Since it is not 'clever', it is not meant to be. It was fun and performed well, and that was enough! <br /> <br /> I like the 'option' boom of 80's ('spitting image', 'black adapter', 'the young ones' etc.), but I enjoyed the usual ingredients like this. If there is nothing else, it could be an option to provide alternate comedy. Although I found it sad, Ben Elton's choices turned against both this and Beni Hill. Well, the family-based comedy has disappeared from our screen, but has it left us? See the latest TV schedule. Drop all soap and reality. The rest of the comedy looks at tens of thousands, which means they are jammed with oath, physical jokes and clear sexual references. And they're not funny from far away. <br /> <br /> 'Alternative comedy' boom was good in many ways, but there was a dark side. These are the old sitcoms shown in the old form, Spike mimics as gifted writers and actors, and finally led to an unexpected drill like 'Little Britain' and 'TTBangbang' (Heaven helps us). If it does not break, do not fix it!
