The most impressive and, for me, at least, Anthony Minghera's best picture winner is "The English Patient" is the most powerful element, in the mid-90's, when Hollywood was losing its nerve, a movie was created in Grand New Projects, Which made films like "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962) and "The Ten Commandments" (1956) Danta, very strong sign of the wonderful glory? "English patients" made these films so powerful that much more. It is a magnificent feeling, an extended running time that does not seem to be quite long, and interesting and interesting with the past and the story. <br /> <br /> In the sense of how it was designed like "The English Patient", "The Godfather: Part II" (1974), based on a novel of the same name, Michael Ondayeze. It combines two stories: past and present, and it's moving around all the title characters: In the second year of World War II, an English patient. Ralph Fiennes has played an English patient, who has been animated by the plane crash and is taking care of a nurse's disassembled church, performed by the surprise act by Juliette Enoch. Along with his rash-voice, binding with a disturbed patient, humble came to know about his past when a stranger (Waleem Dafo) came and asked two men to know each other. <br /> <br /> It's just a two beautiful fabulous story that shapes this picture. Another flashy kid said, the patient's past, before he was lying on the bed and died in bed. The present story has been associated with the patient's past and his love relationship, which sadly changed his life forever. <br /> <br /> To be intelligent, "English Patient" is a boyfriend's story which combines an epic space sensation and excellent combination. I was really appreciated about the love story between Ralph Fiennes and Christian Scott Thomas, how passionate it was, and how bright it was to be shown on the screen. Usually in love stories like Minghail's next "Cold Mountain" (2003), romantic elements are far more passionate than emotionalism. Some scenes of love combine elements that can be associated with Kama more than love, but still, because it is so advanced and developed and not absorbed beyond the proportion, we can believe that there is a sure, true love. It reminded me of "Vertigo" (1958), a reminder of how well filmmakers and actors gave us to believe that these two were genuine people who fell in love with each other. <br /> <br /> The performance around was great. I was particularly enthralled by performance by Juliet Binoche, who passed the Oscar home for her performance in the next year. I liked Will Duffo, like a suspicious character, that he's always playful. And of course I'm not able to give up Phoenix and Scott Thomas and their two very passionate lovers. <br /> <br /> Despite my great enthusiasm for this epic, if I could describe it, I would be unhappy. The perfect film. I have two eyebrows that have two errors. Number one, it's a little longer and because of my second complaint, there are some unnecessary sub-slots. I am not particularly interested in the second love story between Bancache and New York Andrews bombs expert In my studies, I have been convinced that this plot element comes from the original book and I am sure it worked perfectly there, but in the film, does it seem a little? Confused and the relationship between the two characters was not fascinated by me. I was much more interested in her relationship with Fiennes character and her two leading actresses. <br /> <br /> However, these two errors are easily usable even if they are slightly slow. Those who kept aside, the "English Patient" was a great success. To me, it was like an insane mixture between "Casablanca" (1942) and "Lawrence of Arabic" (1962), one of the two extraordinary and good films, and this effective combination was appropriate for my time. It's a real shame that Anthony Mingela has left us. She was really a gifted film maker. All these evidence is required.
