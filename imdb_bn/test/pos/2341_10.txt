A truly accurate and unglamourous look in modern day life. It can be set to any city in the United Kingdom. <br /> <br /> I live in a housing estate in Glasgow and can have a very good relationship with this movie. <br /> <br /> Sadly situation and character are all realistic but not predictable. <br /> <br /> Actors are probably trustworthy, I felt like I was spying on my neighbors. It was a close dive in the life of fragile and hopeless people. I was very moved by a few scenes. <br /> <br /> I like the way to shoot this image. <br /> <br /> Overall, this image must be seen.
