As an English teacher, I appreciate a movie that does more than tell stories. Good films, like good literature, think, think, reflect and predict. This picture makes me three. Mr. Jensen took the risk and used symbols, symbols and striking turning points for many of his characters. I like this thing that, despite choosing the characters in the pictures, I do not see teenage looks or painful like other movies. Acting is quite good and the actors seem to share a good chemistry with each other. Nice soundtrack, you can not listen to the radio with the song. This is a reconciliation with life / spontaneous road trip film which is more deserving than just the second eye.
