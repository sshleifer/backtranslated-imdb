This particular movie was that I wanted to see in the theater, but it was not nearly as close. When I finally hired it in the summer of 2001, I was so happy that I went out and bought the DVD soon. Boney Hunt and Don Lake did a great job with script and wonderful to listen to the audio commentary included in the DVD. They've really done a great job to make you caring characters. I really felt a cyclone in seeing these pictures with sadness, anxiety and joy. Based on the comments made in the movie, this image does a great job of showing the importance of the family (an annoyance in today's film) which reflects the direction of Bonnie Hunt. David Duchovny showed me here to provide a wonderful performance with some beautiful poetry scenes that have life beyond Fox Mulder. I highly recommend you give this movie a look. I really appreciate these photo-makers. They gave me a wonderful part of the cinematic look that I would recommend to all my friends. I have seen many movies over the years and it is very rare that after watching a movie I came away from this feeling of satisfaction. I will see this year and time again over the years. Returning to me reminds me that there are still filmmakers who would sincerely know how to please their movie viewers. Thanks !!
