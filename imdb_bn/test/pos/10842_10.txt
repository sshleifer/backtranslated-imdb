This is one of the best lesbian film I've ever seen! This series brought the joy and sadness of true love. Lesbian lesbian lesbians set in the 1800s and the amazing look of will Cast expects were beyond! Rachel Sterling is an extraordinary actress, I've never seen her work, but her film screenplay connects me with feelings of heart disease, pain and love. One thing I think is most important is that I connect with any character to watch. If you suspect seeing this picture, think twice! It will see a series. Better to make the BBC again! We liked a gay movie which illustrates true love and hurts. I imported this DVD in Canada and I was so thrilled to buy it.
