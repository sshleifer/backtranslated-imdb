Peter Lorre was born with a line like Stephen Dennel: "Mr. Smith, you can not hold my wife in such a way." And "I told you not to keep the monkey in the house!" For this movie the poster is a humble green and Peter Lohar layer that does not want you to go to its Penalty colony / island. This movie is not available on DVD though it is a classic and rarely shown on TV. Just what is the relationship between Stephen Daniels and Monkeys? Why the monkey makes him so annoying. We will never know. The film should be painted by somebody and quote should be made in a knot video. The film was reprinted in the 1950s, and some of Peter LÃ¶hr's films spend any text in this film. Casablanca was right near the corner. Bougert could have lived on that island, but there was no budget for him
