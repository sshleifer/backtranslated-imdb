We've bought DVDs for "Walking with Dinosaurs" and they are often delighted with these very well done topics. <br /> <br /> Many DVDs offer the minimum minimum offer today ... The feature itself and possibly another language (which does not help viewers at all but makes it easy for companies to watch DVDs in more than one market). <br /> <br /> So in the case of WWD. There are so many wonderful extra and good ideas that even * Navigation Menu * Attractive "Making of DVD" smiles every day intros laughing Sunny Sound and video quality is awesome And of course the story and the content ... Any dinosaur lover could know more? I mostly broadcast TDC (narrated by Avari Brooks) and then saw almost half of the DVD (as described by Kenneth Brangh). As far as possible, I can say that the version of the broadcast is described in most American letters, (ie, in a section of T. Rex mother tongue, "tired of the attention of men and women", and Brooks says, "honeymoon is over") and cut some of the nearby doll works. I like the brune version simply because it is more complete <br /> <br /> Overall, a great price and wonderful production. The BBC and the crew that made this gem made much of Cudo.
