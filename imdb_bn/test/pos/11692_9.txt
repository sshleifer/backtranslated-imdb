The beauty of the problem (Kraska v nesnázích) is not a great title. What exactly did all the descriptions of this movie fail to achieve? An adult fairy tale A poor girl is wooed by a princess. "Girl", Marcela, played by the stunning Anna Gissolova, has a charming Hupite beauty, it is a red hair, face and an image that is initially, sexually and continuously fascinating. She has a husband, but they have sex. Children hear the romance through the walls. It is rough and passionate, because the sex of the working class is often portrayed in the film. But acknowledge it to us that it is a thing that unites them in an inconsistent marriage. Husband, a professional car thief, is finally caught and jailed. We do not know how we knew this marriage, but he is not a high class. But she loves beautiful, intelligent (we guess) and her superb and stable kids. She is more qualified. And he could get his deserve life - finally. (No spoiler!) After her husband is sent to jail, she is forced to move back with her mother. Mother has a disgraceful second husband (refer ugly stepfather). She is a real horror show. He is a child abuser being the borders of children. She is passionate about cleanliness, but the falsely farts at the table, always demands modesty and decorations from children. He is truly socially harmful to the lower class. Mom keeps with her, like Marcela's husband, at least she's lusty - stylish but horny. Controversial, confusing, layered characters make this film so powerful and attractive. These characters have errors, some were driven by classes, by some innate characters. The description of this error and character is one minute charming and the next abusive. Through the rapidly changing terrain of the audience, the audience discusses class, sex, ambition, commitment and the contradictory feelings of a role as mother and wife. Like the bottom line, children may also be victims of many movies such as "Thekar Than Water (Blondband)", the excellent movie. What is the best for the children to be the best? Who is our salvation and the future? He has appeared in several films of the Pan of Laboratory to May Children of Men's. These films have played in the film. The foreign movie recognizes the complex ethics that life is misleading, cruel, unfair and like adults, we must definitely get our work together to pass some perfect passage to the next generation. If we give our neutral intelligence, then we can lose ourselves and the world in this process. What is the class of classical characters in Kraska V. nesnázíic? What is the class? What is the class? What is the nature of the fabric of its character? This film is completely like the last two shots, which inspired me incredible and unexpectedly. An American film seems so subtle and intelligent to compare this comparison. Americans sometimes seem to lack the lack of consideration of the human nature's rebellion set resolution. But here, combined with the spectacular fairy tales for hazardous adults, interesting moral questions Not fooled by simple stories; This is a very nice movie.
