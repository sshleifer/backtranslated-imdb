"When I die, someone will kill me, and if they do not, then what is the difference? So the philosophy of life (or lacking there) is limited to Sergio Leon's" Dollar Trilogy "less than the classic and the least fun. On the other hand, three apparently evil gunmen entered the western city, and with the help of the menacing gloves, they were all unhappy people hiding in the house Each of the three beers of these three beers will notice an interesting similarity to the character of Leone for a few dollars. There is a guy in Eastwood's fifteen, one of Lee Van Clay's black suit and is like working on the Jean Marie Volt's indoors. No. They are a mysterious as soon as they are known as strangers <br /> <br /> This is a completely different story. <br /> <br /> Leon's The Good, The Bad, and The Orleans In a clear copy, three gunmen are again waiting for hidden treasure. Again again there are hunters and Mexican bandits. The Stranger (George Hilton) is a fantastic supercollo giftor to shoot a gentleman like a director general. After the award of Bundit Montero (Gilbert Rowland) But when the Montero gang stole three lakhs of gold in gold coins, the stranger got separated from his normal line. <br /> <br /> Ad Banker's corrupt bank executive, surrounded by three, Clayton. He also wants money for himself. But to hide the money, the only person who knows where to shoot. Now the only source of hiding place is a medalion that shows a family authentic. The game also finds treasure before nobody else. And no gun can play. <br /> <br /> With lots of gunfight, boxing, and double cross, the action takes you with these three final showdown repopes, painted three ways to hide the hidden treasure of Allah, and ugly - but with a twist <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is not as good as Leon's film, but ultimately who blames it, is not it? This movie is fun - 60 seconds nihilism, Spaghetti Western Style. There is no rule, no permanent loyalty, and there is no right or wrong - just treasure and it takes it to get it. And, even though the movie is not classic, in the end, of course. Hey, maybe we can all get 100 pieces in pieces. <br /> <br /> <br /> It is fast, furious, and worth the look.
