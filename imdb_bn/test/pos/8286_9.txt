"Chipmun Adventure" is one of the greatest animated movies of the 1980s. Alvin and Chipmunce always showed some interest to me, because they really got me rock and roll. Chipmunks have no bad features in one. Alvin is really the star and all the coolest look. Theodore is a lovable sensitive one. Then there Simon (my personal favorite), a smart party who is often the party worm. I like the chipat a lot. Brittany, who is like Alvin, who is always trying to become so popular. Then there is Alan, who likes sweet, sensitive and food like Theodore. Genet is the only chip that is not like his opponent; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The first full-length movie by Chippans is David Sevill, who is going on a business trip to Europe and while leaving the boys with Miss Miller, he is leaving the boys. While playing an arcade game, Allin wins against the British and then says that if he has money, then he wants to race around the world globally. Unknown to the children, Claus Fertiyen and his sister Claudia, trying to bring the world of diamonds to cash in exchange for cash, heard the conversation and said they would run for the $ 100,000 worldwide. Alvin and Brittany take it and go to the nation. <br /> <br /> There are many great songs in this adventure movie. The theme for the film "Off to the World" was made for the song. Then one of my favorite songs in the movie is "Getting Profitable". "My Mother" is perhaps the most favorite song in the movie, but it always cries to me. The only cover song used for the movie "Ulley Bouleley" (the rest was completely original). Then, of course, "The Boys and Girls of Rock and Roll", in my opinion, the movie must be one of the greatest music numbers in history. <br /> <br /> I was watching this movie very often, until my record was tapped. I still see the movie, though. This is really a fun movie, which is going for a holiday abroad for the first time. It gives you an idea of ​​what kind of things you would expect for a world tour. Certainly one of my childhood movies, and I would recommend to fans of 80s and fans of Alvin and Chipmunes.
