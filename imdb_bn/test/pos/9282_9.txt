This is the first movie I've seen from Singapore and it's cool. If you do not know much about Asia, its language and culture, then this movie may be a little confusing for the non-informants. As an Asian-American doubling twice the number of Asian languages ​​(one among them Mandarin) and some Asian American Studies classes, this film was easier for me to understand, but besides this kind of knowledge, I believe this movie as long as you remember That's an upcoming age movie. The film must surely be valuable to see what kind of teenage teenagers in Singapore are struggling and looking at what they are dealing with. This is an extraordinary upcoming movie, but is depicted and shown in more artistic and original ways. The actor is outstanding.
