Kate Gulden starred as one of the most nominated actresses of the last decade of this century, and Merrill Strip (outside of Africa) also acted as the most talented actress. He is wonderful that every part that he plays. The pride and joy of Yale graduated American film. <br /> <br /> Kate's health is getting worse and her husband George, starring actress and Oscar winner William Hart (Smoke, Kiss of the Spider-Man), has a hard time with her real bad health, and her daughter's help Wish you Poor girl Allen Gulden, Renee Zelger (Jerry Maguire) has much more than expected ways. There is no break! The story takes a very realistic view of a parent's illness. The only girl in this movie has to keep her life alive to live the lives of others. There is always a person in such a family who performs such responsibilities. Alan is angry at the beginning of the film, but at the end of time she ended the burden of her family's understanding of her mother's life. He even asked his mother: How do you do every day, inside and out and nobody will notice it? That's what women do, I call invisible work a lot. Moreover, we make it clear, we amend, we amend, we extend, we celebrate, we are best friends, we believe, mistress, preacher, disciplinarian, sensitive. Some of us, this movie has perfect education like both women, psychological pillars for the whole family and also invisible! That Kate came, and many women in our society. Many of us have already moved to that stage of life when our parents' age and death. I was there. They just went too young. I thanked my parents, but I did not understand them, as well as when they had to play their role, and walk with their shoes. This movie mirrors the reality of life. Perhaps it is sad, but life is like that. Harvard professor George Zagrate, who believes that his work is more important than all others, and has a very "master / servant" mentality for women in his life. He is not strong enough to handle. If you want to see good acting and the reality of life, do not miss this movie. Favorite view: Restaurant Kate, Violin and all coming. Making a table out of broken China. I'm so symbolic! We all broke the ship! Dear Quotation: George: "It just moves, you understand that you're really going to breathe." George "You have a Harvard education but where is your heart?" <br /> <br />
