Alfred Hetcock's "Sabotur" (1942) (Do not get confused with another hitcoug movie "Subotage" created in 1936, which is a completely different plot) is not Suspense's greatest movie. It is not the level of "Vertigo" (1958) and "Rebecca" (1940) breding atmosphere and it is certainly not "psychological" (1946) psychological effects and acting talents. It has dosage thrills, adventure and a nail wind climax. Confession, two leads, quite weak It is easy to understand why Gary Cooper wanted the role of Robert Cummins for Hitcoi and Barbara Stanwick for the role played by Priscilla Lane. Also, in the Cumming Patriotic lecture it has been said that (written by Dorothy Parker) has been badly updated and the bearded lady is clearly confronted with the circus trumpet, which is clearly false. However, the last half-hour view of your seat, the climax on the Statue of Liberty is very well done and the prediction of the movie "North by Northwest" (1959) Two villains, Auto Kruger and Norman Lloyd are very good and a fantastic sequence of fire in the beginning of the air cycle. This is not the best hit of the movie, but it is one of the most entertaining entertaining ones.
