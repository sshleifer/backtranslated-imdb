I'm really impressed, so. I expect cheesy gamer humor and nothing else. <br /> <br /> All right, there's a ton of beautiful geeky humor. But the movie is so well made. Acting is pretty good. <br /> <br /> Dialogues, sometimes gamer's cheesy, I guess to take care of the gamer crowd, that's not bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I did not check the rules, it was cool. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The game is well done to transform the real world from the world. A male character playing a male sometimes by a woman, and will sometimes play by himself. Very cute, I thought <br /> <br /> <br /> The man who agreed to play the game, but he forgot that the woman was good for many laughs. She even called the tag at one stage, and she is going to play the role of female (sorry, I did not see her name, although she did great.) The guy always tried "get some things", a little tedious, but I guess the gamer's humor was more. <br /> <br /> The movie was very liked. Lighthearted Fun! I did a very good job and I'm saying that as a movie fan, not a gamer (and I'm not a DD player.) I was just as hopeless as I said. <br /> <br /> Movies do not often hold me back, listening to them while I was working on my computer. This one held my attention. I could not give much praise to a movie.
