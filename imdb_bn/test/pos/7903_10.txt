Vanaja (2006), written and directed by Rajesh Domalpalli, is an extraordinary film from South India. Mamta Bhuiyan plays the 15-year-old Bhanja, who lives in rural areas with her loving but alcoholic father. If he is going to be successful in life, he will have to overcome the burden of lower caste and poverty. <br /> <br /> I went to this movie that a bad girl torn by society hopes for the script. This "Vanaja" does not show us. Young girl is attractive, intelligent and ambitious. He will not take his fate with tears or simple resignation. She wants to be successful, and it is clear that she will not succeed, even though in spite of discrimination. <br /> <br /> The actor is from his custom Mr. Drama Palli is acting miracles. The role of Mamta Bhuiyan is remarkable, and Urmila Damanagari, a wealthy zamindar who was known as Srimati Rama Devi, is a former famous classical dancer. <br /> <br /> In the film, Veena learns from South Indian classical dance. , He did in real life. I could not say how good Bhanja dance was in Indian standards, but many dance scenes were spellbinding. (Do not think Bollywood - it's classical dance, it's different from ballet, because ballet dancers take away the heels from the floor. Sound Indian dance, Heil is the primary contact point.) <BR /> <br /> This is a movie that will be missed Will not be It will work in DVDs, but the theater screen will be good because the dance will be shown better. However, if the DVD is your only option then see it similarly. Just do not forget to see it.
