Above all, the legendary listen to perform this wonderful and timeless music is very perfect joy. This movie and soundtrack is a Tour de ball. Ray Charles is unique and amazing. I really adored the film as it was really inspirational and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Jamie Fox has been one of Hollywood's premiere actors, as clearly shown in Ray and she should get an Oscar for this role, it's an unprecedented Actually, everyone who works in this movie should congratulate everyone. I really like Kerry Washington who played an exceptional wife ... Ray Charles apparently got married. Regina King is a good actress and an extraordinary Sharon Warren who plays a young mother. <br /> <br /> In all truth I used to say that this whole project was secretly arranged. The complete cast is perfect, great screenplay and extraordinary settings ... Crew plays a key role in making director Taylor Huckford and Crooe do an excellent job to bring Charles Charlie's life to the screen. This year my picture, of course, is one of the best biography films ever made.
