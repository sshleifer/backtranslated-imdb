Many believe that Waiko has been a long time ago. Most people have probably been involved in their minds of "godhead leader" David Quorsch and the burning composition on the ground after a long stagnation. Many believe that the quorse was some sort of crazy who thought he was God. He was accused of being a child molester and his followers had the achievement for the breakdown and death. Also, many feel that the building was burning when the FBI attacked the Mount Carmel Center. Most people think that the religion was blamed because it did not agree with the FBI on reasonable terms. Most people think that the community was fooled by the quorse and followed with what he had said. Nothing can be far from the truth, because after a nightmare strong evidence and this kind of document proves that much! <br /> <br /> This is one of the most balanced experiments in the event that happened. It is much more thorough and very detailed than most people receive in mainstream media. In the face of many people, this documentary will reveal that ATF, the FBI, and the United States high level people who were unfair, cruel and fraud and did not have David Quaresh and his followers. Whether Corsham and Davydians are only protecting their constitutional rights, and have fully violated high powers and rape those rights. There was no basis for the AFT compound storm; AF shot the first and they shot helicopters from the unarmed men, women and children !! Even more frustrating events occurred when they entered the Carmel Mountains. See it for yourself and you develop and develop new perspectives of the US government. There is infrared footage that clearly shows that FBI burning composers are shooting with machine guns for men, women and children. It will bleed your blood. It will really make you angry. It will make you wonder what kind of people this country runs. Finally, it will surprise you that what you are saying every night is nothing but true and true. This video is scary and I highly recommend it if I can get it on it. This documentary is not required to purchase; It is available for free on Google Video!
