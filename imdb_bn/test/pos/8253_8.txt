Pleasantness! It never pretends to be an excellent composition, but it is a miniature gem of the seventeenth-century British comedy. The producers wanted to sell it abroad, it is an American (late character actor Richard Jordan) star, but at least he does not type in normal soft Hollywood hunk. British character acting talent cream around her, led to an extraordinary hungry and superior David Niven. <br /> <br /> Ivan of Niven gets nasty naturally one of the best liners and all the best feedback shots. He managed to be surprisingly dangerous and terribly dangerous. At the sniper club's moment when he faces the charming and Richard Jordan will be the threat to the audience who think of Niven as a light drawing room comedy star. We see how Ivan earned his nickname, he was filled with real strength and brutality. All the more surprising given was how ill Niven was. Shortly after filming this production, he lost his ability to speak amyotrophic lateral slerosis (which is known as low gaichor disease). This is the last picture, where you can listen to your voice, where the comedy is dubbed by the dominant Sid Caesar. <br /> <br /> You can show seventeen movies and many familiar faces on television beside him. L. K. Somara (The real seventeenth era in his political spatial way, in the wrong bibo mode), Oliver Tobiah, Michael Engelis, Brian Croucher, Davy Kai etc. How much did Davy make the biggest smile to keep a security force captured by creating a phone? Call. "You're crying ?! ... bloody dial-in-disk! You're gullible!" <br /> <br /> Great shot at London street location; The movie creates a durable Patina time capsule with a round round-dial manual handset, "Bloemi, Gove!" Driven black cages. Modeling cockneys, and women and gents deeply dodgy seventeen reverse leisure wear and all manner of hair style. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the previous Ealing comedies of the era, the 'hero' allows him to move away from his crime and flee to the life of the sun. How many times have changed! The morality code by which miserliness in the film has always been punished for seventy years, the situation of their Panti Green Income was threatened by their anti-authoritarianism and firm capitalist 'snake charming'. The establishment of suitable fit cat traders. Pinky is as close as the bird with his ill acquired gains, unkempt and free as we are pleased. Compare Lavender Hill with the end of the mobile <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Perfect for viewing midnight after closing pubs; If you are a young age, feeling sensitive and always wanted to see David Nivon in a McDonald's branch, secretly uses an American with deceptive telescopes!
