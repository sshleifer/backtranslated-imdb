I did not write a review at the age but reviewed the TV shows, live shows below and I felt that I would have to give my opinion on this movie! It is, I think, the perfect comedy movie. It's a lack of line in the story of the boyfriend Dove (I'm not really saying prosperity with Gina Carbona's love? Or he and Eddie are being nude there ... not love) that the rest of the comedians come out well, that one of the comedy films must be defeated There is a lack of natural conflicts ... unless you have poisoned this guest and other comedies from Guest Vomit Like the pictures will run as a sham ... No, this movie is simply set up and is successful in achieving one thing and only one thing: a smile to laugh. What do you need from a comedy movie? Smile This movie laughs laughing without smiling like a lot of other comedy films. That's how I called it, the only perfect comedy movie has been created so far and I will never see this beautiful movie! I applique rick and ade on such gorgeous talent!
