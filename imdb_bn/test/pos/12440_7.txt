The happiest days of your life show a traditionally harmful and high-class tweet-fashion show like Britain's greatest comedy all-time show. Generally it is a perfect-stop tour of Stary English behavior that provides a great setting for girls only in DTT. Margaret Rutherford, Elster Sim and - especially! - Jose Grenfell has all the fantastic, many of us laughing, because they reveal the horrors of how they are dealing with them. When the movie continues, the schools roam around and parents eagerly walk around for the high points of the crackers. <br /> <br /> At this point I will specifically mention Jos√© Grenfell and his wonderful character Miss Gossage He is so extraordinary innocent, stupid, forgiving and void that he seems to steal the whole movie. She flirts with a male teacher ("Call me sausage!") When she gives the film the greatest laugh While some film is slow or date, and is not always very involved, it still breaks for most of its flashing and rare romance. Good for a stupid, harmless gigabyte. <br /> <br /> 7/10
