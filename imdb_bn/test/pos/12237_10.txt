I think this is an extraordinary movie ... I saw it at the age of 4 to 4 at the age of 8 ... but it was a lot of nightmares. I especially got what I got for the guy because it was "another" and like his friends. I'm 12 years old, and still I get nightmares about this day. I can not sleep right now because I'm thinking about it. I love this movie, but it's so scary! Although I definitely love this movie, I have very good memories from it. Cutting is very good acting in this movie. Surprisingly, I did not realize that it was her! I think the graphics were very high, the opposite of what some other people think
