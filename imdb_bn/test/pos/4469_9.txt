Lucio Flachi, known for its graphic horror films, like The Bound and Jabboo, a Italian gaelo (with Argentine and bavo companies), an Elsaard in a man's skin, and his best works, Dow torture a duckling many years ago. This movie contains all elements of the Italian mystery / thriller genre that is known as Giallo, but the audience only holds every character with a skeleton in his own closet. This makes you a lot of intelligence as a movie detective. Who is killing boys in the city? The young rich woman who is so annoyed that she is subjected to sexual assault to the last victim, a journalist who wants to commit a crime with a good shot shot, mentally disabled girl, local witch, and the town stupid to the city dwellers. .. The list goes on, and you have to put a mental note like a true game to play and solve. The themes of this movie were very brave and were done with this perfect Italian style in the early 1970's. It is sure that an American studio will not even be considered to make such a firm content film, and that's why looking at such a satisfactory film (despite some unusual accent choices for dubbing) and it will certainly discuss the long-term meaning after that. Not saying, they do not create it anymore, so get a copy and enjoy such an important movie!
