<br /> <br /> I have seen this movie shortly after I released the video in 1995, I said, Julie was not a Daniel, she never gave it a chance and said it was horrible. <br /> <br /> But after 5 years, it's in Disney and I see it again. And as I made it as it is not as bad as I can find. Miyagi is still like MiGi, like Cool, so Musical scores are still as happy as before. And Swan's character is not bad, considering his performance script is quite good. It beat the third installment by a wide margin. So, my original rating has increased 4 to 7.
