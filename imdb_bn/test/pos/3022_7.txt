After you've seen enough movies, other movies that are very small do not remind you. Still a bit annoying movie if it was a watchable. I had to stop from time to time and come back later. Like "the silence of the sheep," it shows the characteristics of a serial killer, who has kidnapped someone and kept him in his chamber chamber, as the main character of "Flatlinus" discovered the world of dreams through an experimental method. How does the superposition of dream sequences create this film, as it finds a situation and landscape characters, in which literally something can happen. And beyond this continuity and "do not need to create knowledge", which makes it a movie maker's dream too. <br /> <br /> The only thing that seems a little far away is that it is expected that the serial killer can release or exorcism of his demons. You actually feel sympathy for the little boy inside the person, but clearly the innocence of the boy can not be distinguished from the horrific acts of humans. You must pay attention to save man from his loss.
