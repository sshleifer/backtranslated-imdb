Wonderful, wonderful, brilliant, fantastic The four adjectives that rely on my head when I start describing "The Right Runner". The adaptation of Khaled Hossaini's book has already kept many minds, he actually verifies that he himself broke down in tears after looking after the Prime Minister. Before I see the advanced screening of "The Kite Runner" I must say before I start reading the book. So my judgment and opinions may be slightly favorable. <br /> <br /> Firstly, I say it, although in my opinion the book was better than the final product of the film, it is not bad adaptation. I mean a two-hour movie that got the appropriate response. It can be seen only in the final twenty minutes, but what has succeeded in this book? It has captured the minds and imagination of millions of people all over the world. The feeling of remorse by Khaled Hossaini magic magic, joy, sorrow, pain and loyalty is disturbing in our imitation. Especially in the first scene, when young Hasan says, "If you tell me to eat dirty, then I know. But I know you will not ask me." Such a touch line, many hearts are bound to capture. Two young actors were brilliant, absolutely fantastic. Especially the boy who played the innocent but faithful Hassan refused to give up the boy's stomach, because he promised his best friend that he would bring him, only to insult him with big words and to use him sex, and then to her Revolt by her best friend as broke. The whole thing is so sensitive that it can not wet your eyes. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is good to save the last bit. When he learned about his true relationship with Aamir Hassan and Hassan was not bothered at first and last, he was frustrated with the feeling of helpless, lonely and remorse that he was facing Amir. Khaled Hossain in the book dedicates some 10-12 pages to describe the description of Amir's mind in this post. But when he was ready for him at the end of the film, Amir stood in front of his commander's father-in-law, his nephew Sohrab, son of Hasan. The last good was deserved and I would definitely appreciate it well. It is felt in the torch interview from one generation to another. <br /> <br /> Coming from technical side. First of all, acting. Just a sound-fantastic From the beginning to the end, young Hasan and Amir, their father, his friend Rahim Khan. Everyone has been fantastic, especially young Hassan. Secondly, the direction was amazing, some fantastic camera work was combined. Background score was also impressive. From the beginning, from credit track to end credits, and especially when Amir likes Western and Islamic festivals in Pakistan, especially in the mosque. <br /> <br /> Everybody is clearly one of the best movies, and we welcome all these inspired inspired films that we have been covering for the whole year. 9/10 !!!
