It takes too much for my film to reach the worst particle for a movie, which has already been overturned and the reinstated copyright copy of the films has not been taped for the sake of the world. But this movie has turned into my 'magic movie' list. To become a 'magic movie', it must release every string of my clearing which I can only define as 'joy' and 'complete satisfaction'. If this movie is my mind and not deeply tuned for personal bonding, then my head and anyone who has made this share have taped the fiber, after the explosion of 90, it will be like one of its 'Dead Rev. Scenes' film Exsti craze. In this way the movie did not come to me anyhow. It reached me and pulled a little bit that I thought was dead for a long time and pushed me for my own criticism. I have forgotten how long I've seen something that made me feel good inside. I firmly recommend watching this movie.
