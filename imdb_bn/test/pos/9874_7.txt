For some reason, I always enjoy movies that people hate, when I do not really think they are bad - and it's one of those movies. In this film, I think it is very critical, I'm not really a bad movie. In fact, I think this is one of the best sequels. Halloween: The Curse of the Michael Maywers "Halloween begins on the night before, where Michael had brutally killed Jamie Lloyd (who was captured in the 5th episode" Man in Black ") after giving birth to his baby, then we introduced the Strong family, Which is now coincidentally residing in the old Mayor's house (which seems to have changed in every film). The original character, Tommy Doyle, is currently an adult boy who survived the real killings. To protect Jackie's son from being an evil godman, they have to fight together, while Michael himself drives himself to death with an old ritual where he is in Huddfeld A whole family must be sacrificed. <br /> <br /> Surely the best signals in the series One of the, in my opinion, and I did not understand all of the hatred it has gotten. It had some great mystery, an interesting plot (but sometimes confusing, I will accept), here and there some scary moments, and a lot of pride and Knife slashing makes all your grooms happier. Not all acting was particularly great, but it was enough for me to believe. Marianne Hagan is the leader and she is very fond of. Paul Rud plays a big up Tommy Dalele, and plays his part very talented and nicely. Supporter left the rest (without the great Donald Pleasance) Praise is not appreciated, but it was not too bad, consider all things. I'm still not sure why Michael's murder was completely necessary to explain, but it was finally finalized and I did not get annoyed with binding everything together. The open conclusion was also lazy, but there could be some more. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie's infamous "Producer's Cut", its original cut, and I think that in some cases it's good. It further explains Thorn's displeasure with Michael Drive and some extra scenes that really helped support the film, and in the end my opinion was even better. The studio cut of this movie was more natural than our conclusion. I want that dimension will release this alternative version of the movie, because I personally think it is good. That possibility is very slim though. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Halloween: Curse Michael Maywers" is a very good sign and please all fans of the series. This movie is not the best of all horror films, but if you want to see Michael his thing, it is certainly worth it. Just do not expect brightness, and you will enjoy it. 7/10
