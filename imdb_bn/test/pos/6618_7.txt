This documentary combines the interviews of team members and other influential people and identifies the source and life of the Jeffar Skboard Team using the original film shot in the 1970s (originally by Craig Stacey). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> In the 1970s, a residual local attraction of the Pacific Park was abandoned, which left many beaches with open peas and other dangers. The poor children living in the area were not better than the surf, and they were better despite their surroundings (or perhaps due to). Because of the waves being removed in the afternoon, they started skateboarding to meet their time, and during those years empty swim pools of their drought page created their surfing backgrounds, which today lead to creating their main stream vertical skrobboarding styles. <br /> <br /> I saw that the film was much more covered than surfing than me, which seemed like a bonus, since I did not really know about surfing or skeboarding before watching the film. The soundtrack was not surprising, as well as well. I loved how these kids just followed their emotions and usually ended well for the experience. The parts that did not work so well for me, they were forced to create the play, were somewhat compelled and the team had a low cost price (although it was probably the only way they grew up to the streets in the street). This does not mean that they did not have significant impact, but it seems to have only other reasons. One note: When the films are used explicitly, the camera is mostly affected by vomiting in most cases. This movie is often guilty, so if you are so poor, be warned. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this picture to anyone, but especially with anyone who is scoutboarding and / or surfing in their history. <br /> <br /> seen on 5/11/2002
