This little John Ford is one of the best artists in the cast of a Western cast but with no 'big' cast. It seems like a documentary that it shows the journey towards the west side of Mormons, and it may be the most authentic of all the Ford movies (after the "The Sun Shines Bright" year) <br /> <br /> <br /> < There is a sort of plot, (a group of bank robbers join the train at Wagon at one point), but the dramatic highlighting of the movie is almost incidental. Ford's stock company's superb performance, (Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Junior, Ward Bond, Jane Darwell, etc.) has added significantly to the cosmicity of the film, and the film comes in full physical star performances with Juan Drew's Denver. At least for the recognition of the Oscars in "The Last Picture Show", eventually there was a lot more acting actress than the credits given to pay for credits such as bonds and Johnson. He said to himself, 'This has not happened with Nicar.' Add to the fantastic location photography of Bert Glennon and you have a real part of America that can not be anyone other than Ford. This is a film that truly honors pioneers of America and full of feelings and feelings.
