22. JOE (Drama, 1970) Joe (Peter Boyle) is a racist factory worker who is known to hate "Hippie and Nye ** ers". He met Bill, a businessman who murdered the boyfriend of his intoxicated young man Jill (Susan Sordan). Jill runs away and joins a hippie commune outside of the city. Joe for bills help Their search leads them to the most awkward sections of the city, where both internal hatred and hatred of men are tested. <br /> <br /> Critique: It is directed by John G. Avidason's first sleep burst hit (An extraordinary show that included: 'Rocky', 'The Karate Kid', 'Split-Image', 'Barney Weekend'). The film was so interesting that it included themes and concepts of the faint 60s (Vietnam War, Black Power, Women Lib etc). It has also performed well with Peter Boyle as a Junkie of the first Anthyros of the film. He was always good to play in the fear of great, stupid heavy players, whose abstract idea is applied by his awesome presence (he'll play with Frank Bros's Frank Frank Frankenstein's monster). He reminds me of a small kid stuck in a big, stupid, painful body. The film is a weak script (for example Joe and Bill a little playful at the meeting), but it's a particularly awesome, post-taxi driver. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> " Kill $$$.
