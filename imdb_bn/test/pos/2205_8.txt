I have only praise for this photo. From the beginning to the end it captured the brightness of Stefan Sondheim's musical instruments. I'm a big fan of musical instruments mostly overdone them. This one but my mind changed. I played myself an actor and actor Sweeney and I know how difficult this role is. George Heron has given a remarkable, efficient and round performance that we can give him the highest prize (he is an Emmy and something like this.) He does everything he can to go back to gold. He is so good that it will motivate your mind why he did not win an Oscar in movies. Lansbury is very good and very interesting. Responsible as a sheep beggar and bigha women. All in all a great video. Choose if you can.
