Who are those who star this thing? Never heard of them !! But I'm one of the most fun comedy to run across. It will win the Putz Puller Prize for the parody. Dr. Jakeel starts unreasonable with his powder being wasted and sex became the Findend. In the movie's most interesting scene, he followed the movie with a Livro-powered nurse. Pay attention to PA system in background hospital; Instead of like the MASH system. By accepting this award, the final scene with Hayd laughs me for a few years. Oh ... and "Busty Nurse" is Castro Petersson, who became Elvis, Dark Menstress. <br /> <br /> If you like Mel Brooks Classic Movie (Blazing Saddles, etc.), I doubt that you like it. <br /> <br /> The shame you can not get it anywhere in the DVD. <br /> <br /> It is now available in DVD !!!!! The best thing to do is to wear DVDs !!!!!
