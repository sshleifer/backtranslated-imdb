Before talking about the end of this movie, I will talk about the plot. Some couple named Gerald breaks the relationship with her and goes to Scotland's Craven Casele. A few months later, Kitty and her aunt came to Scotland. Gerald is aged at the Cranwell Castle Kit and she has raised the middle class. There are specific rules for Gerald Castle (the rules have been the same for over 200 years). Gerald does not want them to be, but emphasizes Kinti an excuse. One night caught a glimpse of the monster running on his aunt's yellow. It makes him so scared that he loves and (another excuse) they will have to stay. After trying to enter Gerald, Katrina became more worried, but Gerald picked her up and even more. Then what the key sends for strengthening, he calls his doctor who actually is their friend and his ample. Then they do not feel suspicious, they invite some friends (who does not really do anything). Blah, Blah, Blah Kitty and her aunt are the most mysteries of stories where this street ends. They are different and they try to find each other. But aunt is quarreling over the animal ... here we are all waiting, what is the animal hiding in the shade? ... it's a giant flow !!! What is better than OMG! After seeing the aunt, the frog became literally crazy, oh, I mean that the top of the castle is above the steps. Frogs then jump out an open window. Then we go on a shot from the ground and see every frog gall from us (oh yes this movie was 3-D). But the funny thing to know about is that the window that falls is actually a toy because it's 1/10/10 frogs before taking jump. Then it has been revealed that all this evolution has been done in the fruits of marriage, Blah, Blah and Kitty and Gerald. Then the last shot of this Masterpiece was in the brain of the frog, the only place where he was really happy;).
