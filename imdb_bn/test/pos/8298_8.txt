I'm too serious, I do not misunderstand you, if you do not get a bent for this type of grade, but if you see my first thought on the nature of the creature, then this is a rating of 3 to 4 out of 10, but for me it's a Special kind of stupidity that took me back to a wonderful time in my childhood. You know of this kind of, the memories that do not leave you. Young people like Doug McCallur and Peter Cushing's tunnel are eager to fight wildly animated vivacious animated vivacious animated animal and tribal species. And guys, guys! Now we are all grown up, we can appreciate the most important importance of Caroline Munro and her Hugging Clavaz. <br /> <br /> Yes, my older brother was interested in taking me to this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, the effect is bad, in the case of men, Parrot monster lines and bursts of rubber burst like accessories make us happy. Extensively. And yes, Kushing and working in a wonderful Puddie McClure as they have really been mesmerized by evil mesmerizing at our "core" film. But this is not important, horrible in the weird and strange and glorious color, this eighth core has threatened a special pre-ilm time when kids like me align around the block to see this delightful dirty. 8/10
