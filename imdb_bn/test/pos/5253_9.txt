At the weekend I was a boy and my parents called me to say that both of us wanted to meet them in the movie. When I went there, my mother said that she wanted to see "woman" and asked if my son and I think it was labeled as chick flick. I am reluctant to agree that this is going to be another "First Lady Club" type movie. I want to say that I was really surprised to enjoy the movie from the opening scene of credit. It was a great production and cast their role was perfect. My son and I saw myself smiling through the whole movie and we are glad we saw it. This is a great Saturday movie made for the movie and I highly recommend it to anyone, male or female.
