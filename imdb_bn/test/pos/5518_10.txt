This picture was different. It accepts the story of a common thriller and comes to faith with a different character in a more interesting, deeply observable. Of course, it was nice that the main performance by Andrew McCarthy, helped. Other performance was also quite interesting, although not consistent. The end was something to a bit down, but there were many better moments. Filmmakers have tried a bit differently here - they are not just for obvious coolness and fear. This is a dark movie (not for everyone) but if you want to entertain and do not talk, try it.
