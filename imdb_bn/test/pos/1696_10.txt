Of course I'm going to think it's a great movie. I do not see the time of filming, many people recognized. I was playing the guard in an hour to ask for a cigarette of exercise in the death row. I changed the view of this one. They basically forced it to go to the Rear Gardens and to make the prison straight, and to turn it out and to move it out. The director said, "It's going to take a long time, what you will do." I said, "We have to go inside and hold hands and pull them back. That's how your camera can face when we close it." I also remain in this little prison as my father is also the assistant warden of the security forces. I am the current employee of the Tenancy Depotter of the revisioner as the highest security supervisor of the Rev. Although most movies were a joke, the part I was in was for the sake of reality. Also in the bar scene, the dancer was kicking high in the air and left the stage a real stripper that I used to work with a club called "Classic Cat".
