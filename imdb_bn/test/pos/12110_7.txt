The role of a rare tall Kinski features as Crazie Ling crazed outlaw crazy crazy wanted San Francisco. Kinsky's character has arrested a woman with rape in the old west of a sexual predator, whose mind is nothing but stealing, raping, and killing. This film is probably not a big disappointment for Spaghetti Western fans, but for Cluj Kiski supporters. Overall, it was going to be a great performance from two of the best things in the collection of close kiosks and a great music score from Stalveau Cyprian. <br /> <br /> Another story line that needed to work a lot to be effective, but still fun to see! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Since most of the old movies are being rebuilt today.
