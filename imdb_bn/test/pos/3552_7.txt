Swain (Karen Mourley) looks at the duck bed during a group in this Pre-Hesse code; The Prothom-alo goes out of the lighthouse, then they go out of the main ballroom, then the search is for rare and missing jewelry, as well as other missing ones ... You can say that the tables were not too long, they are still using caption cards many times. Also watch for a new kind of safe that does not need a combination. Good thought plot, no big hole, but no big surprise here. Not bad for an initial bakery movie. Shine finish
