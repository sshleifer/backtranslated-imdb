This show will be my favorite from all the 80's horror TV shows. Tales from Darkside, from the same builders, this show is a rare jewel. If you agree with me, please sign this application, I have started, to find out the word for monsters and find it on DVD. Here is the petitioning address: www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html Some of my favorite episodes will be Glim Glim and Rain Dance. I like the opening article with the monster family. That used to find me! What I have to do to include the DVD creator is to say the sound of the sound before the commercial breaks are there. I do not know if someone remembers that part but it is one of the main things to bring memories back to me. Come on, come on! Worldwide war TV series has already been released from the DVD, so I call the monsters, and the Tales of the Darkdes, and the 13th series on Friday will also be released! We will talk to fans of our hearts! Please spread the word so we need this awesome show on DVD !!!
