A lumberman finds help in finding a young monster. The young takes up with the cottage staff of the camp soon for his own cat. His protesters, known as "Good Time Charlie", initially ridiculed him. The problem arises in the nature of its wild nature and its normal habitat is released again. This film is among the wonderful Disney-style films that showcase the great performance of 50s and 60s, beautiful scenes and some favorite animals. These films were not long, but the attractions of wildlife and human contact included attractive pins. Unlike Disney's animated conversation, animals in this film were true in their own nature. Make great travel film for the western states.
