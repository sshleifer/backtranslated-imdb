This is an incredible movie which starts slowly. It leads you along with thinking it as a standard maudlin family drama. Then, in the second half, a plot twist that is completely transformed into a worldwide story. <br /> <br /> If you are not incapable of filming India, apparently no reason for song and dance routines, stick with this movie. Especially in the beginning of the second half, you get this movie an amazing experience. ****************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************** At the end, the dialogue (Amuddha and MDS) seemed very weak and missed the chance of war as a force to transform the war into the lives of the people. It was mentioned all along, but there was something about the importance of struggle for MDS.
