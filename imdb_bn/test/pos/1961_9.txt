Reverse Edge is a great movie and it is shameful that it has not made a mark for itself in the history of the movie. In the eighteen years there were several sunrise films around the children in school, but all I saw was all; This is certainly the most nihilistic and annoying. The film contains a story that is annoying in its own right, and adds unconventional attitudes about the themes and themes of teenagers' slogans, which lead the story to another level. The film works because the central story is interesting and it has been played by complex characters. The picture starts with a murder. Then we follow the murderer, nickname John, when he goes back to school and tells about what he has done to all his friends. Instead of giving the expected response, most of them rarely react and have a strong response from the killer lanes; It gives the number one priority to clean the person who has the mess in it and to get out of it. Other friends were pressed against the crime, and one of them went to the police a long time ago ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves has a reputation for acting in wood, and for good reason; But he fits this very first role very well and this performance is easily one of his best. Crispin Glover is the biggest standout as a little insane lane. Glover is always standing in every film, and when he's topped; She convinces this movie lead as well. The Dennis Hooper also has another wild role as well as Daniel Rokok and Joshua John Miller in the talented young category of Rev and Glover. The film is a very radioactive feature that sings well with its nihilic voice. The central character is more threatening than killing all 'slacker / stoner' generation and the way that they actually seem to take care of the murder of their friends; And the film that is trying to make a film about modern society is both firm and defined. The picture is a bit funny, because of some character lines; But the humorous black and definitely this picture is not meant to be a comedy. Overall, this is a wonderful and memorable film that is definitely valuable!
