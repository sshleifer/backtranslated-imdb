Academy Award winner 'Cromar v Crimea' follows his divorce with a chic businessman Ted Crumer (Dustin Hoffman) and his marriage wife (Merrill Strip). One day, Ted's wife left him and her son to find a better life, forced Ted to close his son (Justin Henry). Two bonds and very close (but only after some friction), and just as everything is perfect, their wife returns to the town and wants their son's only custody. Then he went to a mission to kill his son from the court and kill him in court. Dustin Hoffman gave an amazing performance with Marilyn Strip and the young Justin Henry is impressive. This is a tragic emotional roller-coaster of a movie, but it's a very well made and inspirational film. Hoffman's Best Actor and Best Female Actress in Strip, along with the 1979 Academy Awards, took the best picture from the Oscars. If you do not think of TierJaker, a great movie to watch 'Krumar v Krummer'. Grade: B +
