This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is about true love and friendship Turning your life around and doing something good for someone else. Thomas B Larsen can play the same role in many other films, but recently we saw him in other roles which he did very well. But what if he plays the same role in other movies? She is perfect for that role. Ulrich Thomsen works very well. These two criminals are the "best friends ever" in a short lifetime. They share everything and do everything they do for each other, whether they cost. When they know that Peter's daughter is being abused, they hold everything (unless you have to do more criminal activity, you can not stop them) and take them to a better place. They can make better they ?? These two men are not masterminds, but their heart is in the right place. I can say that Peter and Carsten are my biggest heroes too ??
