This is a fantastic good documentary. I'm not skunkboarder, especially skateboarding or skateboard culture. But anyway, for almost 2 hours this movie makes me interested in this. <br /> <br /> I would not always say this the most fascinating movie, but for some reason when I was interested in how they started their skateboard clubs and skate in the empty South California pools, I was interested. <br /> <br /> I was also very good in this movie. I did not want to hear more than 70 rock bands, but they felt appropriate for what they were saying.
