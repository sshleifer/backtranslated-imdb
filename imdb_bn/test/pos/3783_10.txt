I have described Woody Allen's Manhattan as perfect as the other day, and he thought it was a great way to describe a movie ... <br /> <br /> I saw only a few movies that I would say perfect. Manhattan one, Robert Olman's Maccabey and Miss Miller and another one and Win Apon is another picture of Time in the West Sergio Leon, which I think is perfect. There are a few, but I can not find any flaw in the three mentioned above, yet I must admit that the taste of three directors has been achieved. <br /> <br /> If there was a movie that I could stand behind and sitting in the house that I would show it to anyone, it should be flawless. <br /> <br /> Correct everything in this film, City Lights, The Great Dictator, The Gold Rush, and Panshop 10 but Chaplin is not the only one, what he has done is touching a level without ridiculous and clear explanation.
