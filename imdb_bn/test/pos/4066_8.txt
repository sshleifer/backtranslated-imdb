With the publication of the showtimes, the drought has become easier in recent times, it is a movie which is a fun and consistent way of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Mitch Preston is a dedicated police. He does not have a dirty Harry type in any way. Is he simply an incredibly attentive person who expresses intolerance in the way of his duty?

Of course, mitch and tray mix are sweet like oil and water and many delightful losses occur. <br /> <br /> We know that Mitch and Tray will be the best friends at the end of the movie. How do the friends and the police think of doing the movie? In fact, it should be said that the short-term refrains from lethal waste and time-honored clichés written by tango and cash.
