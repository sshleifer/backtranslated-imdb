At the first glance of the movie, camera corners immediately think that it is a low budget movie that will carry you in tears or press the stop button. Surprisingly, the story comes forward and is played across the screen in a way that I think is the most related. I made this movie on 7th but most of the time, it seems to be a 10, you can see it, because it is a rare thing that can be communicated with a person's feelings and how life should be shown on a TV. Set. Most of the movies try to forget you for fear of their special effects, twists and turns, this film has actually played a good film supported by an album style story, which most of the time thinks is good waste for a few hours. After all the good work I wish to be the creator of popcorn!
