"Nurse Betty" is a movie that you can not describe in a poster or trailer or comorale. This is a movie that you are walking to hoping to be more mature "fool and dumb", temporarily insane waitress takes a cross-country adventure, when trying to kill him. <br /> <br /> This picture is a wonderful, heartwarming story about chasing their dreams. The good part about "nurse betty" is unpredictable. Director Neil La Boots can never tell you what's going on, using cruel violence for the sake of a different dream and with sensitive drama and humorous comedy.
