This picture is a study piece for my English class, but it makes me amazed at depth and meaning. Since we are closely watching all the information and characters in this film, its love and hatred, warfare, and interesting stories of bias. Story: <br /> <br /> Story: A girl named Asty Patti Bergen fills a fledged prisoner, then she hides her garden in her garden, and they know each other, they Start seeing other qualities, and they love each other. Patti's father hates him and behaves like his holes. Anton (prisoner of war) was often running his cover for his protection, but someone tried to stop him from seeing him.
