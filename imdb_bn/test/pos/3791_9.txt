Charlie Chaplin's Little Trump or Little Man won the title of World War I, when the Great War was known, was handed down, even capturing Kaiser, there was something that the entire armed forces could not do. Too bad it's going to be a dream, which is somewhat frustrating and this gentle muted short (almost a feature film about 46 minutes) is a weak part. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Using Cheese as an Operation Against Germany, Liberazar has put a gas mask to eat cheese from Liberazar; Charlie sleeping in a flood beside a soldier sleeping, he continued to bother; Charlie makes herself a tree-like disguise - one of her best sketches - and Charlie pretends to hit her friend, who has become a pound, then the mugs her when the enemy comes out of sight. <br /> <br /> An amazing feature is that when Hitler and his Nazi thugs were behind German enemies wearing German clothing, ten years ago, Hitler was similar to Hitler. Clearly, after Charlie's picture, Hitler made his appearance.
