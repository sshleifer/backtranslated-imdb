Last year I saw it as one of the best movies. Belmendo and Denwow are bright in their respective roles, he is a stupid planter and he is brilliant as an intelligent technique. Words will not judge this great essay; it is enough to say that it is a film that is bold in love and it searches for its power for pain, humiliation and self-confusion that is dressed as a movie noor. Forget this weak rebuilding with Jolie and Bandaras, instead look at the original article and consider yourself some moments of great movie looks.
