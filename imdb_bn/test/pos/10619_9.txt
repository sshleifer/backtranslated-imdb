Be ready for the trip to Hansek's "La Pionoste" ... The mental illness of the protagonist, who plays nicely with Hoopert, you can exceed any limit. The most striking part of this is that you started to feel the sympathy for the character of Irika. Trash-sexuality (though no news scenes), distortion, mosquito, indecent relationships ... Hanake gives us a crude meal, which allows digestion; Sometimes, the only way you can escape from the extremism of some scenes is to begin to laugh at it. Perhaps "Maine n Sken" is not the most interesting part of the movie, it is a clear Austro-Germanic, sometimes Scandinavian note: static, tall scenes, but not annoying. Vienna settings, French language used, look like a completely European blend. Fixed Germanic Music Background (Schubert) is nicely selected. Above all, ear prizes for best actors are both fully deserved: one of the best performance of the best actress of all time.
