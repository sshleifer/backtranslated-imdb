OK, other critics have mentioned the main points of this great little jewel, as the story started as a material for Buster Keton's silent classic "7 Chances". Comedy, or any other sequel to it, explains only a scene and line that someone else has written and edited before, if it is not completely original. Here we Stooges are basically written and written by someone else doing the material and for a low budget, for a short time exercise of the film, they are doing fine things just fine. Despite what the credits say in their movies, the actual "Stoge-Files" knows that there was a lot of input in their lines and direction. Surgeons are an important operation as they take their job seriously. A documentary about the boys Emil Sitka himself spoken words Here, what seems to be their usual anarchy with something so easy to marry, it is actually organized chaos Each line is perfectly timely with a related physical action. How many charming people today can claim such skill? In most of the cases, I have not seen anyone else in the last 35 years of watching Sinefeld Kruti. Critics will always remember "Poho Poho" Stoges or Lorel and Hardy and the other ... ... who will remember the name of the critics or what they said? Just watch, enjoy and enjoy!
