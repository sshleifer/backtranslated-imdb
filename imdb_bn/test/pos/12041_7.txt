Darr was a super hit film, which was preferred by many people. In the story of Shahrukh Khan, Juhi, who loves Sunny Deol, feels innocent feeling. Actually it was an entertaining movie, but you look carefully at it is not very realistic. Shahrukh Khan puts Zuhey on the phone and tells him that she loves a lot. He announced in college that he loved him and gave him some beautiful surprises like beautiful pictures. Unfortunately, instead of being flattered that a guy loves his very bit, he is very scared. I personally know about 100 people who ridicule someone, and these people enjoy it because they play for a long time. Yash Chopra gave us a good film, which gave great entertainment due to Shah Rukh Khan's character. Sunny Deol is considered to be the main actor, but Shah Rukh Khan's outstanding performance is remarkable. Shah Rukh Khan is famous for the literary film, but if the girl gets him, I would have been happy, because he loved him very much. Sunny Deol gives a decent performance, but he beats up all the guys who are on himself, and survived a cruel knife attack. Juhi Chawla played quite well as intelligent as ever. Good music with the best songs in front of you.
