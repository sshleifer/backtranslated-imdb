Absolutely damage! Director Arthur Hiler and writer Paddy Chieffsky broke the American hospital system with this evil comedy / drama / hooddint. The hospital pictured here is in trouble ... to the potential serial killer to disturb patients from neighboring protesters. George C Scott is the leading doctor who is involved with his neurological breakdown, free spirits Diana Rig and his painful father Bernard Hughes. Alternatively depressed and stimulating, some acid-tired conversations in hospital have imaginable properties (Scott describes how to create love sessions with Rigg). It has a lot of cool Vintet: Scott Beating Head nurse Nancy Merchand, who killed a doctor here after the death of one; The sick administrator Francis Starhagen is trying hard to collect insurance information from the people who are in full waiting for the sick; Get the mental advice of the hospital after talking about his tragic home-life, get a Scottish consultation. Acting is the first rate of all. Scott and Rig Dynamite and Hughes are a real surprise. The movie achieves an extraordinary Oscar with the script of script (it's tough competition for KLUTE and Sunday, Bloody Sunday). The opening description is invaluable.
