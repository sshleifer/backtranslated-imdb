It is very difficult to portray a tag novel along the cinematographic line. And forgetting the unclear production of 1967, for the first time, the glass sand has been completed on a large scale. Overall the sets looked fantastic with the right touch to create a successful play drama. Prosenshit is a good effort, so cross is used for commercial stuff. I saw the Bengali version and saw that the voice of wealth was dubbed, which delivered its dialogue to the poor. The film director did a good job by portraying each letter with teammates, but there was very little in the way of meaningful plot, probably the story was missing. Although the development of characters with minor roles seems to be the most powerful point. It's hard to make some tag stories into movies because only visual parts are realized.
