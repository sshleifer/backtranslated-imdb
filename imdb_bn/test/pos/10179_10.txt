The US Treasury is touring millions of gold trains through trains. Along the way it's reported in Lewis Lane. Train along the way is attacked by stylish thieves. They separated the car with armed guards and attacked the rest. This leads to a naughty war between the remaining guards and thieves. Thieves defeated them, but then Lewis Lane entered. He closed the train with a thief's hand (using one gun at one stage) but the train went out of control. Lois can not stop it and nothing will stop to get the thief gold. The best thing is on the way of Superman! <br /> <br /> fast, exciting, non-stop action. Probably all the cartoons are one of the best. Just great
