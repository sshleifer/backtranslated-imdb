Personally, I think the movie is pretty good. It is about 8 taka I like the genetics aspect as well as the fantastic photography. Colin Firth's character is not the most preferred, but she has done a better job than a decent job with a role. The heroine starring Nia Long, is a well-known film heroine, which she thinks she is doing best for her child - when she is married to a respected member of her expatriate community - "bad" people - who are not members of her community ("Exterior"). Most movies about this mother's struggle: What should she expect she to expect from her, for her child? I think it's better to follow her heart or she will follow her heart ... I just do not want to give it away, just tell me that it is a very beautiful position shot, fine African dress (it's only worth looking at women's brightly colored African dresses and hairdressers for the film) and overall customized characters An emotional movie with Nia Long's son acting actor Ujjal and adorable. The pharmulika a bit, but I liked the movie anyway. If you are a fan of Colin Firth, you will see this movie. If you want fantastic flicks, see it. I think tonight will see it!
