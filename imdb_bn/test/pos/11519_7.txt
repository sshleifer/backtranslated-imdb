Ridiculous and ridiculously bad, the lights in New York are the first of all features and it is often not seen in the light of the day. <br /> <br /> Two lovely girls (Eddie and Gene) from the outside of the city are involved with the boleglers and one thing ends up front. Police opened fire at one of the bootloggers, and Huq (who shot the officer) decided to kill the AD, so that he ordered his dog to "take the ride". But Haque himself will take a bullet in a wrap that will surprise some. <br /> <br /> Fired at $ 23,000 a week, "Lights" was originally meant to be two relayers, but Faye took advantage of six six batsmen in the absence of Jack Warner. When Warner discovered it, he ordered to return the shot to the original. When only an independent show offered $ 25 for the movie, Warner actually looked at the film, which turned into $ 1.3 million. <br /> <br /> Now it is seen in an extremely hockey piece, starting from Passable (Eugene Palette) to Transs (e.g. Eddie Granny in a special scene) and most of the play is in Hollywood. Since this is a primary talkie (4 pieces before it) it's about all the letters, and it does very slowly. The script seems optimistic, the visual style is unincorporated (except the shooting scene in Silhouette) and the scenes are intermittently interrupted. Header cards are interactive which sincerely declares letters and locals. <br /> <br /> Despite all this "illumination" we see the performers and crew struggling with foreign technology and an engaging experience to change the film. <BR> <br /> If you can hold it up
