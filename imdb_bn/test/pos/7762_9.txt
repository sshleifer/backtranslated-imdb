All right, I'm not saying that I do not like all the anime. I've enjoyed a few quoted "classic" series, but fully consider the medium as American television: that is, a good 90-95% of the word is falling somewhere from the rest "clock" to "decent". In this case, it is astonishing that I do not like self-extinguishing anime parody. I do not get much jokes, and the medium itself implements a certain style of humor which does not appeal to me - loudly, hyperparty, below, and completely above. <br /> <br /> So when I see this series on the friend's direction, I was frustrated after the first half of the first episode. I think the characters were supposed to represent the cliche letters from the outline of the store, and their activities were considered to be of the same awe-inspiring. I saw where it came from, but it does not seem that it's all clever - many "painful, fun-filled high school, Schengenes and running, we are ridiculous about it now." At the third episode, my opinion has changed drastically. <br /> <br /> At that time the power of this series began to express itself. The sequence of non-chronological episodes, awareness of the consciousness of his consciousness, and above all, is a clever trick with a well executed person (smiling). <br /> <br /> I think that the annoyance in any medium, this show presents a hostile interaction between the letters of physically opposed. Because of extreme radical resignation, Kevin's eternal feeling provides the perfect foil of title character Charity Haruji's Generic "Anime-like" exploitations. It's a break from the formula, and it works incredibly well. <br /> <br /> Based on that strong foundation, the series has reached a more detailed level of attention. As previously mentioned, the episodes are carried from increasing order. I think this might be a gimmick at first, but it works wonderfully well. Guess the growing sequence of events, but the broadcast sequence of episodes follows the traditional framework of Aristotelian drama more closely. The selected sequence does not give any formal spaces which can not be met in general terms (although it can be assumed that what happened in a formal "previous" episode, one is still to see how its events are expressed), and any of the fantastic plans Plot holes or rivalry I saw this series for the first time in a complete way for the first time, and I am surprised to see how well it was possible to combine the seemingly unexpected events together. <br /> <br /> The last point in detail extends extreme attention to each area of ​​the series. Although the design of the character "anime" characterizes a little bit, the background industry is rendered based on the delicate, indeed original photographic references. The important point of animation quality is excellent. For example, there is a musical performance of late in the series, in which the characters are actually playing a song - it can be tiny sounds, but the subconscious effects of the observation (film-quality) animation that are actually similar to the soundtrack. <<br /> <br /> In short, I love this series for some reason. Something that I normally dislike through his nature, but his death sentence is so unique and disciplined that I can not help it.
