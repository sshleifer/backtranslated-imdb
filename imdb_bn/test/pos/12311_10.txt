Naturally, deaths, nostalgia, and innocence in one of the main topics is probably not surprising that it is more rated by older viewers than young people. But there is the technicality and completeness of the film that anyone can enjoy. The speed is steady and constant, full of characters and engaging, normal relation and interaction shows that you do not need tears flooding, screaming for fear, screaming to show a debate or show an outburst of anger. Naturally, Josette's short story makes a well-made framework perfect as a polished diamond, but the small changes make the same as Houston's fairytale fairytale. It's a wonderful composition of real skill, subtlety and stunning beauty.
