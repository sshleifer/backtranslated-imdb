I am a huge fan of legendary director Eliya Kazan. His movies often deal with people trying to overcome their weaknesses. There will be indifferent love in 'grass splendor', 'a tree grows in the tree' or 'racism in racism contract' in racism. When looking for other movies made by Kazan, I stumbled across a movie that is based on a novel by Arthur Miller. The name of the film "Focus" is William H. Messi (who was one of my favorite actors) and Laura Dern. It is a very realistic way to police with anti-semitism. <br /> <br /> Messi's character continues to be around him and with his big cats in his job, until it affects him personally. He's the key here ... because he did not do that because he knew it was wrong and he wanted to take a stand, because he was now considered an outsider, and he started to get the same kind of similar experience, the same Comments, and the same brutally experienced Mr. Finestesten (David Pamier). <br /> <br /> The movie is very well written and well-played. Laughing meat does a great job playing a dirty bag! Both Messi and Darren's performance are remarkable! It's easier to make it easier instead of living. Sometimes people will have to influence their life, or the lives of their loved ones, to stand up. Only then will anyone get their moral compass.
