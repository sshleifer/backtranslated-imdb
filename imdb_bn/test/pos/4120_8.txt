Only the place of each commentator has mentioned some footage of the interview footage on concert footage. This is true, and this is the biggest error in film.

Apart from seeing Seventy and Black Sabbath early in the first detention, I saw them in 2005 or 006 when they even gave the title of Ozjesfest exactly. The concert was amazing, and like it, I hired it in the first place. It's just about the best Geezer-Rock See it
