I must say that I did not want to sit for a lot of "pitch black", but I was far behind in excitement and pure fun. This is the type of Flickr where you can just go back, relax and get a great time just for entertainment. This is not a deep film in any way. All it proposes is recycled or "alien", "predator" or other such movies are closed. But when I see a rip off, I want it to be good, and this rip off is great. <br /> <br /> It starts with a star streak. Such scenes of all time with the greatest films - "2001," "Star Wars," "ayaliyena," "predetara." A ship is cruised through space when the whole crevasse is awakened throughout the crevice. The vessel was hit by some. They crashed the land on a nasty little planet with three suns. When they fled prisoner Richard Raidick (Vin Diesel), they all escaped from the ship. They scan the desert planet in search of him and eventually find him, but their ship has no way to fly again. They searched the planet for planet and civilization, but it seems that everyone has suddenly disappeared from the planet. <br /> <br /> They then realized that every 22 years the planet has activated the black pitch of the planet in the solar eclipse and the whole world. Living in the darkness of the planet can be alien shining - what are the chances? They will happen just like the planets - what is the possibility? And there's a rare talent in the wreck - he can see in the dark - again, what are the chances? <br /> <br /> There seems to be a lot of similarity in this movie, but there is no such movie. Get Oscars for originality or credibility. This is for entertaining viewers - it's easy to do. Vin Diesel is a big Gorilla of a man with no acting talent. But I want to say that there is someone who can fit the trash, hurriculously Fallon diesel. Listen to mock him, "he did not know who he was? Great stuff. <br /> <br /> The film is a mix between Alien hyamaraheda shark," ayaliyena "and predetaragulira are in. They are like a hyamaraheda long, horizontal head found Alien fast dynamic agility, and theft of a hunter. I'm David tuhi (film director and writer) do not assume that the audience never true to his creatures Ekhenani believed to be. At least I hope not. <br /> <br /> The film "ayaliyensa redox" might be a better name, then again, it's the second and third "ayaliyena" in conjunction with the movies. Apparently the last series Restoring - "Terminator 3," "ayaliyena 5," "praidetara 3," "ayaliyena vs. predetara" - "pitch Black" stands as a completely new series. Two sequels wear Is lpana. Let's hope they do not carry. I can shoot twenty-five years from now: "Pitch Black Alliance vs. Alliance vs. Predator: * The Fight of the Year. /> <br /> * The title of the year and share <br can be taken in the upcoming film "Freddy vs. Jason vs. Michael vs. Alien vs. Predator vs. Terminator ledaraphesa vs vs vs Norman Bates, James Cameron vs. Barney the dinosaur." <br /> <br /> 4/5
