I can not believe the bad reviews about this movie! I wonder why ..... why should I admit to the book ... it really does not follow the book ... Surely ... Dean Quontaz is a great book but the movie is good as well !!! It's a mystery ... good acting ... especially Michael Aronsoide, which is why he has acted in this movie! <br /> <br /> Come to a guy ... Give this movie a chance. Still more bad films than this ... all the horror groups ... Phantom ... The Vinci Code ... I am looking for some of these bad films ... actually have great elements in the movie than the really annoying spectators. This movie has great mystery and non stop action !!! I'm looking for this movie ... but it's very hard to get on DVD ... <br /> <br /> I have really suggested this movie to everyone ... Look at it! !!! Do not you regret !!! <br /> <br /> 10/10 *
