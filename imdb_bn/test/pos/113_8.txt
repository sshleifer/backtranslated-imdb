It was a brave movie to hit Indian cinema during the war of liberation. Probably the first movie to release the lesbian trend among Indian films. Indian film 'Shabana Azmi', along with one of the actress Nandita Das, added the film's material in her warm sensual scene. <br /> <br /> The image matched sexuality and the director used sex in the best possible way. The sex was not for erotic purposes but in the context of the movie was. The scene where Nandita Das lost her virginity to her husband, of course was her first type in Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> Among the Indian actors, critics of all actors, especially Nandita Das, are in the role of acting.
