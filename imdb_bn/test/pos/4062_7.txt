Most of today's movies are convicted, this plot is not completely starred, the film can not remove anyone and it does not guarantee any award (beyond blockbuster) ... but again <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro are very funny, sometimes lively, to make movies that I really enjoyed. Russo and Shatner played well in their small part as well. Man, I hope in future with my wife's age as well as Miss Rennie. <br /> <br /> Moving along, this "friend" cop-flick creates a high level of laughter in a reasonable amount. The video is enjoyable enough to wait for the video / DVD release and check it instead of going forward. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy is her usual top-form and enjoyable to watch it is enjoyable. De Niro completely played such role. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie and think that any good movie pants or a good smile really will enjoy the showtime for any good movie. <Br /> <br /> Top performances: Murphy. extremely happy. Enough said. Job Directions: Excellent. Using excellent action scenes, like Marie and De Niro, using a skin disease, Rousseau works in a wonderful way. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 out 10. It's not going to move you or anything else ... This is a very enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> This showtime ... was a great success.
