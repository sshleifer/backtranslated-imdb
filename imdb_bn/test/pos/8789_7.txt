No speaker !! <br /> <br /> After the successful American film of Hitako, based on the Gothic romance of Rebecca Duffen Duarier and the comic novel, he returned to more familiar themes of his first British era - misrepresentation and espionage. In the second world war, settled in the United States and civilians started growing film entertainment business as a major 'war effort' to build aircraft, weapons and other necessary militia, with pandemonics and often gigostic thrillers with wartime themes. These thrillers often work in shades of good, legal citizens, engaging in fraudulent and efficient operators networks. The director was informed about the espionage, that producer Jack Skibber had contacted Hitakk to manage the property of corruption, war veteran and helpless hero, and insulted the wrong credentials. The dark element of the story and the sharp-minded author of the legendary marathon Dorothy Parker (the short time of Hollywood before returning to his Bohemian roots in NYC) was a perfect match for Hitkoc's sensitivity. This often neglected movie tells the story of the 25-year-old Barry Kay (Robert Simmons), who is working in the factory in Los Angeles Airplane, meets new employee Frank Frey (Norman Lloyd) and is made for the moment of sabotage. The expulsion of the authorities, which does not believe in his remote story, soda City Utah, and finally fulfills various letters on the way to New York City. These memorable characters are associated with a circus carvaganet 'fix' and a popular billboard model, Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane), who has become crazy during her life as well as during the worst crisis of national security! Of course, Hitakoop's country, Patricia, kidnapped by the supposed Sabotu Barry, added a romantic tension to his captives thus mixing. Well, for this hitcock, Hitakoos brews a national network brews old woman, average Josh, and respected businessmen who double as secret agent terrorists, doubling criminals for pulling guns and removing items in bomb blasts. This is a terrific plot that takes its time forward and burns once, becoming one of the more memorable final decisions of Hitcoch. Look for incredible living like NYC tourism attractions (which were revived by Hollywood industry executives due to 'shooting bans' during the war during public attraction). Although Sabotu can not be one of Hitako's most famous films, it is a popular B-movie, which is certainly tough and a lot of cute plot twists and an obscure as usual - a great Hitcoo villain. In the second half of the film, remember the Hitchcock's Camomo look out of a drug store. The original Camio concept of Hitakoos was shot (he was fighting in his sign language with Deaf's wife) standards and practice bure that was scared of the criteria of the deaf!
