A classic late film of 50. The supernatural headlines (Joan Crowford and Louie Jordan) are not the best, but the direction, the painter and the young cast performances are compulsory. In the sense of 50 (which I love). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br model can be one). A stupid plot, of course (hey, it's 1959!), But as a film - glorious! As a reflection of society, very interesting. And as a witness how to spread away from Hollywood American sex disguised ideological illustration, is interesting.
