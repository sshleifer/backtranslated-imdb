Michael Jackson's Thriller (1983) will be the greatest video of all time. The dude has your hair, gore and an interesting tune, what else can you ask for. John Landis mixed the knights of Living Dead and American Wauwolf in London and came to the video. Literally started out as a beautiful evening for a young couple, turns into a date from hell. You have to dance zombies, a horror jacket and "rapping" Vincent's price. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> There are some "interesting" ingredients in the documentary.
