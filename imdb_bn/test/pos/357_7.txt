I have to disagree strongly with previous lemons remarks. I have not seen too much expectations from this. The truth is that the cast is fantastic, especially the lead teen lady. All of them came in the dark direction, all were clearly astray. An underlying current ran through teenage angst and sexuality movies. The serial killer's role was also well played because you can think that he has left the same way as his children. What is this movie, is a strong play / thriller. Yes I agree, they do not do the obvious work, but you can relate to the teenager's head attached to what they have done and it is trustworthy. There is also a modest dark finishing, which can instead be easily out of a happy out. The attention to detail in the movie was fantastic. I'm 10 to 7 very hard. Occasionally a little slowly, but a thinker lets see where the letters are coming from.
