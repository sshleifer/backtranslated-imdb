I saw this movie on TV and liked it! I was a real disaster film fan, and this one was great. Cast is made from some really interesting people. Connie Selleca is always great. And William Deven has a league of his own. He can play some comedy and thrillers in the same movie. The story line is very great. Thinking of being able to follow a deadline of what will happen and using this timeframe to prevent worldwide disaster is a fun idea. And this movie has been brought about in a way that is almost entirely trustworthy.
