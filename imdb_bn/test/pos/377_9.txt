Adaptation of Alfred Hittkok to Patricia High School "Patricia High Skit", Guy Haines (Fary Granger) and Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) met for the first time in a train ride and discussed the concept of two murders. Rather than pushing, Atheni thinks he can kill Hence's unfaithful wife and kill Haniss Anthony's authoritative father. The lack of any connection between murderer and victim in each case should be ensured that neither of these crimes will be solved. With the impression of haines more easily, the offer is not very serious. Later, Anthony Hanes's wife was killed in an entertainment park, followed by Haines, and complicated to continue the deal. <br /> <br /> The difference between the two is clear from the beginning. Henes is a professional tennis player, respectful and respectable to his achievements, but Anthony's life is not going anywhere and he admits to having come out of three colleges to play water and gambling. Henes is related to a Senator's daughter who wants to marry. Anthony has literally translated it as a fictitious technique in the part of Henes to provide a carrier shortcut. The difference in character is also apparently reinforced. Anthony often lives in shady areas and travels in a boat named "Pluto", but hens are often seen from more heroic perspectives provided by less camera angles. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting visual sequences such as: - <br /> <br /> (1) The murder of Henes's wife, which is shown through reflection of his glasses, which falls on the ground, because he frees himself from Anthony Struggling. <br /> <br /> (2) To illustrate only Anthony, wearing black clothes and very small against the huge White Jefferson Memorial Building. <br /> <br /> (3) This event where the audience is assembling their heads in a tennis match, the action, when one head (Anthony's) looks at Hiles and stays in position. <br /> <br /> (4) The scene where the movement goes out of control and is finally astonishingly upset. <br /> <br /> The story is often "doubled" in the whole story, for example, Hanes and Anthony are basically presented as 2 pages, they are coming out of their taxi in the air and going to the train. Once the train has left the station, there are 2 sets of each track that are available in two ways. Two men discuss the killing of 2 potential victims and ordered two double whiskeys. The camcorder in the hitcoo carries him a double bash and stares at the train. Henes doubled when his wife rebuilt an agreement to see her lawyer to arrange divorce. Hein's wife goes to the music park with two lovers. Anthony beats him before he murders when he illuminates his cigarette lighter and reflects two of his glasses. Later, he met Senator's little girl twice for Henes's wife when Anthony got very annoyed. Although Henes refused to proceed with the second murder, Atheni doubled him. When Henes is traveling alone on the train, he kicked two men in the same car in the same car and kicked him the same way. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>>
