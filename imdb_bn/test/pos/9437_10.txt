Do you want to explode? How about war? Well, this movie has both. You know any other thing that you can not have a movie except: a kick ass on a motorcycle, elevate the head of any person and find them at the same time. You have a bet of Stabilizer. There's even a classic arcade scene. <br /> <br /> To everyone, I am very proud that I have seen this movie ... even this review is my first review ... Yes!
