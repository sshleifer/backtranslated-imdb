This is the best movie I've seen for a long time. My lifetime top 20 I smiled more than the guide from Hitachi's galaxy, and I saw the notebook more than I did. If you are looking for a sensitive movie without happy edge ... this one. It is real and powerful. See it and you will not regret it. I was initially reluctant and I just saw it because I had to make a school project about speech disability. But this movie is much more than that. It is free and independent from the means of liberating the world. Each of us is aware of our disability and keeps us away from what we miss, but keep everything else away from us.
