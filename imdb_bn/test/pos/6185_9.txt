Arnest L端bitz has not given us exceptional films such as Design for Living, NinetCacha, The Shop Four the Corner, or other wonderful movies. But people usually put BlueBirds' eighth wife as one of the weakest films of Lubytosh. <br /> <br /> But I consider this movie as an important film. This image starts with Charles Brycat and Billy Winder's assistance. Charles Brycat, Billy Wildor, and Walter Reich Ernest L端bitzche Knistcock wrote the screenplay. Courses, work with writers of Lubitsch scripting process. After that, Charles Brycat and Billy Welder worked together. Together they wrote The Lost Weekend and Sunset Bloved Screenplay for famous films. <br /> <br /> There are many fun moments in the film. I thought "The Taming of the Cry" was very funny. There is a famous expression "Films Titles of Life". And this is a wonderful example from Bluebourne's eighth wife (1938). <br /> <br /> In the first session of the scripting process, L端bitchch poses the question: How does a son and daughter meet together? Billy Winler immediately suggested that the opening scene should be a men's store in a department store. "The boy is trying to buy a trouser," he came out slowly. "But he can only sleep at the top, he is quarterly, so he only insisted on buying at the top money, Clarke said that he must buy the pants, it's like a catastrophe, then the girl comes to the shop and buys the pants because she only sleeps the pants." Lubits and Charles Bryckt were prolific. After a few months, they discovered that Billy Winler himself was a leading sleeper and he was waiting for a chance to use it for several months. <br /> <br /> I found this book a book. I think this picture can be considered as the return of Ernest L端bitz. Shortly after this movie, he made wonderful films such as Nantucka, The Shopping Charry the Corner, and not to be or be. <br /> <br /> I think Gary Cooper's performance was good. I think Lubitz probably imagined Gary Cooper because Gary Cooper played Long Fellow Daddy, who was Frank Cappar M. Go to Deid's fate heir to the city. But it's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> For me, I enjoyed the film. I rate nine films out of 10. Luvittoch films are different, because their films are a piece of life.
