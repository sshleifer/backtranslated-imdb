Ray 'Ray <br /> <br /> <br /> Ray Ray-Deer-Taylor Hackford Cast - Jamie Fox, Kerry Washington, Regina King, Clifton Powell, Curtis Armstrong and Sharon Warren Written by - Taylor Hankford and James L. White. Ratings- *** <br /> <br /> "Hit the road jack, and do not come back? No more, no more, no more, no more!" Who thought that this immortal line which has become a remedial mantra often for the broken relationship of the popular culture, is formed on the rebellion of lovers! Ray Charles was a genius. And if he knew that there was one thing, to breathe and live for; It was music. Therefore, a lifetime that is associated with severe poverty, a great struggle with darkness, crime, medicine and painful things; When the verdict still found the moment the inspiration struck him somewhere and took their own shape to make an instant eternal classic form of words and notes! <br /> <br /> There are some forms that can be transformed into a silver screen. Ray Charles's life was one of them. It often comes as a shock that the studio-backing was not until the end of this project! And perhaps this backing came after the primary screening, where the acting of Jamie Fox was praised and silent voices confirmed the Oscars were winners. Like Ray, Jamie Fox almost believes that the real Ray is acting on the screen and an actor is not mimicking! It is not so objectionable to be so helpless, all the senseless smiles, but a man can dance through his giants, Fox holds every worth of Charles Ray. Ray was a complex man. He never claimed sympathy and rarely showed it to himself. A pure businessman, he has confirmed his success at any time, sometimes to the value of losing his loved ones. He did not apologize for his fans and always maintained that he loved his family, which we are convinced. She likes sex; It was just like that! But there was a verdict that was afraid of darkness below everything else. Imagine the fear of blind people in the dark! His fear was because of his crime. Rai believed that he was the cause of his brother's death, and his entire life was tried to free himself. Ray was a Mayveric, who preached the good news with Jazz, an illogical condemnatory practice in 50's. But his motive was not enthusiasm. He practiced the only way to learn to be close to God! <br /> <br /> It is difficult to conquer an eventful life, which probably the film fails. We are never allowed to get around judgment as a person. We know him as much as we see him. His relationship, especially with Margie Hendricks (Regina King), is not searched in detail. And this script has gone to Reya's wife Della Bia (Kerry Washington), everyone knows that there was a rock beside her. And pushing all the biggest mistakes, is almost a sudden climax. The manager suddenly realized that he came out of stock and called for a pack-up! Nevertheless, 'Ray' is definitely recommended for shameless performance by Jamie Fox and a capable wrestler shoes. Music and age create a sense of nostalgia, and we truly feel that the film is made with sincerity. <br /> - <br /> <br /> - Note: 'Re' has been nominated in six categories of this year's Academy Awards, Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor (Jamie Fox). <<br /> <br /> Ratings- *** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent <br /> <br / > <br /> February 2005
