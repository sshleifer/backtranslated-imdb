I am a 20 year old block from England I'm not crying in the movie. But this one moved me up. I cried like a girl! Although the story is suspicious, I sometimes see it running the most movies. Joseph Mazello's little face whispered to me every time she cried. How could someone hit such a sweet looking baby? I'm just going to cry now! O of non-SM-fold.
