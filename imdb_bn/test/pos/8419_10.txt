Shawwas awesome! Considering the producers had a little budget, they did a great job. This is a clock must. The little boy did a great job with many emotions flowing through his eyes. Grandfather is his best. Photography Fantastic Technically accurate and very creative It helps to add many emotions to mainstream content. The film will disturb you and you will not be surprised if you smile after the sound of the film and the story for a few days. I sincerely hope they can nominate it to Oscars <br /> <br /> Enjoy and do not miss again
