I knew a little bit about this movie when I entered the theater for screening in advance. I was a thriller that collected from advertising. <br /> <br /> Meet our "Matlock" like "Obedience". Two teenagers decided to commit a perfect murder. A hunter is randomly selected and then execution is executed carefully so that there is no trace of the actual killers. Then a bunch of false leaders is fitted to that point of an innocent bystander. (Anyway innocent killing) <br /> <br /> Enter Sandra Bulkak as the investigative officer. (IMDB said that he was his FBI, but I did not remember it. I thought he was a regular police) he was frustrated by the inconsistency of the killings profile ("the profile is not profitable!") And the effect of one's father in power and between the boys. <br /> <br /> There is also a ghost of his own, which decides to become his forehead, which is mainly on his forehead. But this is the only character which is really one-dimensional. Everyone else is beautiful flat. <br /> <br /> There really is no big thrill for a thriller. This is mostly a cat and mouse game (which he is seeing at one stage in the movie), as an episode of "Mattel". There are two involved in twist killings. Just Killer, Justin or Richard? It will cost you eight bucks to find out.
