I swear that if I try cocaine then I can be absolutely involved with this movie. Its speed, as well as the dialogue, is looking at the speed that some viewers may need to shut their heads off and relax. <br /> <br /> There are many small elements that go out of the movie, such as Rob Loeyer's character always losing shoes, or how some characters seem to be moving spiral around his zigzagged path. The story is very well arranged together and the side looks defective. <br /> <br /> The movie is weird and weird. This one seems to be the most I can enjoy. Some of the smiles-suddenly-even-if-you-alone-moments ensure that I will see it again.
