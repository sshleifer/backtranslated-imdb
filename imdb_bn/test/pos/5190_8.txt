Nude City: JWAB does a great job to enrich two of its A-B stories, though I'm not in love with many plot movies. And Scott Glenn and Curtly B Vance screen dual make a great one. However, I'm not sure what the message sends when the two female flat-female girls can kill, kill and steal it free, a free flight home (no less than the first grade) - at least from the appearance of their dress) . Gee, I guess that the silent blue wall still seems to be! <br /> <br /> Ratings: 8
