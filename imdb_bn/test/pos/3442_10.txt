In 1984, AdGar RÃ©tis surprised the movie lovers around the world with his epic hemat: The Chronicle of Germany. Eight years later, he came with a second series, The Second Hymet: Chronicle of a Jouth, which is even more surprising than his ancestors. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's not actually a series. This is more of a "middleclass", because it covers the events that occurred in the ninth and the eleventh episodes of the first Himmat chakra. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> ) Her first love, Clarchen, her helpless mother and courtesy of the elder brother (she was about 25 years old, had a childhood relationship with her). Still angry with those incidents, young people can never fall in love again (if a lady, in a strange scene), and decided to go to Munich (the director herself in about the same time), hoping to be a professional musician spent a few years at the Music Academy . He stayed in Munich for ten years and covers the time frame of Heat II's 13th episode, each of them focusing on a different person in Harmon's fellow students, who like him, are searching for their "second home" country, it's music , Film or anything else, which eventually they can live peacefully. <br /> <br /> Like the first snowman, this second chak The perfect union of T movies and television: Episiodic formation and different romantic suboptles let it look as a sub-operative, in fact the second hemat should be fully seen to be fully accepted, but some sections of Himat 1 can be seen as a separate story (especially, Herman Kishore Year-related). However, the style and content, pure sound film, is known With low and white / color compression (in fact, this time almost more predictable) and with hesitating characters, the next element is underlined by the relationship between Harmon and Soul Player Clarissa: Lechblaw (Solomon Camar): They explicitly love each other, yet they Working with others, until the delay is inevitable delayed. At this time, Rights seems to be more discouraged about his characters (at one point, Herman is so confused that he said: "Beatles are better than us!"), Creating episodes of dark, controversial themes such as miscarriage and suicide. The decade of discovering is not suitable for everyone, because the events of the 60's have been frustrating dramatically by special events (especially the '68th revolution). <br /> <br /> Rayet feels that this mini-series specifically for movie buffs, references to many movies (with a brilliant Casablanca scripts) and cute jokes (an episode is set in Wines, whose film source is an important part of the success of Himmat Saga. Part) has been given And since 1992, film lovers did not thank for the 26 hours of the most annoying hours promised in celluloid.
