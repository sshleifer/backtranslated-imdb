It's three intermediate cartoons (rabbit fires and ducks! Rabbits, ducks!) And the three are weak but still quite funny. It only depends on a joke for too much of action. Still a good cartoon I feel a certain sympathy for this one Daffy, which is rare for me. Daffy is so definitely overmatched that it almost became painful. A nice series good cartoon Recommended.
