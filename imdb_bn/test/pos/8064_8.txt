Anne Frank Diary is one of the best selling nonprofit books in the world and for good reason. However, sitting through this documentary of his life, which is included in some details leaving the diary, I thought, "Another documentary about Anne Frank." I got it enabled but to be extraordinary This was my confident attitude because I was already aware of the story of Anne Frank; Most of the information I wanted to tell the documentary was not known to me. <br /> <br /> Everything has changed, when I went to finish the documentary --- when I saw Annie's motion picture footage, Frank. The standard effect of viewing this footage is just one second or more, which is thousands of times more real than before - --- but in the documentary it was not; Whatever I knew about Anne Frank had suddenly become more personal to me. I have always been moved by his stories, but I saw that footage, what I feel is that my life is stronger and deeper and more deeper than any other film experience. (I already knew that this documentary has live footage of Anne Frank and I have also seen footage on television movie reviews, but in the documentary context this was a completely different experience. I probably do not mention it, it will loot it for somebody here. I now realize that many still do not know the story of Anne Frank, such an ignorance is frustrating when witnessing. "No one knows how the story of Anne Frank, is not it?" In this case, though, Frank ANNE: reading her diary with a reminder, the best place to start. This is a story that everyone will know.
