Based on Anne Boleyn's story, the silent historical drama, the miserable sight of Henry VIII, the bad-evil king of England, who likes to feast, drink, seek, courtesy of Jester, watch clock, and mixed women around the cakes and skulls After jumping around behind the beauties of the young beauties. Well, he canceled his marriage soon, married Anne, and told him that he was responsible for his successor's heirs. He fails to score that and soon he has his eyes waiting in yet another woman. Meanwhile, Annie spends so much that the whole film is hesitant, annoying, or ready to explode in tears. He did not just come across as a happy camper (or is it just bad acting?!). <br /> <br /> This picture was a hard part of the entertaining, with which I was interested in two hours a drying story - plus I enjoyed seeing a fantastic sepia tinted print featured here at the very great medieval costume. Emil Jannings King Henry VIII is quite striking and memorable among his well-portrayed illustrations - he really feels like he was eighth Henry. I'm not sure about the performances given by Anne's acting actress, she looked a little more upside down. This movie's DVD is a perfect, well-done piano score that perfectly fits this story. Pretty good pictures
