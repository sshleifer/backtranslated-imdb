The VHS cover says it all: "Without doubt, the most powerful film of his kind from the Texas Censor genocide". I'm a huge fan of slashers of 70s and 80s and I would say, I agree 100%. Characters are credible, the actor has a great charm (especially as Georgie Kennedy Bon-Roger). There are rolled atmospheres, only TCMs, amazing soundtrack emotions and photo positions that are the most beautiful in horror history. This will be one of the most beautiful shots horror films of all time! As a director of low budget film in 1981, Jeff Lieberman did this and did excellent work and added to his other works (Neil Sunshine, Wrong Turn), he must be one of the most neutral directors of the film industry.
