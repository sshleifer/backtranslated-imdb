In 1937, Warner Bros.'s head of production division, Darryl Januk, tried to play his newly created company from the 20th Century Fox Field and play at the stage of the play level with his old master and MGM in the glamorous palace. . "East Is My Affair" was an attempt to monetize the historical success of the historical set of the previous set of Centuries ("San Francisco" in "Old Chicago") and succeeded successfully in the past. The plot is interesting. A problem maker, but the heroic naval officer (Robert Taylor) has secretly hired President McKinley, who publishes a ring of bank robbers who violate US money. She has found the gang but she has fallen in love with their female mascot (Barbara Stanwick) and has to decide between love and duties. <br /> <br /> This does not work well about all vintage movies, but overall it is a good part of the studio taking movies. For "Mother Night", Kurt Vongut (The original role of this book was performed wildly by Nick Nolt) will be borrowed for the plot and it seems quite reliable to believe in the studio's beliefs. As a fan of old movies I have never seen that I have never seen and "It is my thing" was not an exception.
