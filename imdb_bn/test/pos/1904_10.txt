Citizen Why ... The Godfather Part II .... D'Urville Martin's Daleime. This is the greatest piece of celluloid unit ever built and unleashed on mankind. Rudi Ray Moore, a role in conquering the Academy Awards star as the worst cat of the universe, Dlmeight. He definitely does not accept any gym from Turkey (I unfortunately Turkey) and it proves with rapping, pimping, and karate slippers with its capabilities. It's a perfect example of a bloated Blackplugion, low budget, continuity error, and hatred for rats-soup, hateful exposure to eating and eating. The true godfather of Rap (this is not the new Ali Nonsense) Moore is an integral part of the acting technique; Anyhow managed as the most philosophical horror actor of the 1970s, and not saying anything. This is recommended, if not for one highly single liners.
