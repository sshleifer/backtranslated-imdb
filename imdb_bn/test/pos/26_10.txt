The film has protesters and Courtney's Fai Dreser can convince some people (who can really put a good smock on the head) - but the film is always at the top: compelling, shocking, relevant. Finney, naturally, is bigger than life. Courtney makes an ideal foil. I think Performance can be very strong in both Leads, and Courtney's character supplies a lot of dark humor. While the time is well captured, supporting cast is well-selected. This is seen and savored like a delicate cordial. I just wish the DVD already out of it ... (* sigh *) ...
