During the movie revolution of the 60's was revolution and music. Filmmaker Ant Garard was watching the movies daring to discuss banned substances before exploitation films. Beginning with "Breathless" and underground American movies (such as Kenneth Angel), the films became more experimental. Hollywood realized that if all of these were collected, there was a widespread commercial appeal with their "Easy Rider". One of the best (and most surprising) outputs of this era is initially one at least successfully. "Head" was created when the Monkeze Career was severely disappointed, which is sometimes condemned as one of the best psychedelic movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Well, not really one, many have opinions. It's going to Monkees from one surreal scenario to the next one. However, these sequences were apparently limited to LSD-tiled and fundamental how the Makkah was confined to their light pre-fashion fame. It is a shame that the film was found in no audience. The teeny boppers who like them have always moved onto a new fad. Those who were shot in the psychedelic / heights-ashbari rush, never have to face the death of Manki in the film. Its all their loss. This film may be a plot, but it is certainly not nonsense and is very well kept together. The crew then creates "Easy Rider" and "Five Easy Pies". This image was later revived during the archaeological period of 1973 and it achieved a very positive reaction, giving it the title after qualifying for a long time. Wickedly, this 80-year reviewer will be the victim of the same business as the protesting monkey in the movie. (10/10)
