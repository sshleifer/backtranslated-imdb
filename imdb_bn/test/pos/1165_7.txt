As widow Paradakari, the boycott was taken for the ransom of the Cannes Burgen abduction and Sik Rasuli. The incident came in 1904, Theodore Roosevelt ran for the presidential election on his right. A good example is to demonstrate the muscular foreign policy of the United States, as the Roosevelt, Brian Keith declares the Moroccan sultan, "Paradikari is alive or dead in rausuli". <br /> <br /> But this adaptation of this event is the only true story in this story. Paradisiris was actually the question of Ion Perdicricus who was a Greek immigrant and a Deliliant playboy. In fact, Pericaris gave up his American citizenship years ago and returned as a Greek national. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This phenomenon presented here is used by European powers to get their footprint in Morocco. Conspiracies are far more than a brigade's ransom demand. <br /> <br /> The wind and the lion are rarely history. But it's an enjoyable movie and Shan Connery is always fun to watch. Brian Keith fits my idea of ​​Theodore Roosevelt and the scenes at Roosevelt White House are true of all the stories. John Haston starred in the State Patient State John Hey, who inherited Roosevelt from his ancestor William McKinley. <br /> <br /> But the children do not use this film to read the history of theodore Roosevelt era.
