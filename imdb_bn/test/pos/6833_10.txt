The director (Sebastian Gottairez) was astonished to know that a young Venezuelan (28) and bored with many anticipated movies, I was very happy to see this script that there have been so many short stories and signals spread. Directed by black humor and taste, I liked the tension between Boggart Rickman and very natural but beautiful Thompson. Each member of the gang deserves attention, Gill Bello is his best. Gigino is amazing.
