I saw this film with high expectations but was somewhat frustrated. Although I liked this movie and was mad by the story, I could not move it and it seems like the last flat plane. <br /> <br /> Which of these stories is a photo shop and its best customer policing traffic? Location is a pure Korean village. <br /> <br /> This film is realistic in some ways, because tragedy has an element and yet it is not melodramatic. However, I have not been transferred to any film that portrays an image that a woman loves so much, but does not even like to enter her life. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br />> < br /> Overall - well before sunrise and after the film in Sunset (or after sunset and after sunset)
