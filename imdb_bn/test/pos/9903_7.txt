I was lucky enough to catch this film at the Phoenix Film Festival and I must say that I enjoyed it. When I asked the director, if he went to the film school then I was not very impressed that he was not. Such films do not come from people without genius. Get a start in advertising and then shows this real range of comedy production in a heart-felt family. I will certainly keep an eye on what he does next. As a good indie movie, the film should be driven very character. As your average Hollywood movie, which is mostly driven by the plot. The movie center of a Jewish family in New York, Applebum, who was invited to the "suicide" group of their forefathers. The film is big, fast, jabig, dialogue full stock. Jews have covered the small Jewish family with the Jews, and none of the Jews is actually the unrealistic situation of a "suicide" group. Director Jeff Hare does an excellent job at pulling out characters from actors and bringing their lives to the screen. The production design sets life to be remembered as a home for more than 40 years, and has given attention to small details. This conversation continues with the dialogue that it lets you sit on your seat, who thinks the next malignant phrase or fist line is knocking down. And when it is appropriate, the visitors let them enter deeper into the hidden meaning and motivations hidden within this loving character. Check out this movie if you are a fan of Woody Allen or go to the movies "As Good Good at Gates".
