Adult version of the classic louis carol story you can expect is much better. Here Alice is a virgin librarian who read the hole of the rabbit and learn to love sex and her own self image. It was created when adult films were creative efforts with plots instead of just sex scenes, a smaller movie better than the budget movie of its day. Do you think that this movie is actually a good script with funny jokes and good songs. This is a naughty little story for adults. If you are not good at my recommendation or not, then think that this film was only available for non-hardcore versions of only three decades, because the film has sex with sex, as I watched movie years ago on cable TV. The relatively recent home video release in DVD has returned sexuality (terriblely inserted wired clips) which makes it clear about removal of shots. If you're an open man's adult with a taste for something spicy then I can sincerely recommend this small film as a nice separation.
