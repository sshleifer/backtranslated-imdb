It is easily one of the best films of the 1950s. Auto Pramming has only managed four or five good films and it is one of them. Frank Sinatra's best performance and dynamite score of Elmer Bernstein's music score From the opening title (by Saul's bus) drug addict Frank Frank is going to cool turkey, it's a riveting movie! Kim Novak (providing a very good performance), Alan Parker (alongside very bad performances), Darren McGuin is the Reporter Mascot and Arnold Stein Frank's Gifferer Pall. Beware of bad prints: This movie is in the public domain so some copies are quite rough.
