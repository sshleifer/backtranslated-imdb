Being a high school student, I will take a health class. This year, subject matter is drug. We know about a person because they harm. From what we say, I still believe and know that medicines can really embrace a person. However, my teacher wanted to see us. Naturally, we cry and start to sleep, but like the rest of my class, I really enjoyed this movie. It was completely real, and all coated sugar. The letters were amazing and trustworthy. Even the plot was outstanding, realistic and credible. What I liked about this movie was mainly how it can accept the point of the dominant medicine, and what is the key to dealing with it? Everyone reassures themselves that they will not be harmed. Let's get the good gravity. Something like Sam and Chris might even happen in your best friend, even in the small town. This movie shows it. A person can really know a lot from this observer. It was quite effective.
