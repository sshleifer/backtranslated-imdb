Since I'm 9 years old, I read Jane Austen's novels all the time in a year and found the modern library version of his work as a birthday. <br /> <br /> I love this movie for his romance and for music, which is on my head, suddenly. It was certainly an explanation, not an Emma or a sensation and sensitivity, but something different and Catherine loved herself. Oh will be loved by this loving Henry! It was Henry of Catherine's imagination, and she was promised a romantic heroine of her novels, and the real Zen Austen, who initially had told us that the narrative probably would be impossible. Jane was totally ironic in his novel. Possibly, he could imagine, too, such as Henry. <br /> <br /> I have not seen the film in at least a decade. But, since I'm ruining for it.
