Strict slander New York Police have killed their number one after a group of nasty brains involved in a detective ring headed by the most weird, hard-body body manukey (always played by superbly excellent judgment skid). Philip D'Antony, producer of "Bullet" and "French Connection", ruthlessly creates a strong, great, strictly casual nonsense voice, maintains a steady dynamism and stabilizes the action scenes with a lot of loud aloud. Dawn Alice's 'Racing String Score' enhances the more raw gradual intensity, although both the scrappy Big Apple position and the rough and granular painting of Ur Farura improve the reality of roughly gangiography. Moreover, the difference between fine lines from the culprits is that the police gets frustrated: The title team uses the stringent, cruel and morally suspicious strong-strategy strategy as a means of finishing law enforcement and there is no honor code in the lip. And the thieves who are clearly portrayed in this movie have covered the city. Tony Lo Bianko, Pesticide, Sniving Snitch Vito Lucia The Undertaker, as Richard Lynch's evil psychological hoodlum moon, sees Bill Hickmann as the cold-blooded sister of the moon, as Jerry Lynne's Fanny Flatfuft Mingo and Joe Spenel as a parking garage attendant. A highly wild and exciting lasting heart-in-your-neck mondo destructo qualifies as a specific highlighting of car charging. Climatic shootout delivers similarly stirring products. A little winner of a real bang.
