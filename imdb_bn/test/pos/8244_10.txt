I would like to say that I know Mr. Arnek's documentaries and so I knew that I would get a very well made piece of movie documentary. I was not frustrated. Like in history, I've seen hundreds of documentaries and liked different ways of doing this. <br /> <br /> The director and his 17 consultants (historians, elderly families) tried to access the reality of Gallipoli, the letters from the vendors on both sides. Therefore, history follows British, Australian and Turkish soldiers. <br /> <br /> This Duke of Jeremy Irons and Sam Neal describes how intense and passionate this document is inspired by their great voice. <Br /> <br /> I saw this movie in an Italian movie around Dolby. I bought the DVD last year and wait for 3 to 7 years for this talented director and his very best documentaries to do the next. <br /> <br /> Summary: Well. Intense History with passion - wrapped in a war documentary with great narrators
