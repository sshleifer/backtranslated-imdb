In the "shorts" world (most of which is not), this image is a gem. <br /> <br /> Reader for a blind woman, who is a young girl, a quiet, short peek in the world. Here star star Elizabeth Franz - tells about the textures, layers, and visual stories of the film illustrating beautifully. <br /> <br /> The dialog is short, cinematography is stunning and the direction is sure, clean and compelling. I saw this movie in a film festival held in Tribeca Bar - and in the first two minutes (and for the first time on that night), the crowd became calm. <br /> <br /> <br />
