I use "Princess Rackon" (the film's most accurate English title), as a litmus test for the humor of my friends. It leaves them cold and annoying - because it clearly shows many other commentators on this site - or doubling up the results of laughing, unusually huge grins and complimented gasps. <br /> <br /> Comedy comes from the film's consummate mix of parodies in contemporary style. The goals include a glass of Japanese and Western classical drama, from the poetry to Lott Shakespearean and the Spanish Renaissance imagination; Modern American and European singer's Naffe Vacuity, Random Tap- and Rap-Dance Songs and as a host of some very funny ballistic songs, dancers with all the loving "amateur" clich√©s; Japanese anime and samurai live-action reviews; Clear Buddhist religious ceremonies; And the overweening confection of the Venetian operetta. After the rebuilding of the musical instrument of Russell in "Lover", I did not smile so much in this film. <br /> <br /> Green texts come from clever text breaks. The memorable traditional 5-shaped structure of 17th-century master Chikmatsurah plays. The narrative goes on mixing music, curriculum, high flowing poetry and less comedy relief, as well as his work - here incomprehensible ninja, octoprece-retrograde, by the farmers in the illusion that he is a tanuki-racoon cave of the human. All these hanging together somehow, and even more significantly manage to add visitors' emotions through the welter of cultural references. <br /> <br /> The true "Princess Raccoon" wear her pan cultural clothing with alluring light, and there comes astonishing gas. Apparently - with the superiority of Russell - the film is a treatment, color and print, high costume, and colorful rioting with digitalized backdrops of classical Japanese images from the stages. The set, mixed with some breathtaking live action sequences in the summer field and the beach. Do you like it or hate it, but there is no point for the cheese being castigating cycles; And "Princess Racon" first and foremost, both East and West have stood as a funny and also tender proof of our contemporary cultural vacuity. Say!
