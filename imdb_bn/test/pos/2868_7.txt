This is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a while. An eerie abandoned house, interesting characters, gore and a rolled plot. Can you ask for something more horror movie? This is mostly predictable but most of the time, in 10 minutes, it can be the most horrifying reason, so I can not catch it against it. Music, camera angle and so forth are excellent. The set is good and very believable. There were not many concubines, but it was a horror film that was moving away from the many alternative plots just going away from a horrendous fear ... for fear ... it makes it easy and fix it. If I compare to any other movie, I would say it reminded me of the repeal of the Texas Censo genocide. Of course a horror movie lover must be seen.
