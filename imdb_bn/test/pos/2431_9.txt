Anastasia: Aster Mystery was a two-star starred historical movie based on the book of Peter Kurt, Anastasia: Undersea's Rendell. It keeps a lot more historically, the name changes, etc. But it sounds pretty good in the real story. Omar Sharif and Claire Bloom are very good like the Russian Royals, Sajer Nicholas and Carina Alexander. All the small images of Rex Harrison and Olivia de Havilland were stuck in my mind. Everything was in it a fantastic classy production with some fine acting. At the time of the first publicity in NBC in the late 1986's, it was quite stagnant by production prices. He also starred ex-German actor John Nicholas, who previously played in NBC's other Russian epic "Peter the Great". <br /> <br /> I felt that Part 2 exceeded some important details of Anna Anderson for travel in America. It is very important to know that, in 1986, Anna Anderson was less familiar with the story. Still, it was not yet known whether Grand Duchess Anastasia is claiming its trueity. Further information was made in the late 1990's and Anna Anderson is now famous for cheating <br /> <br /> Very bad networks are not making better television movies.
