This movie was better than I expected. I do not think it's worth a rating. I have seen PG-13 films with poor language and violence. I found this movie entertaining and I enjoyed it. If you are a person who disengages everything, it can be very wrong to you, but if you accept it for its face value, then you may find it entertaining.
