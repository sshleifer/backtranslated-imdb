I say, every time I see this movie, I feel deeply concerned about how he treats his drug addiction, not only in the most painful four years of life in Hong Kong. It is also true that being addicted to drugs, alcohol, or pornography can not hurt you, but you can also harm the most important people in the world: your family. Since the family is the # 1 priority of Asian culture, it shows how much love is gathered for the circle and how much a family loves its family. This is actually the first Chinese movie that I do not really enjoy, it's fun, but its surroundings (beautiful acting, tactful stories, great aspects) make this movie valuable. What's more, Hansenhein and his family have played their own story instead of having some B-movie actors who are trying to imitate the real person. It shows the film's authenticity.
