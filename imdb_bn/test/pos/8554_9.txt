I stumbled upon this movie when flipping the channel on late teeve one night. After about 20 years it continued my interest, because the important real life lesson teaches us about the dark side of human nature. And although it tells a real story about WWII, it's astonishingly crazy for the ugly things happening in Europe today. <br /> <br /> If you think of "ethnic cleansing", it is called today, but with regard to race or ethnicity, you can think differently after seeing this story. <br /> <br /> I think I would be very na√Øve to follow the set set according to any rules. Evil works as bad. <br /> <br /> This movie teaches a valuable lesson, and I particularly recommend it. Church groups or civil rights organizations <br /> <br /> I do not hope it will be very easy to find and rent, but I really want to see it again because it has a wonderful view in it's completely unknown but interesting aspect of the "complexity of the nation's efficiency". In this scenario, at the beginning of the war, the Progressive, captured by the Nazis, was "discovered" and entered into a house by the SS Race Authority. There two played a free game, where the SS officer came from our hero (Anthony Quinn's character) - and he was able to determine where his ancestors came from. Well "Quinn's character is not a" bad "race member after all, but on the contrary, he is a perfect, archypical Arya !, which means that the name of the queen is not the full meaning of the character but the SS people are interested in talking about the cities, the rivers and the mountain ranges, There is a difference in terms of the perfect Aryan archive. Among other things, he left his job in a servant worker factory where he She is wearing a scalp, and in a slave modeling job where she wears Nazi uniforms, yes it is sure to be a good person, who was always grateful for wearing a nice dress ... until the combined soldiers arrive and recognize the cover from the magazine cover. br /> <br />
