My husband received an OBWD DVD for Christmas and this is the best gift from us! We will laugh at each and every time we have seen it 12 times! We are beautiful scenes of this movie and the music is outstanding! We bought soundtracks and we need a pickup when we are in our car and at home, and every day! If you need advice for a good gift for movie lovers then this movie! Characters are funny, engaging, and very interesting to describe the expressions of their faces! I'm always a fan of George Clooney, but now I'm a fan of Team Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Tarturo (Pitt) and now I'm looking for them in other movies! You will see this movie !!!
