In 1962, Goldie Haun was particularly well known for television comedy shows - particularly Ron and Martin, who was a young blonde in Gigi Cooke. He made films before the Cactus Floor, the Walt Disney feature is the most notable, only and only general, original family band. কিন্তু ক্যাকটাস ফ্লোয়ার তার চরিত্রটিতে লাউগ-ইন থেকে উঠেছিলেন এবং (আইএল ডায়মন্ড-বিলি উইলডারের দ্বিতীয় অংশীদার - এবে বারোজো খেলার উপর ভিত্তি করে একটি ভাল স্ক্রিপ্টের কারণে) তিনি টেলিভিশন চরিত্রটি বিকাশ করতে সক্ষম হন যাতে একটি বাস্তব কর্মক্ষমতা ছিল আউট fleshed। As a result, MS Haunon won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 1969 and his career has been a hit for future successes like Personal Negro and First Lady Club. Although Laura's other stars have performed well on television (Henry Gibson plays a repetitive role as a Judge of Boston Legally) Only Goldie is able to keep a career as a star. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There will be a helplessness in the personality of Gold that would be embarrassing. Sometimes she understood and covered with a loud voice and smiled, but sometimes his mistakes did not see (for example: goldike 1950 Different Show host Gary Moore met is made and is called "Goldie, this is Mr. Gary Moore." He blurts his hand (much to his confusion), "I always wanted to show Mr. John Gary Moore!"). But it's quite different as Tony Simmons. He said Julian Winston (Walter Matthew), who is in love with a successful dentist who can never marry him. Julian told him that his wife (with whom he had two sons and a daughter) would never divorce him. So at the start of the film, Tony tried to commit suicide by using her hair gas. But he stopped gas from his neighbors, Igor Sullivan (Rick Lennz), a struggling playwright, in his apartment. <br /> <br /> Tony has resigned to live, but he sent Julian suicide note. Ego's note tries to provide a message to ignore, but Julian's receptionist / nurse / assistant, Stephanie Dickinson (Ingrid Bergman) does not prevent Julian's work schedule from being passed on him. Instead of finding letter and races in Julian Tony's apartment, only to see him alive. Egoor supports his story when he tried to kill himself, Julian realized the depth of his love, and decided that he had to marry a woman. Unfortunately Tony has swallowed Julian's lies and believed in his wife and children. You see, Julian has no wives and children. Since Tony is convinced that she can not marry her Julian with lying, she is stuck in a weak tree branch. <br /> <br /> Suspicion by Julian Stefanie said that she was Mrs. Winston. Initially, Stephanie opposed her, but on her own first Saturday, Tony brought Tony to his record shop. They talk, and Tony has all the subtle powers (and Stephanie has her two nieces with Tony's character and personality), Tony thinks they belong to Julian's kids). Tony told Jaliyan that Stephanie is likely to see a man who is going to get married. So the falsehood began to inspire Julian, Stefani, and Tony. Soon a lover Steveny was given as Julian's friend and freeloading patient Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston). Greenfield is so lazy (Stefani hates him) that Tony feels that he is not worthy of Stephanie. <br /> <br /> and it's a complexity (most deliberate, caused by incorrect informative Tony) Conclusion The script is filled with first-rate status and one-lainaragulira (example: Julian for lying about their marriage stuphanike Tony recorded two albums purchased from stores.) He stole Tony has a Minc, but he has agreed to send stiphanike. Stephanie Mink is very happy with Julian's card, but she does not talk about the nature of the gift - when she grows heavily thanks to Mattau, she wants to say Harvitt - Vladimir Hirovits. Stefani thinks Harvitt named Fourier!). <br /> <br /> <br /> Bergman could enjoy the film, because several scenes show that in the 1940s movies, the world was illuminated for him. But his 1958 film Comedy Smash Hit, similar to Indict, was similar. Carey Grant lied to focus on the romance of their love without thinking about marriage. When Grant's lies were disclosed to Bergman, he decided to make a lie to convince Grant that he was making him helpless. এখানে, মাতুথোকে বিশ্বাস করতে প্যাসিভ প্রেমিক হওয়ার পরিবর্তে সত্য বলছে, বার্গম্যান আড়ম্বরভাবে মাতুথোকে তার জগাখিচুড়ি থেকে একটু সাদা মিথ্যা বলার চেষ্টা করছেন, কেবলমাত্র একজনের জীবনকে জটিল করার জন্য একে অন্যের দিকে নিয়ে যায়। Bergman becomes part of those problems as a beautiful woman, despite being tried to be a part of the solution, as part of a part of the solution, all the Leeds are well, especially Bergman, well all the business thoroughness is good but gradually its reclaiming good Perform sexuality Matuou is delightful as a laughing loser, this is an obstacle that can not just kick one side. Supporting cast, especially Westin Münching and sexual relations Harvey and Vito Scoti as UN Ambassador who actually did the hotspot for Bergman. This is a cute ridiculous, and it's a really good way to film Goldenie Haunon.
