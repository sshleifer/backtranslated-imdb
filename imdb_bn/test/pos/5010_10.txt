After watching the series premiere of Talk Show with Spike Fiston, I really thought that after 12, good shows were seen in addition to the bath and I was very sad that it was only 30 minutes long. His great writing skills helped in the lack of series and hand help in this show. Electronic Lincoln was sunny and I really think it would be a good bold horse talk show. <br /> <br /> I was very happy I managed this and gave some good lines to work with Andy Richards. You suspected that it was a little shiny but for the time it was very good. <br /> <br /> Overall if you're not the weed someone or even you and you have nothing to do is more important than this great piece of watch and it's a fun time.
