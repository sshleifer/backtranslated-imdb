It is one of the best films made about 80 punk scenes. I saw a "bootleg" copy a few years ago and amazed. Nowadays, very few children know the true root of Punk and this film shows some pank legends of the 80s, such as germs, and shows how it got back. Nowadays, most of Pink's main streams go with it watching MTV and radio and real underground rebel movements of the original scene. Derby Crash (the Germs) is one of my hirsules and why this image shows. One would see all the "punks" and the curious about the 80s punk scene
