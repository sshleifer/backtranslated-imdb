This movie is a jewel ... an explored Gary Anderson classic. <br /> <br /> The source of both "UFO" and "Space 1999" is clear from this movie, which went to the last ed Bishop and George Sewe, both with Cast list, "UFO". <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that despite many of his TV successes, Anderson did not have the chance to develop his talent on the big screen. Think of what he can do with the movie version of "Thunderbirds". (<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> you'll appreciate the good qualities of it.
