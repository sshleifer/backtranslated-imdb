I mostly agree with Australia's comments. However, there is a fairly decent plot in the ID, if the unit is there. Christina (Kelly McCarty) was a landowner who wanted to open a mountain lodge. He came back to Chip (Bobby Johnston), whom he knew while growing there. When James (Paul Logan) came with his new stripe friend Shane (Davin Lane), the plot grew even more because Cristina had become friend of James Streep for a few years, and this means that James did the wrong thing. A novel in Rome shows interest in the movie as a guest in Sofia Lynn (Monique Parent), as a guest, such as Eric (Sebastian Guy) and Linda (Flower), the pair of lawyers from the city. One of his dirty tricks to stop James Christian's business building's local insider inspector So the question is, "how far will James rob him of lodge and he will be successful?" Look here for the Devil Lane and "Beauty betrayal" here. He seems to be making a transformation of the world from "hard" to hard-core business. Another notable Samantha McConnell, playing the role of "Bat", is clearly the most harmful character in the film!
