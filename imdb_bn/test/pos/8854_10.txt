Things are a milestone in making movies and one of my favorite movies of all time. Despite the film's roots in science-fantasy, it is finally a horror film that splits brightly with mental disorders. Today, for more than 25 years after the release, special effects have emerged as examples of brilliant talent and influence, Rob Botine has suffered a complete physical breakdown for his industry. The studio is certainly impossible to make the same movie strongly in the role of female character or Paul-Walker type. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They become steadily growing each other, because they become increasingly uncertain and who are a simulation, and this 'body graduation' scene decreases their numbers continuously one-by-one, they are victims of thieves. When it exposes itself as a different night wild animal in the corner, the transformation is always terrible and compulsory. <br /> <br /> A group of discouraged men, without any means from their situation, helplessness, isolation and clustrophobia and continue to help in any way to reach them. Long hours of dark and growing snow provide a dark backdrop to the spirit of terrorism. The director John Carpenter's impressive character is selected with the care of the actor and every member of the team; they are young and street-friendly chefs, adult and wise doctors, or the bitter and cruel helicopter fits perfectly. Pilot The point is that no one here came from an American-American diamond superhero locking people, and with six-packs, the real power of this film does not thank any part of this little reality. The screen-affected people are recognized in our daily lives. <br /> <br /> Things are enjoyable and enjoyable even after it's repetition. I am now seeing the film in more than 20 programs and the quality of my role, my surprise, acting and special effects are unstable. My girlfriend likes the high school spin off of the film - faculty - which is good and solid entertainment but more light-hearted and whistful She still loves and admires the talents of Thing, and thanks for her love ... because I can not live with someone who loves this movie. <br /> <br /> is a classic and then something.
