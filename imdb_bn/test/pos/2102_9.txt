The cruel evil war criminal Samansoos (played by the euphemism of Euterro Gomi) cruelly persecuted peaceful residents of a small village. The life of monster stone idol is equally socious and its life is destroyed to destroy the evil. Director Kimi Joshi Yasudo and screenwriter Titasuro Yisida described the story of all the power and simplicity of ancient fictional folktale: an extremely ancient concept of ancient times and remote distant places (this is especially feudal set in Japan), good boys are famous and objectionable, when villains Truly nasty and hateful, sometimes excited tires are bay Gurto skills and is governed by the impressive special effects and subtle, serious tone and set the pace for a minute, is not disturbed, and the wrath of the savage destruction majinera the last rock is extremely lively, exciting, and more than a little frightening. Moreover, the strong paraphernalia of the narrative is firmly convincingly firmly credible in the dark, harsh and harsh world. This image has earned bonus points for pretending to be cruel vengeful power to portray Majin instead of the perfect pure soul. The elderly composer Akira Ifkub provides a generally rich, robust and enthusiastic score. Fujio Morita's sharp, Moody cinematography strikes Bull's eyes in the same way. Capable of doing all the respectful sound and heartfelt acting, especially the June Fujimaki tragedy, the protective Cognaca and Hansen Guanuro as Tassoo Endo do the commendable work. Highly recommended.
