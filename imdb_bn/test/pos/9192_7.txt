I read the latest comment in this photo and totally and totally disagree with it. <br /> <br /> You see, I can not say anything to the Portuguese nationality and anyone coming from Boston, it must be saying both to both the Portuguese and Brazilian people as well as immigrants. <br /> <br /> And why, can you be surprised? Well, first of all, this film is related to two brothers: Portugal and Brazil. Brazil achieved its independence in the early 19th century (in the hands of the Portuguese throne) and after that its relations have improved greatly. <br /> <br /> However, this may be meaningful, there are still many prejudices. Because of the economic climate of Brazil in the 1990's, the immigration of Portugal greatly increased. You see, Portugal is not only a country that will share the same language, culture and belief as Brazil, but the rest of Europe will also be the gateway. In this way, some people were forced to cross the Atlantic and find a better life, and Portugal was the first logical place to try to migrate. <br /> <br /> It still happened to many migrants, but they received average wages under the minimum wage and were considered "dirt" - only in this case, because the language is similar, they are constantly aware of their status like immigrants . Another strange thing is that in this country, so much knowledgeable people in their country's history have tried to survive through the export of individual national resources. It is such a person who puts Brazil in constant arrest, because the country is well-placed in natural resources and can easily mount economic stairs, it should be given a suitable opportunity. A concept, this colonialism still exists - Pablo represents the exploited people, one of whom is named as "superior person" (or at least rich or "well off"), as assured by the stable foreign colonial power. Are <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not want to say lecture or do not want to sponsor anyone's history but I think this f Ccitra was symbolically very powerful. I'm not saying there was no room for improvement (as always) but I think the last comment in it was not only a narrow mind but it was caught by unknown people. <br /> <br /> One last talk will be about this, I've seen you with the eye of this movie "American Movie Viewer". There is no harm by this comment, but I mean "foreign" movies can not be about "beautiful scenery" - the industry is concerned with its problems. You do not expect auto decode, for example, to make all the beautiful places of Bayern and Black Forest ... If you want to focus specifically on the attention of a filmmaker, but do they think that there are more relevant topics to participate in? <<br /> <br /> In short, do not judge movies lightly and do not give just two or three criteria. This picture is very interesting, its photography is quite good and it also handles how black and white conversations are handled by it. I think the image is purposefully grain ... not like the reality? <br /> <br /> <br /> Check it out and reach your own conclusions ...
