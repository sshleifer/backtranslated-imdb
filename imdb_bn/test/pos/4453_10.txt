Collector director Lucio Florchi was probably famous for his poor Junkie Flickr in the 1980s, which earned him the reputation of being "Godfather of Gore". Phulasi's greatest film, though in 1972 and it is definitely ironic and violent, it is often not as poor as its other films. "A C Cigizia U Paperano". The 1972 "The Torture in a Docking" is not only one of the greatest films of Phulossea, this tantalizing and completely bright geyollo is one of the absolute highlights of this genre. Wonderful atmosphere and tantalizing suspense, great segillian setting, brilliant performance of the interesting story or the cruel moments of cruel shock - I do not know the most appreciated about this wonderful gaolalo! "The torture is not docking" really gives cinematic perfection in every aspect, it makes the perfect writing of Italian horror movies. <br /> <br /> Unlike other Gali, it is not a seductive beauty queen, who was killed. One after another, but little boys who are murdered by the killer. Small boys' bodies are found in rural Sicily. Police are desperately searching for the killings, but the little town is basically a bunch of strange people, and the city is shouting for criminals ... <br /> <br /> This picture is very skeptical and inconsistent from the beginning. , A radioactive, dark, and persistent dense atmosphere that is still quite similar. The acting performances are among the best of Italian horror movies. Thomas Million (one of my personal best-time actors) is great for leadership like investigative journalist Andrea Martinieli. Sexy Barbara Bouchet delivers both eye candy and a brilliant performance. Irina Papas and Florida have similar performances from Balkan, who are quite brilliant in their role. Riz Ortolani's great score brightens sensation and atmosphere, and the film captures impressive scenes of scenic scenes in the Sicilian landscapes. Though not as glorious as the other Phulchi movies, this film is cruel and inconsistent with violence, with some harmful cruel scenes. <br /> <br /> "Do not be victims of extraordinary torture". It's not easy to catch as most flowering flicks, but I'm convinced that it will stop exploring. Any horror fan must be able to see my personal preference and I usually do not want to recommend a real lover at this moment. A masterpiece!
