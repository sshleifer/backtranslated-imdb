The visual effect of this film is disproportionate to what I have seen. And the work required to achieve this was incredibly long and tedious (you get "Kodak Garni Film" in your camera to get this look). Do not look for this movie to be entertained, it's visually stimulating, stimulating and stimulating your thoughts on the film, and see any thing that seems to be a thing, religion would probably be a thought. <br /> <br />
