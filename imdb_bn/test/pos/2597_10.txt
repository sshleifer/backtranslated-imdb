Bugs Bunny and Duffy Duck - Ali Bab Boney - When it comes, the only movie that I can think of is better or better than it can be. However, it is irrelevant to determine which one is best - just look and enjoy both of them. <br /> <br /> I compared this to Ali Baba Bani because both of them are his worst - greedy, nasty and very interesting process. However, I think RAB-bit Sejoning simply likes because the bugs are too terrible for it - Daffy tries a dirty trick every time while returning to Duffy. <br /> <br /> A hunter (Naturally, Elmer) hopes to leave the rabbit explosion and leave Daffy alone to track that hole directly up to the bug! Do not be dismissed, the bugs again and again take Deafir's tactics and turn them around - and in most cases it shoots Duffy face to face! It's all very, very tricky and fun and I do not care how old you are, this cartoon will smile you until you're a grouch. I especially love the great and unexpected end, but I will not say anything because I'm not surprised.
