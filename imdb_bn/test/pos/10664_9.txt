A milestone in the history of the movie, 'Bronicates ptoimacin' is one of the coolest movies that can be perfectly classified as a classic. This was the picture that Sergei M. Eisenstein made a screenplay for making movies. And today, it is still always remembered as the wonderful piece of movie. <br /> <br /> 'Potyomkin' is a film that needs to be viewed as a single, not to be picked at. Those clips do not just present the 'Odessa step' sequence and will not only see them moving into 'Citizen's ears' or 'The Godfather', it's always time to really understand and enjoy it during the 75-minute running time. Although not every smallest statement is expected to be perfect, I think '20 seconds' silent era 'skua do' acts like a master of obscure reality, some plot points may seem irrational and some of the series of war appear, but it is still a Very enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The most memorable moments in the film are anti-war rebellion, the body of Jahacinchuk, the ship is falling on the ship, the sailor under the tent at the end of the pot, the mother holds his child, the Odesa is driving a baby car and the lion is crying more crying. With every new eye, I see, 'Blaileeshiptemkin' is alive again.
