It was a very fun, fast paced movie. I've seen it once and kept my rent for others to show. I want to know this opportunity, how do the H.H. producers like their subtitle translator? I am the most enthusiastic. Please point me out. <br /> <br /> Again, for returning to review, it is a true rolling film with plenty of content, classic memories, though full with slopstick. Memorize the Mexican comedians of Cantinflas <br /> <br /> The film does not disappoint fans, who have noticed that they have chosen Chinese themes very easily, which can be very rarely invented. The director's entire collection is a way to get a look into the culture in a neutral way. <br /> <br /> and I do not see how Chinese Feast could be leading to her funny girl.
