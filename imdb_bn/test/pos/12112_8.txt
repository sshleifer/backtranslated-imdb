"Buffalo Bill, The Farwest of Hero" director Mario Coaster helpless Spaghetti Western may be produced in Europe with "The Bust" Clauskisski. Hollywood will never dare to create a western Western project about a sex hunter as the protagonist of a movie. Kinski is ideally suited to fit the role of 'crazy' Johnny do not remember. He completely played a person without sympathy, wearing white clothes, pants and hats in his toes from his head. This low budget oater has nothing to hunger about it. There are generally no provocative Spanish scenery around Almatya. Instead, Costa and its director photography Luciano Tracy, who shot another Kiskki Western "and God Said to Kain", is responsible for this horse opera instead of Toraja caldera, lazio, Italy and Monte Gelato fruit, Teja River, Lasio, Italy. Did it. . However, "The Beast" qualifies as a continental Western because it is related to completely unscrupulous characters and the action can be classified as film noir because the hero and heroine are trapped by helpless situations, which force them to take shelter for criminal activities. Probably, the specific plans of the Kinsky character were lagged behind. In fact, the character of the licensed kinsky is a willie e. The type of quote is similar to the character. Incessantly, he struggles with sex with many beautiful women, but the law enforcement agencies or lawmakers disappoint each of his efforts. Finally, the amount of irritability except "BISHT" is a tragic character study. The Stelvio Cipriani orchestral score was lifted by Tony Anthony Western "The Stranger Returns". Mario Costa Screenplay takes place on the western border between San Diego and Mexico, which is a notorious Mexican bandit named McHite (Giovanni Palavicino of "V Steel Kell's Old Way") and its gang is terrorized. They are victims of staging and safe from anyone of their depredations. For the first time we see Crazyie Johnny Lester, she lets herself refresh herself and washes a pretty looking woman's clothes. He trembled and attacked him, but a large man armed with a rifle interferes and he has to flee. He looks around in a town and a snuff-snorting gunslinger, he recruited to help a wealthy person, Mr. Ability, Trail and robbed him. They killed him and received some money from the wind. Mr. Snf-Sniffer accidentally released his sniff box for the crime and Sheriff was arrested for suspected murder. Crazyie shot his associate from his hotel room to death so that he could not think of getting involved in crime. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a young couple in love is having trouble creating their way to the world. . Riccardo (Steven Ted of "Ricker for a Bouty Killer") helps a Mexican couple raise their foxes and helps raise their real son Juan. In the village, the boyfriend of the recorder, Juanita (Gabriela Jiergelli of "Sacrangente Strangento") sang in the canteen and danced. Riccardo and Juanita plan to get married, but the last place in which Zuneia wants to settle down is in the dust storm. He dreams of living in the city, but the life of the city needs Ricardoro or more money. They are grouped together with a blonde exiled name Glenn ("The Living and the For the Dead The Devil") and when they come to get her legacy, then plans to kidnap Mrs Nancy, the daughter of Mr. Power. Glenn has made a serious mistake for Crazyie for her help because Glyn knows that Johnny needs money to get women. <br /> <br /> They kidnap powerful girls and keep them in a remote cabin with a public watchdog. Moreover. At this time, Juanita was enchanted as a powerful girl and Powers attorney found her in the city to get money from Gary Pinkerton ("Blood and Black Lace" Giuliano Raffaelli), but she suspects because Juanita does not think she feels like Nancy. Riccardo brandishes his six guns and Panterton warns that he kidnapped Nancy. Unfortunately, for Ricardo and Juanita, Pinkerton kept only $ 50,000 because McHait struck the fear that everyone's hereditacy could not be transmitted across the region. Meanwhile, returning to the cabin, horny mother tried to rape Nancy, but she expelled her, assuming she was alone, she took her to the chair. He makes him unconscious, he steals a garden and drives back to town. Johnny came back, followed him, and at the same time Glenn, Ricardo, Juanita and Pinterton met him. They notify Johnny about the complications caused by MacHeight's terrorism regime and give him 12,000 dollars as a money-cut. Pinkerton was excited by Nancy's vampire body and threatened Johnny. Naturally, Johnny pushed him into cold blood. <br /> <br /> As soon as the San Diego law came out to catch McHeight, it really started to get worse. Glenn, Ricardo and Juanita returned to Mexico, when Johnny was attacked and caught on a farm by two people. She wanders in Mexico, finds a canteen whore and goes down on her when she receives a revolver. Johnny admits that if they release him, he knows where they get more money. McHuit's people took Juanita after following Johnny's tip. Villagers joined Ricardo to rescue McKay and rescue Johnny Juanita, but later he died after a big shoot. Riccardo is left alone now. McHite and his men take vengeance against their parents, not only kill them, but also a little gambler. Riccardo and Juanita dream up everything up in a gun smoke cloud for an unhappy end. 'Crazy' Johnny dies and never gets her desire assuage. If you think of the coaster disagreeable menstruation, "The Bust" is an interesting characteristic and appears in a Western setting as an exercise in the film, where everyone gets punished.
