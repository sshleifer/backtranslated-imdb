This movie felt so real. I actually felt emotional feelings all the time during my life - both Rory and Michael. I've droolted Dissin's Masculus like Rouier, so I really felt myself what I saw here. Some people will not believe that people like Rory, full of anger and rebellion, are full of people. I know they exist because I'm one of them. <br /> <br /> The story is great. For a drama, character-driven movies, the story comes quickly. I was not disturbed, maybe partly because I saw the close staff of my heart. But I think most people, intelligence, will be covered on screen and take care of the letters. Acting is awesome! James MacAye is perfect as Raurie O'Shea, who has Deseen's muscular diarrhea. He deserves a prize for Steven Robertson's photo of Michael Connolly, who is Cerebral Palazzi. <br /> <br /> Michael's love does not return any girl, and Rory helps him deal with her. I have felt this feeling many times and the question is, "Does he not love me because I am not just one or my disability has stopped him?" Whatever the girl saying, we will always be the suspect as the truth. It's just natural and it hurts in some way. <br /> <br /> Some parts make me cry because it is tragic and I have to face my own problems. Without a terminal disability people can not just start fathom how it can feel. This is a must see movie for everyone. Disabled people everywhere and widely misunderstood. This film gives a little light on some of the events of life, which is accepted by the able body. We want to be like you - in our own position, to go out, to be drunk, to love. Outside, we can not do much, but inside, we dance!
