I have a glutton for B-movies. I prefer to rent like this movie in old drives. This film is made for very little money, it is one thing that some big budget movies fail. It is cheezy. It's poor. It has no real plot, but it's a one and a half hour entertaining me. I was laughing or laughing my eyes. A guy gets stabbed in the chin by a knife while a guy has some great effect like a shot from inside the mouth and it slaps into his face's roof and his face slams into the roof, and a guy yanked out getting his eyesballs. But there are loads of locks, and some psycho-killer Patterns after Texas massacre Texas, and have a demon scarecrow. I like dialogue that the killers do the same as torture and kill people. It works great cameras, and has some cool editing strategies. It's more original than the first bloodbath, and the unwanted look is even better, but it's patterned after the trashy jambi films of the 70's and 80's, and it still has a charging factor that holds the higher power. Do not expect Romero, the second rate is Fulci I want to say that fans of Haraara will like it, and it's fun and quick ride through cheezy and B-movie land.
