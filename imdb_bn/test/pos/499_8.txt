When I saw it in the theater, I thought, it is no idea what it is going to be, and it is so happy that when I bought the video I promised to buy the video. <br /> <br /> I will not go too far to disconnect this picture, but I will say that I gave you 8/10 for the reasons that I can read in other user reviews. <br /> <br /> This is what I say: <br /> <br /> The first 10 minutes of this photo are incredible. I've never seen it as a textbook audience grabber nearby. I once put this movie in a party, where everyone roams around and is ready to leave. I just wanted to see what was going on by showing me for ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Everybody who looked at the open, went to the end.
