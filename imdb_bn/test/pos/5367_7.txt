For the first time I saw Satan's Brotherhood, 12 years old I saw this in a small town in the state of Central Washington, that we had already played before the crypt because my sisters were already afraid of Satan's Brotherhood. All in all I had it a pretty good movie. The start was okay, we were just sitting and the tank made a number on the station wagon. <br /> <br /> What hit me about this movie was visible around the city where it was illustrated, it is almost similar. The area around Chelan W.H. where I saw the movie, especially when they were heading towards the city of Hillsborough, which is located in SW New Mexico, a small town. I always like Lucky Jones and Storthar Martin and Charles Batman who liked another program on the smart screen. I gave the movie 7 and later when I saw Tales from the crypt, I thought Satan's Brotherhood was good.
