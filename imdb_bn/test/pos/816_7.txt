The working girl is related to Kiti (Source) Bill (Kelly), who works long hours in her garage, neglecting to save money for her marriage. After standing on his birthday, the key goes to a double date / blind date, where he met the department store heir Bob Hartwell (Hamilton). She falls in love, but she is released in protest to show her wife's intention to become her mistress instead of changing his wife. The Trusted Bills round him for consolation, and in the end he gives requests repeatedly to restore his employment, after losing his job, he supports his family's bill. When Bob returns, he is convinced that he wants all after marriage, how will he follow his heart or conscience? <br /> <br /> I was much better than this picture. The character of Bill was stopped for the first time as Jack Karson, as the angle of the Iron Age of Kunni. But Kelly (and script) narrates character with genuine compassion and love, and Bill becomes the best person in the whole group. Visitors may find themselves against the cracked heartwale for bread! Film tones, though light-hearted romances, and in a very dark direction, especially in a dancing marathon illustration and Bill Garage rather than in a terrible accident. <br /> <br /> Cast is rounded as dependent Jane Darwell, a weak but still starkly stupid Mickey Rooney, as a younger brother, and Spencer Charters as the Ner-du-Well Father of Kitty.
