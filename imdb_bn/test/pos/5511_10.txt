I really did not have bad in this movie Sure, the intelligence type sucks on his work, and he accidentally happened on Captain Howy, but he ended the job. Captain bone was very scary myself. Make-up artist did a great job. I really liked dee seen all geeky dresses. I saw when I laughed so much. I personally do not see how anyone can survive from the shit like Texas Chess genocide and call it a great movie and then shows Strangland which is more annoying because it can actually be so popular with the internet and it can call it bad I personally think the Texas Chainsaw genocide was rude. Perhaps one of the stupid movies that I've ever seen. I enjoyed Strongland. It was a very annoying movie because it almost all happened.
