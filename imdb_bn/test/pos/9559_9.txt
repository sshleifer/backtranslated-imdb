In the previous comment I mentioned how much I enjoyed this movie - better second time I do not resile from that opinion. Curiously, I do not find anyone like it. <br /> <br /> My mother was going to see it but a few friends told her, "No way". My sister and her family watched and the theater went through halfway. <br /> <br /> My wife recommends that the Australians view letters as normal, everyday and that's not so funny. But, hey, most Americans think that all Australians are like crocodile Dundee, so it is better to boot instead of boot on other legs.
