Edward Demitic's "Crossfire" is a rare movie from the 1940s. The director and his adapter, John Packthon, decided to do with the novel, because of this, it was a groundbreaking area for Mr. Dummyric and the studio. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Please see the picture, please stop reading now. <br /> <br /> The Richard Brooks novel is about killing a gay soldier. In the film, the subject was turned around in favor of the bias against the Jews, that theme was banned during the American Theme. There was the courage to be involved in this film project. Democratic achievement. <br /> <br /> The film is an outstanding part of filmmaking because the director presents it. Clearly influenced by the film Nir's style, we were taken to Washington post war. The opening scene of Samuels' brutal murder shows a tremendous cruelty, which we still do not know, why it has been killed, but not worthy of death in such a horrific fashion. <Br /> <br /> The basis of murder is bias, pure and easy. We realize how in an unconscious mind, in the minds of the murderers, the truth is, to be successful and different. Samuels stands as a sturdy lamb, similarly Gayle's novel is being victimized. Parallel is well painted. <br /> <br /> This image creates an interesting scene because of Robert Ryan's bright star as Montgomery. Mr. Ryan was an actor who always played an interesting role, but "crossfire" was not good enough. Also, the glamor has a great appearance, such as Guinea, with his heart in the right place <br /> <br /> The rest cast can play as an ankle. In charge of investigation, Robert Young is a decent person who knows the first biases in his family and speaks loudly against him. Robert Mitchell plays a cool Sgt. There is a complaint against a man who touched deeply in the prison. Sam Leven is a nice role in Samuels' role. <br /> <br /> This is a film that probably speaks loudly against ignorance.
