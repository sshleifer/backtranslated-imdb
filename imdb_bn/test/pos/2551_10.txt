Chop Shop, the second feature from Ramin Bahrani, is a rare species. This is an American film that tells a story that is not available in American stories, which is the story of the minorities living in poverty. It's a beauty of simple beauty. Shot in the shades of Shi'a Stadium in Queens, New York, shots, Chop shops are largely neo-realism. Combining a cast of non-actors, it's more common with anything from the US based classic cycle cheers to the D-Six, than anything else in the United States. There are no scores or soundtracks, all the music and sounds are diagetic. It looks like watching a great foreign movie, it takes us to another world because it's great to see. However, this second world is not in Rome or Istanbul or New Delhi after World War II, but it is contemporary New York City. <br /> <br /> Tells the story of Bahraini Al Aleandro (Alejandro Polanco), which is known as Alle. He is a 12-year-old Latin American child who does not have a parent or family unit to look after him. He was sitting in a small room in the auto store that worked himself. He shared the same bed with his teenager Isamar (Ismaar Gonzels). Some of them passed this second grade. Alley, though young, hard and mature. She works as a small family head. He hooks up his sister with a job, and while doing work in the chop shop, he can do something himself which he can do. She sold bootleg DVDs on the streets and candy on the subway. He searched the scrap's auto parts and sold them in street lining lining shops. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She herself became increasingly disinterested to abide by the law. He stole, first part of the car and later started the wallets. Like the violent protagonist of cyber thief Antonio, we can not blame the scholar to become a thief. It's just survival. Alay and Ismar hope to buy food vending van for $ 4,500. They show their way to the van and are very optimistic. However, as is usually the case for neo-reality, we know it will only lead to disappointment. <br /> <br /> Pollock's impressive performance gives legitimacy to the Chip Shop's realism. Here is a 12-year-old character that will be faithfully independent and vulnerably naive. Whether it is driving a car in the shop, whether it is selling movies or snack bars or whether his sister is playing in a small room? <br /> <br /> Chap Shop is a loving reminder that all American children are growing up in a land of opportunity. Many people in the medieval white America consider 'third world' as the life style of Aale. While reading the New York Times on Sunday morning, they worked on poverty and deprivation in foreign lands and made it blind in their streets. Once you see the chop shop, candy on the subway will be considered separately for the children of choice. <br /> <br /> Review more at www.mediasickness.com.
