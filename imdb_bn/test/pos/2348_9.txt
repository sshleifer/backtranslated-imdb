I like this picture, the second Naruto feature film. I enjoyed the ice one well, although I found the story a bit odd because I was not sure whether some things are going to happen or when Yet, like the first movie, it has a nice runtime for more than a decade and it has enough time for a well-developed film and some great winter. The story begins with Nina from the hidden village of Bali in the war with unknown attackers. Then Naruto, Sakura, and Shikumaru seem to be going to be an easily assigned shit to a ferret down. Naruto is separated from his friends after they have attacked with a strange young soldier in the armor and then find it otherwise after the attack. After they are both injured and accepted by a caravan and soon Naruto is invited to join this strange organization willing to create a utopia. Of course, it does not seem to have and there are lots of fights to go around. My favorite girl was fighting with this strange woman who made her very light, which is a big mistake. The last war is rather Naruto and this weird person who is associated with the villains better than the previous films.
