If you have a pretty awesome thing, this movie is the best of this genre. This is a horror film that relies on psychology and exciting buildings to create thrills, despite not being ineffective in the Gore scene. And it is one of the movies that is beautifully illustrated, where each scene is a whole world of symbols and details, which serve all the scope and style that it can be called but beautiful <br /> <br /> It is not easy story, after spending some time with two sisters in a mental institution, after their parents and parents returned to the field. They rarely deal with their mother's death and they try to protect their world, protect them against adults. So think the film is its exotic level. Indeed, gradually the film gradually develops slightly differently, but no frame is lost to express the feeling of romantic beauty, so I will not say anything more. Look at it, it's the best in the series of past horror films that has recently won world movies and it really shows that they were successful in doing it for good reason.
