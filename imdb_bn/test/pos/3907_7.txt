I believe this is one of Elizabeth Montgomar's best performances in a movie and I've seen most of her movies. I saw this for the first time on a 14-year-old television and I was very scared. I saw this movie every now and then, and I still enjoy it a lot. I know that this day the film will probably not be more afraid of the people. It can only show that public film and television viewers have seen too much graphic violence in the last 30 years or more. I like movies which do not show graphic details, your imagination works for you. Throwing in this picture was the top notch. Jess Walton, who played the sister in the story, was very good, although his part was small. He also made a terrible role for the television thriller, which you will not see once with Dave Hartman. I got the biggest kick out of the Ilyn Hackert maid. Aileen was so good as a woman with a very bad attitude. George Marshish, who played the husband, was quite effective. This story was probably the so-called wrong in the plot, but I love the movie. I highly recommend this movie to love the thriller about graphic violence. I gave seven movies to this movie.
