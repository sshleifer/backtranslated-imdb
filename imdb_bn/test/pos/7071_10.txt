Forgive me if I'm wrong, but due to many reasons Mexico can be one of the most serious movies in the history of film. We can get plenty of material for the perfect Mexican mid-class family morning: a cup of buoyant's spiritual motifs with a few drops in the fall of Ripestianan; A pound of phalas emblems around the film and more difficult than the difficult psychological complications, Todd Salondze's happiness and the Dogma movement. There are many carpets, black humor, suppressive dreams (Tiderora's dream of flying), lack of control irregularities (relationships between Marx and Lojmayer), equal equal stories, inconsistent violence, immunity and <br /> <br /> A small sign of hope (in Lozamate Spotlights, "Yuko Poko Month" used for husband's return home and lit-motif). Marx (Bruno Bichy) is an impressive character (I think in a bookciss way), except for a king-like crown that does not expect anything, but broken nose. Luzma (Maria Rojo), a loving wife, faces a lot, but the only thing that she was worried was that her sons had breakfast; She is a happy and sensual moment in a few moments, but you will fall in love with her. Soundtrack drag (too much wood) lacks technical expertise, deliberately, out of focus shots, enlightened close-up (underlying view), DG pan and sudden version cut. "Chronicica" is difficult to digest, it stops the throat and helps to do something for it. It is a nasty taste, such as a pepper orange juice and date-like milk, but you want to enjoy it. So I recommend to get some Melox before the show, because you will not be hungry after all.
