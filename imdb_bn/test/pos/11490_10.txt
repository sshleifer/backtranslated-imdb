It is frustrating that many people do not understand this movie. To get caught in peripheral elements, the film has to miss the true meaning. This film actually talks to the minorities who really believe in love and truth. It indicates that in today's society, people will often say that things are becoming rough, what is it like at this time without any intention of supporting things. As stated by the fact that the number of divorces to anyone else is clear. Some people actually believe in marriage forever forever. Forget about stereotype or something else, instead follow your heart, pay attention to what's important and fight for your faith. I've ended because it was easy to go with a sad person but the reality is rather great, and you should fight with everything you have, but sometimes that's still not enough. Very often forget about leaving the people and forgetting the magic of love. Late.
