Warning: read this entry after watching the movie! A year ago, 'Easy Rider' was released, trying to explain what would happen when genocide and mainstream (though right-wing) America got mixed with 'Joe' America, a violent end. Although the film is most often a slow showcase of traditional "old-fashioned" American morality 60's "key-felt-good" lifestyle, it is a commentary between high-class versus mid-vs. Their inability to show the mid-way while meeting diplomats with class and comet Boyle Joe represents a generation stuck in the 1940s and 50's, where 'kill a virgin for mummy (or jap or hippie), as long as it helps the United States and stores them. Joe and wife Mary Joe are obviously Archi Bunker and Dingbat's wife, Edith's Archeology. This film - which will be known forever for violent (but not bloody - no blood-seen), it is uneven. Joe Bombs (Actually) Hoppi generation (literally) descends with them to enter their numbers in order to identify the daughter of the compact - when she is obviously expected by the concept, she leaves the separatist idea for sex. When he was betrayed by theft (Read: Believing in the new generation of the old generation), he came out of the unexpected discipline of the killing. Perhaps due to Hollywood's tarantino, the spectators hope for the death of blood streaming in the last scene, but bloody shoots are long for any kind of impact or reality. 'Joe' is not a great movie, but it is an interesting showcase of class and culture isolation and vivid final characters in the reproductive spaces.
