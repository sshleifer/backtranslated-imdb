This movie is very silly and very funny. You can not criticize it for accepting yourself seriously. If you watched their previous album from the album or watched their HBO videos, then you can imagine how this film describes the story of how Tenissius D was formed. /> <br /> Comos' Completion, it does not only give a legendary account of Tennesses D, but it also sends the history of musical instruments. Some of the humor Mary reminds me that they often go to "places where you do not think they will not do it", but it lacks postgraduate humor in South Park. This movie has other nudity without the moon.
