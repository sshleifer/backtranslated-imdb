A stunning and heartfelt story about NiaGar, Niagara Sheth and Mercy Bay Out. Rabindranath gave amazing performance as Troy's Sidrome-led Mercy, becoming sick and sick due to the film's progress. This movie is not very optimistic and it is very difficult emotional, but very romantic at the same time. It's hard to explain, but watch it and find out for yourself. It's definitely worth it.
