As it turns out, Chris Farley and David Spade together made three films ("Coneheads", "Tommy Boy" and "Black Sheep"), but these were really "citizens who" of their pairings. Farley Thomas Colahan III, playing the discrete heir of an auto parts company. His father Big Tom (Brian Denhehei) recruits lightly, Richard Hayden (David Spade) to look after him. Big Tom is married to "Ten" (Bo Derek), so everything needs to be fixed. If Big Tom died suddenly, Tommy and Richard have to try to sell half a million auto parts to save the company from bankruptcy. Then, the film is one of the best works for Chris Furley, which he can do the best work: Create a mess of everything. <br /> <br /> When this movie came first in the theater, I saw that grandfather. He came out that the characters of Bo Derek and Rob Loire were hiding something. But you can completely ignore it and you can only be luxurious in Chris Farley's antics. Nothing is safe around his stomach, and there is no anger in Hell like his happy-going lucky attitude. The scene where he placed cars in the fire, and after the deer scene, a pure smile made for riots. Chris Farley and David Spad were the real John Baluchi and Dan Icraed. It's always a pleasure to think about "fat guy in a little quote" and again.
