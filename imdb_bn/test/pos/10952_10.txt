Twin Effects, played by H. K.'s most popular stars, occasionally comes out of HK in some enjoyable film experience. It's for everyone, there's something for action, comedy, horror, romance, and some plays. This picture can not be taken very seriously, otherwise you will go to the dissapointed, but if you leave your brain at the door and watch the movie for some fun, you can enjoy it. <br /> <br> Great special effects, excellent action, cute twin, cool hack actors, fan film! <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone!
