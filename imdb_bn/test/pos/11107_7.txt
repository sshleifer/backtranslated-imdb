When it comes to shameless and strange small crime films, those characters roam around and roam around the neighborhood, and thanks to some extraordinary films and some black comedy. Dead firms are just like the picture that Paul MacGuigan wanted to create. Well, all the shops, as well as all the shops, as well as the drug and the impostor Gangster No. 1, are interesting exercises in the supernatural titles mixed with reality, the only way to make the acid house is its only way we have to go now. The bodies of Robert Quinn are based on a Derek Landy script, a picture that crosses the line between psychological horror and neo-nir; Combine crime and terror elements with themes related to morality and irrelevant, emotional disorders. <br /> <br /> McGuigan's british-based crime attempts to see the terrible and distorted feelings of seeing someone's terrible witness and having front row seats in the process. His films are able to hate in some areas and make fun with their support among others and above all the expression. They carry a very dream-like sensitivity despite having a very realistic, down-trodden, grimy looking world ground ?? The emphasis on the horrors of the real world and its character is derived from something else due to terrorism of the situation. Dead Godse is a film that deals with both briefly summarizing a heroine character-driven situation as well as a subtle psychological mentality, only the film adjusts both its curvature; The terrorism and ethics questions will get better in the situation they face. <br /> <br /> The dead bodies are not effective and easy, which never seem like a manipulator. The people's advice and feelings are not deterred from just what her home-like hammer wants to experience in her advisory and intelligent trends. In the beginning, we are Tommy McGan (Scott), a young boy whom his girlfriend Jean (Davis) prefers over him, when he lives and screen for a little while. In reality, the condition of living in less residential accommodation; With stacking a job and stacking a partner he is not getting along with all the best, across a unique method. The audience has been granted an explicit permission to dislike genes, as it clearly holds up with a novel, humiliated and anticipated attitude. Later, the film is obviously in the face of a police officer, and it will increase the long-term outlook, which is easy and easy to tell viewers to which our hero is still in trouble. <br /> Compare it with gangster no1, in which episodic and misleading method applies to McGuigan elements; A characteristic, important plot point emerges when a character sets up another building in a 'random drive' and sets it in the drive in the previous month. Feeling not as grounded or full. Dead Bodies is set up by The Davis Gene; Just a sort of a femme fatale sort of picking a fight is not just tidy but really being able to find one. She has led Tommy Jumps through the ring; Going there, and doing this work, and without Tommy, she did not really react, mainly because she was controlled by her commitment to sex. The reaction of how Tommy is going on in the beginning increases the amount of tension and the initial event happens when it is released independently and the jinn dies. <br /> <br /> If setup is easy enough then this is one thing, but the project's pinch is that method that Tommy decides to release his gene from his death to know someone at the time of his death. The jinn was buried in Tomi, as well as the second corpse in the same place due to all the problems of suspects, denials and common problems. At this moment the film is spoiling the lines between the noir and the horror; In fact, Tommy lives in the upper part of the house rather than the big, the evil, the wicked and even the Gothic house which he shares with a big relative. This Hitakoof remembers the set of 1960s film "Siko and Betts" that is with his mother and where he is. It is no extraordinary event that this horrible place is the setting for the unfortunate death of the gene. <br /> <br /> To make it work, put a dead body in the hands of the stupid men. The primary event is a classic set-up for no silent; Ulmer's 1945 film is more recent than Detroit and more contemporary than the dead bodies, the 2006 film is titled Big Nothing. This image is released, it is a bend; Rather, the uncertain and consistent narrowness and a terrible story of the games of mind were clearly stated under a pallet of dissolving visuals. Above voice-over and fine lines, which, for the majority of films, is correct and misguided by pushing it into an area of ​​neo-nir; If we consider that the leadership is largely innocent and the charges of murder are wrong, it is one thing, but his view of the gene initially shows him in a grave manner and the cover of his death is the accusation of killing anti thesis. The dead body is taught; The clock without feeling the absorption ever provides a consistent tone for recreational and rather the physical and emotional content of the vessel.
