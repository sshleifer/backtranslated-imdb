If you're like me and you bought the new Tennesses D album the day you came out, and go to the movies to listen to all of the songs. Then you will definitely enjoy this movie. Yes I favor as a huge Tenacious De fan, but I really like this film which makes me a lot of chocolate. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty much I expected. Writing great songs from Ben Steiler and Tim Robbins and backing up some great comedic geniuses by the Kyos. I particularly enjoyed Tim Robbins' part. <br /> <br /> However, if you are not familiar with the Tennessius D'HB series and the superb greeting album, then it can not have the same comic effect on you. I will still recommend you to go and value the price of each cent since it is worth admission and you will have to smile even when you are not stitched full time.
