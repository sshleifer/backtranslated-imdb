I have read most of the opinions here, everyone saw the flaws of the movie. I agree, the director is not Copernic, the actors are not winning Oscars, but there may be some relation with it. I do not want to loot, but to say more about the plot - for school finishing and big party trips, or if you want to look beyond the metaphor, then choose the lazy life way. Remember the days of youth? Those days when you or our friends acted like a character? Or do you think you will act like one of them and you were not sorry now? If you can go back to that time and if you can ask yourself a question, then the movie was not so bad.
