Four holy youths from the country of Mormon go to LA to promote the urban thermal power gospels. However, a young Mormon is a repressive gay who "comes" to "out" the young Lata Party boy to cross the road. (What would the plot of the plot be without coincidences?). These two, very different, become young friends, and in this process, influence each other's perspective, which set an inevitable clash between revolting and Mormon culture. <br /> <br /> This is "Letter Day", a 2003 film, c. Written and directed by Jay Cox, who is himself a former Mormon missionary. The story of the film, of course, is extremely relevant, especially in contemporary America. It is necessary to say, revive and revoke the diversity of this story in the future of the future ... because the underlying theme, which highlights the light of the higher aspect, is seen by Christian fundamentalists often towards the sea. Through its nature, "Letter Day" is provocative, and I suspect that this movie is well received in Lucas or Pocatello, although the script is intelligent, sensitive and insightful.
