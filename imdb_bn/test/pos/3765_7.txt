It took me some time to find this movie because the DVD does not have it yet (and my VCR is not eligible for hooking again). I guess too much for some folks all references to using drugs. But I found a decent flogging in Ebay and I must say that anyone who takes this film very seriously is only annoyed. It is a slap stick spoof the vein of "airplane". I must say that in the 80's, when I saw it in the showtime or the spotlight, I have enjoyed a lot of humor now. But it is true that they (for example, filmmakers) "Just Say No" must be valuable to see what the hypocrites can go before their campaign. Singing ... "We are all drug addicts", "Ohahah", I've given eBay 10 dollars to get it into a silly film and DVD, and I'm not even thinking of comparing it with the original - it's just plain stupid. Are you high?
