Being a fan of Bill, I basically found it annoying that they made a movie about the bill and lost four superbowls. But once I started seeing, I was really connected. "Bill's" Superblyt was really nice to watch, and I must say that it was really good for a TV movie. As Gill Bello Quebec, and John Voet did a very fine job as the old school coach. 10 out 8
