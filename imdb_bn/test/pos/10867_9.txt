This movie gives Daniel Uk the opportunity to make a great action movie, but I really think Emil Char's character is really awesome, but determined for the absolute mistake. Plus the main terrorist, it makes me amazed about the revolution, that makes me wonder whether it is doing good or bad to me. <br /> <br /> A movie that tells us about Tod, a hungry terrorist until a secret he really knows. He chose the fate he had created from his terrorist family. <br /> <br /> I saw this year the best Purple Storm. The film is really standing when Steven Tung Wei status is filled with great action scenes of Statue Tung Wei, which won the best action sequence of the Hong Kong prize. (9/10)
