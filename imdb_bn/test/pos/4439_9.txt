Since 1974 my architect is a great film by the discovery of Nuthanial Kane, through the death of his famous father, Louis Kan, his architect. This picture is slowly, but completely created and the unfortunate identity crisis of which is lost. Love story, loss, family, and perhaps perhaps the life of our life is a beautiful story with deep stories. <br /> <br /> I have never heard of Luis Kan before this photo, although I was vaguely his work was familiar. With these words of Louis Kahn's colleagues (both good and bad), remembering memories and getting stories recovered, you get a very good idea about Nathaniel's feelings. Sometimes it seems like these people told Nathaniel about how to feel about his father. When I listened to each memorial, my opinion might be beautiful from horror, sometimes in a moment, so you feel good for rollercoaster that Nathaniel's passion moves around. <br /> <br> The final series in Bangladesh made the film completely for me. For the sake of Nathaniel, I found that Nathaniel had finally found what he was looking for.
