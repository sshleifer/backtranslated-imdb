I saw this movie after returning to Life in 2004. I have never seen it since, but often I thought about it. It was so impressive on me that I recently searched for it. I finally found it and it was made for television only. The movie is fabulous - filled with great writings and acting. William Petersen is perfect, as always. This movie left me in the stupid and tears. It's a wonderful story of faith, love, and compassion. Does anyone know how can I get a copy of this photo in my house? Is it possible with television movies ?? I really love to see it again. This one must be in my collection course !!
