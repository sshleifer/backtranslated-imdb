I grew up in Baltimore, so I was open to John Waters' movies, because I was very young to see them. And if you are confined to John Waters' knowledge of Hysspray or Cree-Baby or other family-friendly movies, you must prepare yourself for Pink Flaming's. <br /> <br /> Clear sexual activity, turmoil, an elderly woman does not eat anything except eggs, and silly work with chicken is one of the worst parts of this movie. The movie ends with 300 pounds of Divine, Waters. Cross-dressing Star eating habits dog breaks. The courtyard is about two families: a pair of intimate trailer trash, in which the Divine and Edith Messi eggs are in the form of eggs; And another rich, swing couple. Both families are challenged for the title of "animated soul." Enjoy the best of John Waters' film, but only if you have an open psychiatrist with strong stomachs, because some scenes from this movie will find you out.
