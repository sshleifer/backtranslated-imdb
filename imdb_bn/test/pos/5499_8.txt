The Line of Fire gives us a great game of cat and mouse. Clint Eastwood is hurt by John Malkovic in this writing film. Malkovich said he was going to kill the president, and he deliberately called Eastwood and imposed his buttons. He asked questions about the ability to protect anyone in Eastwood. Malkovich brings a cold, but very intelligent thinking for his character. He does everything, for he's a reason, and he's not shy about killing. To catch Melkovic, Eastwood had to solve the doubts of his superiors, but no one would listen to him. As a result, a movie fluttering in an entertaining view of a ballroom in Hollywood's Bonnaventor Hotel, which is a mystery with Crackles. Wolfgang Peterson raises the tension and we feel every turn.
