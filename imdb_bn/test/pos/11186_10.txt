"Monkey Island Curse" is a treasure. In my opinion, the series was entirely the holy guerrillas of adventure gaming, not to mention LucasAutoes. <br /> <br /> But to get back to the "curse", what is so good about CMI that it is not afraid to be yourself. It's deviated from the first two but still remains faithful to Ron Gilbert's production (if only the fourth schedule of the series can be said!). Voice action is ineligible, Dominic Armato plays our favorite hero Gaibres Threadwood. Animation is quite different than the classic pixelated character, it is done nicely. It's really pretty fantastic. And the music is fantastic! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, they have the rare ability to come off as fat instead of fat. That's a lot from the girl who regularly fell asleep during the chick flicks. <br /> <br /> Then of course, the humorous classic MI element. CMI Deadpie Line, Completely absurdist Humor, and providing quite good fun is quite impressive. Gary Coleman created a camio as an emerging young entrepreneur, and world events are intelligently seized without footprints outside of the sports boundaries. <br /> <br /> It is not entirely fair to compare CMI MI and MI2 because it is truly a state of its own. Personally, I can never look for any of the 3 favorite people because they are different from each other. However, if you want a swashbuckling good time with the flash in the classic series, I'll give you a shot in this game. You will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars, hands down <br /> <br /> - Emily N.
