This is one of my favorites. Betty White and Leslie Nilsson blurred in this romantic comedy. One business executive who re-evaluates life based on the expectation of his death within a year. Another player who is tired of young women digging gold and pursues relationships with a vital, mature woman. If you are getting romance in your hair and / or your heart, populated microwave, curl up with your honey, and prepare yourself for a treatment.
