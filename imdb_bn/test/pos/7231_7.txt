This unexpected troma movie is actually a very good movie. It is known as their epic and produced best and extremely rated. Their version of Shakespeare's play is extremely fun with the natural levels of Trauma Nudity and Gore. Troma has created some very good Gore films, one of my darling "Street Trash" and of course the toxic avenger movie. I have a tromba movie, "Terra Fermat", which earned fame as their gorist and nostest movie. I've enjoyed "Tromso and Juliet", so finally I'll see "Terror Fire". This is a 2-disc collector version that has four comments and many features. "Tromeo and Juliet" is an absolute hoot and highly recommended.
