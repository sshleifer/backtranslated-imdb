I played Sam (The Porter, Lourd Sidekick) in the movie "Dead Rail", which was later circulated as "Alien Express". And, I want to say that I enjoyed watching this movie in my part. As a struggling actor, I had the opportunity to work with fantastic people, it gave me a great view to include my relay, and this allows me to work in a dream job for a half month (no waiting table!) Turi (director) and Steve And Scott (producer) was very good by giving me the opportunity to participate in this event. I've made so many friends (Lou, Todd, Steven) and I've been able to work with this fortunate gifted man myself very fortunate. There was not a day that did not stop my butt. The actual tragedy is not so much a special effect, that this single person who saw this movie did not see what happened behind the scenes and in reality the genius that went in it. Manufacturers set up the set, prominent master, Gafar, dress, makeup artist, script supervisor, cinematographer, production assistant, extra, crafts service, producer, director and actor. This is a given subject which does not spend huge amount of money in Science Finance (2 million) but it has a lot of time, energy and power. I now see the movie which brings a lot of talented people to a fun project as a production that shoots without complications in less than two months. It was a fantastic throw and crew and I was so happy to be separated from it! One more note from those who do not know the Lou Diamond Philips, Todd Bridges and Steven Brand Excellent people who they are incredibly funny Lou I'm still working on my Deniro impression and "Thank you enough for introducing me to run midnight." Todd, everytime I hear an Elvis song I can not forget the story you told me about hanging with him in his house for dinner. "Can you please let me pass PA TAT?" (IM is a huge Elvis fan!) Steven, "Mr. Brand!" You are a real man and all the suggestions and encouragement you received from you will always be appreciated. I miss you guys and hope you are better. Thanks for the good memories, stories, jokes, and friendships. Oh and Miss Miss Hello! <br /> <br />
