This is usually not far from the trash that Bollywood produces but it really has some good about it. <br /> <br /> The title song is Bollywood's best and Sara Hunting. This is one of the movies (with Buzziar - Must watch Bollywood movies), which Shahrukh Khan has made, and for that you have to test it. <br /> <br /> Another review gives the story - this is a fairly basic concept - Shahrukh stands out clearly and finally one of his last expressions gives me this picture an extra star. <br /> <br /> It is quite fatty, but of course if you are new to Bollywood then it is of course valuable. No! 8/10
