"El Apartments" I've never seen in my best French movie (with hatreds, Vincent Castle's acting and that's the gorgeous Gerard Depardieu / Pierre Richard Movie). Cassel and Bellucci's leading roles are amazing. Along with "Brotherhood of the Walls" and "Durbman", I still have not seen a bad movie with this couple. "L'Appartement" sucks you from the start and keeps you twists and roars till you are thrilled. Fragment storytelling really did this good to "Pulp Fiction". Let's hope this unique romance / mystery-thriller will not be a godly American remix. (Edit: Guess! A godly American remix has been created!)!
