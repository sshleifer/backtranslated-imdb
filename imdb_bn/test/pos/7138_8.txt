I like this picture! Marquee Post It's really great. I've seen it throughout life, and it's like the same entertainment class: 'The Betty Broadrich Story', 'Locked Up: A Mother's Rage', etc. {That, anyway, very good, amusement movies!} It is on the top play, the only mother who is trying to stop her middle class, the expected personality. This movie is just pure entertainment! It does not have to be a realistic look of heroin addiction. But, it shows how any "regular" middle-class person (and they!) Might be addicted to heroin. Junky streets are not just homeless uneducated people. {However, if you see it, check out how the baby is about her mother bosses! Splal!} 8 out of 10.
