This is a bad, messy, predictable, durable, ample soap opera? There is so much guilty pleasure for me, "the best of all", "There is something in the Valley of the Doll". I mean, "best" has everything. Someone gets pregnant outside the marriage ceremony (you've never heard of that word?), Everything on top of things, drinks, cakes, jealousy, even a tragic but not completely unexpected death. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mike Rice Their chemistry is instant and it is a glue that prevents the movie from being broken. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> a role that I had never read about him, according to any biography, was apparently not a stretch . But Parker has done a surprisingly credible job here, unlike Louis Zardari, he holds himself in a few scenes, playing David Savage. Zardari probably took this role for money and special screen credits because he clearly came to the well-known star / street. <br /> <br /> Dian Baker is helpless, unclear April Morrison, Martha Heir as well. Barbara Lemont is especially a juvenile story, and the film's legend, Joan Crowford, Amanda Farro, another role, in his usual appearance, like Zardari Savage, other than the role that Joe Crowford probably took for a check mark. Date dialog and plot device (this IS1959), and soap opera genre forecasts. But if you like good soap, there will be more than satisfying you "the best of all".
