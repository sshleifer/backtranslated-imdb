Warning: Plot Speakers <br /> <br /> David Craneberg's most extraordinary films must have earned gaining taste. Supporters of the previous movie will probably like 'Exsthenz', but it is clearly not the same. All of the usual elements are here. A game made on the skin of the pood (bound on your back), a bucket of blood, a gun made from bone and a naming mechanic mechanic. The result is only strange, good in part, bad, and among others. But the film is a subject of unconscious originality. <br /> <br /> Despite excessive use ?? Curiosities prove it a point - virtual reality games can have dangerous effects on some people. In the movie, a character claims to a dead man that he was 'boring' (assuming he was still in the game). But it did not really happen or if it happens in an event like this stunning living, then leave the question. Exstenzed leads to a conclusion that can respond in different ways. <br /> <br /> Despite some extra gadgets and guts, it was simply a classic 'it was a dream ?? Or it was 'wrapping'. It's a smart wonder and answers a few questions, but at the moment it's a little disappointing to lead the whole film. It can be slightly more in just 97 minutes. In an extraordinary way the film raises moral issues but answers them in a violent and rather inappropriate way. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Jason Leigh plays her first major role in a while. But there are not enough attributes to stop the screen of his character or even give him a funny character. Jod law on the other hand (decorated with a strange American accent) is better as your average Joe sucks into this unusual world. We can see the film from his perspective. <br /> <br /> 'Exsthenes' is far from shameless, but it must be remembered for movie experience. David Lynch has tons of strange characteristics combined with the same styles (next? - being eaten by a question mark?!?!?!). It is definitely not for all the taste but it offers considerable rewards. My IMDb rating: 6.2 / 10
