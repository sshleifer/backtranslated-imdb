Crack House (1989) is one of the few movies in the mid-80s that falls in this category. It is believed to be a anti-drug film, it is not much more than some white exploitation exercises of misuse. But with that there is nothing wrong. Video Presentation From A Star Of Richard "Turnkot" Roundtree There is even a drug-related message <br /> <br /> This film follows two young lovers in high school. One of them is a crisp solid guy and the other is his daughter. One of them is turned into a mutual friend, the other is given a tour of Slam and later given the opportunity to return to his former friends. Jim Brown appeared in the movie "Mr. Big", he is a bad father who can still punk-out someone and a very sad person who likes to drag his hog and try to deny his words. Luke also hosts a guest star spot from General Hospital. <br /> <br /> If you like a solid edge style, this movie is for you. Sadly, Hollywood does not make it even more, and when they do this it is not exploitative or recreational. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Slate fans.
