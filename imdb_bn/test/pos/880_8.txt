Golf Thief * Bollywood Criminal Thriller, and why not? It is managed by the biggest announcer of the crime thriller industry of Indian film Vijay Anand ('Johnny Mere Naam' and 'Tessari Manzil'). I can see this movie for the following reason (seriously): <br /> 1 Victory of happiness, 2D D. Barman Music 3 Dev Anand 4 Vayantamilla 5 Ashok Kumar 6 Songs of Majrooh Sultanpuri <br /> <br /> Even if the zodiac key is not a bond movie, definitely bonded babes. Helen, Tanuza, and mysterious Vyajanthimala (and some adolescents.) But something other than our sauv√© bindi (bond of love). He is out of control for most of the story and we will take him away whenever the story is often confused. He is trying to hit his romantic nerves, even with anus (Tanuza), so that he can get a job in his father's shop. <br /> <br /> Dev Dev can play twice as much - I do not want to increase your movie or else I would tell you otherwise. Most of that mystery is about. Dev Anand works in a jewelry shop and when he seems to be working, there is robbery - though there is at least one perfect ALBB. We wonder who we are, whether Anand is identified as 'victory' or 'immortal', which we have not seen yet, but many have claimed that his appearance is the same. 'Shalu' (Bhayantanta) comes, who claims that he will give his mother tongue, in a difficult circumstance, to prove that he is not humble and not immortal. If Dev Anand is manly or immortal, then everyone asks to remove his surprise. We are told that he has 6 digits in his foot. When we are going to reveal the joy, we also get a joke while spellbinding. <br /> <br /> There are many films in the real life of Bijoy Anand and actor Dev Anand, among which the film is not the best, but certainly the Crimson Thriller is the best. <br /> <br /> The moment of Hitachi's North by West West, but the movies are very different. Who does not have many similarities except for the treacherous female lead and the confusion about many trips. Apart from victory, Dev Anand can be very good. People have seen him, they identify him where he is. There are many people for this fraud. At last, Humani feels that it is good to find out how to find the truth after being immortal, and it is a sad mistake. She gets very deep, can only be saved by movie twists. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie as a little child, I was definitely not impressive, until finally I was completely confused. Even so far there are some parts that I do not like, but I would recommend this movie as well. <br /> <br /> I even enjoyed this movie offer as a child. 'Yeh Dil ...' - Kishore Kumar's song is a special song of Rufa. I could hear 'Rule gay' all day! Dito for 'Assan Ki Nike', which is set under the 'sky below' of Gangtok (at least the line of the story indicates it). 'Akki Hey at night' Tanuja is seen as an actress among the most popular songs of the Hindu film. 'Merry up look' - Helen's cabinet and we look at her. 'Hathan P ...' - Now, there may be a thriller of better songs than this. Like the song progress, we are more exciting than ever before and have added secret words to the saloon lips.
