It is not surprising that high-level voting was submitted by women 45+ years old. These are the timing of living in women's life when they become elderly and sick parent's caretaker. I lost my mother due to cancer complications in June, and most of the same emotions portrayed by Jeljord in this movie went through. Yes, it made me cry, but the tears were real, the letters were real and the development of the plot was extremely accurate. Congratulations to the whole cast and crew for a great painting of life and death, and promises of tomorrow.
