It's a shame that this movie has been rated PG13 - it's really good for anyone - even though young children can not follow it very well. <br /> <br /> This is a serious-comic ghost / angel story that will cover everything from Winners of "Wings of Desire" from Cappers "It's a Wonderful Life". <br /> <br /> <br /> Photography is stunning, the first rate of acting, and the surprisingly surprising sound. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that there is not much ambiguity in the film. The two interwoven stories seem to be the first playful mysterious; But they solve a little nicely for my taste. As the director of his commentator in the DVD, all the elements of the story of the erune are in his bedside table. Symbolism is just a very pattern for me. <br /> <br /> But what the hell! My favorite scene will be when the transfer team tries to get a dinner in the diner. It really is a tour of the theatrical - malicious acting of his magic D ball - fine, playful and positive lithic - a strong eye for diverse and diverse mix of paintings. <br /> <br /> "NorthFork" is fun, touch, beautiful appearance, magician (with reservation above) and single car-charging. <br /> <br /> A simple nine star.
