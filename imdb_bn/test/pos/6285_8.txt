When I first saw that this movie was playing on TV, I was just new as a comedy joke who was wearing a weird dress today. I still decided to visit it and I was impressed. On the shore brings a new breath of air. In this film, he crawls a college adviser and probably needs his own adviser. A mid-west "farm girl" with Karla Gugino, an intrinsic role, an easy family and a movie-clich boyfriend Travis, drama plays. When she cast head to Eucla, she met the crawl and she quickly turned her into a bubble, blonde California girl. She decides to bring home crawl for Thanksgiving breaks thanks. Travis decides to propose a proposal, beef requires a distraction. Crawl then everyone believes that he and Becka have already been appointed. As a result, unemployed parents have found dancers to make a friendly relationship with their brother even a local dancer. I'm not going to reveal the end, but I liked it. However, if you want a deadly performance, do not rent it; If you want to laugh at your butt and enjoy an often-missed section of the humor of 90s, rent it.
