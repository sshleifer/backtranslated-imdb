There is no doubt that Indy Flick, Eddie Monroe is one of the better independent films I've seen for a long time. The highlight for me was Paul Vario's performance. I first saw Paul, or he was called Danny Provenzano's Hit Indie, "This Thing Off Off" as a "Big Palle". Thankfully, the "Eddie Monroe" filmmaker did the same thing and played Paul's policy expertise (main?). Outside is a performance (as well as use of camera and voice over) which looks very good in the role of big budget studio in the future. Refreshing to see a trained actor who is committed for business, the same proof to the audience Keep up big strips of good work and we will meet you real soon! Cancer is not bad for kids, is not it?
