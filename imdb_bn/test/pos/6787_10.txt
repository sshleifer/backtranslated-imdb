How nice! What a beautiful, warm, rural film! This story is met by Muy Taylor (Mikey Rooney), who keeps a watch on a young man whose journey takes him to a quiet, rural coastal town. There he is with the Brown family. Velvet (Lease Taylor) is their eldest daughter, who is sweetly friendly, has a passion for horses and auctioned on an auction. This horse is a beautiful, maroon stallion; It is referred to by a former owner as a 'murderous pirate', but Velvet retorts him again. After a long time, Velvet proposed to enter the Grand National Racer, MI and his family against the idea, but soon agreed, and Velvet and MI started training him in Britain's most famous horse competition? Is this picture a beautiful example like British films? I think when I was eight years old and saw my first on the summer holidays. My dad tapped it off tv and i woke up early ?? Most of these days, instead of large collections of Disney movies, <br /> <br /> I believe it was Leisure Taylor's first movie and a good one! Its character na√Øve but sweet ?? His acting is extremely believable, especially when he portrays his love for the horse. It's a great opportunity to show Angela Lansbury in her first role; Who is the big sister of Velvet, co-star, who spent most of her time killing the boy in town! She was a fantastic lady when I was small. Beautiful blonde hair and a pink cheeked face. Though the main part of this movie is not her, she has a number of scenes - so do not let her fans down! This is the father's reading, should I emphasize ?? Please if you can keep a copy of this! Are you children love animals ?? I firmly recommend you show them it! They may find some annoying scenes, but you can watch the horse roaming around the whole movie on many occasions and entertain the most brutal children! A lovely and nostalgic film. I could go away now and make it!
