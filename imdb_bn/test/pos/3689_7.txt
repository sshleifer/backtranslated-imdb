The "dishonest love" begins with great promise. P. J. Under the direction of Hogan, until the last third of the film, the film works seemingly, when it is flat on its face. Screen game m Hogan and Josephine Muraugh wrote that at the end, there were numerous possibilities for the possibility of quarrels. It seems that the artistic team hopes to play differently behind the film. The reality is that it is a film that has to be solved in different ways to solve its problems. Do not make me wrong, the film becomes quite attractive and it will be revived with a lot of public. <br /> <br /> Based on strong cast, we decided to take a look. Catherine Betes, a great genius to play in Greece Basel, found at the beginning of the film that the woman is not good at her marriage. Mrs. Bates is an extraordinary actress who has earned a lot of her ability, even if her character does not play any role in the film. <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett is always reliable. Victor Fox's Lover is well written as a writer, until he is trying to come to Chicago to find Dick Victor's murderer. It's bizarre and it defies all the rules of reasoning. Dirk is not able to hurt a flying blow, let's make a killer victim with the help of Grace and his daughter, incredible fun, Maudey. <br /> <br /> As one played by Mary Eithon, this little lady, Maudi, is one of the best things in the film. She brash and say it as she sees it. There is nothing to do with the best actor Peter Sarsagard in this movie. She is completely destroyed. Dan Aykroyd also has nothing to do. We see him at the beginning and at the end of the movie and he does not understand the Mac. He wants to change his life and his marriage, except for any explanation, to come back to Grace, all things are forgiven. <br /> <br /> English actors are good. Lindard Redgavite has got a better chance of violent vulture. Jonathan Price is seen as a ghost song singing around the world. Julie Andrews makes a fun contribution to a couple of priceless scenes. <br /> <br /> Finally, the television program run by Sally Jessie Rafael was closed and did not add anything to the movie. The best part is being sung by Kothi Bates. She has a beautiful voice! Actually, Mrs Bates's best excuse to stay in the end.
