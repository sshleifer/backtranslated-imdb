Talent or nasty crazy? That depends on your interpretation of this film. I responded to this on a self-aware "cop-movie parody" level, and I sincerely hope that its intention was because I do not take it seriously! : - Paul Rudd screams visible for one and really seems to get into the soul of things! Does this picture tell about the continuation of the comedy to exit Rudd from its original background? For a little insane effort, will he review it as a strict action star? I do not think <br /> <br /> With silent, almost painful acting, low budget FX, and zany over-the-top action set pieces, it released all kinds of old TV shows "Sled Hammer" for me! extremely happy!!! :-) <br /> <br /> Of course, I've completely misunderstood the film. This was actually an attempt to 'direct' action movie, but it was definitely a ridiculous failure !! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ;-)
