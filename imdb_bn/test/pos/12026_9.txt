On the TV I saw that it is the most enjoyable one. He's just an incredible actor. His personality expresses through every of his songs. I was really available as an unauthorized DVD so I could see it over over without -beeps for obvious words. I did not have the chance to see him alive, but that's something I'd really like to do now. I do not forget his backup singer. They really add a lot of substances and humor from the show. With their camp style, and moving flamboyant dance, they really give the perfect complement to the true talent. I wanted to have her live CD, which has some incredible songs. It is refreshing to see someone like him. Just so incredibly person and real, I really could not say enough good things about Dan and this show. Again, I was just available as an uncut DVD.
