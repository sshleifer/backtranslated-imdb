please forgive!!! HellOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!! Cuba GOODING, Jr. This film will win Oscar for his photo !!! She was in the film! Although the film may be in need in some cases, Cuba was extraordinary ... and for me, the best role that he has ever played for. The movie scene where he found out that his mother died, he broke me and cried in the theater !! I guess I can really relate to this movie because I saw the same behavior of people who grew up in my own school ... no tragedy! Seeing "real" radio and coaches at the end of the film was really very special! If you can see this movie and do not move to tears then you need to check your heart! If you like "Simon Birch" and "The Mighty", then you will also like "Radio"! I want them to make more movies ... radio is real deal!
