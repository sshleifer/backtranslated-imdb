I read Angels and Demons about 3 years ago, and I can honestly say that some books I could not read. <br /> <br /> Although the movie was much more than I expected, with a mystery story somewhat, a lot of action. Tom Hendes plays a key role in Professor Langdon's role than The Winchie Code. <br /> <br /> You will not be considered as bad as this Da Vinci Code. It was not everything that was. More interesting, less action, more mystery, and less unneeded debate. If you do not read the book, any concerns you still find it very interesting. And if you read the book, you might well be surprised that you might be a little surprised because I have found so many absences that I was waiting for. <br /> <br /> Overall, very impressive films for a movie girl. But, Dan Brown is not something very special for fans.
