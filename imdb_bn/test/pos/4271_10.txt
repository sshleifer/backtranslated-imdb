I saw this film in a small screening. While it was a low budget, cast directional direction and intelligence helped to make it a little jewel in a movie. Each character of April 8, 1994 follows their "mid 20s" and follows an artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) when they know about the creation of singer Cart Cobain's suicide. They quickly travel to San Francisco to Seattle and get inspiration to be present in Cobain Vigil. This is where the movie really uploads and provides a series of fun and emotional scenes. Highlights include: Jimmy visits Hendrix's grave, sits with Cart Cobain's original childhood room and Campfire. An original piece is a key piece.
