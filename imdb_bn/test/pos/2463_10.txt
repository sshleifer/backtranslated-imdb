One of my wishes is to be a filmmaker, and I just want to say that I will not be able to compete with the main battle of the drama war in any way. Because the acting is perfect, and when you see the movie you know what I mean. I can recommend that it is watching, I was involved in it and was very impressive. <br /> <br /> <br /> The screen was absolutely amazing on the screen of Istavez and Shane. <br /> <br /> The relationship with her mother (Kathy Bates). Some of the best scenes are included. <br /> <br /> As well as the relationship between Shane and his daughter, Estevez's sister <br /> <br /> 10/10, and of course my top 10. I want the DVD!
