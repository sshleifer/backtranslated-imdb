I just want to see the national velvet on the TV, it is now February 2006 and I have been checking the details of the date. It was astonishing to see it in 1944 and Rooney was 24 years old, but Leicher Taylor was only 12, which was a successful English actress. <br /> <br /> To give rights to some American contributors: There is no Irish village in England. Ireland is a completely different country and there is nothing to do with the English countryside. The scenes shown are found on the south coast of England between Brighton and Arundel (Sussex County). Unfortunately this type of view does not exist. Roads and buildings have been built in many other areas like hills and beaches. <br /> <br /> So, please, do not confuse Ireland with all your lovely Americans, England! We take great exceptions to it. Like the confusing Texas with the island of Connie.
