Christine Lahti (Sandy Danlap) and Mary Tyler Moore (Holly Davis) did good work with soap ingredients, Ted Danson did his best to play on Chip Davis's extraordinary role. In these two scenes, two female friends, an apparently happy married woman and another carrier woman who is aware of her biological clock ticking. I found the relationship that the character of Ted Danson was the single female actress instead of Christine Lahoti. He behaved in a caddish way, yet he left the two "widows", pining over him. When I told the rebel, he would tell her that she wanted to break her after meeting her wife, then she told him that she missed him (she called his wife, there was no sign of her). She behaved like an heel. It's probably a more interesting film she will not be killed. Probably both women wised up and dumped him. I like friendships between the two women but it gets spoiled by what was common: husband's cad.
