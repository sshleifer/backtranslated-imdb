This is an example that the film lecturers at Film School will call a good debut movie. It follows all the rules. Small scenes, at points, cheap to shoot, guerrilla-film-making, a set (only abusive buildings) and probably an empty wing of the hospital. Even the black and white film-stock was genius stroke, perhaps more than the film's impact, rather than its low cost, but it did work. <br /> <br /> Reno was as amazing as Brute.

E-Themes - At first glance, it appears to be a man in the post-apocalyptic armor in a swing, but in the second visit an office A man with a line in the chair with a lined, self-confident commitment on his feet. It never happens in the movie. <br /> <br /> This black-white photo stock, zero-dialogue, physical acting, tight scenes and bright actors make this movie a valuable place to add to your personal movie collection. A superb movie.
