Palwol ui christmas is very Korean, if you have been in Korea or have a Korean friend, you should know what I mean. Koreans are very traditional people, they look very nicely. Feelings of a kind you do not find today's world I think this film is so special why. It is wrong to compare Yehian's "Love Letter" to this movie, Japanese is very good but it can never be made like the Palwal ui Christmas. If you have a chance then see this movie for yourself.
