OK so I love even Aidan Quinn's acting with a bad script. This is not the case of assignment. Other viewers said it was a movie that I just imposed on cable and in this I did not want to finish it. Take a Cuban American Navy (Quinn) who is an upright, high-ranking soldier and family member. Add an insane agent (Donald Sutherland) who is looking to the world's most notorious terrorists and add a Ben Kingsley and have your "Assignment". Sutherland witnessed the activities of the most notorious terrorist Carlos in a caf√© on a lovely day, where he kept this man so deep that he could breathe this person to stay alive for the only reason. <br /> <br /> Hold a soldier near a Israeli who is a dead ringer for this man and kept him beaten and kept by Kingsley until they realize he has a plan. Whenever he accepts Carlos, or is forever liable to help his world get rid of it, it creates a very heavy recruitment and crime trop Without helping his country, he is bound to choose a man and his military duties intelligently. So the training starts. Let's say Carlos is well with the training arts and the Academy of Holocaust. When I say this intense and amazing story, scripted and executed movie rate is best, I do not mean it. Three actors could save almost any script ... See credits from one of the frames together it's a movie. I'm not in terrorism or cinema, but I am fascinated! Bravo again plays Eden Quinn, who once played a heavy game that can hold an actor including Gary Oldman. A complimentary th ats Get it rent and lots of popcorn. Oh, did I mention sex? This is the "last tango!" And it works better than its educational.
