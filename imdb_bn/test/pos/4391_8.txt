I've seen this many years ago when I was sitting on the sofa and stuck to it at HBO. From the distance of my reach I decided to go with him and was waiting for a sad movie which I was avoiding for a year. So it was closed and I was not very optimistic about it, but after about ten minutes I saw myself smiling. I was expecting to be completely opposite. The comedy was smart, the performance was great, the cast worked very well together, and the story (though a little painful and fake) was actually pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Three responsible brothers are forced to flee from their sentences, and eventually they go in search of their fate. The movie is set in 1930s. Meanwhile, they encounter a number of quite interesting and attractive charatcers. All are struggling for them to have a different story or achievement. May really feel that the movie is mostly random. Some might say that it was useless and annoying, but if you search for smart comedy (and sometimes stupid) in the movie, I'm sure you enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I liked the performance of George Clooney, John Tarturo and Team Blake Nelson. All of them did their work very well, they worked great together. But to finish this, "O my brother, where are you?" A smart, funny, and a movie adventure that I will not pass.
