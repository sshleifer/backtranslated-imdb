After World War II, almost Soviet movies are killed. In the early 1950s, the film production was completely closed (only nine features in 1951 were released), and all the filmmakers' work was closely monitored and often censored by the government. After the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, filmmakers were given more artistic freedom with their pictures, although many were reluctant to challenge the brave, optimistic and promotional attitude of the war in the previous years. Until 1957, director Mikhail Kalatozov and writer Victor Rojov became one of the best screenplays of the battles, 'Staten Soviet Masterpiece', 'Latit Jurvali / The Cranes Flying', which is widely considered to be quite bold enough to produce. It is seen from a country or period. The film was not appreciated for its artistic brilliance in the Soviet Union, but international recognition was followed shortly, and Kalatozov's film was honored by Pam D'Or at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> The Cranes Flying 'is an impressive visual banquet and a tragic, both humanized illustration of the war. Contrary to many Soviet war-themed movies of the time, it was less limited by the original feature of the traditional war hero, and was more concerned with neutrality, cruelty and, in fact, the inevitability of the conflict. Love, as a cinematic concept, is often ideally modeled as an idea that, by any means, conquers all and suffers endless suffering and yet reality is less romantic. In this movie, two lovers, Veronica (Tetiana samozlova) and Boris (Alessi Bottlov), promised to marry after WWII (known widely as patriotic war in the Soviet Union, 1941-1945). , But the tragedy couple refused their wishes. In order to betray the uncertainty of uncertainty and uncertainty, Berice's cousin Mark (Alexander Chevron) agrees to welcome a handsome but ineligible young man. This image can be proud of the Soviet pride and the patriotic flag-weaving parade, but the optimism of this sequence has been widely accepted by the rebel tragedies of our young female heroes, who are frightened by the crowd of celebrations. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of 'The Cranes Flying Flying' is Sergei Uroussky's inspired and dynamic hand-directed painting, which actually holds the chaos and confusion of intriguing warfare, miraculously firing gunfight and tears of death of comrades. , Only one of the sequences of film joining Boris on the front front}, but the family From the point of view of his recede. In a particularly impressive, detailed tall shot, the camera follows Veronica as she searches for Barisal and her family march for the crowd. The hand-held camera easily follows the girl from a bus, quarrels through the crowd beside her - Veronica's disappearance in a passing squadron dust before chasing on the crowd unexpectedly - by stopping the passing snippets of loved ones, their boys and spouses leave. Army tanks, an exciting movement that offers dramatic period opportunities and emergency opportunities. Urusksky had his first filming experience as a military cameraman during the war and fell in love with the possibility of a hand-held photograph of the hand: "Camera," he once announced, "can not express the actor's ability to represent: his inner sensitivity. Must have to act with. "
