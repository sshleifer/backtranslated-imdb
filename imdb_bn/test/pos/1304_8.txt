I found the full 3 DVD set for $ 5.50, in Bargin Bint Wal-Mart, so I thought I'd take another look. See all 13 hours (26 episodes) in it. I was born in 1948 and mostly seen on Cultural TV. Many independent stations have repeated them for many years. <br /> <br /> Really better than my expectation, time was kind to the clear sincerity of its creators, and they showed due gratitude and respect to all fellow fighters and women. The reasons for the WDII and the final results are more abstract and straightforward than the direct documentary. This war was heavily dependent on the sea and the final victory was dependent on achieving the ultimate efficiency of the ocean of the Earth. Allies were able to do it. <br /> <br /> Interesting, they see big events, and try to hit a balance between individual soldiers and sailors who happen to them. The score is impressive, if a little higher by today's value. I read somewhere that Robert Russell Bennet donated as much Richard Rodgers as the final score. I imagine Rogers has supplied all the major themes, and it was meant to fit in pictures until Bennet. Great work! <br /> <br /> Every ruler, or should be seen by a possible ruler. A warning to the abusers that the war criminals have won by the ideal, determination, and supplies to support them till the end. Supply: The final winners of their quality and delivery will be set. Alice produced and exceeded the material quality of the Accepts, attacked their source very much and guaranteed their last defeat. <br /> <br /> Sorry, producer Henry Salman has lived a very short life. The incident of IMDB was rather skimp, I would have to know more about him. Before his first death, he did some extraordinary documentary films. There may be more things later ... TVA: All 3 LP records of background music were fairly good Unfortunately, the producers decided to add sound effects to the end in order to immediately act immediately in the status of innovation instead of listening to serious music. Very bad, because it contains some interesting but more subtle themes in the series. Wrong stuff like 16 inch guns, torpedoes are being shot, bulldozer, planes ... just for kids. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
