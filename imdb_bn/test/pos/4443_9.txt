Future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to this elementary film Giallo sub-genre. Set up in rural Italy, there is a serial killer in the big. Gullo movie fans add an array of known familiar characters ?? A madman, newspaper reporter, ineffective police, a sexy Syrian, a priest, a silent girl, mentally retarded loner etc. It was one of the first Italian thrillers of the 70's. <br /> <br /> For a giallo, in this case the victim makes a change from young boys, which is more common in the corners of danger. It only makes the kids who target kids only a little more uncomfortable. A sexy young girl (Barbara Bouchet) of a young boy, where Fulci is pushing a lift here and goes further in a glorious humiliating UnPC view, is working with a somewhat inappropriate attention that she gives a drink. He exhibits himself openly and actively invites young people to call them; Finally, I asked him if he wanted to go to bed with him. Although he definitely wanders around it, it is still quite unusual scenes. Of course there are strange or funny bits of one or two conversations, but it is very nicely photographed and Barbara BUET exceeds the high level of self-confident sexual appeal. A standout view. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Has been left to set up. However, he was hunting by a lynch crowd and chains-whipped when a car radio rock explosion music. This scene is very powerful and unpleasant. Fulti's career might indicate her misdeeds afterwards. <br /> <br /> Despite the literal impact of the above killings it is surprising that other killings are bloody or off-screened. The only death scene compared to the death of the killer at the end of the movie, though this sequence is stupid. The plot gradually fluttered inside the red deer, although personally, I identified the identity of the killer as a little overwhelming. Although these vulnerabilities are less problematic on the subsequent viewing ?? Like most Galiyas, do not torture a ducking reappears again. <br /> <br /> Technically, is the film made exclusively with camera-work, strong acting and effective music from Ridge Adrilani ?? Especially well it sounds like a repetitive incomplete female vocal that's coming from a remote mountain. Phulchi went on to create a more graphical violent movie but here she shows a talent for a slightly more restricted object. It is still wild stuff though and highly recommended for giallo movie fans.
