After watching undisputed 2, I knew what Isaac had to expect from Florentine. <br /> <br /> Shepherd: Border Patrol is a decent florist (Van Damme's best, but certainly his bad.) Cast some supporting cast of VD, but it does not make sense. <br /> <br /> The story and the plot have all been done before, so it is nothing new. I mean this Van Damme. What do we really hope for is an amazing plot? So talk about how we want to watch this movie: fight. <br /> <br /> Without anything else, I thought that the images of the war were shot and shot well. VD's recent films such as Second in Command, in which the entire war was violent. With the camera behind Florentine, and if you have seen the Undecided 2, then learn how to photograph the photograph and enjoy it. Shepherd's fights remind me of VD's old stuff, which we all want to see. The war was good, and I said "haha, awesome" loudly a few times. But I thought a little more that I did not think there was 2 undisputed. <br /> <br /> Videa's daughter was somewhat interesting, in the picture, I thought, "Oh, she's too hot" came to find, her Bianca van Varenberg, daughter of Jessie's real life. I had never seen it before that it was a beautiful treatment. <br /> <br /> All, this movie is not half bad. Yes before the story was made but at least JC is trying to make a good movie. Next time, add more hands to your hands! I think he's still done for the big budget movie ... his performance has improved since the work of DTV and he really is big at the age of 47. I do not know about you, but I am one of those who think most of the DTV is really exceptionally different than Daryll. What he needs to do is go back to the "Blood Donation" shape, and create a martial arts movie ... and I think people will react well if they are not. This movie is definitely worth the rent. =)
