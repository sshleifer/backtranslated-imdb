The people are often uncomfortable with "Venice's businessman" because of its often subjective subject matter. Thankfully, this film can be avoided, instead of showing how anti-communism in the 16th century Europe was the highest regime. The story must, of course, require Antonio (Jeremy Irons) money so that he can help Portier (Lin Collins) hand in marriage to Basiano (Joseph Phoenix). He is getting the money from Shurek (Al Pasino) of the Jewish Eurere, who claims a pound of interbreed meat if he does not return the next loan. When Antoine can not repay the loan, Shylock is determined to repay his loan. <br /> <br /> We hope this cast will do a good job and they will not be disappointed. Another condominium that is still a great actor Al Pacino
