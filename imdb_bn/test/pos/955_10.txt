I'm a cheerful fan. I did not see any other movie that is such a good one. <br /> <br /> This is a regular clich√© which you can expect from a commercial entertainer. A hero who is poor in studies, but his dance is a star in Kabaddi. To fill the comedy quota with his friend. A heroine of a life and death situation. A villain, which I say firstly portrayed by the playwright. High Octane Chase and action sequence. Music that can make a dance. And above all that is a perfect storyline to keep cause above all in an enjoyable circle. Perfect. <br /> <br /> The director does not allow the audience to leave. He just went from one nail to the next to the head. And in this movie, the winner can see the lighter side that he rarely performs. <br /> <br /> Everyone said that this movie will be perfect for many years ....
