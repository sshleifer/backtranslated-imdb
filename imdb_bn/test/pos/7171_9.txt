This movie is only shown on Channel Seven - Australian TV - today <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it was a very interesting role in how the Nazis behaved indiscriminately elsewhere in Russian Jews. <br /> <Kelly Martin did a great job indeed, and tears and frustration as her "tears" were quite strong. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Holocaust is a part of our history that we do not have to forget. The list of Schindlers was not the first - and it will not last - in the last five years of survival and courage accounts in nightmares. My family is Dutch and I will always admire a filmmaker who helps the brave people to stand up, break up, and help "kill a Jew" to kill.
