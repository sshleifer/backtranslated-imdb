Slashar sub-rhine is very tired - in fact until 1979, even after one year after 'Hello hello', Halloween (which was released seven years after Blood Bay) was released; The sub-section was not far from tired; But Tourism Trap represents one of the more original outings. The film follows the same basic formula, as most slashers - ie crazy kids kill a burden, but its originality is shown from that madness actually (opposing a man in an invisible assailant or a mask) and we actually get some insight into his character. This killer has teleconnectic power, in which the originality has been added because of the ability to control wax dummies in his house. We jump with a great opening sequence, which looks foul when a young man finds himself in a gas station in a plane tire having a flat tire. The scene is astonishingly unclear, as Womb Dummy mocks him and things look - and it gives a great insight into what the audience should come to; For example, a very horrible horror movie! <br /> <br /> Acting credibility does not exist as you expect from seventy slash, but be honest; It's not all bad. Girls look hot, boys do not really matter; And the role of Chowk Connors psychology is quite curious ones. She is not just Anthony Parkins; But still, good enough. It's not the star of the show, but as you might expect - the strange atmosphere accepts that award. Proven wax models like the House of Max (Vincent Price Version ...) are very dangerous; And the film makes use of that true best. There are only a few things in the movie that can be scary only - but wax statue must be one of those things. The killer's special power can be easily achieved on the way to the atmosphere, but the film uses the best of it, even the things fly out of the roof and it is better with the rest of the film. Overall, it is a very good film. Tourism trappes may not be absolutely essential; It's a good price to see and I can recommend it.
