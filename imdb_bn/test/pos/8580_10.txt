* Warning! Some spoilers! * <br /> <br /> Matt, a rich writer, is actually still a boy in his behavior. He does not take care of himself but needs his own needs and does not care less about the outcome of his work. Just as Nimi and her ties became familiar with her family and her community, she began to think that something is missing in her life. <br /> <br /> She realized that she was stuck alone and unknowingly. The structure is not only convenient but the lack of heart and commitment. Yet he shies away from any responsibility and reluctant to change his life. But he will be able to re-sit in his old life and ignore the bonds he has already kept - <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He was pressed for the rules of his Nigerian community, his ancestors and medieval values. Due to being a single mother, her position is difficult and it becomes worse even after falling in love with Matt, a white devil (say referrals), a man who can make a commitment. Women in the community planned to marry Refernd to finish their single status and give Sammy "a name". But all of Nimi will have to give up independence and self-reliance. But what is the alternative for him if he wants to accept Sammy and he wants to be a respected member of the society? <br /> <br /> This movie is all about: a very beautiful and scenic love story (a scene of very sexy Matt and Nimi) and a well-loved child in love, who is made in vividly animated colors. <br /> <br /> Colin Firth (* Swine *) and Nie Long show a great chemistry. It's gorgeous to see them And Famy Roberts is just dead as Sammy. You just want to accept him. I like to talk to Sammy and Matthew talking to each other. They are both in the same level in many ways. Especially when Sami asks Matt about sex. This scene is absolutely adorable !! <br /> <br /> Nothing to complain about ... wait! That's not true. One thing is not good: the movie is not long enough! (Well, and probably that refraction is very bad and too stupid to be stupid ....) <br /> <br /> 10 10, all the ways!
