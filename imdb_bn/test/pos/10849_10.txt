When I rented this movie, I used to think half a budget, indie film plots less, but I thought I would try it. I started to see Part 1 and could not pull myself up until the end of the 3 hours. It was always one of my absolute favorite films away. By the direction of writing, I laughed, I was crying and undoubtedly, singing all the songs from the silence of the adult way through the Austly style. Rachel Sterling is awesome in this film. I have never heard of him before, but now I will remember the weakness and strength that I have experienced in his work. She, Kili Haas, and Jodi May are incredible, because they manage you through emotional difficulties that they think they treat most with sex alternatives. In the 1890s, the film was determined, in that time, it does not educate the audience about homosexuality, but today we give a statement about our society. You must see this movie and perhaps like me, you will make a trip to the shop to add it to your collection.
