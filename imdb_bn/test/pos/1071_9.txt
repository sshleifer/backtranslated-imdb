First, I liked the documentary. It represents a new school history / theory where one issue can reflect a broad range of social and historical issues. <br /> <br /> I will first bring the camera and the dog out. I hate camera blair wich quality, but realize the advantage of such a casual approach. Actually, I agree with other critics that it gives us unprecedented access. <br /> <br /> Dog: Alert: There is a doctorate degree in my literature that I do not use as a profession, so some of my training may be in. Be careful: people have great effort and their achievement to find labor. We need a complex relationship for dogs. Beautiful metaphor Dogs may reflect their owner, offer as a critic. But they work in films that they work as stand-in for the workers. Although it may indicate a Marxist problem raised by a critic, I think how difficult it is to make labor problems worldwide. Italy can not translate a Mundovie elsewhere. (Yes, I hate to hear a Marxist and intimate resignation!) This is an extraordinary bat and switch. Dog family, labor family But, to the end, dogs are workers (last scene with poor peasants). If you agree with politics, the similitude of the industry, combined with the politics of the film, is surprising. <br /> <br /> If only Faulkner (I was from Alabama), the next image of it was the Hollywood market, what interesting stories were said.
