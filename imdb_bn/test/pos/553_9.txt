The interaction between Portman and Sarandan was quite interesting, and I really sold the mother-daughter relationship. This is a family story that is not spoiled by freelance and special effects; It's really a story about how I can not express my heartfelt condolences at the end of this movie because it is a story about a grown up story and a good story related to family and friends. The acting was quite bright and we hope we will see both the Portman and the Sarundan known in the road crash ...
