The best contacts for themselves because of some hazardous reasons are that these IMDB boards are reluctant to credit Billy Wilder at least two (this one and nineteen) as a cryptolator when one can detect the hand of the wilder to work on the buffet. As it happened, for the first time, he was teamed up with Charles Briket (who got the credit) and this is a great start. One commentator commented on how satisfied it was to see such films in old fashion movies and I could not agree more. In one of the small revival houses in Paris, one or less continuous Lubitsch reflectors are seen in one of them and I am pleased to report that it has played to the rightly respected audience across the age spectrum, though I suspect that there was no doubt whether anybody was alive. It was first released in 1938. The famous Willadar Meet-Boy specially flavored, when Millionaire tried to buy half the set pizima of a department store in a carefully-owned-it-cooper realio and meet sales resistance. Cloud Colbert turned around and agreed to buy another half. Although the chain of chains in the store is exhausted, the magazine sank more and more in the milk, calling to the manager owner, who was in bed and revealed that he also wore the upper half of the pajamas. The film is full of sight-gog, it is consistent with verbal intelligence which makes it just perfect. Clodett Colbert is just awesome and gets great support from his helpless title father from Edward Everton Horton. The fourth billing dealer has some interesting 'business' such as Franklin Pankburn and Gary Cooper lacking his role, but there are oral skills and sophisticated personality that Wilder scripts have at this stage of his career calling everything and you have what's darned near perfect.
