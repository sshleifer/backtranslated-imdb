Although some unreal events will happen in the end (such as a police shooting a gun in a crowd where a lonely number of innocent people could die), it was still an intense, enjoyable thriller, one of the better films of Alfred Hitchcock. Robert Walker is pretty cool as the cool nuts, sure to provide a fascinating performance that is really almost very annoying at some point. Here's his co-star, Farley Granger, all right but there is no match for Walker, acting or playing the characters they play. It's a weird camera angle, unethical theme, silly people suffer, etc., usually with hitcoc film. Contrary to many of his films, I thought it was a quick story that was very little dust. Being a former tennis player, I've enjoyed the footage of some of the cool old net matches that show some good rallies. Patricia, a real-life girl from Hitcoch, played an interesting and unique small role here. He did not just get to work because of his parents; He could work Also note: There are both British and American versions of the DVD and the story had some differences. This is a classic film which is still mentioned in modern day movies, even the "Throw wax off of train" even comedy.
