I bought my first zop album in 1974 (17a) and after that it was hesitant. This DVD has taken pride in the place of my music collection. It's often a band can not boast 4 virtuosos in their lineup but here we can. Each member makes their own contribution to the band, but together on stage, the electricity they made was larger than 4 people. This masterpiece covers the whole career of the band from Lead Zip 1 to Koda, and it is nicely captured on this DVD because every concert shows how the band gets bigger and bigger. My copy has disappeared recently, but I am happy to find out how wonderful these new generation boys were when they were found in my 17yo son's house. This rock music is essential for anyone that has an understanding. Long Live Zeppelin Live
