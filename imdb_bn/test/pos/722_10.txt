I did not know anything about this picture. I was supposed to have some sort of a sci-fi movie in it. How i was wrong Intriguing and intriguing plot, Cast is all charismatic and the whole film just makes you feel for change. Some cats stopped me completely but in the end the answer was simple. I was quite annoying at the low scoring of this photo because I thought it was quite unusual. If you like Sebastian Se7en (Seven) with Brad Pitt or The Matrix, then you like it. Here there are no major special effects or fancy gimmickry. It's about plot, about creating characters and building an atmosphere. It's a movie but ultimately does not give any answer that can disturb some people, but I think the last was great. I'm still not sure whether the film is based on the real story ...
