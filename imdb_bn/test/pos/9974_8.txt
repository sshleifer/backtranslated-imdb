'The Merchant of Venice' is one of Shakespeare's well-known plays and is still performed on regular theaters. Incredibly, however, this film seems to be the first English-version version of the movie instead of television. In the first days of the movie several versions were made in Britain or America, but they were all silent. <br /> <br /> This negligence of the game can be sensitive to the game's complication. Anti-Semitism, an issue which was even more sensitive in 1933 after the power of the Nazis. (This can be explained as to why the previous version was made in silent era; it was easy to portray Shylak in 1908 or 1922 as a simple villain). Yet in my view this film is not anti-Semitic. It should be remembered that there was no permanent Jewish community in England during Shakespeare's lifetime; At the end of the 13th century, I expelled the Jews and I was not allowed to return to Cromwell's time after 40 years of Shakespeare's death. As far as we know, Shakespeare has never traveled abroad, it seems that he never knew of a Jewish Jew himself, or at first, the effects of anti-Semitism were not experienced first. This game is not just the question of the Jews, but among other things, the analysis of the harmful effects of religious prejudice In fact, there could be a coded experiment of cross-conflict between Catholic and Protestant students in England (of course Shakespeare was the first experience) and more appeasement appeal among them. <br /> <br /> Now, traditional anti-Semitic stereotype has always portrayed the Jews as harmful, but there is no lack of Shaykh's main sin; If that is the case, he must have accepted Banani's proposal, to give him six thousand dukutits, twice the amount of loan from Antonio. Instead, Shayl's hateful sin is rage, and the fundamental principle of his anger is that he and his fellow Jews are treated by the Christians of Venice. The Jews are generally not considered second-class citizens, but the Jewish targets as Shylock have specific goals for abuse, even though the services they provide are essential for the Venetian economy. The challenge of the game shows the malicious effect. Such views not only corrupt Christians who hold them, they can also pollute the Jews who suffer from abuse. Shylock's vindictiveness is out of proportion to all the mistakes he has suffered. By kissing him and calling him a dog, Antonio behaves like a terrible satirical behavior, but is not considered a worthy offense for stupidity and anti-religious executions. Moreover, Shylock did not try to retaliate Antonio himself, not only for what Antonio had done to him, but also for all the mistakes, realities and imagery that he suffered in the hands of the Christian community, such as his daughter's marriage to Lorenzo. <br /> <br /> Credit to film director Michael Radford and his star Al Pase√±o means that they understand these things. Passino's Shylak, initially, got the status of anger about him, which gradually showed offensive anger and after the humiliation of the trial scene by the argument of Pashto, by his argument. We clearly see that he has used his own machine of destruction, but we can still sympathize with him. In my view, I have found that none of the passinos performance is equal to the first two 'Godfather' movies (not 'Antonym', for which he won an Oscar and certainly not 'Godfather III') equally the same. , But 'Venice of Merchant is the closest to those benchmarks. The other performance of Lynn Colin's brilliant Portia was with great transparency and simplicity, with her lines and her character highlights her intelligence and enthusiasm more than just a romantic heroine. I was very impressed with Jeremy Irons's Antonio, who was very inactive. Antonio is a complex character; Part loyal friends, part is rarely thoughtful, part religious prejudice and part entrepreneur capitalist. Although the irons were holding the first two aspects, it was difficult to spell on Antonio's belief in any of the different beliefs or risk her at risky trading ventures. The words of Radford in this game were attacked by the critics of 'The Daily Telegraph', although he praised the performance of Passino, but disliked the setting of the time and argued that Shakespeare should be kept in contemporary settings. It quotes a recent stage production, which is 'relevance' for the modern audience, which is taking place in Weimar Germany. I will deeply disagree with this approach. Theater and the film are quite different media and some interesting modernist aspects of Shakespeare's film (Trevor Noon's 'Twelfth Night'), a traditional method is often the best. (I like, for example, Jefferrley's 'Romeo and Juliet' of Buz Luzmann). The idea that we can only appreciate Shakespeare's modern thinking is intellectual laziness; We are not ready to be ready to see our greatest writer in the background of Elizabethan society, but instead she likes to wear it as a 20th-century man as a conspiracy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the play, the scenes set in Venice itself are characterized by erratic action; Belmont Portsia is happy and more peaceful in the country's house. In the film, the Venetian exotic scenes are similar to the appearance of 'No dot lab no', in contrast to the dirty, winter gray sky retreat. The candle was reminded of the effect of chiaroscuro of Caravaggio painting, with a brightly shining face against the dark background; I suspected it was deliberate, Karvaggio was contemporary of Shakespeare. In contrast to dark or dusty Venice, Belmont scenes (shot in a great Paladian villa on an island of a lake) are marked by sunlight or peaceful moon light. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Shakespeare adaptations of recent years. A cute and eye-catching look of a complex game. 8/10. <br /> <br /> Some mistakes. We see a black hawn in front of Portia home. This bird is native to Australia and until the 1596's until the film was set up in Europe until it was set up. Also, the Portier portrait of Leiden Cassette is painted in the style of Florentine Botticelli, which was active one century before that date. Lynn Collins may be a bouquet of beauty, but it seems that at the end of the 16th century, the Venetian lady herself portrayed Florence in the late 15th century.
