I was very excited to see the documentary in one of my favorite Italian directors. D'Amato, the post-apocalyptic has been dabbled into everything from hardcore porn. He touched geniuses like Bio Omega and Emmanuel and The Last Canibles. A lengthy and informative guide to the films of this documentary d'Amato. She is interviewed extensively with English subtitles across the bottom of the screen. Quotes from her films are described by a descriptor (with English subtitles). When it is most often censored "Emmanuelle in America" ​​analysis when documentary proved to be more interesting. Here D'AtaAuto Focus explains "Pfuf" scenes in detail and remembers some interesting stories. In fact, good ol 'joe is always warm and funny, wearing a smile and smoking a cigarette. An overwhelming aspect of this documentary is that it spends a little time in D'Amato's Horror films like Antrophyphas and Brilliant Bio Omega. It spends too much time in erotic movies and rarely touches post-apocalyptic films. But, I can not complain. D'Amato is wonderful to see his respected respect. D'Amato highly recommended for fans. If he could rest in peace.
