The unknown Basterds makes no excuses, asking for no forgiveness, it is prevented from banned invasion on any sense. Tenantino does not care if he does not take care of him, if he is taking all the stereotypes and clich√©s, then this film is absolutely correct. It's great to see a filmmaker whose work is not explicitly interfering with power. Tarantino is constantly making a lot of pressure and suddenly smiles laughing loudly; You are not sure that you are going to laugh or laugh, otherwise it's a roller coaster and do not miss! This is not for everyone and I'm not sure how the Germans take the film, of course if you're not a fan of Tarantino's style but it might be a little harder to swallow, but at least it's a movie that's easy to see. Any self-respecting film fan should miss this. And the performance of Christopher Waltz ... Oskar, do not ignore him !!
