Like "Shobot" method than Victor Herbert's life, I can not argue with other comments that give more attention to romance than the story line between Mary Martin and Alan Jones characters. But what was the box office draw in the 1930s? Perhaps it should have been VH's music instead of VH Life. This is an abundance. <br /> <br /> For me, the movie's romance came to the end of Susanna Foster's "Romance of Land" song. For more than a decade, I grabbed this movie for the second time in the local movie 'Old Movie' Theater. At first the audience was surprised; Then it explodes into spontaneous applause. I feel shivers running up and down my spine. The film came out for the first time in the late 1930s when my quarterly memory remembers the information given by a local journalist searching for John. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
