With frequent occurrences and exciting encounters, how often do we live our romantic lives as large screens? Often, if I see what I see as normal life around me, then it can not be judged. Romance, as it has been said earlier, is sometimes not a world phenomenon in the top of the world or in the form of patta and tornado. <br /> <br /> The romance, its everyday form, has lived almost millions of times in the world, a slow, delicate, and calm thing. Something that grows in you, sometimes slowly, perhaps it takes you gradually, in addition to you. Anyone can tell me after I'm in love. If I do not believe in anyone for anyone, no one will know me. And yet, it's just a feeling, a specific knowledge that you feel this extraordinary passion. If you do not want nothing but the best for anyone, you will never want to enjoy their sad moments. You are willing to take a great degree of pain for them. I can not say so much that you are willing to die for your loved one because we are all humans, and we do not know that we are able to face our death until that moment. <br /> <br /> Love is so subtle and distinguished among the main characters of the film, Romeo and Juliet younger than them? Unstable emotions, inappropriate feelings, propagate much more than the repetitive screams of "I Love You". The restraint shown by the lead actor is so ruthless in the scene where he sees his love interest in the caf√© window, yet he never went to reveal himself to himself, it is heartwarming to see only. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can claim that I have become seriously ill, but I honestly say I do not know that I've never been closer to death. Will I be so calm, keep all my things growing, and give me the instructions of others to leave me? I doubt I'll be calm, because I have little choice about this. Can I be so stupid? Again, the answer must be negative. I can sympathize with sadness that your life has been destroyed, the fate that has hurt you, and the events of the future, even though there is a small amount of them left, you are no longer under your control. <br /> <br />> There is nothing more than the small series of life, its consequences may seem to be somewhat cool for past observation. But only rarely.
