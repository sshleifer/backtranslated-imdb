I do not know what some people were thinking when this movie was bad. It was a lot better. Classic Bruce Campbell, yes it was a low budget and showed a special effect, but you will not see a Bruce movie for you to see it for Bruce. Teddy Rami was also excellent. I found this movie as fun and entertaining when I reminded that pink moped Bruce. Now if you like this movie then everyone is not for everyone, if you do not like B movies but you probably do not like it if you have made big budget effects and actors clear. But if you like slip stick and wall scientist closes plots, this movie is for you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
