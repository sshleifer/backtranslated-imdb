I saw this movie on my local cable system under the title 'Bind Redemption'. I was searching for new material searches, since most of Saturday I was not interested in the morning. I've always been a fan of Andrew McCarthy and Michael Iranside, so I chose this movie. I was glad <br /> <br /> Personally, I enjoyed this picture. Rich Rossing, who watched movie scenes behind the video rental box, commented on the insulting film for him, he was justified properly. I was not frustrated to know anything about the film before. This led me to rate the movie compared to the average score listed on the page. <br /> <br /> I like the suspense movie, and it was not an exception. The film kept me guessing at the very end. At the end, I was surprised <br /> <br /> During the movie, the moment of reflection of the main character and the past experience has been added to the mystery only. The responses to these memories are human, yet contradictory, giving the idea of ​​police action. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, <br /> If you find this movie on your local cable or satellite guide, check it out! <br /> <br /> However, if you are looking for rental videos, follow Rich Rising Tips and get a video before you see it.
