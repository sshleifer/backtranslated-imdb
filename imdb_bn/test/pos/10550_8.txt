This is a fun movie, there are not many. All right, the plot is a bit annoying, but very original. A child is trying to meet even father, because he was not nearly as well and almost sent him to jail because he lied to affect an older boy, is not it funny? Plus it's not the typical movie featuring teens movies. I saw the first remake, which is better than the original, the only problem with both: Gerard Depardieu. With another actor it will be a perfect 10, he sucks, playing all rolls alike. Another problem is that all women are melting on it, it is not reliably reliable, it is not interesting !, y was a rubber trolley that looked better than it, come on!
