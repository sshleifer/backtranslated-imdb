I absolutely love this movie. I just managed to get a copy and saved it to see my birthday. This movie raises several questions. One. Who is the monster of this world? Just that to be different Different. Hide behind the real monsters ordinariness mask. They all consider "a great calm smoke", who "did not bother anyone". Or they are bad characters they played by Kroneberg. People who engrave pleasure and strength by creating their own books of engraving and blood. I love shapeshifters, people with gifts and those who look may be unexpected for the people. It touches the movie and searches for what is normal. Who is the 'other' and what some fear. Although I gave this movie 10, I am still sick of those women who have screamed or set them so much that they can not see what is happening and a vehicle to destroy the medieval ones. My other complaint is why they never do a second film. I would like to see the continuation of this most intriguing story to keep captivated from one to the last
