I went into this thinking of another gross movie with this sunny. My first sentence is that I do not like this humor and this was the moment of the film but I like it. Justin Long is not really like this comedy, where she is witty and cute and I like it. Lewis Black ... enough to say. Finally I really love because it took itself seriously, I mean, how do you end it? Yes it is another rude story but not in your standard form and the film is not their compromise and downs, it is coming together for a common goal, to go to the college where they were adopted. Cast was amazing and yes I laughed laughing laughing laughing laughing and laughing laughing Parents and sisters have played their role well, but when needed, their letters are kept. The film was not focused around them but at the same time they showed when you expected and did not expect them. They played a very good story, and I liked the familiar faces like Anthony Hild (Boston Public), Jeremy Howard (me) (Justin Longer's Galaxy Quest) Ross Patterson (The New Guy) and Sam Hargin (Brink). Black Laily has added some of her specifications to this movie, which makes it more enjoyable, as well as a B-friend. I recommend this movie that those who hate the total joke in the last 4 years and really want humor and actually want something with the story line! ~!
