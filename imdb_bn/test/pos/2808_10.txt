I'm not really pleased with anyone who does not like this movie, I do it and what is the review. Iron Diamond Philips is great in this comedic role. The line between Train AB and C is now an instant classic, very good CGT, yes the train looks a bit fake, but alien woos never rock, Todd Bridges, Arnold and M. Where's the drum, oh, he got out of the loop, guess what the prison does with you .. To give a big lecture for a bullet trainer on the way to Las Vegas, a meteor has just hit, and now all of a sudden we I was hugging on the train, and our hero Copy had to save the day, to make matters worse, his ex-wife was debating with him. I would just see if this movie was so wonderful, if you prefer action.
