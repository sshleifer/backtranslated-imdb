I'm sure why this movie is so low in IMDB when everything you want to do in the worst movie is absolutely everything. This is a horror film defining. I consider myself to be a big horror fan and I must supply this house products. The wax house is a group of college kids on the way to football, who decide to camp for the night and run with local oddities. After the waking up the next morning, they made a scary discovery and decided to go to the city in a broken vehicle. The city is weird and I'm just going to stop. That's really because of the terrible greatness that begins. When I say if you are looking for a horror movie then believe me you like it. It is surprisingly surprising and innovative with its killing scenes, the story is interesting and characters are humbly drawn to the actors with their personality pairing. Paris Hilton does not quite well with her part. The film is a bit lonely on the shallow side but it's a lot of fun and care. This movie should be eaten at the box office and all the Awful fans should be part of it. Look at the House of Max that the image is leaky, very glued lips, dead animal dead bodies, hot spots still alive, spreading fingers, decapitation, a pole through the head, and more. I was lucky to see this picture in the Tribeca premiere and all the actors were present to promote this movie. And there is something to boast of the wax neck of the boys, the most horrific roller quota journey of the year! 9/10
