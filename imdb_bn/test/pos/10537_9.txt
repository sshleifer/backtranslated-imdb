I saw this at Family section, Tribeca Film Festival. I'm not sure which one of my kids got the movie, but I would say it's a great little film. <br /> <br /> 'Nostradamus and Mr' An interesting small movie about hope and fear. All of us have grown up in the 1980s, what has changed, how my kids feel today. Then, we were Regan, today, we got Bush. Instead of nuclear war, we have terrorism. <br /> <br /> I really marked with the main character, and I myself gave a 'CareerHead' date in high school. We did not feel like 'nothing mattered' at the age of 16, but it is very good to watch a movie, where they discover that everything is important! <br /> <br /> Again, I probably did not keep it in the family section ... there was a lot of curse for small kids, but it was a nice and enjoyable movie to watch.
