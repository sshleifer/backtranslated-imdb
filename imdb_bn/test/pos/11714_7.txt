"Sharky Machine" has evidently designed a Bart Reynolds car that allows Star Room to maintain its talent and spray-paint the machine, film plot spray paint with other films and other style colors, provide different types of moods in nutrients. <br /> <br /> In 1191, 119 minutes (longer for the period) was created, the movie worked well, at the box office $ 37,800,000 It was a lot of things for this: Bart Reynolds actor and director, a strong one-two punch; Adaptation of the William Daniel novels, and the South Land of Atlanta Georgia, at this time, a land of film production opportunity outside of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> With Rainbow Woman's love for Domino, Romandas fell in love with Tom Sharky. While acting opposite Kadririn Deenov, the "golden" image of gold with gold has become a reflection here and there was also corrupt politician in the original part of the film, but with despair "shirk" machine ". <br /> <br /> The story is a pure intelligence system / The worker, Sharqi, a drug addict makes a drug dealer brutal, causing some innocent people to be killed. They are disappointed, they literally move down and down and the other disrespectful policemen who consider the latrine duty to deal with the disaster. His new digs him to meet another similar compromise officer who does not want to see someone else doing dirty work Opportunities are provided when some of the attention is directed towards a particular pimple, some of Hungary's evidence Seen and discovered that a special prostitute Domino (Rachel Ward) - Dominio is being protected by police forces and political forces and Sharky has set up 24-hour surveillance forces to see him. When he saw that he saw the current governor elected Hotchinson Earl Holliman) is visiting Domino, as is a deadly Italian gangster Victorio Gassman. Prior to making a case in the case of police evidence, Billy, Victor's brother, Coke-snoating gunman (Henry Silva) was shot by the door of the apartment of Domino, killing the beautiful Dominioua, but Shark was discovered that the victim was actually the roommate, Tiffany (Arica Wales), Sharky Victor Beat and told him that he was going to arrest him. Some of the missing assassins have been caught in Sharka, under the leadership of Smiley (Daryl Hickman) and for torturing them for carrying Domino, but Sharky ousted the governor and overcame him after he killed Vitter. <br /> <Reynolds wants to showcase the internal activities of the strict police workers who fall in love, but the plot of the story-story plot, tastes with silent ingredients, and reinforces Renault's power relationship with the development of the film. <br /> <br /> We have come to learn something about some people and it gives us reason why they are moving towards pensions rather than fighting the real crime - this element of this film seems to be a sketch under Reynolds 'Off of Handsden'. And performance. <br /> <br /> A Reynolds film always has uniqueness. He likes to play big actors or others, and then they can change, sometimes with different results. <br /> <br /> With her "Shakir Machine" on her whisker machine she gets some fine moments and sometimes gets a bit of extraordinary fission, but always a sense of feeling and feeling of good nature. It works as an integral part of Reynolds. <br /> <br /> Reynolds, the actor / otuyur always laughs at himself and tells the viewer that it is all fake, but good fun. <br /> <br /> Great line: When Victory with Sharky throws Gauntlet "You are walking" you walk all the people like you, and you want to know the worst part? You came out of the state. Officers seem to be the greatest insult to the criminal. <br /> <br /> Reynolds compelled himself to make a movie book in Atlanta during his career and must be targeted and demographic. <BR> <br /> This image marked the appearance of Rachel Ward, who was nominated by the Golden Globe in 1981 as the new Star of the Year. <br /> <br /> Reynolds always has presence and star power and Georgia has been selected, to make films at home from home. <br /> <br /> I got my DVD for half an hour for $ 7.99 and unfortunately there was no comment or feature built on it, which is shameful. Perhaps the next generation will have them. <br /> <br /> The movie is still very interesting and both Reynolds and Ward are great actors of their Prime Minister.
