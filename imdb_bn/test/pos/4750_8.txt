This image is a classic seventy cop flick which is sadly ignored for some reasons. It basically meets the French connection bullet. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . <br /> <br /> Skyder and his team will have to find out their killers. They became involved in war with the masses. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> However, this car's Chase outshines Bullitt due to its length, speed and intensive tension. This is an exciting roller coaster ride which is endlessly unexpectedly and spectacular. Do not miss this little gem !!
