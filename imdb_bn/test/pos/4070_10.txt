It's exactly what I expected from it. Comfortable, funny and entertaining. The acting couple was awesome, as well as the scene selection I personally recommend this This is a kind of movie that can be seen by the whole family at the same time without being disturbed or disturbed by a family. This cute movie will smile to you, and laugh too much. And the action scene is delicious Modern American Comedy Classic. And very well done.
