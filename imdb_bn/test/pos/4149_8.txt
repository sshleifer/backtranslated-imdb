In response to submitting this review exactly how it corrected the film ... <br /> <br /> I saw this movie last year and it got inspiration from my optimistic immigrants, just like my Italian grandfather came through Elise Island The turn of the century will force all kinds of offensive inspections to enter America. <br /> <br /> It was obvious that the eyes were open, since my grandfather did not say anything terrible. My grandmother was 5 years old and my grandfather came to age 18. <br /> <br /> I just returned from a New York journey where there was a joy to visit Elise Island and the museum was really going through immigration. Evaluation Process - The filmmaker is clearly his research, direct medical examination and equipment, questions and puzzles. They have all at the museum. Even wedding photos and review board rooms - Actually accurate! Those who have immigrant grandfather will see this movie. At least say inspirational
