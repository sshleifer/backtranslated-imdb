I must say that in this life I have the best documentary. I first called the movie in my friends' house, and did not get the chance to end it. From that point, I spent my free time trying to find a movie. I could not find it, but on my birthday, my friend who knew that the film was my hardest time to find, it got me for the present. Shan Pen Documentary narrating does a great job. I loved how Z-Boys and Dogtown's history told each story. I have had many times in Venice and the surrounding areas, and I never knew what happened until I saw the documentary. I did not get the chance to watch the actual movie, and I heard that it was not close to the documentary. I really do not know if I want to watch movies, but who knows.
