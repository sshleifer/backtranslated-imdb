I want Hollywood to create more movies like China Syndrome. Because each one scores this score. <br /> <br /> This is an intelligent, credible script. It shows you that it is not just nuclear power, but rather the meaning involved, which creates danger. The film gives you behind the wonderful scenes of television creation. <br /> <br /> it scores as a thriller: for the first time I saw it, it kept me right on my side. Seat. And it scores as a character-movie: I really care about the original character. Jane Fonda, Michael Douglas, Wilford Breamley and most, Jack Lemon is very good.
