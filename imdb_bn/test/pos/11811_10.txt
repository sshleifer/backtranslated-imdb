It was a beautiful film. Such an amazing performance from Joseph and Brad. Very innocently written and performed. A must see !! I almost cried my eyes through the whole movie. This is a movie that every family will have to sit down to meet their children, it teaches us all the important lessons in life and how we should reach Aids for the harsh, how we should teach our kids to deal with it and the people around them Not only with AIDS, but with a terminal illness. I T.V. Until I even heard about this movie. One day and it happens to run across. I recommend everyone to visit it, just do not forget your box of tissues. More movies should be like this one. Very hearty.
