I like Braille's movie, but it is the best way to maintain animal warmth with sexual intelligence. Anne Parillaud is electric, and the script is amazing - especially it is considered to be set in any other movie in Braille. You do not have to agree with her to get her many things. It made me think a lot about weaknesses and power. Try to imagine a man's director with Jeanne's exposure - not impossible, but a little mind-bending. When people meet together to do something like this, the unusual sexual harassment that is always present holds bright light here, but not cold light.
