With the release of ADV Films, for the first time, the "Giant Mugin" was opened for the first time without a deep cut and ruthless sound of late night horror theater. Guess what This is a fantastic extraordinary movie! <br /> <br /> The sets are authentic, defeated and credible, and the giant mob is strong, strong and unstable. I love the delicate fantasy touch (enchanted wood, fate charm, etc.), and the potrayal choice of the gods as a little less than 'good'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is begging for a new remake of the century!
