It is a common sandra film that he plays a mossy (but dirty) woman, but she finds the way to survive and become a hero. Sound familiar? <br /> <br /> There are lots of holes in this story. Things just do not add up and some mystery is a small corny. But - that mystery is very good. There is a lot of tension in this story, which is the ongoing Paranoia. The story begins to grow slowly but is very quick and kicks, it creates an involved film for the audience. That's why I can give it a pretty good rating - the movie involves you. Bullock is more tricky than annoying, which he usually comes to me, so it's my highest rating movie with him.
