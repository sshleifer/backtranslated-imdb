After finishing the Zero Women Series, I was looking forward to the series of Women's Scorpio series; Based on both trophies by Tooru Shinohara Unfortunately, I did not see them in sequence, because the third in this series <br /> <br /> It starts to run away from Scrappen (Meiko Kazi) police. Detective Condo (Mikeo Narita) led a cuff on her, but she cut off her hand and went away. If it is not bad enough, then the dog then digs his hand and finds trotting down the street to find a place to enjoy his behavior. <br /> <br /> Scorpio can go back to prison again without any picnic. First, local Yakuza Tanda (v) threatened to return him if he did not leave; And then the gang leader gets him when he gets rid of Tanida. However, he does not hold him for a long time before he escapes, and looking at retaliation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Madam (Reisen Lee) prevents himself from killing himself. <br /> <br /> The police got trapped in her last murderous assassination. He is there for a week and the police say that a friend (Yeeyay Watnabe) is providing food to him. (Story and Yuki (Watanabe) and his brother are a theorem which is very interesting, but only accessible to the movie.) They try to burn him, but it is Scorpio, and some of its incomplete business <Br /> <br /> It's a slow mix of gender and violence, it's a slow story that is beautiful all the time.
