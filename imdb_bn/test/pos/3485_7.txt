Because of its predictable, second-rate title, (at least it was distributed in Italy), I did not expect much from this movie. Thought it would be another cheap flick about a ghost house ("El Casa Maldetta" meaning "cursed house"). Well, I must change my mind only the first spectacular scene! The constant presence of the priests and the strange atmosphere reminds me of some of the Exxist's and some of its Italian Rip-Off, but it's going to be something completely different ... Hitscok is getting along with the Italian thriller! Very good writing and guided, good actors, interesting plots ... All right, I've tried not to spoil the "7 Hyde Park" for you, which I would highly recommend to everyone. <br /> <br /> <br /> I am wrong, or do Joan work hard to stand on the street or become a little taller on her waist and leg? (... and I'm not talking about the "bad dream" sequence.)
