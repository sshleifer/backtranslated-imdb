Disabled Screen Entertainment is a relatively new and British (I think) DVD label, smutty and excessive violent ritual movie expert ?? Most Italian ones - from the glorious era, when everything is possible, from 60 to the middle of the 80's. The selection of the label seems like a crossover between "Mondo MacBroo" and "No Shem" (probably the next name also), and they are already "Rotman", "My Dyer Killer", "Killer Nun", "Feelings of Death" and "Horror". "Awesome Women" was completely unknown to me, but from fellow critics from here, whose opinion I was very valuable, it is the greatest of its era. And described as one of the most ridiculous cycling euro-sex films, I did not hesitate to take it out. This is not a very strange film and probably not suitable for almost 99% of the average movie-loving audience. If you are part of the remaining 1% But you really are for a unique style. Style, atmosphere and content of Jess Franco's "Sukubus" and Massimo Dalmanova "Shu Although it is similar to "Friday's Friday", both of them are widely considered as classic, although "fearsome women" is often unknown, it is a matter of profiling and good marketing, I guess. The story is a literally dirty rich doctor (he lives in a large isolated palace, Owned by old-timer cars) and its own lifestyle with an odd and slightly offabout Myanekuina doll replica of Arts with a very impressive collection of absurdities. Attitude towards women He feels threatened by male men to survive and thus he spends his days kidnapping, abusive and sexual abuse which he got from the street. Dr Saiir then abducted aspiring journalist Maria for his ambition to completely crush his aspirant, but he gradually fell for him. Just when he began to believe in real love, he strikes back with a revenge. This is not really for everyone, but you can think of this a top recommendation, but you can think of Moody and Terribly sexy ambiances, Wicked scenery toys and Psychedelic touch that are completely impossible and surreal. Is it slower, stylish, sleazy and complete bonkers ?? Ruthless Entertainment, OK!
