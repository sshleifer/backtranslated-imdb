Chen Kyz gives great depth to our atmosphere. Yes, this is a 'piece of time', but artistic use of chain artwork makes it more like that. Actors often behave like players using styled imagery, posture and facial expressions of Picking Opera. Addressing each other, even in one scene all the actors played 'back wall'. They are a story about the past with the strong clarity of the past, like the past spirits, for the present. With intimate attention inside and outside of the scale and southern painting, "Jing K C Q Wang" is a stunning story that speaks with great respect to his own idol that is fully captive.
