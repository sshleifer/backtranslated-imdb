On March 17, 1974, a man died in a toilet in Manhattan's Pen Station. Although well-known, he could not be identified because he scratched personal information of his passport and said his body unclaimed at the city's morgue for three days. It is one of the largest American architects of the twentieth century, Louis I. Ears. At the age of 73, he died, on his way from India, where one of his biggest projects, the Institute for Management in Ahmedabad, was near completion. Louis Kahn's architectural heritage includes Dhaka, Bangladesh, Kimblebel Museum of Forth Worth, Yale Art Gallery, California's Sal Institute and a type of mobile " Music boat "designed to give concerts on the harbors. In various cities around the world. <br /> <br /> Though celebrated as an architect, little was known about his personal life. In addition to his wife Esther, and her daughter Su Anne, her two dough, Harry Pattinson and Anna Tyng and their two children were alive. All three families lived each other in Philadelphia in the suburbs, but their paths never ended. His son, Nathaniel, was only 11 years old when he was director of the film, and there were memories of Nathaniel's mother Harriet Patterson's weekly weekly tour of Philadelphia. Twenty-five years later, he started his journey to visit his daughter's house, to talk to relatives and colleagues, and to visit places where Louis Kahan plays the role of his father. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel was asking the architect and mistress of her mother, Lawson Ear, why she wanted to play with her second riddle and never met him. Tears her eyes tears, but she has no regrets. "It was worth it." It's such a very sad moment. He definitely exploded, considered to be a distraught in his funeral, which he was forbidden to participate, almost as he led an alternative life. It seems all the strange incredible. Kane's architectural Namesas, who was in charge of rebuilding his local Philadelphia in the fifties and sixties, in another interview with Edward Bacon, he was reminded of helpless ideas about the daughter's architecture, he was hit in the spot. When his son, Nathaniel heard uncomfortably, Kanan's name came when very Bacon Bacon literally screamed with anger. The scene of Chennai is the capital of Dhaka, the largest creation of kahan, preserved. It took 23 years to build a complete and extraordinary building, of which Bangladeshis are very proud. This is one of the few national symbols with humor in the poor nation. Some interviews with the locals bring tears to my eyes, especially when they know that they are talking - God is forbidden - the architect's own son! <br /> <br /> This personalized journey is an account of the legacy of the ear's grand architecture, and it is about the success of the movie and the film in general. Probably Louis I. The ear is falsely as a father, but these flaws in personal life create more interesting pictures for this extraordinary movie. <br /> <br /> Camera Asphuara --- 9/10
