I had this a very good movie. Some people said that it was 'sick' and they could not see it. I think if you realize her rating R, you'll be ready to use nudity and drugs. It's a good story and amazing acting. Just can not be an inspiration to appreciate it! It's basically like a mother who wants to get into drugs and clean her so she brings a very rich old friend and she brings her property and crazy things. I guess it's a drama. I'm not just sick of people who do not like movies due to cursor or nudity. The world we live in. If you do not see things like this movie, of course you are not comfortable with yourself. And it's rating R. So, that would tell you from the beginning that it's not all peachy happy rainbows. I like it I think you will!
