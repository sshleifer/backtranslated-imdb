Remember the date of the huge publication of August 8, 1945 - Japan may be a message in WWII a week before surrendering, perhaps more than our "21 plus". Irene Dunne (The Happened One Night, 1943 version of Love Affair) is Paola Warton, who is going to live in the army while her newspaper editor husband Training School. Alexander Knox (longest day) is her husband Max. Look for Charles Coburn (Monkey business, likes Gentlemen Blunds) Staff, Commanding, as the newspaper owner. Also look for Kara Witherspoon as Lady Gates, Lady Dick, Lady of the Libeled Lady. The story of war was written for the views of women, which was not very common on that day. Funny comments about snail status of "married housing"; Irene's costume was not all in this film. Since they did not give up their little cottage, it seems that the entire movie budget was spent in all its best dresses and hats.
