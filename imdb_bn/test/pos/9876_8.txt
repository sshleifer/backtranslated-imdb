It was a really interesting Halloween movie. I was not thrilled with full throw theory, but it still creates a good movie. I found Tommy Doyle back, but sadly Donald Plasens died after shooting. The film was really a bad director, who did not give a flip about the series, which I thought was Donald bad and did not let Daniel Harris return as Jamie. Just like he is trying to throw the film, but I still like it. A lot of cuts and music have changed, and if you are lucky, you can get the cut of the producers, which is more than 40 minutes. Not before the scene With those scenes it turns an entirely new movie. Check that you have the opportunity.
