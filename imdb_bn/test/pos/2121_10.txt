Today's "Grand Champion" went to the preview presentation (Dallas / Fort Worth, Austin, Snyder and a few Texas cities). There are few movies suitable for young people ... but it's one, and it's cool. Although this plot is "hockey" (the name of the movie's name), it is a wonderful story for children. And I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> This picture represents a good family of farms in West Texas, though it is a little exaggerated. Since the director / writer Barry Tubu grew up in this environment, it should be taken correctly. She loves her "Texas love love letter" <br /> <br /> Jo Lauren Adam's Body (Jacob Fisher) and sister of 'Blow' (Emma Roberts) played single mom. See Emma Roberts (Julia Roberts's nephew); She is very good and I think she will have more movies. Julio Roberts, Bruce Willis, musician George Straits, Charlie Robson, Robert Earl Kinnie, Joe Ely and Ride legend Larry Mahan and TAF Haidman's Camio are also present. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you have a small child or just want to see an emotional movie, come to your city ("Next Month"), see "Grand Champion". You will enjoy it and it will make you feel better. <br /> <br /> I guess I'm from West Texas, I can be a little favor ... No, I'm neutral. Pictures are awesome!
