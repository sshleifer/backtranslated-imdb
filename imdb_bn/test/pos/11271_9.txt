Start black and white distorted images. It seems to be in the nineteenth century. However, for the words crystal clear, narrow subtraction and calm words to add words. <br /> <br /> This movie was very critical for life's struggles. It shows a single mother and child in a violent world that thrives on innocent. Mother is very unconscious about her surroundings. This leads to a lot of torture, pain, and death. You can see it many times and different symbols, plot devices and basically "what does this mean?" <br /> <br /> If you are grateful to the art in the movie you would like it. Otherwise, do not bother.
