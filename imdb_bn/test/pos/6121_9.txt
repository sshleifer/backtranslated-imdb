"300" is more entertaining than all gay organs combined. More heartbreaking than a Shakespeare tragedy The poem of poem is also about lost love and about Allah Bala. And above all, the greatest trash of all time. <br /> <br /> A black comedy is examining the limits of human perception, John Waters's civilian film "Pink Flimings" is a story about the conflicts between two families. The humiliation, death, and of course, ends with eating dog bits (yes, in such a way that is not an insulting part). No, not about this impossible love, this is not a romio or Juliet in the 90 minutes. If you can call this movie about fights for fame. Fighting for the title - Lively living <br /> <br /> On one hand our Divine (cross dressing water has played regular ... umm ... Divine) is a caring girl, good mother, cancible, murderer, distorted and current owner of current title. He loves his son's crackers a little more. Crackers are both victims of sexual intercourse between both chickens and young women. Family friend and loyal companion Cotton gets her satisfaction from seeing crackers for some time ... Activities related to the objects mentioned before the attraction At least but at least the Divine's mother and the grandson of the crackers, Eddie. A 400-pound woman, sleep, eat and basically live a baby pedal. He is addicted to eggs and loves eggs - people (who bring eggs ... lol) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For a marbles Goal Exhibitionists, manipulators, cheaters, actually very bad people The main source of their income comes from the abduction and oppression of the youth. In infectious areas, they use their trusted and trusted cross-dressing butler to supply semen. Then they sold distorted children to the highest door. <br /> <br /> It was an envy of the Marble and was jealous of its title, which would cause an uncertain collision between the two families. An epic war of dirty, deformity and violence. <br /> <br /> "Ping Fleming" is an extraordinary classic version of the trash-movie genre. Loaded with curiosity and peculiar work, John Waters's film is hated and hated by the filmmakers, critics and viewers of the average film. But Flamning is an unforgettable experience in some cases of helplessness by these generalizations. Funny and sick, violent and poetic. It's really an exercise in poor taste
