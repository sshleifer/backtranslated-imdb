If you are worth your freedom! <br /> <br /> After reading an article in the UK magazine "The Fortune Times" for the first time, I first showed great interest in the disappointment of Brad Dividion. If you want to know more, I hired this documentary and after seeing it, I was amazed at what I saw. This picture shows my interest in the subject and since then I have read several books on this topic. This film must be seen for people who only know the information in the so-called "mainstream" media. Think twice about questioning the government's activities in this conflict "almond" "lunny" and "cocks", by making false statements, conflicts, and contradictory statements made by officials and politicians shown in this film. The fearsome thing is, I know some people who are "open-minded" and open-minded "intellectuals" who still believe that the government has done the right thing in Waqo and refused to see the film. Read the subject book. They do not consider their time valuable because it is a gun-loving, hatred of Clinton, religious extremists, all campaign of right-wing anarchist nuts. A publication published in a publication of a company claiming "Due", "General Knowledge" and "Rationality", has been claimed in the publication of a "Film Criticism" and it strongly recommends that the film should be suppressed. They even indicate that the Davidicians are coming in it. I'm not a coward I mentioned his name. If you are reading this (you certainly will not be able to read it), but I can only say that you do not open your mind.
