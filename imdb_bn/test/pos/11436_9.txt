This is still a wonderful new movie which is still being shown in movies in my country. Its director, Calberian Jianni Amelio, is perhaps the only contemporary Italian director in my modest view, along with Nani Montatti, who is also great to claim (that is, those who are still close to the old masters and occasionally wiped the film). Since the mid-70s, the contemporary Italian film has become ill, it is one of my greatest remorse because, in most cases, due to the lack of financing and new talent growth, most of the cases can be transferred which makes Italy the most stable. According to our time production industry (both in an art and cultural sense) industrialized countries ... China, the opposite. And this, among other things, is precisely the subject of the latest movie of Amelio. Some of the directors of the world can talk to me as the real, current state of the country and the Amelio, but its pictures also have valuable timelessness and universality. And those who are already worried that their slow, scholar and might be qualified - rest assured: What I saw is certainly not guaranteed, at least if you do not use standard European movies. The main plot is outline: Vinsenjo Bonavolenta is a technologist in the unreleased steel plant factory in Italy, probably the answer. Sergio Kastitito, Italy's most versatile and talented actor, has played him. When a major Chinese steel company purchases some industrial equipment from the Italian steel plant, Vincentjo, who struggles to understand himself as a non-Italian speaking Chinese director, tries to tell him that the machine is defective and needs to replace its converter, a material he own custom building Is working. He warns them that it can be very dangerous consequences. Meanwhile, Liu Hua, a young Chinese woman, acts as an interpreter among two men, but struggles to find enough translations for Vignenjor's technical jargon. The Italians finally lost patience with him, often pushed him aside and asked him to give a Chinese-Italian dictionary so that he could translate himself. <br /> <br /> In spite of Vinceenza's warning, the next morning, the factory director and his employees returned to their own country, but he was not paying attention to his advice on the proper use of industrial equipment. So Vinceenzo, equipped with his great fidelity, set off for China. And here started an endlessly impressive road movie through China, a very empire through the Asian giant 21st Century ODC. Looking for a mystery of Marco Polo's mysterious nation the next day? Not quite Like Amelier's films, the journey is much more important than whether its final "mission" is performed. In fact, the point has literally been brought home, without humor, it is a beautiful, tragic satire and satire, which makes my eyes look good and I laugh together. Vinceenzo's visit was kept secret to the observer because it was utterly in vain, but he did not know himself and took a satisfied man, an innocent innocent. At least, you figure, he is happy. Sorting <br /> <br /> <br /> The passages that have completely disappeared in Amylio's character and pushed them to humanitarian needs. They are passing some name, position or someone to put a word for them. Themes such as Theo Angelopoulos have also been searched in lamerica, actually my favorite Amelio film, following personal preferences, follow La Stella Che unse. In the 1994 film Lamerica, two Italian racquets go to Albania to "do business". Just like Vincenzo, they are willing to go there, what they have to do and then go back home. Instead, after the fall of communalism in one of these two Italianians, the homeric journey ended with this devastating land. <br /> <br /> But we come back again La Stella che non c'Ã¨: Once in China, Vincenzo has probably discovered that the seemingly "simple" work to handover the converter to its new owner is not straight-forward. It is almost impossible to determine the new location of the device, until he started a difficult journey through China. When he came across Liu Hua, he was working as a young librarian as a young translator, he tried to talk to him, but he responded adversely, told him that because of this he lost his job to his interpreter in Italy, in Italy. Directed by the new generation of Ling Tai, Liu Hua soon became a Virgil in Dinos, when she admits that she can do worse work than her work as a guide and interpreter for the Italians (possibly for cash suit). This young sugar actress can not have the beauty of Zia Zhang and Gong Li's film star Glamor, but its impressive, evocative and gorgeous face overwhelms the combination of vague power, intelligence, dignity and humor that makes its features difficult. Be sure to forget once you see the movie. Moreover, he and Castileto have excellent emotional chemistry as co-stars. <br /> <br /> Amelio suddenly accepts serious, poetic, mythological, next neo-realistic and ridiculous plays, the ability to explore the fleeting summaries of humanity in everyday, common situations while maintaining heart rate. Naturality, like a documentary, actually hides a masonry tape of a sight of eyes and places, a prominent characteristic that also involves the painting of breath-taking scenes. Here photography is an effective, yet beautiful, artistic, and emotionally-disrupted movie. <br /> <br /> Amelier's surveillance eyes grew bigger, psychologically, never even a drying or irrelevant. . Masterfood camera angles often reflect on Vinceenjo's animosity in the eyes of China, which brings realism and feeling of cultural neutrality, which is rare for the "unknown" western-western country to discover the "unknown" non-Western country. I can not recommend this movie enough.
