In 1982 I saw it in the theater. I hope a stupid movie and a movie. Not what I found <br /> <br /> It is essentially about three teenage boys trying to harass sex. We get the expected sex jokes and scenes - but, once, they are really funny! <br /> <br /> Yes, they are stupid but I've enjoyed them. Also, there was an amazing amount of male nudity. <br /> <br /> Then, through almost half of the movie, suddenly a dramatic turn takes one of the boys to fall in love with a girl (winner played by Lawrence Monson). Then joke off and things get too dark. I'm not going to give up what I'm going to be doing, but the events were suddenly amazed. Movies come up with some important issues and act them in practical and intellectual way. And it ended up breaking a real heart. <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the best teen sexual comedy / plays because I'm giving it a 10. It combines imagination and realistic mix and works! What more can you request for? Also it has a great soundtrack.
