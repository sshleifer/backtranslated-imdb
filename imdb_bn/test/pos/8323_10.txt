I saw this series in London in 1999 and lifted it. Commented as another user - I saw what I saw when I first saw "Jurassic Park" - the life and death of dinosaurs as their natural habitat as a document. CGY is very vivid, and the variety of dinosaurs and habitats shown is very educational. <br /> <br /> The series accepts everything about the dinosaur, adding a lot of good ideas "what it might be" then looks like a documentary series to do. What I missed was a few small bar graphs in the corner of the screen, moving with stories and pictures with "fiction" and "true" because you often think that educated guess how much and how pure fantasy is <br /> <br / > <br /> To notify you about some information and imagination, you will need to see 50 minutes "Making Off", which is not only very educational in the process of Cgi, and in the series Paleontologists Nana collection and include, but are very funny (dainosarara cigarette smoke and Cixi ayanimesanakaridera complained). <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this series before going to the upcoming Disney Dinosaur movie or before watching a Jurassic Park (like) movie. This will surely make you more critical of those movies. The Disney trailer looked particularly bad.
