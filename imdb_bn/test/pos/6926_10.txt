I know this movie was a rough ride from critics, but I have to say that I've enjoyed it completely. Here is the real star superb Dylan Moran. He never failed to be ridiculous and credible in all its diversity. He operates to radiate a sweet charm that belies his damaging pratfalls. Specifications will also go to Michael Gambon who plays for a brilliantly accurate and yet ludicrous inner city laughing with Dublin accent. The only weak link is Cain, who is obviously a great hilarium playing at least humorous and most disrespectful character while hamming it. Most likely it will not play well abroad, but it is similar to a clock.
