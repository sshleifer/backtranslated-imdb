Again greetings from darkness. Director Alejandro Amenobar created life against all the victories based on the real story version of one man's struggle for controlling his fate. Great to see his role as Javier Bardham Raman is interesting. There is a doubt in his mind that the speed of his eyes and head is going on in his mind. Dream and fantasy sequences are not used extra, so prove it very effective to explain what he wants. Instead of answering our encouraged question, the real question is, what is love? In every house we love people of love, love for love or love loved ones. The script is tight and in spite of being portrayed in one room, the film is in progress. Supporting Cast is excellent and we really feel their pain and how each family member relates to Raman's decision. It is a jewel and is expected to be seen.
