I saw this on the horror of the zones and most of the movies they like to play can compete perfectly, but I was happy. The film revolves around two friends and a giant trucker who is following them (I know it's a crap, but it's really good), the film suddenly gets frustrated and laughs loudly (and not in an unknown way, it's very good And many fun and funny, many funny black comedies are also thrown in this way, this is not a movie, but what if you do not have a Shakespeare But if it is a funny movie then you are not, then this should be fine
