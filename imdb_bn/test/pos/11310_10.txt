"Medusa must be brave truly" is a tortuous funny parody, which is a good companion to the genre, "Madonna: true or brave". Julie Brown's Bright Creation Scouts are a very entertaining documentary in Madonna (although it was not bold, insightful, clear, or truthful) in detail detailing it for packaging. I highly recommend Madonna fans, Julie Brown fans, or anyone who enjoys sharp and cute parody.
