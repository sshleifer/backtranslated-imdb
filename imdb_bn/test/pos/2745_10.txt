Every Saturday I saw Superstar at 11am. All the shows have happened at these shows during this time. The Sunday morning campaign was also very good, but all the big elements in this show took place. Wrestlers will talk to themselves on the screen in front of a background on their platform or in front of a live rally in front of the live crowd with all their interviews with the gene. Match is usually squashes but sometimes you will see off 2 middle-tier squares in main event. There was also an interview show that usually a feudal outcome resulted in violence. These sections come from Piper's Pitt, The Body Shoping, Flower Shop, The Snake Pit, The Brother Love Show, The Finer Paller and Barber Shop. I do not recall any title changing this show hand. That's usually happened on every aspect and Saturday Night's Main Event.
