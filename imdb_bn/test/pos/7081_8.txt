This movie has become confusing and I have seen that one of the best movies has grown ... the acting was fantastic and when I was not going to dry my tears, I used to enjoy the Maril Strip, whose performance was extraordinary. The movie relates to the difficulties of a remote family with a mother of terminal cancer developer. The film was very hard to see and hearty. Soundtrack fits a spunk in this movie. Bra Bet Miller !! 5 stars out, I give this 4 1/2.
