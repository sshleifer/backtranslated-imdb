I always did not like Brenda Blathin and "Understanding Betty", was not frustrated. I saw this on satellite on Sunday morning. Life has become intense and this movie has made me laughable and we generally consider it a ridiculously frightening. I will do more movies like this and "Save Grace." Brenda Blethyn is a great girl for us approaching 60 approaches to see the action. She is beautiful, beautiful and full of life without plastic and messy looks. There are not many actresses to relate to us in a realistic, yet humorous and / or serious way. Brenda - If you see this - keep going with gems like this. We need more Mrs. Bennett, Bettys and Graces.
