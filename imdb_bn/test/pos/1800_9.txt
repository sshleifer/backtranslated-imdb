This is a good movie which is defective in many ways with less production. Martha Coolidge herself said she had only $ 350,000 to work with. This is a movie that I like to grow up in the Midwest. My friends remember and I did trip to Nostalgia 10 years ago. Great thing about this movie .... great cast with hungry actors and a hungry director. The bad aspects of this movie .... Calling for a lot of progress for the budget. Martha Coolidge's film has given more meaning and time, but the results will get better. They could accept the story, not from the potential of 20 to the high school stand point of 15-17 years old. Most actresses / actresses were among the 15-17 year old players playing within 20 minutes .... (Come on) The music is very memorable and my soundtracks are always played in my car. The best scenes of this movie are held in Hollywood clubs by the character of Nicholas Cage. I gave this picture a high rating of 9/10 for five reasons. Nicholas Kies's spot performer progressed; The camera work and the angle was excellent given their budget and being able to take only one in each view; Sytles, music and Lingo are captured completely and forever; Again the music is incredible and carries the story from the scene to the scene; And finally ... Martha Coolidge could launch a weak script, unknown actor, and a very low budget, and the whole movie is 20 days of shooting and wonderful in a memorable movie!
