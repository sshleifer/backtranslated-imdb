This movie, I want to say, was completely great. I can see how many people will think it's just a shock movie. It's not completely untrue, but it's a lot of shocking fiction like Chalk Palahnieque's books. Always one of my favorite movies, Bijo or Harvata is a specific miserable movie that you can have a response to. This is scary, funny, stupid, gross, off-the-top content and to some people, awakening. During my cell phone I saw it was with my friend, and her mother brought her home to visit. She said it was just a little skewed up Japanese film, but I saw a lot more. It has been created badly, yes, but it is a beautiful kind of beautiful poem. The director tells himself, this is a shocker movie for a specific reason. Like the entrance. If you leave the audience soft, then the whole human race is going to be soft. I think this is a good philosophy, and I agree with one hundred percent. Bijo or Harvata is the type of film that gang, fitness, curd and rape all these new things in hell.
