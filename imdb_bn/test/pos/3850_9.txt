I'm not a big Disney fan, but my 7-year-old boy started to enter them, so we've collected a lot, and it's my favorite. We saw it the first few weeks ago and we saw it almost half a dozen times! Okay, as others have mentioned, the plots are not the most complex or inventive, but there is more to it. <br /> <br /> Great characters, Phil Harris is stealing the show as Thomas O'Mallley, but Edgar Butler is not very far behind. The music is amazing - my helpless boy always jumped me aloud and loudly loudly loudly said, "Everyone wants to be a cat". And "Thomas O'Mallley" is just enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why some people in this movie are so humble without dislike cats! And yes, it takes some signals from "101 Dummationes" and then "The Lady and the Tramp". (I've been spending a lot of time looking at it, so I'm not going to compare them) and when "101 dummies" is good in some ways, "Aristocats" is more enjoyable for me. What is the news of this movie? In addition to "Peter Pan" (now it's a 10/10 movie), this is my favorite Disney movie. My 7-year-old boy loves it, his troubled 41-year-old father loves him, so you can not ask for a lot of family films. <br /> <br /> Excellent!
