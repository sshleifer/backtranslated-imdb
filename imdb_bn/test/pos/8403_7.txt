When I watched the wind, I thought that Vivienne Leigh and Clark could not be a better actor than Gabelle after playing Scarlett and Rite, but I saw the movie Scarlett. I fall in love for this dramatic story. I love Dolphin as Rite Butler, he's pretty nice. This is a movie that I can see thousands of times and it still will not bother me.
