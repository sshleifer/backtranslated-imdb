Victor Sjostrom's silent film Masterpiece The Phantom Carriage recently released DVD with a new soundtrack recorded by KTL. Both American guitarist Stephen O'Mallley and Austrian laptop artist Peter Reharg are both co-coordinators who acknowledged a great collection of words since 1921 to bring original film footage. A violent frogs flow as each law and drones unfolds as a medley, guitar code, and reaction ebbs and fatal drama. <br /> <br /> As impressive as the new soundtrack, the film remains the real star with its timeless rendering of a dark and dystopian fairy tale. The last person who died before the midnight's stroke on the night before the New Year, condemned the soul of death and spent more than a year in a phantom carrier. The hero of this movie is David Harim, the hero of Harry, who after his unhappy death and carrier driver was transferred to the painful surveillance of his life after the next clash. <br /> <br /> This picture is often referred to as a horror film, and although it is a suitable label, the real horror is not here in the occult elements but rather the pain of human suffering in others. Sjostrom gives a remarkable performance as a drunk, poisonous and Holm life of living, and the mad, scared Holma is looking back from the dead bodies and shrinking from its past deeds. <br /> <br /> There are lots of fanatical carriages and more than compensating for inevitable limited dialogue across interesting imagery. Midnight's weak formula is strongly reflected in the dark night sky, like a second moon, through the face of the watch face. Equally impressive, the front-end imagery of the dead and the spectacular scene on the land and ocean is fascinating to see the fascinating career scenes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a must see.
