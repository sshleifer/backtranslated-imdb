This movie was not very good, but was very good. It's based on one of Rubin's Santiago Hodgon players. He plays mostly. On paper it looks like casting stunts. Yes, round all the black people in Hollywood and keep them in a movie. Hell berry even produced it. Oprah's only name was Apara thanks, because she would probably become like the Halmark movie. Instead of this movie some feeling was not mess. It was moving but not duplicate, the letter came in and went to the question with the exception of her husband, Palin and the author. The film revolves around the grand universe, Mrs Bill Crosby and how he raised the author and took it among the people. While living in New York in a wonderful New York, he took sick people and old people and then we saw him take to a psychological institution, it seems that sister is going to get a Medicare scam. People are getting a job and receiving Medicare / CAD check but he has not given any explanation to the loop gestate, he wants Rs. 25 per week and does not want money before time. I think this picture was kept only for wizards in New York, so we know that he is not scanning poor people. (G) It was written by New York so that he knew the agreement (g) .. He almost thinks the angel. And I see why I see with little boys eyes. He is a ne'er married who is 17 years old and is stupid marriage around him. Terrence Howard was born in this kind of game. He was good but I would like to see him play a different game. Marcus who plays Nanny is very good. But for some reason the person standing by me, he played Jeffrey Wright. Where is this man Oscar? He has already won an Emmy and a Tony. He was a prostitute and he stole the movie. I do not know who I was in this film. She is not the same as a cheating. I have not seen him playing a bad part yet. It was a 5 minute role and he managed to make me both laugh and tears. I took the scene several times in the air again. One time, because I do not know who he was. His wife Carman Ezogo was excellent. I have seen her in the role before mostly mousy stuff. But he's so good here I know who actually works like her. So to me Messi Gray was very real, whose big part was a very good one. I'm glad they did not kill Nani. I was a goner at the beginning of the movie. But he can go home and start his old routine to take care of people. Most of our lives are such a woman. We do not know or even live. Thanks to God for them, I do not know how they do it all the time. I have a friend who lost two children and stuffed a lot, but whenever I feel selfishly sorry for myself I call him and he always keeps me in good mood. This movie is a tribute to all people. I simply told them that what happened to some characters like an armed man, Paulin's boyfriend, who played Habibo's The Wire, Omar, my favorite actor on Rosie Perez's character and one of Richard Gayle and Delray Lindo. Arm Man, he was mesmerizing another small role.
