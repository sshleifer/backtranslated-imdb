Take drunk and lewis like salt and pepper dash. Why hold on Martin Lewis? Then why do all women love Jerry in this film again? Because he is innocent! Martin has sung some good songs (at least licked-synced) and Jerry drives more girls to kiss more than all his other films. I usually think that Jerry's antics can take so much so before they become increasingly. But .... In this film, see Jerry when a submerging navy is stuck out of the submarine! O of non-SM-fold! Buster Keaton will be proud. I give a picture 7.
