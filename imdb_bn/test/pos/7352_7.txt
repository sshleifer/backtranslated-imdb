Well, "pretty good" does not scream at me, but I was surprised by the campfire tales I enjoyed. Although there is no doubt about the involvement of some of the classic directors. Scares just do not jump on you but instead the director builds steadily at the moment of the climate. The picture is based on the popular urban legends and ghost stories. The authors have rather updated stories and have revised them enough to know that the familiar ends still pack a punch. The best of the shorts is "honeymoon" and "people can leak too", I enjoyed two because they have a wonderful mystery throughout every story. "The Locket" is a good ghost story and the wrap around "The Campfire" is also very good, except they can eventually go for several twists. The only frustrating segment is the "hook" which is fine because it is pretty short. Overall, I donate 7 out of 10 out of it. It lacks most of today's horror films and is well played by Cast. It can not rate it with Halloween and Exxist, but it is a good small film that is valued with the rent price.
