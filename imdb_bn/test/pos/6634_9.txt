Very impressive aspect of the battlefield, where Vargeman's couple (well, they have different names and initial situations but the actors are the same) are found in two front crossfire. Describing the battlefield as disrespectful, high authority is often seen in miraculous photographs and Orwell draws interesting parallels of 1984, even Bergman has gradually highlighted this topic at the personal level of increasingly marital wars. That is why many fundamental and philosophical questions are relevant and essential for the marriage of Eva and the people, when threats and dangers from outer tears open a fireplace inside the interior, which was tragically closed before the past. An acute metaphor on the weak facades of the civil conference.
