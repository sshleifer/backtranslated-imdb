Before renting, I was uncertain of the film and gave assurances that Hilary Swan always gave excellent performances in her movies. He believes to have the mental impact that he believes in restraint. And he did not prove me wrong in this movie. <br /> <br /> The film also had both customizable and non-speaking customs performance. I have to sing out Jamie Bartlett and Quietel Ezifor for singing out two outstanding actors - their extraordinary performance capabilities and genuine human feeling and failure. The whole movie ran almost like a documentary. <br /> <br /> I would love to congratulate Tom Hooper for the director and Avery Bookies. Stories of multiple levels are being easily published as the editor, when the dialogues do not understand with fashion and fashion. The sequence of opening of the South African landscape suddenly ran out and I had to put a break button to hear the photograph. <br /> <br /> Why such a movie can never be nominated for international awards. It seems to hit me high rating button on all calculations. It was not just a movie that came out of racism in a country, it was a real experience. There was almost a life of poverty but it celebrated the dignity of man's soul.
