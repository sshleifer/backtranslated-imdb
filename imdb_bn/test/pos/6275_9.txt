Miles O'Faffe again feels the role of strong atre in the first series of the movie's first film. <br /> <br /> What can I say? - This mostly represents B-movie creations! <br /> <br /> This plot is ridiculous, the script is terrible, the acting is full of hammy, special effects .... It's not good! - All these movies are really fun! <br /> <br /> Ather and Thong (her lonely companion, not her underwear) are being attacked by invisible attackers in a cave (Certainly reserved for FX budget!), the most unconvincing monster serpent committed to celluloid, and what will be the battle of Ather Of course, the notorious hangliding scene! <br /> <br /> There is a question, though I have ... At the end of the film we saw a huge nuclear explosion when the concept of auto destroys the geometric nucleus (as the narrator tells us) ... how to burn in hell Will it revive alive? Is she a primer timer / explosive or fashioned in some form? <br /> <br /> Well, such an absurd ending just joins throughout the movie - they do not make it that way!
