Dangerous effects in places, however, you do not have bad eyesight or leave the effects slightly preferable until they are afraid of darkness. But most of the acting was believable and most of the effects were well done. I thought the animal looked a little more like a man in a gorilla suit for my choice. This reminds me of the original Pink Panther film.
