A teenage film about anger, friendship, loyalty and growing up ?? But it is not happy in part because of the circumstances surrounding the court and the conflict of life changes. What's happening is quite numbing, hunting and lowered cold. But I was expecting something more powerful and effective, and when I was excited and unforgettable, it was not fully excited in the emotional way. The performance is a mixed bag rational, but all of them have a cruel fidelity. Dennis Hooper and Daniel Roebuck especially amazing ?? The crispin glover overshadowed and the Kenyan Reeves' body was cut off by its custom Slacker role as a wooden shaw. Joshua Johnson is very good and so is Sky in law. Jim Metzler chimes with a brief but extremely compelling performance. The story is dramatically confronted, heroic and heroic in its last split where it infuses a lively and painful punch. JÃ¼rgen Knipper's swirling music score is simmering with anxiety, tension and wonder as morality and commitment is tested and learned.
