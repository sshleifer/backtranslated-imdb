In the comments of MaxxSpy, I agree with the most vulnerable, predominantly weak plot of modern Schubu du films and how it was predictable. But people look a nice improvement of the nurse mind, with excellent animation, honesty in Scotland. Music is good, and the plot is well thought out. Alongside, there are some great dialogues, and the voice acting was extraordinary, KG Kasem is consistently delighted as Chaggy, and a wonderful surprise among the guest performers in the role of the fantastic Scottish singer Shane Easten. Actually, my only complaint was a strange utterance among one or two members of voice cast, the exception of Easten was the true word, and the way people are not designated as Neon Monster is also possible. Overall, a solid and enjoyable Scooby Doo film. 8/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
