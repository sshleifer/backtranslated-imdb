I hate to admit it, but I did not get it to be the best of Hitcoak, yet a writing, climatic thriller. In the rebuilding of the 1934 film of the same title, Dr. Ben Mcenna (James Stewart) ?? The person who knows too much - and his wife, Joe McKenna (Doris Day), is having a holiday holidays in his son Hanna (Christopher Osleen) in Morocco, when mistakes occur in erroneous and a murder plot is caught on the web. Conspirators go to extreme lengths to refrain from interfering with their plot: They kidnap their favorite Han. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see that Doris Day, I'm usually associated with Rock Hudson comedies, he was played in Hitko. Movies. When I was watching this, I soon realized that it was more than a family movie (for example: Psycho) and he had the ability to sing "Best of the best", which he made beautiful. He was as good as himself and James Chelsea's chemistry, which helped to make the couple trustworthy. <br /> <br /> I do not believe it is better than other great directors, but it is still a lot more entertaining family thriller / mystery. There are also some best-added bonuses, which became a hit for Doris Day. Well operated, well played. A fine film.
