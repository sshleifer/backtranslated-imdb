Anyone can say about the movie "traffic" is the best thing that has attracted attention to the superior British mini series "Traffic". As many people have mentioned, the current film suffers from the fear of seizing the story of cinematographers and theatrical owners, who measure the success of a movie by selling too much food. <br /> <br /> This mini series was first shown in public TV in 1990 and it has been seen many times. The whole documentary-style series contains an accidental element and its strong element of destruction, because the letters are moving towards their last destiny. The most powerful among the three stories is that the Pakistani family forced the city to find a way to combine body and soul after burning the livestock harvested by the army for the benefit of the West Pakistani politicians. The family's problems are similar to the rickshaw pulling family of "City of Joy City". Finally the farmer finds work, but he compromises his pride and fidelity. <br /> <br /> The Pakistani part of this film deals with the fight against al-Qaeda supporters today, and some of it relates to those who are less likely to pay to those countries in support of such movement among the poorer victims of Pakistan and Afghanistan. The film creates a point that farmers will get only 25% assistance that they should encourage them to increase other crops. <br /> <br /> Americans do not see anything other than black and white matter - good boys v. Bad Guys - It's lovely to see any other black and white, gray dimension levels where others see. <br /> <br /> The original probable spoiler forward My only problem with the story was that they were going to live in real life rather than things that were as they used to be like before, as a way to imagine how they had to enter their "real boys" to come to them. Other than that, we rarely see that there was a fine part of such work. Cast was outstanding and German and Pakistani positions helped to give this film a "different" feeling (what changed Germany as something other than the villain in the WWII movie).
