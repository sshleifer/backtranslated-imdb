I have always been fascinated by the silent film. There is something about performing the performer and actress 100 years ago. With the special effects of today's high-tech special effects, I always try and imagine what it was like to see a particular movie during its original release. It helps in realizing the superstition of the early film. <br /> <br /> "The life and the life of animals Jesus Christ" was filmed in 1902, originally illustrated, but elaborated and eventually released in 1905. Imagine the continuous life of famous religious figures, divided by real title cards, and you have a beautiful idea like this movie. For example, Mary and Joseph fleeing from Egypt, sitting on the famous Spenix, near the Marine Marines, is similar to Llosa Olivier Morgan's 1879 painting "Race on the Flight to Egypt". Although some may find this "living painting" a strangely cop-out, I think they are very charming and very nostalic. <br /> <br /> Setting and Dresses Stage Production seems to be right from Christ's life. Probably and the day's emotions are broad of the game. Make up on the cast is very dramatic, so much that a close up of Jesus is almost ridiculous. Again, where others might get annoyed by their brutality, I was quite charming. <br /> <br /> Filming for 3 years, continuity is not very bad. The biggest error is the time that the welding changes are made. The character of John the Apostle and the 12-year-old Jesus is visible in the middle, the audience was very surprised! <br /> <br /> The best strange humor in the film, the birth of Jesus' scene. The child is probably seen in the hole between Mary, Mary, and Joseph, as shown. Maybe it was the frame of my mind when I saw it, but I laugh loudly! If only that baby was born !!!! To stop it, Mary acted in an actress watching the whole scene (in fact, through the whole movie), such things are done every day! My time has changed! <br /> <br /> This movie is easier than today, it's a really nice window in the past. I recommend it! <br /> <br />
