A Jewish Frodo SPOILERS? Yep, that will be Elijah Wood again. <br /> <br /> From the last part of "Ring of Link", Elias Wood like Fredo has become increasingly difficult to move away from this main role. A football ammunition, a psychotherapist and now playing a young American American, Wood has tried any route to avoid this type of casting. Now, with "everything is illuminated" he could finally achieve this. Playing a role not as basic as the other role, he really gets the spirit of his character. Yet, it is not like wood, just like wood. For the first time, Wood has got a great production to spread his wings with the help of a great adaptation of Levih Skirber and with the help of new adventurous Eugene Hughes, a remarkable performance. "All other are exposed" is a magnificent, moving movie piece. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Safran Foer (Wood), a young American Jew, my grandfather's rescue of his grandfather sets it out in Ukraine and helped he get America. Coming to the country, Jonathan is talking about all, Alex (Hutt) and his racist grandfather (Boris Leskin). During the trip to the whole country, three could gradually learn more about history and relationships, which never knew Alex and Jonathan. <br /> <br /> This is a strange feeling, when the film progresses in its second chapter (it is actually divided into four in total). The first part, sometimes a bit fun, is mostly serious and intense. So while we give a brief history of Alex and his family in the second part, from the serious to the sunny switch is a wonderful step. It does not work quite well, but with the progress of the film, it can clearly teach that the humor and sadness of this mixture will end as soon as it gets destroyed. <br /> <br /> Continuing for the highest achievement of all of the stories involved, so we started reading for more and more characters. Elise Wood is magnificent, Boris Leskin is so intense and strong that it raises questions why Hollywood has not properly noticed him. But most notable is Eugene Hutz. Playing an intensely troubled character, Hutz is absolutely bright. He shows division between his relatives and the real world with almost perfect skill and when you are in contact with his character Wood, you really connect with him deeply. Without Hughes, the story is so strong that the film will still be great, but with it it will hit the next level. <br /> <br /> For the first time, for the actor director Lieu Sherbur, the story is also a bright piece to start. Emotions are a work (Schreiber's own immigrant grandfather of America), he really manages to accept the passion of the subject, and by presenting us with some really beautiful scenery and some magnificent shots, he really handles the house hit. Especially the final half hour is so beautifully made, it is a challenge to create tears in the eyes of any viewer. This is an ongoing story, and with the help of the script, it has become more powerful. <br /> <br /> Made from love with an enthusiastic director, "Everything is light" is a beautiful part. A road story with a difference, it is played nicely and wonderfully written. This is a film that everyone should watch, and Elijah Wood is finally the right way to relax Fredo.
