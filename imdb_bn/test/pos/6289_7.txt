This is the only silly movie that you must watch. Okay, I've seen it alone, and I think I'm well-liked. I usually find tired of Shore's kind of Shore, but he is very funny in this movie. Actually, the script is quite funny, and Shore does not ruin his other actors ... what do you say to him? Mimic? However, this is a fun, ultimately forgotten film. --Frink -3
