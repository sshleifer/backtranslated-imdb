Another extraordinary Tom Wilkinson performance "Different False," a 2005 film also starred Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellows, the story of married couple James and Anne Manning, where the husband (Wilkinson) believes he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. At night they brought police near an accident near their house they had a team. It's a hit and runs that killed their maid Maggie Bassett) Husband. James is a neighbor suspect, Bill Bule (Everett) when he sees some damage to his car. He faced the bullet, who admitted that he did it and promised to go to the police the next day. When James came home, Ann became angry that he was making such a big deal and said he was driving the car. Of course, James is not so eager to look at the police. He advised that they call the bullet and tell their decision. "Oh, f___ Bule," said James. "Well, that's right," said Anne. "I am f___ing chest." This well-planned drama of James' devastation is just starting. Without a plot, how to change a story of gender switching is a good example. What I mean: Susan Smith drives her car a lake and drown her children. He lives in prison. What if the father did that? The clerks You will be surprised how many times the results are different. Here's also true - if James manages this relationship and performs the next activities, the viewers may feel different about the story. If Ann James was in the place, it would be shattering. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, involved in the accident and happy marriage - he knows what to do. Rupert Everett as a bulge is very effective - tragic, generous and finally needed. Everyone here is very civilized in their behavior with each other, and no good or bad all. <br /> <br /> There is a different lie - James that blessed his marriage, Ann listed above - and there is one united lie - the accident, which is about to silence all the groups. It's enough for Anne to know that Maggie. In the end, each individual has to deal with different lies. <br /> <br /> Bright movie.
