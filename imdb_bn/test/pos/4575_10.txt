I had a few who went from my way to see this in the theater. I often think about it frequently. After two DVD views I'm happy to hold it perfectly. Like any great comedy, I laughed at every sight, hoping for both gags, but even after catching the missed things. <br /> <br /> Mike judges make extraordinary humorous characters and they work very well with fitting in their world so they make sense. In office space, make the environment letter credible. Ediorsi's future gives him the freedom to write incredible fools and to work them. I will wait to see if they release a good DVD with some real features before buying it. But this movie deserves support for not providing the DVD in the theater.
