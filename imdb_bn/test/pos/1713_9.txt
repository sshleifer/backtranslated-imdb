I've enjoyed some of the old doctors many years ago, so when the new one comes out I have to check it out. I was very pleased - with characters, story lines, updated look, I became stupid! From season 1 to 27 (27 for old fans) from menstrual 2 (28), it just gets better. It's nicely related to old shows, though you do not know about old shows to enjoy this new version. <br /> <br /> While the cast has changed but I highly recommend the doctor who - with Chris Eccleston and David Tennant <br /> <br /> I loved that they gave so much depth to the characters. Doctor seems more weak in this series, perhaps he is the last timlord. The passion and passion of Chris and David are really great, and I feel their pain, anger and feelings of courage with them all. <br /> <br /> Billy Piper (Rose) brings a very human element for each episode, though he is more brave than me. With its talent, the delivery industry will go away.
