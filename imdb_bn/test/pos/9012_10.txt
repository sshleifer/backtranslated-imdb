I have never been forced to write a review about anything but saw such bad reviews about an innovative show that tells me something. First of all, people simply separate these different things from different and different different ones. Once you once watch an episode, it really comes back to never mind again. Origin of humor and when, some jokes carry from the movie, they are delivered fresh. Some of it's even memorable Shake - self-referential humor. This joke is targeted at many teens and original fans as younger and younger. Patrick Warburton and Arthie Kitt are both sunny, because they re-establish their role as Krok and Ijma and the nomination of their Annie Awards as well as the Creator. <br /> <br /> This show takes some time, really "Groove" "thing, so to speak. + If you ignore the terrible theme song (which does not really make a warrant on behalf of a show trial since just 30 seconds of overall content ), This show laughs-out-loudly and does not lose the empire's new Groove Spirit.
