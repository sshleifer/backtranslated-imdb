It is two Czech pilots fleeing to England to help RAF in the Battle of Brewer, who is a bright, very checkered film from Sevak's father and son, but who also comes out from a female (beautiful fitzgerald). Some excellent and incredibly realistic air war scenes feature ?? Perhaps the best and much better than Pearl Harbor or even the British Films War - and interesting common themes like love, war, romance, comradeship, harm, and slavery. Also, trials and tragedies going abroad and learning foreign languages ​​(though it's easy with the great Stanwick Anne Massacei). <br /> <br /> This movie contains some of the famous little motifs, such as the world famous RAF Bauli device, completely and at one stage, nicely reflected on black vinyl records, cutely cut around (course another theme,). Besides, all the traditional icons of English life: dimpled beer glasses (opposite straight glasses of Pearl Harbor war), tea set in an English country plant, tea (shot in the Czech Republic), mascot dog, a wine bottle of HP sauce, Even a dart board! <br /> <br /> Of course, unlike the airports and neighboring countryside anywhere in South Angel, the virtuouso aerial sequences, Eastbourne and Seven Bones, are always equal to the battles of South England and Britain. However, the best of the sensational musical instruments of the Undraudus Soukupup, one of the best versions of late Ron Goodwin, was achieved by Hendes Gimmer, as well as any of the other classic English war films that won British film of the main battle. Even have a nice little camio role for ?? Apparently ?? Famous Czech musician and actor (and Kevin Kline Lstelike), Oldrich Kaiser, who played the title theme song, Dark Blue Sky on piano. Excellent <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> Love competitor and fellow pilot Frantisek (Ondrej Vetchy) are with Susan. <br /> <br /> Another great English actor in this movie! Charles Dance is certainly fine as Wing Commander Bentley. <br /> <br /> highly recommended and well-liked / recruited ?? Get DVDs with special features (how stuff they make dog fights and stuff). Perhaps the only movie combines subtitles together with English, German, French and Czech together.
