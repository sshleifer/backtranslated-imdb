I liked this film a lot. The actor was great, especially patent, who is different in each role. Farman, who can play? And Luos, who makes things torch (he's also a talented singer - he's singing "My Truth", heard that when a character shocks the lab's stereo) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > Flick, which pays attention to its characters. It is very serious at the time, and the set design is innovative. It is very bad that they had to create a seagull, which is nowhere near the root. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The other two things are significantly notable. DVD is not dubbed, which gives a better experience to the film. Also, make sure to keep the observer after starting the final credit rolling.
