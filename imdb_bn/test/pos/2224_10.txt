This is one of Peter Celler's best films. Why is it not shown on TV or movie theater? Will it ever be released as a movie movie? Is it objectionable in medical field? I would like to see this movie again. I want to see my son, doctor who The best doctor for laughter and Peter Sellers is the best doctor for this.
