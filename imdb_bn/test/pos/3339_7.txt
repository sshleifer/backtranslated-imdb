I would like to start my review by thanking the creators of this documentary, it is probably love work and I think they have done a great job to combine an enjoyable documentary about a person who has so little information about him. <br /> <br /> I heard of Bruce Hack but I did not know much about it, and I found the reason for the frustration at the beginning of this document. Other musicians could talk about him, but Bruce Hack was kept far away from himself. I wanted to see this Bruce Hack guy !! I think the creator thought that I did not know him and the musicians of the screen, so I felt somewhat left in the dark. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < We treated with more musicians and I felt like I was told "Look - these cool musicians are in her, so she must be cool!" I do not care much about Bruce's musician's comments. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see Bruce like a person. You know, the important thing - to have more interviews with him or anyone who has worked with him. About his life, and yes, his use of medicines and other things. I would like to know more about his "Hackula" project. I wanted to get inside her mind. Even if they do some "God's Voice" commentary and pictures, it will be okay. <br /> <br /> The animations were good, but again I felt that they were used as fillers, they did not really hear me listen to his music and see some of the imagery based on the level 5 record. I think it was tricky and creative, but again ... I wanted to know more about Bruce! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The hack has forgotten the duration of the stamp until March. I'm happy that this film is about teaching the people about Bruce Hack even their flaws.
