As a veteran screenwriter author of the Richland College of Dallas, and as a former MGM Stryner author of beautiful films, I saw Dazzle Channel 33 on Sunday night and saw this great movie, where Bati White Gorgeous and created. Before starting banging all these crap out of Hollywood for really good movies one year for good old days. If a producer is listening, I would like to say that more than 60 years, we have enough, who will not be happily paying for any gun, any killings, a special effect, no sex, violence and any good movie. The story of the touch of human relations that leaves you with a good warm feeling, like this movie did for me.
