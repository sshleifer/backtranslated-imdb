Bit was an exciting movie about some young punks trying to survive in the 1980's New York. In this, fighting with other street gangs, which they try to stay straight at school, will share with the high school class, as well as local shows that engage the band looking like dead Kennedy and their band name is at the school's name. Rex (played by David Jacobson) plays an autistic child who begins to be longer with such periods and shows that the poem is really beautiful, and if it starts applying what is done in this child's life, then really things can work well ! Billy Kai (played by William McNamara) and Kate Kai (who played the role of Glover) brothers and sisters. While they roll with this crowd of cold, these kids do not have the same kind of people as this group. They care for Rex and they care for others, and really show themselves an enlightened side. When her sister was sleeping on the head of the gang, she loved Rex, trying to show her that she was not a prostitute. But in the end teachers return to school and want to keep them in the mental institution, finally it seems that the time has come to end his life, then he is played without the sound of the belved. But they think that he does not die, he only makes his life fully alive, sharks, and is happy in the sea. This movie was the movie where I was delighted that I saw it. It was extremely entertaining, it was a big message. These kids had no direction, no future, no appearance, but a problem child came, they all realized that life was the more important way to fight with local black kids. Everything is destructive. Rex showed them the beauty of angry music. Rex showed the beauty of their fat, disease and killing. Rex has shown almost all the beauty, although there is no beauty involved in some things, yet they can see that this poem speaks to the people when used in poetry. Rex played an important role in this step, who changed hearts from depression, hoped for hope, and why he started showing them; Bit.
