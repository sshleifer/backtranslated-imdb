Luis Bunuel's "Nazneen" will always be remembered as a great movie because it is absolutely honest in presenting a playful attack on religion. This is one of the most remarkable films that should be shown to all especially young people to familiarize them with good and bad, holy and evil ideas. The difficult question adopted by "Najrin" is about the power and weakness of organized religion. It has been tackled by involving ordinary people who are not on small things in their basic life. Especially sin Venus scores show us that various questions related to the differences in class are eligible for honest, honest and reliable answers. Najrin seems to be believable that a light, ridiculous vein has been created. This is the only reason why it can be said that the story of a general priest seems completely true in the life of all the audiences. How did Bunuwel look for the truth? This black and white woman was shot dead by surprise by Gabriel Figueroa, one of Luis Bunuel's favorite cameraman. Filmmaker Lalit Rao watched "Nazinine" in India's "Triveni" at the 13th International Film Festival of Kerala. "Nazneen" as part of a special package named "50 Years Ago" by the famous Indian film personality. PK Annair. This is a movie that should be with an intelligent DVD collector.
