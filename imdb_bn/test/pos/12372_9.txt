ভিক্টর Sjöstrom এর "Körkarlen" তার চলমান সময়ের বেশিরভাগ সময় ধরে দর্শকদের জীবনের নিম্নতর গভীরতার মধ্যে ফেলে দেয়, মদ্যপ হ্রাস, পারিবারিক সহিংসতা এবং আত্মঘাতী হতাশার দৃঢ় দৃশ্যের সাথে, কিন্তু সবচেয়ে স্মরণীয় অনুচ্ছেদে মৃত্যুর পৌরাণিক চিত্রটি রয়েছে। Here death is seen as a horse horse drawn car, driven by a bad sinner who was the last person dead last year's New Year's Eve. The soul of a sensible newborn will be collected for one year, and after twelve months of this terrible slavery, the driver's soul will finally be released when the last person on December 31 will be killed by the new driver. <br /> <br /> the vehicle involved in the scenery (the movie "The Phantom Carriage" or "the English-language dialogs" The phyantoma kyariyeta "known as) Cinematography by using double-exposure, which is very sophisticated for its time and is still Most of the cases seen today in effect, the car sits under the ocean to collect the soul of a drowning person. Ira's interesting, however, is the film most part, David halamera downward spiral associated with the director himself a decent living possibilities to give up on a short-represented actor acting as said. Flashback we halamake his wife, son and brother of the saikatate a happy I have enjoyed enjoying the day, and he seems completely ordinary. Cruelly, segue or without explaining, we then Holm an alcoholic as the debris to see, with the laws of the problem and his family cut off from. Naturally, before the next leap in a story-telling lack of feel like, but in this case the filmmakers about ourselves familiar Trusts to fill the sordad details. এটি প্রস্তাবিত যে হোল্ম তার প্রতারক বন্ধু জর্জেসের সাথে বিপথগামী হয়েছেন, যিনি পানীয় সঙ্গী যিনি প্রথমত ফ্যান্টম ক্যারেজের গল্পটি বর্ণনা করেছিলেন, কিন্তু তার পতনের কারণ যাই হোক না কেন হলম একটি হারিয়ে যাওয়া কারণ, <br/> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Despite her disgusting behavior, . The nurse is going to die himself - indirectly because of his ministry in favor of Holm - he wants to see him, and thus unreasonably set the speed of a chain of events will result in his recovery. <br /> <br /> This picture is similar to the use of spectacular spectators like the story of Dickens's Scrooge, which inspires deeply defective people to take stock of their life, misbehavior and reforms. I was also reminded of Szstrom's 1917 play "Terez Wigen", among which a man was able to find out his house from the prison and his family went away (a sequence reflection here). Director of "Berg-ejabhina and Han husaru" (ekee "The autalabha and His Wife", 1918) was found earlier skyandinaibhiyana lokalokera reiterated a standard theme that can not exceed a person's fate. This time, however, it may be advisable that David Holm is actually successful in depriving his seemingly inevitable fate, because he has given an unexpected second chance to correct. <br /> <br /> The visitors will be grateful to expect a glimpse of the supernatural audience, but they may not be prepared for a tragic examination of this picture of a drunken man falling into a problem. But for the intense and strong silent plays, the taste-minded people would fully appreciate "Corcenelle". It has stood in the best of its era and certainly one of the most successful works of the Sejstrum.
