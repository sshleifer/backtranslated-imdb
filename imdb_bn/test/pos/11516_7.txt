"New York Lights" originally started as an experimental two relay Vitofon short, which was finally snobbed in the first feature film. One of Dollyres Costello's most beautiful actors, Helen Kostel Hollywood and Bone (in my opinion, real beauty) thinks that all could break. Helen is best known for appearing in this beautiful film, who bought the Hollywood revolution !! <br /> <br /> Two bootlars firmly believe in trying to folks their barbers in the city of Lam on "Muin Street". Broadway Barbers Edison (Coolen Landes) and Jean (Eugene Pallet) do not realize that their sailor's shop soon made a cover for illegal bulletlogging operations. They quickly realized and they felt sorry for the day they were going to their small town. That's the only thing Eddie's mother lends to them and they want to return it harder. Eddie Catty Lewis (Helen Costello) became well-acquainted with her home town at Broadway. Kitty "Huawei" is worried about Miller (Wheeler O'Connaman) who is always hanging around him, but Eddie feels mercilessly that he is already supernaturally as "Haq" that he has a girlfriend Molly (Gladys Brockwell) but to assure him he A little handgun gave the unwanted admirers scared away. "Hawk", who killed a police officer and stopped "feds", decided to make edi frames. Meanwhile, Molly is getting excited about her "hacks" treatment and after a showdown where she tells him that she is not after chicken and for the old chicken stage - Murray !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> Besides talking to gangster and shoggers as well as their best lecture, this is not entirely horrific and it is also happening in the 1930s. Gladys Brockwell (if a trimmer melodramatic) and Eugene Palette (quite natural) were ok and cast most seasonal actors. John or Athel Barrymore - Coolen Landis and Helen Costello soon came back to the obscurity that could not be seen. I did not notice most of the "hidden mikes" - where people had to sit on a couch before engaging in various conversations, telephones or conversations. Those who saw this in the movie probably began to think that all the police talked about this flat monoton as the trend was running in many initial conversations such as "Little Caesar" (1930). In 1928 some singing and dancing - perhaps in some cases they were probably bizarre by the whole novelty of the whole penny. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
