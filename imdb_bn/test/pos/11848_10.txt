I paid attention and enjoyed the rich expressions of major actress Julian Nicholson. I do not have the word to describe how enchanted it was. All actors and actresses have played well. In particular, I noticed a strong good character who was consistent with the future forecast - Karl had played Andy Richard I like the idea of ​​showing a variety of friends and relatives with different opinions, and different suggestions meetings, like the real world. J. Mohar, who played the future husband Ed, was also very practical. But, I want to emphasize again that the very rich expression reporter, which Julian Nicholson was naturally capable of, and naturally, was forcing me. In fact, the matter that handles this film makes me feel very important and touches strong people's strong ideas. I saw this movie several times and did not bother. It raised my thoughts again and again.
