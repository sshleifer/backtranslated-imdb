Mrs. and Mr. After Aire, it is another great movie from Aparna Sen (mostly in English). In the previous film, he treated his influence on contemporary political environment and people. In this picture it is the emotionally disabled family of the family and its impact on the family. As a parallel sub-theme he treats a philosophical concept of "reality". This is a movie which is considered after watching the film. <br /> <br /> The little sister Mithi (Aparna Sen's daughter Sena Sharma), elder sister Anjali (Shabana Ajmi) from Schizophrenia. After getting married to Jojo and being separated from her, Mithi believes that she is still with JOJO and her five children at 15 Park Avenue in Calcutta. (There is no such address in Kolkata-it seems to be in New York) and he strongly believes in it. It is almost like an intense religious belief. What is the reality finally? In one scene, he told Anjali, "If I tell you that you are not a professor, only imagine that you are a professor". The open ended reflects this reality. Motiur lost his house in Park Avenue At the last minute, Mithi watched a group of five kids and looked at them with the joy of returning to his family and then he was lost. Regarding this idea of ​​reality, I recall Harry's second film with James Stuart. The hero believes that a large rabbit named Harry (?) Is always with him and he always talks to her. Eventually the doctor believes that probably Harry has. What is the reality, the playwright does not believe or does anyone else believe that Shawna Ajmi is determined to be firm in her strong performance and is conscientiously sympathetic. Kanakana Sen Sharma gives equally effective performance as schizophrenic. <br /> <br /> Still the film is Mrs. and Mr. Not as strong as Aire. There appears to be some loose ends. And probably there are many letters. Those who want to end a closed end here may not be grateful here. But enjoy the theme of the last movie. <br /> <br /> Another good picture of Apon Sen
