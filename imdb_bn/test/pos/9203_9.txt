I was surprised to know that hostage ears left the show, did anyone know? I consider James to be the best of all time and he is surprised that he has ended on TV, which can be better than what you see on the Big Screen. Stories are sticky and fast cameras faster than bullets! Do not forget the rest of the cast: James, VENESA (Yay!) Nikki, Molly, Josh, Mitch. Also, can anyone tell me why there is a shabby theme tune in DVD sets on the globe, but a little less conversation on Avx's JXL Remix Primitive NBC Broadcast Is used ?? You do not have to understand what kind of tune you use across America's gambling McKay for DVD releases ??
