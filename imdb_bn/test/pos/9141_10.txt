With some wine, some friends and some good humor, I had a great time watching this film. I used to enjoy acting especially as Jillon Ghaiyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy ("Randy"), who like pants! Charity Ramar ("Michelle") her scenes were wildly fun. I do not want him to come to me, but he tried to score with "Mandel" and it was great to see "Randy" to see even better results! Of course, the girls of the movie are very fun to see. And, a friend of mine showed me the playboy issue, which showed Pillar Lestra as a player of the month. He definitely has a look. After all, this film has fully served its purpose, which was to entertain us on a light and caring way.
