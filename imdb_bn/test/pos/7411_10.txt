The formula of "Pharaoh's army" defies. Instead of selling for clips and big stars, it depends on a strong cast, excellent written script power and excellent acting from an impressive and bitter tale. The result is a raw and realistic movie that runs fast with a quick mental present. One of the best I've seen about the civil war, and I think it can give it to the pleasure of an independent film (if you like this movie then try to see the same bright Indie Civil War film "Wide Spring" as well). <br /> <br /> "Pharaoh" only tells the real story of a small expedition / phase team of Yunus who travels to the Confederate firm, but is trapped there due to the accident. One of the men Tension broil and relationship is created and broken. Nothing happened to how Hollywood would write; This movie comes from someone who actually talks about quality films and history. Removing remarkable dialogue and plot exposition with a movie that is very professional, but often you do not seem to see a movie, even listening to a story. <br /> <br /> This image shows the incredible variety of incredible Chris Cooper's performance, which explores his role. He is transformed, but the height of credibility is always easy to relate and mentally. Patricia Clarkson has played equally that many actresses will gradually decrease. With Cooper's character, he shares an interesting chemistry and where it is more serious than letters, it is still easier to identify. The rest of the cast is quite skilled, and well meets their role. <br /> <br /> Industrial design and set is wonderful, and personally I love cinematography. It all remembers the camera with strong contrasts and shadows and metallic metallic presenter cameras, but always keeps the physical appearance of the physiological setting. They seem to be using natural light, but whatever they do nicely works. Looks like everything looks like it's time, which I feel is rare in American time movies. Actors acted in the 19th century, not like the old clothes of the 20th century. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film is very personal. I think that as Andy it can afford. The film uniquely creates the relationships and personality of these characters and searches and is almost shameless with the non-secular scripts, and it increases in such a bad situation. It does not fail throughout its point, and these days it's pointless, without the usual and unused techniques used in all war movies. It's brave. It is not all CGI, big stars and hoop skirts of civil war that depend on its character, a fantastic script, human passion, and cold hard truth.
