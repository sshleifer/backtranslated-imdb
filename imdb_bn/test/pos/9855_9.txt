This is a crazy movie! It lasts for 12 (!) Hours and you can not understand who these people are and what they are doing! About a bunch of stupid actors trying to bring the original plot "Prometheus" to the scene, but there are many sub-plots, the disappearance of Thomas and a madman in search of the Word of God. What does this mean?
