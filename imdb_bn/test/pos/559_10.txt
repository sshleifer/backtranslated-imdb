I have seen this picture in HBO last night and do not expect to get hooked - when I see HBO, then fall asleep. But it happened and you too will be too. This is a tragic documentary (2002 Oscar winner), murder of an adult female tourist in Florida Jacksonville, and the subsequent investigation, arrest, and murder of the 15-year-old boy. See this movie today and get a feeling of how we progress as a society. This movie was worthy of a respected Oscar - you will be moved to tears.
