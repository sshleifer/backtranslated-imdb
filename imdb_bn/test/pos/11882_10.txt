If this movie worked better in the movie of the first film of this movie, it is a low-budget movie that is only shown on two (2) screens. Why it seems to be unsuccessful because it is a movie of the last crew and it is so low budget that the director has made the whole film with his pocket money. Anyway, I like this movie, I compare it to most of the third movie (which was bad). There is more serious sound in Critters 4, the first half of the movie (in addition to even a single crytrack), you got scary feeling of it, very bad they do not "make milk" crystals, that means if they were only two (2) dolls they still Can use on-screen Criters also have different deaths in this movie, especially in which it ends with a particularly frozen Critter. There is a promotion in this section of the wig and this is different from the movie which took me by surprise. Finally I like it because it has some conclusions in the series, so at least we will not see Criteria 5 now. Oh, one last thing, I missed a scene from this movie, we have never seen a writer drawing a spike on his back, probably this was not the feature of the doll, but I was not very frustrated (at Critters 3 we see Spike shooting a lot, The only good thing I liked about that movie was).
