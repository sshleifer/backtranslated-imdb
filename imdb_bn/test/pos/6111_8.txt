"Pink Flimings" was revolutionary for his time, and even today it is also hard to see. I did not enjoy the film that it is not pleasant; But it is very annoying and Johah Waters can go as far as the envelope. The story is concerned about Babes Johnson, the life of the painful women. She lived in a trailer with her son cracker and daughter cotton. Do not mention excess weight that is obsessed with eggs and sleep in a heap. Then Connie and Raymond Marble, who are jealous of Babs of two messy distortions. They wanted him to survive a painful person. This means that their mobiles kidnapped the abducting woman and sold the couple to lesbian couples, shocked the public, and even sent a Turkish mail to the father. Dad struggles to prove the deadliest person alive. Which includes even brutality, murder and eating dogs strap and other ill sex acts. This is a movie which is fun for the whole family. (Well depends on where you live?) "Pink Flamingos" see, but do not forget your Burf bag. For more contrast, the strange sex and physical functions also see "Sweet Movie".
