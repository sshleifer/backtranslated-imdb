One of the great things about The Best Years of Non-Livis is that although it strongly identifies itself in the second world of World War II, the issues that talk about today are as true today as they were in the VE or VJ day of 1945. How to reinstate war criminals as old as the written history of our planet. <br /> <br /> And we often do not learn from history, we can be grateful that once we learn from America what happened to the veterans after World War II. The GI Bill of Rights has been mentioned in The Best Years of a Live in the East, probably the greatest part of the last century's social laws. Veterans like Frederick March, Dana Andrews and Harald Russell like you see here, as well as many veterans enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> These three actors played archipelago veterans, who can detect characters with each of the states in the United States. They all saw an army transport plane flying in the city's home town, Boone City, Iowa. <br /> <br /> There is a great level of war class and differences. Bank employee Marches, Soda Jarac Andrews and high school football star Russell probably will not be able to meet in a small town like City of Boone, even in real life. But they are combined and the force forces the continuous bonds which can never be broken. <br /> <br /> March is the oldest, two sons and the perfect wife of Hollywood, Mirna Loy. He settles first and best. He has some wonderful scenes, he is drunk while drunk, and then he has some wine. The bank officials call at an evening meal in an uncertain position. <br /> <br /> I also love her scene, another returning veterans, sharecroppers want to get bank loans for their own land. He has heard pitch for people in March's expression. You can feel him the human spirit. She received her second best actor Oscar for this film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " He gave Oscar a special recognition for his performances. For him, it was probably impossible to nominate him in the supporting actor's section. Her performance, especially Katie O'Donnell has been described as acting as her boyfriend or not with her hand to her, that could be anything of her. <br /> <br /> Dan Andrews, the only officer of the Army Air Force's bomb blast He probably lived in their group. He came from the most poor background of the party and he was an officer of the uniform and a gentleman. Check that uniform and those who are interested in monthly appointment, Virginia Mayo interested in being interested enough to marry her. The problem is that, as a civilian citizen, he is quite small in his eyes. <br /> <br /> While making a fool with Mayo Steve Kocaran, Marcha is very fortunate enough to have her daughter Teresa Wright's interest. They were the main story of the film, Andrews adjusted the civilian living and he married the wrong woman. Not all problems with GI Bill have been solved. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I guess its role as a wife is similar to those of patented stereotypical wife in MGM Was there. As still the mother of Marriage and Right as her mother, she hangs together that family that fingers really. <br /> <br /> The best life won the best picture for Sam Goldwyn, William Wyler for his life and the best picture for a few, along with the other two actors got it. This was a critical and popular success, probably the best movie Sam Goldwin. This is a favorite and chronic classic and it has been for centuries now. It's about three hours long, but your interest will never get lost. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < In his memoirs, he said that he was disappointed to skunk the Oscars in that year, but his friend and fellow William Wyler created such a wonderful essay which he deserved for every award he could get for him. <br /> <br /> The way the film was hoping Capra was a wonderful life. Bit years of our lives can not get better praise than that.
