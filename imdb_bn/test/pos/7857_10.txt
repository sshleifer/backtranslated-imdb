This movie does not seem to be what it is. Clint Eastwood is not a Dirty Harry or "Cowboy" here. The appeal of the film comes from its manipulation of its atmosphere and theme carefully. It happens inside a house adopted by the Gothic story set of civil war and the "action" of all such movies, or its lack, all ages and southern bells of size. <br /> <br /> From the horror, Clint Eastwood is watching the whole story with the character's eyes. Truly a real "scary" experience by traveling around the house and capturing women. And who's "suffering" right here? What are the women suffering from the incredible look of Eastwood? We are confused by both viewers, its sexual attraction and potentially dishonest sex, it unleashes it? Or "confiscation" of what the director has to say here - are we being transferred to a small place only (perhaps) to go to us? Don Siegel is one of the most memorable and annoying films I've been seeing in seeing.
