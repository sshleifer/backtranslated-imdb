I am surprised by how good the movie was. Whether you're a gore fan or a mystery fan; You'll love this I used to dislike the horror movie, consider them stupid. But, however, this happens, I make exceptions. I find something really amazing in this movie. Very rarely I have seen a movie that scared me, but I'm telling you the truth that this film has thrown me under my throat. Contrary to most horror films, thinking about developing this single character. I highly recommend this photo, and I'm glad Asylum is finally bringing good movies to these days <br /> <br /> I recommend! Enjoy!
