Andreas arrives in a strange town. He does not think where he came from and how he went there. He is ordered to reach work, and the city gets its own apartment. All his colleagues are nice and humble to him, they are high and laugh when they pass by him. But then on Undersas it is seen that the city seems to be not happy. While going from work to home, he dressed some people with a gray suit, cleansing the bloody mess of the corpse, apparently a suicidal person who threw himself out of the window. The process is done with a quiet mind, as if they were empty of a trashcan. The next day, Andr√©s meets suicide victims in a completely alive way. More Underseas discover the city's unhappy environment. <br /> <br /> Danny Bresmond Mannan I could have seen the best Norwegian movie. Original, artistic directives are usually missing in Norwegian movies, with a few exceptions. This plot is very original, and even post-modern can be called horror, because this movie represents the terrible thought of dealing with a world that is totally stupid. And the more money you try to fill your life in this city, the more meaningless it is. How the director is managed to create feelings of an isolated universe, a nightmare, which you can not just escape with death. See it, it's really valuable! I got it 9 out of 9
