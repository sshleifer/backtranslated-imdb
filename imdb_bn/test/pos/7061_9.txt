This movie always reminds me of what I think like summer, God! Such a long time ago. Throughout the Canoe procession, the whole scene is "valuable overnight" and Triptor's homicidal maniac story is about urban youth from my youth. A very entertaining movie, followed by awesome sequels are many times good.
