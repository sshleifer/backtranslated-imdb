This is definitely a movie that will make you think about everyday everyday struggles that a person can go every day. Great acting plays two main roles giving it more examples and you will not be sorry to see this movie in any way. <br /> <br /> It is a heartwarming story of two new friends which is seen in everyday life as a wheelchair seat. Their friendships are tested, as well as their spirits when they get their own flat outside the nursing home. <br /> <br /> I recommend everybody who loves this photo for friends or just want to see a wonderful and heartwarming movie that steals clear of all clich√©s and pitfalls and never gets soggy.
