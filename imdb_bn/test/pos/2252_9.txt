I went to see this because I have some friends in Ukraine. But the film was hoping for me to smile on border comedy and heavy weight (the strange use of Alex's English) that turned me into a perfect blend. I like the range. It wants to jog me in an old car and hit the road for Ukraine. Alex (hutz) perfectly plays his guided part and Elijah Woods' poker offers a great counterpoint to face sincerity. The film shows the positive aspects of humanity when the plaques of different cultures can bond and feel the right situation when they feel the sincerity of the situation, even when they enter it with the former concepts and ancestors and how it opens the gateway deeply. There are so many in this movie.
