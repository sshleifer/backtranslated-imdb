Since Star Wars Episode 3 I have not seen a lot of people outside of the theater. Both shows sold, and for good reason. Skyming Maine the Man with the Gakes is the best movie to meet with the gentleman. (Hey, I'm a Dark.) <br /> <br /> Bruce Campbell was present and the entire crowd was in touch! Chess was the best possible way. It could be funny pictures that have made Bruce. Ted Raimi steals his Bulgarian hip-hop hip-eutud and jani face expression, he laughs riot! Who knows that Ted could rap? <br /> <br /> I changed my mind, the person who stole it was actually a robot. There is nothing funny than robot ... Robots are doing. <br /> <br /> For Bruce's performance: "I'm the 5th." Thanks Bruce Thanks for staying calm, thanks for taking time, thanks for all the fun.
