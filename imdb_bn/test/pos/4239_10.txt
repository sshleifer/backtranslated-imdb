Great movie! In the shiny a movie, by far the most fun character. Jennifer Tilly (Tiffani) makes this movie even better! Tifany died before Chaky's death and he was together. But ten years later, Tiffany got back the wheel (as a doll) and made him alive again. It was a great movie! Awesome and definetly funny (only because Chucky!) 10/10
