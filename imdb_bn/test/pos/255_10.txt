The 08th Ms Team showcases two optimistic romantic features from different aspects of the conflict. Geoan officer Aina and the Federal Forces's new pilot meet in a battle of Shiraz Space, while their love disputes between each other during the 12 episode series (and a "movie") while trying to conflict with the two debates. That war surrounds them. It features a romio and Juliet romance and unexpected animations. American shores hit one up to the best. Suits up!
