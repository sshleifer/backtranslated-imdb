Not quite sure how I stumbled in this movie, but I'm very happy. Initially, we had kept this title aside, but my Deluxe Mex also enjoyed this photo (especially on weekends) even if you hate to read. The way I script is fantastic and distributed in such a way of dead-pan just add puddles of pee on my sofa. Not entirely sure that it is very interesting to local Danish, although the comedy seems to have been enhanced by the lack of subtitles and the ambiguity of the translation. I have seen many Danish films (or any other matter), but by judging this film, I guess they are not limited by political stability in the same place (the blessing of the throne) which gives a breath to Eagle's character. Fresh air, because it is fun to face it's special requirement funny There is so much a great one-liner in this movie that shocked the American citizens.
