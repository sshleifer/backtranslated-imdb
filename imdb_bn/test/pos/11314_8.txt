Before looking at this picture I was quite suspicious, I do not like movies with an agenda and I am not afraid to think like a writer. I was afraid that it would be like a small series of 2-Party "10.4", which is a far-sighted, little relationship with the real world and very poor execution In the beginning, it says: "This film is fiction, but events are illustrated and based on extensive research on information about emergency plans in the UK". And the general feeling is that you are not selling an idea, but you are being taught a lesson in citizen awareness. The message that is being published is clear from the beginning: It's coming and we're not ready. The use of real spaces and a scenario that might not just be - there are plans to do this - adding all the interstitial effects of the movie, even the most reprehensible to the audience. The point of view of the film is away from the society and it is away from the heart-separated personal moments, which will not release the message, so we are not using any of the Romeo-Juliet plays.
