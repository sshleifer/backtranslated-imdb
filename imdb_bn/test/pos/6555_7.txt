A girl begins to notice that the people in her small town are being fascinated by something in a spiral-like shape. Early, the charm returns to emotion and things get fatal. Although I would not say that "Uzumaki" was an extraordinary movie, I would say it was different from what it had seen before. On seeing me, I felt I was watching cartoons. Have fun segues between scenes and characters with digitally improved eyes. Later, I found that this movie is an adaptation of the manga comic, so it means. However, when you think you are watching something that can be a children's movie, you are bombarded with the nasty and minor scenes! The story is often short and the last is a bit sudden and seems to be anti-climatic at that time, but in retrograde I appreciate more about its originality. My rating: 7/10
