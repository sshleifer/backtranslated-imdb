I am not American, But meatball still hits me. Maybe it's because of a sweet, sweet movie. Seeing it again makes me feel emotionally, I do not really put my finger on it and a place I can not remember. <br /> <br /> Meatballs are just a great movie. It reminds me of innocent days when things are really hard to measure and some are not possible. <br /> <br /> If you read it, I probably know what you know. <br /> <br /> I can say above all that what I said earlier is that if you are American then the meatballs will be more nostalic. <br /> <br /> I think you know what I mean to me.
