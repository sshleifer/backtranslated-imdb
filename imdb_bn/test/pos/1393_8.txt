I saw this movie as a scam on television and liked it. I've heard an interesting story about this picture. When Roger gradually left the drive-e in the summer of 1981, his trailer division sent an advance trailer which was not actually footage of the film. It was a naked woman being footed around a laboratory set by a giant woman. During the opening of the movie in Drive-In, the annoying customers complained that they could not see the movie shown. Theater owners called Corman and said their customers felt ripped off. So Karamen had to close the footage of the footage, and theater owners had to send positive films to the film. Since footage film was never a negative part, it did not appear on any video, DVD or television broadcast. Has anyone ever seen this footage? In the summer of 1981, do you remember anyone who saw this movie in a driving?
