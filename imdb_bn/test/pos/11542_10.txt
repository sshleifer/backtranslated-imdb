This documentary about Bill Hicks's life and comedy shows Hits "publication" and other stand-up gigs bits. Interview with colleague curiosity and artists and journalists and journalists discussed how his political commentation was raw and brutal. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed it a lot. I've already seen "publisher" but the comedy clips are still fresh. This is a wonderful balance of comedy and documentary, which will explain the popularity of Hicks to non-fans and please those who are already familiar with it. <br /> <br /> I gave it ten rates.
