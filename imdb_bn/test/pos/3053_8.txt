Please be aware that this movie has nothing to do with Radio City Music Hall! Again as an archaeologist: Music Hall .. I know what is the connection between New York and Venezuela. Theodore of the film is simply "Music Hall" There are no rockettes film. Just amazing ice skaters plus superb actors and fun. Just thought you want to know. Really a wonderful film. Do not guess who you are 'murderers' while watching this picture .... in the end What a fantastic plot and beautiful ice skating. One does not look at the kind of performance. In the New York City Roxy Theater and theater, there were ice skating performances gradually!
