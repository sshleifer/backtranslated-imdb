I think this is the first time I saw a rosso 'fatty' orbital movie. I really liked him (title) as the role of a Butcher Butcher. The way he is going, it is very interesting in my opinion, for example how he handles his knife and it's like cigarette. I think he is a good actor; The expression of his face really he is suited to the role of role, for example how he winks the last audience. But one could add that was probably not too difficult. Anyway I think he had to deserve a long career. You probably know that it has been destroyed by greedy journalists who have made money by earning money by printing false allegations that he was involved in a scandal. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This plot is not very important. Shop and opponent employees for the fame of the first half, fatty acoustic and almondin. After heavy food warfare, Almondin was sent to school by the owners of her father's shop. (This is the beginning of the second half). Both fatty and alum enters school in school, and the fight for Almondine continues. (Some of the characters I saw were different in version. It seems that they replaced the original title cards with something new.) <br /> <br /> There are many fun songs including food fights and pratfalls, but they are doing well in my opinion. And some gags I really liked, for example, how do they run chili pepper (or is it a coffee match?), Or when the scene gives a coat of fatty ache but the scene is not inevitable, or when Miss Thechem, girls' school head, fatty spanks, and She spanks her behind. <br /> <br /> Buster Keaton is also its first, movie, it's funny! Cast is a good addition. In the first half, he is a customer in the store, in the second half, he supports Alum in Alumin's war. I like his acrobatics, for example, when the fatty shocks him from one room to another in school, he does not easily trick but gives the land on his hands and head and pirate a little. For a scene of food fight see: Alum throws a flour bag near him, but instead hits the store owner. That makes Buster laugh, which should be a rare one because he usually naturally shows a neutral expression (which - perhaps you probably already know - his nickname "The Great Stone Face"). (One more note: Alc John was the 'Fatty' Arbakal nephew playing Alum and later he became famous for the role of 'Fazi', which he played in many western areas.) <br /> <br /> I I do not like it as much as I like, for example, 'one week' and 'the balloonatic' (movies that were later made without 'fatty'). And it did not let me laugh loudly - but it gives me a lot of laughter, so I gave it 8 points.
