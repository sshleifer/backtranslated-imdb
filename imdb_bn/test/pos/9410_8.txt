Without all the cute people around the real character, I actually saw it based on the real facts of life, I must say that I am fascinated. "Greenwich Murders" is an average of average production for a made TV movie - acting together cool, Christopher Melonie, especially stand-out acting and teen performers excel in tough roles. The concept of a dead girl is a gifted genius that can make the film look good only. The script is essentially a cover for the movie of the week and for example cinematography.
