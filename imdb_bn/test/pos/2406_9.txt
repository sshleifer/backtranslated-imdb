I wish the series did not end so early. Although acting can not be the world's greatest, it ends up on positive notes and educates the morality and value to the audience. Hillary Swank did a good job of depicting a high school girl who lost her parents, etc. Miyagi was great as before !! If you are not happy, this movie is not for you as before the series 3. On this day, where we live, we can not see enough of the poor people who deserve it and good boys are at the top. The Bible teaches that the good will always win over evil. That just happens in this one. This is a great family movie. If you have not already, please see it.
