This is my favorite Hal Hartley movie. All her movies are small gems. I love independent movies and I hope Hal Hartley never sells in the mainstream. If the Lord Jesus came back and loved his people so much that he could not open the final book and destroy the unbelievers? Pew J. I was very nice watching Harvey movie because I am a fan of his music. If you do not watch this if Cookie Cutter is a fan of Hollywood movies, you will be disappointed.
