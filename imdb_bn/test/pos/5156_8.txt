You can not really stigmatize Ray Anderson, (6 films in 37 years). No, you can accuse him of being conventional; He does not 'go ahead', at least when it comes to the story. "You, The Living", his first film in seven years, a guest documentary, which is not being done a lot of letters, and if it is closed, I assure you that it is not. This is a fun, accessible and amazing warm-hearted movie that we usually move on to the screen to remove a slice of off-life. <br /> <br /> Certainly, 'Slice-off-life' is not the case with most people's lives, it's probably the right monkey to be applied to this film. Screen incidents are almost horribly intensely from the general public, and letters can spread, sometimes they are never seen, others become worried about getting approved, Andresen gives them all kind of affectionate affection. . That is, and some rolling music, we spend the time with them to ensure the time is well spent.
