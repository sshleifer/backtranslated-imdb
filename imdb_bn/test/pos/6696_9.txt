As most of the best movies and series, I accidentally stumbled across this. It was late, there was a whole storm outside the storm and when I was in front of a channel I was sitting on the sofa, which was meant to show episodes. I wanted to wait for a few minutes waiting for ads to end on another channel before returning to some or other sitcom. About a year and a half, I remembered my firmness and was so happy that I did not do it. I'm sure I saw all the other episodes. <br /> <br /> I have seen him, John Hannah is very bright in almost everything and he is not disappointed here. The other other cast members do a lot of starlar work. My personal favorite (except for the course of John Hannah) Gerard Murphy. <br /> <br /> The only negative side of the series is the limited number of episodes. Just 8 JH and extra 1 with somebody else I want to see MacCall again on the screen, though I have to stay with JH!
