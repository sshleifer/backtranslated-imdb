"A minute to Priya, a second to die" is a quality goat a tough cast in the West and an interesting story It is nicely illustrated with a relatively high production value for a film of this genre. <br /> <br /> Alex Cord has done a terrible job by illustrating Craig McCord, who is experiencing increasingly weaknesses. He has apologized before his enemies come before him, but when he asks him, he becomes better for himself. Robert Ryan delivers the best performance of the film as New Mexico Governor. Mario Braga and Arthur Kennedy are awesome here <br /> <br /> This movie is very good, but it is not standing near me, which is one of Spaghetti Westerns. It's great to have a lot of styling in the same league that looks great. It has some cool spaghetti overtones, but overall it is somewhat more like an American Western. This is especially clear on the music scene, which is generally okay with movies, but the miserable by the euro-Western standards. Music from the soundtrack type "Unforgiven" reminds me. Although there is a funny story, it has been said in a way that is very common for my taste. If the western fan of the spaghetti and the western fan of a Hollywood movie is to be shown together, it will be the perfect compromise. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I enjoy watching it too. I said, this is a very good movie and I recommend it to anyone who likes western, spaghetti or otherwise.
