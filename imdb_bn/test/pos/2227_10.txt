I have seen this movie since 1972 and I still remember this one of my favorite movies all the time. If I'm in the DVD, I'll buy a copy and it's not too bad. You will think that Peter Vendors will bring something that is played back. "There Is Being" and much better as the Pinky Panther series. Ushaki Digard was a small part of this kind of acclaimed actress. He is the bonus of this movie. I think the medical field will not appreciate this movie because it really makes the profession fun and it also makes one appreciate that the vendors were never available to treat them, as well as analyzed the urine samples as well as their beds.
