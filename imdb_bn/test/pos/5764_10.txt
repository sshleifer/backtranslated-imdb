It could not be the Oscar material, but it was a very funny picture. I was always a fan of Eddie (Edmunds) and Richie (Mayl). "Bottom" and "Young Ones" were the legendary TV series, and almost the time they made a film. Some materials, such as from pencils to rubber-pants, are bright, as well as Richie said that when she falls and a candle that carries her, that notorious line He told the AD, "candle in the Eye, Mandel in the Eye", and Eddie, who was available, he gave the stick his carrying candles. When Eddie is in his motorbike he can not forget it, and he must urinate .... It was a great comedy, not taken seriously, but the film lacked a ridiculous end. <br /> <br /> Overall, a superb comedy, full of smiles, and plenty of fluffy green vomit. A 9/10 <br /> <br />
