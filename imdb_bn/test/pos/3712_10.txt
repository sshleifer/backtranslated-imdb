A beautiful photograph and paced minimal film. During and after Perve Harber this time and most of the time feel the feeling of this family. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the visual appearance of the film - natural and poetic together. Great job by a great DP, David Boyd. <br /> <br /> Although a family film, the story does not become a maudlin or saccharin. We understand that the motivation to inspire the young boy in his campaign I understand the love of the younger brother for his elder brother and why he does not question him for doing what he does. I understand that he was driven by a deep relationship with his brother during this crisis. The baby is tough, and Jonathan Fur's performance is as wonderful as the experience of Ron Perlin.
