Best of all, so bad- it's a good movie ever made. Rudi Ray Moore is my personal hero While walking down the street or living under the block, I can always keep an eye on him with inspiration and guidance. Blackplumbing comes, Rudy's people Nobody does not mean Watch Dlmeite, he and all his daughters, killers of Kung Fu. Big and Willy Green submerged. Great plot, is not it? There are so many one-liners that require multiple views to improve your vocabulary. If you say a few lines from Dolmate, you are immediately calm. You are the mood for laughter riot, rent this movie. Also the Son of God in Human Tornado, Disco Godfather and Pete Gastroro See. Now, can you dig that? <br /> <br /> "You're unsafe, without any business, eating rats, sours!"
