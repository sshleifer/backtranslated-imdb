Considering all the jokes about the military situation in history, one must be the first one. Someone could make a case that Charlie Chaplin invented this discovery in his shoulder arms. <br /> <br /> It was difficult to believe that it was the bold step to go back. When you consider that some of the best films related to people like Bob Hope, Abbott and Costello, Lorel and Hardy were involved in military jobs and created during the war, something that you have accepted and smiled. <br /> <br /> In the First World War, Chaplin went on a bond tour with co-star Douglas Fairbank and Mary Pickford. He was a great supporter of the Friendly Party, unusual for his left wing scene. It will be considered simply natural that the tramp will be drafted and unfortunately it will almost disrespect and destroy everyone. <br /> <br /> You can see many things in World War II service comedy. Shoulder arms Chaplin had no other reminder because the war ended within weeks of the release of the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest talents of the comedy industry was established in the form of comedy art.
