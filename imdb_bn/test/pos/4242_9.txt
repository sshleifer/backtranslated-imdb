Chuckie ("Kids Play" and "Cippy Siegel" killer dolls) have died. But his ex-girlfriend Tifani (Jennifer Tilly) finds her remains and (using "Bhoomoo for Dummies") revives her. Then, by the circumstances, it becomes very difficult, he dies and inserts his soul into another puppet! Together they fall in love and kidnap a nice couple (Nick Stabil, Katherine Higel) to take a tranquility to get to the couch's coffin to recreate the real people of Chuck and Tiffany. <br /> <br /> sounds better than I was expecting the worst after the last two signals from "Children's Play" (which was both terrible), but it was really fun. The film does not take itself seriously for a second (seriously - how can it?) And the line and the situation are really interesting. Also, some of the important figures have been murdered to satisfy our fearsome fans and the film never runs. The film is usually a few things that are not available in a horror movie - a gay best friend (Gordon Michael Ullet) who did not play for intelligent and humorous and closed his shirt to show his muscle body in Stabell. John Ritter has a very nice Camio as a Sheriff. <br /> <br /> Good acting - fixed young, very handsome and favorite; Higgel does not have much to do but pulls it up and is like a sunny day like Brad Derrief (Chaky Voices) and Tilly Killer Puppets. My favorite part is when dolls are sex (do not ask) and she asks Rubber and she responds, "But I made rubber!" Special effects are good (there is no shy CGI here) and it is one of the few horror movies to mix humor and violence in an entertaining way. See good prices I give it a 9.
