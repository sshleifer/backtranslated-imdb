After all these years, why am I surprised by the name of Brown's West (West Coast) family or a very famous comic star in July. She is one of the most fun women on the planet. In this brutality, he likes Madonna who is one of his favorite goals. He had Meduza, a very successful singer, like Madonna, who had to be a "true or courageous" documentary. Julie Brown widespread Madonna like Madonna from Madonna, from Wisconsin, Dyer and Beer. I think the segment there where he went to Wisconsin to see his family and tomb. I do not remember if it was a parent or her pet. I think some have said that Meduza did nothing original. She is just copying others. I hope this clear documentary is available on DVD somewhere. Julie Brown was spoofing her best and spoofing others.
