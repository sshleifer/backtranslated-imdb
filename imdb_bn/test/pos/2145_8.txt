I do not know why this movie was so hostile after the first release. Of course, it is too much and somewhat unrealistic in the imagery of sexuality and violence, but these are many well-known films. I do not seriously think that those who hated "the Gates of Heaven" really understood it. "Hein's Gate" is a vulnerable form of "Die Hunter", much like an insecure and dangerous life (such as Yoming's immigrants and Averril) and with ease and privilege (like real Americans) "in Wyoming and Averil between the attempt and the fables. Life is painful but it can be aggressive despite opposition to brutal life. Also, Michael Simino is historically correct picture Tried to create a lot of pain, it is interesting as a document of the American life of Old West Wyoming (and possibly the complaint). The dialogue is often true, clever and emotional, with great music and cinematography, the film acts as the real poetic work of the industry, "The Gate of Heaven", because of refusing to sponsor the audience, not for all taste. Liud out every year so many commercial draws that it is very easy to dismiss as a blind eye candy (even an example of it being Blockbuster) even the "Gate" and the Simino are really worth the respect. Everyone should see at least one continuous version and then have their own To create a mind <br /> <br />
