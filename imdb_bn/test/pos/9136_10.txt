I decided to write a comment on this amazing movie because here IMDB mentions that John Medieval director, who made some good films in pre-American years, but completely destroyed his fame by making him the latest in American film. It's a plan to rebuild. Well, here are some of the reasons for this to be a reinstatement of stupid ideas: The film's plot is simple and even clipped by today's standards, but it does make an excellent compilation of the film's performance by four leads. Melville, Cinematography, Music and direction by her style. There is no way in today's director of films that it is impossible to create such an environment in today's box-office movie movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> Zahurul Haq created a lesser or less decent film borrowed from Melville's Le Samurai - The Killer, but remember, when the director was not wasted on big budgets and expensive (salaries) It was made. Cheap (Acting Qualification) Actor So what I'm saying is that it is one of the greatest movies of all time, with another film of Melville-le Samorie. See it Even if the remake is created, try to avoid it before viewing the first original.
