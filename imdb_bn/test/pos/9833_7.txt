I've been a fan of Harrison Ford for many years, so I was not surprised to enjoy his performance here. But I also enjoyed the idea of ​​improving the story and casting it well. I do not know whether Kristin Scott bought Thomas as a "Congressman", but she is an actress and beautiful woman. I took his notice of impossible missions in the first mission. Although his part was small, he was trapped on the screen. <br /> <br /> Here he and Ford are playing a man whose plane crashed. They are sitting together and closing this place. Apparently Ford, a police detective in Wash D.C, discovered that his wife was a matter. He further discovered that this relationship was with the congressman's husband of New England. <br /> <br /> The story comes with a lot of concubines, such as Ford and Thomas gathered together through their marriage, cheating, fraud and cheating. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> />
