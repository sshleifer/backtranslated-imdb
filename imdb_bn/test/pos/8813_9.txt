I enjoy living and club culture lifestyle mainly because I have a completely biased point. Being a DJ and a frequent club gear, I can see honesty in this movie and I like it. If you do not know the Club / RAW culture, it will play a great role in the culture that it does not know first hand. I like the true screenplay of emotional emotions and problems in the zip segment. Characters are well built and I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I really do not enjoy this enjoyment that you will write ten lines on this web site. I would write at least 6 or 7 but I think I can represent my point with less than ten. Here are some additional lines to please the IMDB deities.
