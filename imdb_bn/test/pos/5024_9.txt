An off-beat but very delightful performance by John Travolta sets this very funny comedy. His explanation is as a scuffy, femising, overweight, female man, as the high priest. And, she certainly has a dominant influence on the woman she encounters during a visit to Chicago. John Hurt as the chief reporter of Chicago Tabulars owner Bob Hoskkin is very less important in his role. Angeli McDowell plays the role as "his four weddings and a funeral" his role. Maureen Stapleton is delicious in a camio. His comment, "Michael does not suffer fools", is one of the most memorable moments. Bob Hoskins is the only major actor who fails to connect, closes the wall. Mainly you see Michael taking a lightning, the waitresses and lady dancers in western style restaurants make fun and display a completely free spirit. This is a memorable comedy which is more than worth seeing.
