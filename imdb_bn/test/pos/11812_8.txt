I really liked the movie, it was very entertaining as well as dramatic. But I just had a question, the song is about the movie. I have not found any soundtracks (if one is even there). And in particular, I was thinking that some could tell me the name of the song when the boys were going to the river on the way to New Orleans? I had something along the lines of "my great escape", but I searched for a lot of things to think about trying to do on the Internet, books, and I can not find it anywhere. It would be greatly appreciated if someone could help. Thank you.
