I first saw this as a little child. My sister told me about it and I think it would be more of a kids movie. However it remains to be an incredible movie. The movie is about to roll back but this movie will not really stop touching your heart. <br /> <br /> I saw it six years ago and yesterday I saw, 7 years later, I saw it again. For the first time in a long time. Even after it was finished, I knew that I saw it a billion, I was always crying like a little little baby. When I saw it a few years ago I finally understood the concept and the importance of the film. So I stopped watching it for a while. But yesterday I did not change the channel, I saw it. In the end, I laughed, cried, thought, and above all, believe in Marie. I have not been married for a long time and this movie has thrown me out of my shell and opened my heart. This movie was not just influenced. I was so impressed with the actors. Especially Bobby. So if you want to watch this movie for the first time, then I would like to see it alone. With tissues And your young, sweet, silly side and still have the hope that the side is getting ready to discover. When this movie touched my soul when I was only 6 years old, still I realized that I tried to find out the film, which I did not understand and still want to stay in life.
