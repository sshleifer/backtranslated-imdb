In my opinion, flutely demolished the first show with his ridiculous ego. He expressed disrespect to his dancer partner, tried to raise everyone and was not aware of the spirit of rewards. It's good he left the show. Colin Dunne, new male lead, fantastic, and when he and Gene Butler dance together, magic happens! The surprising surprises of the Isleen Ivers (such as the Parkell of Noel Axles), and the value of the entry of Maria Page's "Fire Dance"! When the pages and Ivas are combined together, a musical twist shows, at the end of the show, well, it's a real treasure. I agree, the edit is not complimentary, but any technical error can apply this extraordinary tour D-force. This is one to get. Something like reversion! This is the real one!
