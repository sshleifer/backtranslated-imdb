Move away all the parts of the movie which are "present" and trapped in flashbacks. Then you had a great story. Faith and Wolf's stories and their relationship was the best part. Diaz and Eccleston were wonderful. Brewster was ponderous to sit through. Blythe Dana as mother was surprised to see. She was great. Find the Father like Patrick Bergen, always choose him (sleep with the enemies). It's a very hippie, saving the world, kind of film. Do not worry too much for this, but I only recommend seeing it for Diaz's performance. She has excellent range and should use it more. Eccleston, is always mandatory. He is nice
