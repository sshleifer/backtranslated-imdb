This has to be the greatest series I have ever seen. I definitely saw every Sunday night and purchased set boxes as soon as they were available. This is a timeless game written by an extraordinary Australian who may be related to people of all ages, whether they are Australian or not, but those of us who are Australians really brought the Australian icon. Will see a 10/10
