The other that came out, and even so, the best! This is going on a trip to Hollywood and meets other characters along the way to police with frog Kermit. This film has already been good, in it there are excellent songs written by Muppets, Rainbow connection, Can you picture ?, Moving together and others This movie carries a strong sensitive value to me, unlike other Muppets Flickr. This is a wonderful movie. There are many cayos that depict Steve Martin, Mel Brooks and dozens more. <br /> <br /> Plus in my rating. 109 minutes Rate g
