After returning home from the third scene of the curse of The War-Robit, I decided to leap into IMDB and see what others are thinking. I've seen many Bright like it, those who are in America who do not get it. That does not really come as no shock, do not do "English" in America. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Groot are very english. Medieval English, indeed, cast for good measurements with a hint of curvature. The film is a lot like our two heroes; Easy and unassuming This is a nice and gentle plot so that the child is not lost, but there are enough beef to make the adults very happy. There are some light innuendo (which seems like the evangelists are offended - oh noes, drama!) But for a brief moment there is nothing more harsh than the one below. When people are offended by a plastic rectum, you know the mess of the world ... <br /> <br /> Those who think of a chicken run (those who I saw that all Americans) pick up chicken is a good film: Chicken runs your humor The feeling was folded, and I think it is suffering due to it. Enemies were curse, malicious, English, and cute. The movie of Thomas Tank Engine was destroyed because it was made to please the Americans and I'm glad that Nick Park did not allow it to be done with another Great British organization. Summary: You can keep your chicken Runs, your Shreks, your Madagasga - that kind of crude, crusher, slapstick comedy just does not compare with wit and grace that Wallace and Gromit curve-rubber curses. Cores from English, and Wallace and Gromit could have that way long.
