It is a very big movie about filmmakers (Istanbul) and its people and it's all kind of music. The execution and success of the director is very impressive. I was interested with Aichin because I saw "Head-on" ("Head Curry") and I appreciated his work a lot, but it was the most sensitive for me. I'm writing this here. It's not just Turk or anything like that, it's a very good biographer in a city and we can say how the music is alive. There are also many people's opinions and very variant ideas about life and love. I liked it very much and I would see it to anyone and everyone, not only but also especially anyone related to Turkey ...
