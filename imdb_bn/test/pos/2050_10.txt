This movie is actually my favorite one of all time. I'm not Ronnie Harleen's fan because most of his movies are going to suck, but TLKG hits his target time later. TLKG Samanth Kain (Davis) is a woman who suffers from hunger. She is married with a child and she quoutes as "I am an angel member of PTA." And then her world came crashing down as its falling before falling into place about identity. Samuel Jackson played PI Giggs, acting actor, police, to solve her identity and drag her beside her to pay some cash for her work. Alongside, we find that Samantha is actually Charlie Baltimore, a secret spy that went away a year ago. Plot is great, this story seems to be real and Jackson Davees (who always works a great acting) works great as the second Ph.Del. The explosion is intrinsically intertwined with memorable scenes after memorable scenes of action. Although quite impressively apparently my child finally reached my nerves (see outside the car!) I was tired of making a film to save the little kids, but still, the film is essentially worth adding to the film. . Again, this movie is really good, I did not understand why it does not do much at the box office, but if the actor is a man in the movie, then I am sure that he will earn 100 billion taka. Well, for years, people have discovered this movie and the average rating of this site has increased over the years. I hope it will grow because it's a great action film. And I love the action film
