The first is seen 10/10/10 - 8 out of 10 (D-Billy Wilder): James Stuart's Ledberg's famous flight of spectacular representation as Leibnberger and director Billy Wildader. There really is not a lot of backgrounds created in this story, but it's okay because the Wilder incident really makes it really great because it comes directly from Leinburg's perspective because he used his book on the basis of film. This initial film about flying is also the best about that law. During this Stuttgart flight you will get a lot of insight into what happened in Linberberg on this 33-hour solo flight across the Atlantic to talk to you and think about yourself. And he did the whole flight without sleep at night - which is amazing !! How the plane was bought and financed and there was a little background about some of the flashbacks in his life during the flight, but the film is often used for flights. The story is well-made and photographed and the joy of seeing it despite its age I am thankful to the fact that they do not throw lots of fluff and tell the story only. Well done This is a classic movie that everyone should watch.
