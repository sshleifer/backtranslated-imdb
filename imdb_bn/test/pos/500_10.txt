This is a movie that I can see and do not get tired again. It is sometimes one of the best comic book adaptations. I liked it more than X-Men Actually, this film is like a cross between X-Men and Matrix and it has already emerged. Wesley Snipes does a great job with blade character. He's not just a mental super hero. Also, this image is not sugercoated to get a pg-13 rating. Of course, comic books are basically for kids, but I love my movies a little more. Let us face it, if we are in this situation then we will raise a storm so that it is more realistic. This comic book adaptation also has something that does not do anything. A good fight in the end between bad guys and good people. Let's face it, there was not a great ending of Batman films.
