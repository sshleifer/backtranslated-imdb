This 60 minute movie shows how funny movies can be made. It is also a good-looking comedy attack on Star Trek style as any play-out. "Hick Trek - The Moovie" is a mission to close a group of renegade cats to destroy the entire Redeck Federation, a group of well-OL boys. <br /> <br /> Captain Jerk can stop the villainous Fluffy with the power of RSS and Bovine's cow ray ?? He can have nine lives, but he has ten bullets! This religion classic (formerly only the Scifi Conference) is a favorite party. Lots of fun moments!
