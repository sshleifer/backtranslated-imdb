Pixote is barely operated with a shred overdose. And yet, I still imagined, in addition to this film, hector Babelo carries some of his films with the film, in the neo-realistic style of Vitorio de Sicker, especially Sh≈çshain (which looks like a pixel, mostly in the children's custody). And yet when I like the movie of D'Sicker, but if it decides to make a decision between the two, it stops, because it does not have any intention to choose between two children. They have outstanding work in both raw plays, and there is an extra edge and frustration with Pixot Babenko so that it is not served after World War II. It was like Brazil - someone might see it in the City of God with a little more merit and fear, perhaps in the same position - and these children were before and after the film was created. Some people do not know that after 20+ years no one is alive. <br /> <br /> "The star", pre-teen street street Fernando Ramos da Silva, the title character, a child without a father or a family that really will find him, and as a reformer for the boys, among dozens of street children and The criminals will be placed in Conditions can not be worse, and become more helpless because some of the other two children kill one after another due to some guard duty. A riot, and a turn, and half through the film, we do not even have a real transvestite 18 with Pixote, a few other youths, including Lilica, and they get whatever pickpockets, drug dealers, whatever. Any such, I should not be repeated, ham-fixed has been shown kind of sincerely - Surely you will not ever see millions of years, Ron Howard or Paul Haggis ordered this kind of picture - and yet there is mental honesty in everything because nothing <br <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And yet he must be, as well as the reach adolescence. Around those young people (though not in most cases) will be on their level and things that will push this person forever. Babenko is not necessarily compelled, despite the use of one or two scenes by requiring a pleasant and musical score and a lot of crying. Like De Cicar, possibly due to the consistent condition of children in San Paolo and Rio, she is a natural director of children and some good works of Cox from Ramos da Silva and George Jillio and others, which provide only the right touch, the "cinematic" plays (this is not so real That it becomes a documentary, which is not a bad thing for every thing) and even in some scenes subtlety <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <p> Anyone interested in finding a good, solid look about how it should be found in the library or the other and how it should be spoken in the best foreign films of 1981.
