I was hoping to be like these others, trying to be frightened - endless looking stupid. The authors must have realized this somewhere along the line, and so the film is largely ignored and taken away completely from the other side. It seems like a different movie instead of the fourth entry of the child's play series. The new idea works so far this best in the series.
