A movie that shows the existence of modern men and women while facing death. Outside the general religious beliefs of the Hereafter, we are no more than a hell or anything in heaven. Religion was declared dead. Yet people are more obsessed than death, especially since we can push it for a long time. The reason for the scientific and technical development of our society is more because we believe that we can explain everything, know everything and do everything. This was mostly the end of the 20th century. Today's issues are changing, especially when US President Barack Obama speaks of journalists' public talks and says that the truth is relative to truth because it qualifies for more search than a final finale, purpose or achievement. This film shows the end of the old spiritual thinking that begins to become a real obsession, a passionate idea to truly be unique and overwhelming. Post-modernity has not yet reached Hollywood, although it seems to have reached the White House today. So some young doctors and medical students decided to die. Technically it is possible but the result is not surprising. It reactiveates the old guilty feelings and frustration that has been buried in the unconscious. One has committed suicide of an afflicted father of Vietnam Veterans, among whom one has been executed, one of whom died, the death of the person, yet another young black girl who was victimized and raped in grade school. Without racism, sex, and hatred, do not fear in front of her shame. It is very simple that you may be ashamed of these young adults who have high qualifications and behave like babies crying for edulcorated fruit juices in their bottles. Although the film is interesting but quite different. Setting and Shooting and any details or any detail details, morbid, decadent, "Death in Venice" or Greenway, or other work of art that often conflicts with making friends with the main enemies. There is a death. Of course it does not save the film, but at least it makes it valuable to watch. <br /> <br /> Jacques Collardou, University of Paris 1 Panthan Sovereign, University Varsils St. Quintin en Yewelines, CEGID
