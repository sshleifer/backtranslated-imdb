All right, so I do not understand why people are so excited about this movie. So I'm going to be it's usual Amanda Bynes movie, but it was not. It was awesome. <br /> <br /> Well, acting was not the best, but I think the performance was still overall. Also, you could say the actors were fun while doing this movie. In other movies, the winner won awards, where the actor did not like to work in the film, you can say. The actors had all chemistry, and showed that. <br /> <br /> Actors are a ton of people tipping over football skills. Yeah, so they're not perfect ... get over! They are not actors, football players. I'm playing football for my whole life, and believe me, it's hard to learn, so stop smelling on their level of skill. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was going to be stupid, but it was really fun. The way Amanda Bynes and Channing Tatum can make a situation funny even saying something funny. I found myself very laughing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall I love it!
