I have seen many movies. A lot of movies You can see 2-3 flicks a year to earn a bachelor degree in the film forces. It gets all too tiring. Mostly because I think I saw it all. It is so rare that when I am surprised to see anything, mostly I hope it looks like something good like me. <br /> <br /> Different from the Death bed which I've ever experienced, so I had to really stop the DVD to rant about its genius. <br /> <br /> Piece leak psychic. It is arranged in such a way that the viewer is forced to stay outside the frame. It's not like Halloween, with all its snappy editing and pov shots; Death bed actually comes across the kind of dreamy. The most common way I can say is this: Samuel Beckett is making a horrific house movie. I mean it's a psychological depressed bed that people eat! And fried chicken! Somewhere out in the middle! And have bone hands! I can express my feelings barely about this film. And yes, it will open up the ridicule to frustrate you. But things are the same after a while. It's hard and consistent to be a cinephile. I can honestly say it's a completely unique movie up and down. How to keep it together with it We need movies, films that leave us out of entertainment. Consider it like an existent camp. It's fun and stupid to it, but its curious little way brightens in. The worst ghostly villain all the time? Maybe, but at least it's not a guy in a mask.
