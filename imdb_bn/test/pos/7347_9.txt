I really enjoyed this film. It is rare to find a star that can pull the physical aspects of a sport / firmly believe the themed movie and can do the first thing to do the work as well. In this picture you will find two stars who emerged in this event. Both ladies provide warm, touch and humorous performance at times. The film has touched a number of topics from ethnic issues to sexual orientation. And yet the procedure was not heavy transfer. The production standard for a small budget film was top notch. I saw at the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and went to see it again a second time. It was a real crowd pleaser. I spoke to everyone who enjoyed this film.
