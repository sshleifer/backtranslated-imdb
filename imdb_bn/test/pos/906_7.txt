This is a great and hard comedy, with some nice and fun moments short but overall the film only relies a bit more on a playful scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is mostly dependent on. Stan Laurel does not wear any pants. Laurel plays a Scottish innocent young man who came to the full cabinet in America. For some reason he got into the attention center and played by his uncle Oliver Hardy, so that's why he thinks of having some pants in his Philip. <br /> <br />'s comedies have been well executed but on the main premises also a little tedious after a while. Although the film is still in its ridiculous moments, it is also far away from many of Laurel and Hardy's comedy shorts. The film is simply easy to be considered one of the most, although it can be mostly fined in most cases. <br /> <br /> Great good clean fun, not just great or memorable. <BR || <br /> 7/10
