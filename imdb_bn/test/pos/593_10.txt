Who does not remember the Muppate movie ??? <br /> <br /> The Cambridge The Frog is now the icon of American culture. Does any child appeal to this character? <br /> <br /> As the first Muppate film, the name of the movie is simply said, The Muppate movie did very well. Kermit takes advice from a Hollywood agent and advertising feedback goes beyond her home. Along the way he met with a pig, a bear, a rock band of chickens and a few other quality dolls. Watch for the appearances of Cameron Kahn, Steve Martian, Richard Prior, Mel Brooks and many more. I grew up watching this movie and I like it.
