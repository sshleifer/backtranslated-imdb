Hardware Wars is a sunny, 12-minute short film parody of the original Star Wars movie which was released in 1977 a few months after Star Wars. This movie uses your home appliances as an actor for sending space ships and star wars. Laughing around the uncontrollable fitness floor rolling around. This film has won many awards in the movie festivals, and this film inspired Mel Brooks to write the film "Spaceballs" in his Star Wars parody movie. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite parody movie and I recommend it to Star Wars and have a good sense of humor. <br /> <br />
