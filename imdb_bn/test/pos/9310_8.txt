All right, because I saw this movie in Yunchun China. It was probably because I was finally something that I could understand at the TV or at least read subtitles, or maybe it was fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I usually lock the dust off but I put it on this crazy movie and hugged it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And this movie is the real star of food. If you like Iron Chess and other cooking shows currently in real-time mode, you will love food scenes in this movie. <br /> <br /> It goes faster and subtitles make it faster for you to read quickly on this one. But most of the work is skeptic, so you do not always have to read the subtitles to get this idea. <br /> <br /> The main actress is not good to look at both the lovely eye candy and the main actor. They are looking for both prices. Finally if you have some time to kill and want to laugh, it is not a bad choice for both. <br /> <br /> I do not speak Chinese but I understand cultural humor. It is better for those who can speak Chinese. Overall, I've given 8 out of 10 and now I'm looking for a copy while I'm in China and when I'm back home I'll be there, it's a beautiful reminder for my time in my yankee and a silly movie observer in a silly afternoon at Massage Salon.
