Although flatliners were 15 years old, tonight it was my first time. I heard about the movie Flatlines, but I was not interested in it that I could go out and make a point to see it rent or its time. Well, I grabbed it on the premium channel and it was certainly very good. <br /> <br /> This movie decided to search for death of some bright young medical students. They killed a person briefly and found a way to bring him / her life back. Along with All Star Cast, this film has given it some serious bite. The idea of ​​exploring death has spread a lot, but I really thought that the author and the director did excellent work in giving different hairstyles. It was thrilling, frightening, and not a common effort to create a nation of mind ... it was the real deal <br /> <br /> It was the substance of this film, instead of creating an empty, sponsored, starred thriller. A nail-bitter, white counterfeit, edge off-seat, hard nose thriller. I give it 8/10.
