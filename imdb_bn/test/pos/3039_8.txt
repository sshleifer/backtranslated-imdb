I'm just not considered as a great movie, Mr. Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home), but rather giving real respect to teachers. <br /> <br /> Despite incredible curiosity, Pat Coor (Voet) was directed to a group of students who reached and brought them from a basic literacy and world awareness. His method was criticized by bureaucratic dinosaurs like Mr. Skrinting (Hume Crone), but teachers like Conowe would always win. <br /> <br /> Voet has really shown that she loves for education and it is a natural high for her. She did not overplay the role, and I found her to be completely credible. Voight is Conrack. <br /> <br /> In addition to the love of education, we also see another important thing in this movie. If you are in the boat, if you are in the boat, you can get bureaucracy.
