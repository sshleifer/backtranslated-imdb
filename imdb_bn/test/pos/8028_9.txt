This film is an international terrorist about Carlos "The Jackal" (Queen), who blames women and children for its bones by the description of CIA agent Henry Fields (Sethherland). At least the United States Navy Officer Annibil Ramirez (Quinn Again) who said what he had said to make a promise like a Carlos and to establish him as a traitor in the KG-Eye. Ramirez is visually physically similar to Carlos, but mentally he opposes her. He is carrying the order and Carlos is carrying chaos. <br /> <br /> The movie does not have all-shoot-gun-jump-around action, and it's a good thing. In the first half, Ramirez trained Carlos to work and think, and in fact, where the film earned its distinction from another Run of the Match Action Flicks. An Israeli agent (Kingsley), Ramirez joins the field of training and together they play the role of parental role in the bravery of Ramirez's new character. Ramirez likes to dislike Carlos's dislike, to work secondhand like Carlos, and even Carlos (courtesy of Carlos's former girlfriend) taught to work for love. Naturally, what he is learning will be used well in the next half of the movie. It's a little narrow but gives a vivid performance as Queen Carlos-Wangby. <br /> <br /> I liked another topic about this movie, it was that it does not use much more plot points in the evil twin movie - you know, one of the worst wines that insinuates itself in the good twin family. Ramirez's family comes in the film, but instead of how they destroy his new character on his family life. <br /> <br /> This film offers good chocolate laughter injections, often with Sterland and Kingsley's Essaric Couple. Extra and visible exclamation of Ramirez's first name (Annibal, Anabel, got it)? Also overdone was strong and clever and harping about two of the most intelligent Carlos about harping. In my opinion, during the final showdown, the salary does not match the build-up. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was enjoyable. I'm not a big action flick fan but this movie was more intelligent and lively than average action movie and it keeps my attention. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10
