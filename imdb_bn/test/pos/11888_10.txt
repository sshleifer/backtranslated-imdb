Some martial arts purists think that the old school of comedy was the worst thing that happened to Kung-Fu Flick; And it is true that the comedy in the film of Hello Kong has been signed at the end of the "Chop-Shaki" period. But in reality, one can only carry physical exhibition of skills for such a long time, then everyone becomes annoyed with it. And why was Chop Shaki really dead and how the Hong Kong "New Wave" action film was born: Producers, actors, directors got annoyed by hitting people for the right 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Liu Chia Liang is a professional director with a notable list of films given by her and her resume, this movie should be shown as just another Kung-Fu comedy. Rather, it is a comic film in the style of martial arts and, indeed, the best one of all time. <br /> <br /> What a great surprise Liu did with this picture: he took a martial and recreated it with the Arct Plot and a Hollywood-style musical line! Done with songs and dance episodes! There was almost a time when the filmmaker and filmmakers began to admit that the performance of the movie film (actually derived from acrobatics from Chinese characters) from the martial arts, is more common with the dance than the war. . (Most Americans do not realize that they do not really think of seeing a martial arts movie - the well-known choreography of the body movement using an action film plot as an excuse for their performance.) No rate, clearly Liu Chia Liang made this connection And decided that it will explore it near its boundaries. <br /> <br /> The result is an incredibly entertaining, miraculously miraculous character of human beings Kung-Fu (and often skip over their own shoe as often as they do). And in the 19th and the 20th century, this film gives Liu the opportunity to explore the nature of modernization of China's Westernization and modernization, which has contributed so much to informing China today. So the film has significant historical import. <br /> <br /> Fans of Stephen Chaw's recent Kung Fu Hustle must watch this movie carefully, because Chao clearly learned from this before making his own film. <br /> <br /> A very fun, adorned film. Oh, yes, and Kung Fu is really true, really good at it. <br /> <br /> Puri will not accept it, but it is probably Liu's best film director.
