Sadly, I was 17 years old and I could not kiss, so I really feel for Josey. It's been a while since this picture was viewed, but I've seen it again for writing this review, and I remembered what I thought about it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Chemistry between Sam and Josiah was really good, and Michael Verton was an excellent actor. <br /> <br /> I like the story very much - as I said there, I can relate, and this is a very rare film you can fully relate to. <br /> <br /> - I like it. 7/10
