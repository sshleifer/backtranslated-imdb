I saw this series after I saw a nude song movie. It is much better than the movie, and I thought the movie was great! This series will literally push you towards the television set in the context of the next set, sight, or the funny situation (all night witch's place, club flamingo). I do not think that I have ever smiled so much in my TV series, even after watching movies and knowing some jokes in this way. My embarrassment was that only six episodes had been produced, but I agree that the authors will put a lot of pressure to maintain any episode of this episode. Overall, the series must definitely see for those who like crazy, bad jokes and slopstick eyes.
