I have mixed feelings about this movie, especially compared to its previous, <br /> <br /> "American American Werewolf in London" That film was funny moment in it, it was still more awful stories than anything else. This updated version is now set in Paris, it is not "edge" and is not just in the same category ... but there are some good things for it that was not the first movie and overall it is still fun to watch. So, on one side of the "Werewal Purist", most of whom think that this film is a genuine trash than the version of London, I still will give it a suitable creator because I think others think. I like it though I agree with "London" and I also like that version. <br /> <br /> The first 30-40 minutes of this movie is played strictly for a laughing scene with a "balloon" with a "balloon" in a restaurant. This is the role of the lead female character, played by Judy Daly. I do not see this actress enough. He does not seem to hear that many movies, or at least about America, hear me here. The face of this French actress is a classic beauty, so the movie got points for her stay, and she looks great. <br /> <br /> When horror starts, it can be scary and special effects are good. . I liked the lack of superstition in this movie, in contrast to the first, there is no sound meaning and no lord's name is in vain! <br /> <br /> But there are so many sexual comments and there is a scene here with a man running in the cross with the cross, which was condemnable to me. Soundtrack is heavy metal which does not apply to middle-aged people like me. This image is made more on the 20-somethings, if it helps anyone. <br /> <br /> This is amusement ... just do not expect to be in its first movie.
