One of the best adaptations of the screen from Kernel Chabbert's novels is the screen adaptation. This adds to the complexity of Fanny Arthur's complex widow with the characteristic character of French character, Depardieu's lost lawyer, Faberis Lucini's lost Chabbert. The film has amazing levels, as you can expect from top filmmakers such as Yevse Angelo. Characters keep the film in the gear and at the beginning a little bit of speed increases and at the end it's a fine movie.
