I was very moved by a human life experience who rose so high in the academic world. A close family surrounded by extended family and extended family of families, a man is able to succeed in the world. Hardworking, optimistic and truly family-based - Most of the Hispanic culture has been shown which I have always observed and admired. Religious prejudice points were quite authentic in the Catholic Church. Without any doubt, the actor who played the actor's mother was nominated for the Academy Award. His prayer for his missing son moved me to tears. I would recommend this stunningly thoughtful film to my friends and family.
