I like money! I stumbled on this bright film in a local video store last week. What was not sure was expected. It brought home, the player set up and then started my journey stupidity. First look I did a lot of shiny, really laugh really loud The second movie did not begin to hold on to me and humor was a lot of fun. It reminded me of Austin Powers, it was right to look at the first, then the real fun started talking to people about it, just talking about each scene and setup. I'm watching this movie with all my friends, everyone I know. This film can be one of the most perfect "future" movies ever made. This movie has more than 84 minutes of entertainment, it is a warning for the future of our civilization. Mike Judge, our fantastic mind who brought our office space brought us a vision of our future in the future. Lou Wilson's Dead Pan Humor "Average" Joe has improved a lot more movies. Once you're done, watch this movie, read more! Write more! Think More! For futures sake if not for yourself!
