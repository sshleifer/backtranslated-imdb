I did not read Anne Rice's novel that was based on this film, but who knows, maybe the book is available at a lower price than reading it and probably it's good for your health. This film is not necessarily bad for your health, but a book can be very comfortable, and of course, you practice the active part of your brain than this film. You can read Ana Rice's pages on one side, which I read on one side, but after interviewing this movie and a vampire, I feel that he wrote a really good novel. <br/> <br /> Yet, in the description of the voice of Stuart Townsend, Brad Pitt has received a much more annoying hack than the story of the vampire, and you can say that the road to the damaged limited production company gives enough meat to the early Rice story. Interview decided to go with the lace and elegance, the queen low budget depends on the special effect which is hard to try hard to take. Some might see that the original novel was possible as a movie and the production team attracted its attention in the wrong place. Clothing and rock and roll stage can be replaced with more blood and a terrible soundtrack. <br /> <br /> However, I give credit where credit is given. Soundtrack is excellent. Couron and Disurbard me submerged with fiancee like my fianc√©. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a beautiful Goth-rock zoom and splash montage, but after the first ten minutes or so, the direction decreases quickly It seems as if the film was so long that the director realized that there was not enough time and enough money to do justice to Ana Rice's novel. What is the result of some medium vampire scenes and lots of special effects of sugar. Unfortunately, the Queen of the Damned failed to judge just as she failed to influence John Carpenter's homosexuality. Where is yellow contact? Where do blue blue make-up? After the scene in the scene, I reminded my head about Salim's Lot and Fear Night Day when the low-budget budget is done correctly. <br /> <br /> Although this movie can be protected from garbage. Professor of Allaah, and his soul can live in peace forever. He might have become a famous actress, his life was not taken by us since he did well with this beautifully beaten dance. Did I mention the soundtrack was good? Let's see, what else can I say? It was not too long. Anne Rice's novel could easily be a three-hour movie if Francis Ford Coppola got her hands on an aspiring director. Here are some twists and intrigues and there is there. But in all it was a valid rock and roll was added to the second-rate vampire movie. The director of this movie went to manage a new battalet galactica mini series which tells you something. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
