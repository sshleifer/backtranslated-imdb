In Hong Kong's 60th year, a man and a woman went to the upcoming apartment with their wives on the same day. Soon they suspect missing husbands having an affair with each other. Before another complex bondage emerged, as a result of facing their depression while playing each other's spouse, a strange bond between men and women appeared. <br /> <br /> No summary can do justice to it, Outer Wang Kar-Yi's "In Measure For For Love" for Hong Kong is nothing but a miracle. A story about the sadness that touched and managed to be fun at times. A romance that does not seem like forced or fake. There is no doubt that the director's method has many things to do with him. <br /> <br /> It is directed from an continuous screenplay (though the idea originates from a small story from Japan), it is to immediately separate the film. It's the brand's performance. All the film that is rolling around and the rest is pure growth. The main part of the film has two letters that will make your heart easier and last for a long time after the last credit roll: Maggie Cheung and Tony Lings are only amazing, and the barrier of a language does not just reduce the instant and the single part of the truth. Additional elements are also top notch: films are very nice to watch (part of "Hero" by Christopher Doyle) and the music is frustrating. <br /> <br /> All of this must be seen, if only because it has the most heartfelt, mature and authentic "love story".
