This film was created just 48 years after the end of the civil war - probably on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the war. The film's reconstruction of war and the people of the era are rather impressive and realistic. It provides a different and more balanced view of itself than its contemporaries, the birth of a nation - a patentless barbarous and racist film. For this reason, this short film can be excellent for discussing the war in the classroom and telling the story of a very young person listed as a drummer. The boy performs well and is a hero, though the film ends gradually - a particular convention of the day. Not a great movie, but a decent plot, acting acting and hugely you played in other films often. <br /> <br /> A pessimistic aspect of this photo was to use the title card to describe or set the stage for stuff that was very transparently very often. It got boring from time to time.
