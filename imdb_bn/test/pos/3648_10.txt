Some who say something in Lonny Tune Cartoon shows, it seems unfair to children, say: They were not originally made for children. They were produced for movies, feature films have been shown before, and so they can show anything. "Tweety's S.O.S." Find that the bad ugly floor Sylvester Tweety on a sea liner and have boarding the ship trying to get him. But the two things work against Sylvester: Garni greatly protects Canary, and Sylvester is easily sassy (we do not see him throwing, but with his green face, they make it absolutely clear that he is doing the right thing!). And of course, seemingly cute Tweety has a bad ass ass. <br /> <br /> It's great to see how all of these cartoons are not afraid to go out; Whatever they think about showing, they showed. We must understand that cartoons should not always be a good entertainment for children. Really funny
