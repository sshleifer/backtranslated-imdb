Well, I'm scared that this particular review will not focus on many different observations before me, but I have seen it literally - during the PBS membership drive - and in fact I am not excited to say anything. The strikingly indecent gesture that you have to understand repeatedly, you will see them in front of the movies. Before the Broadway incident in the middle 60. Television was still a small medium, a musical instrument that was very important in the air, which is like today's memory: musical diversity. Some musical concerts were in the weekly series, but others showed a special, one-time special, usually the performer's special talent. This is where we look at the raw, uninhibited first at the stretches. Gary Moore, Ed Sullivan, along with several other events, he was already a guest actor and once had a big uprising with the woman, who would pass him the extraordinary bitton of Belter: Judy Garland In 1966, the color M Barbra Barber introduced the Streissand Paint (hence the title), but a year ago, his first special format was often copied in the letter. In 3 unique works, we got an abstract streseand (an art-later art museum and sometimes the work of art), a comic Streissand studio has already been working on audience audiences (populated with many obscure and animal-related animals), and above all, a Song Streissand is a small mini concert format - well, really, just do it Ena. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that the film has yet to be made to her, as well as the song writer, director and political activist. Here, he is only 24 years old, doing great things because he puts it on his camera launch, 'We do not know we could not, so we did.' On Saturday evening, after the museum closed to the public, a weekend shot the Art Museum in Philadelphia and apparently only worked with one color camera. Yet there is a lot of holiday, dissolution, and shots tracking, leading to a spectacular peak moment - modern, slightly bitik-flavored, "whole move." After losing among the modern habits, jazz-club bongas are started, Streisand is gearing up a psychedelic gown and eye makeup, making attractive stacko tunes with almost sex appeal application. Do not believe it until the Act 3, the moment is matched or fit by any other achievement: In the concert sequence, in a white gown and pearl earrings, Straussand reads the torch "Anywhere I'm My Hat House Home," final Break the notes and release one of those climatic belts that you are 44 years old and even a little girl like a man Like the screams. Just plain old great televisions. See it
