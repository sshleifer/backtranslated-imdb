This year's first real movie. Amazing long shots, sometimes with a fixed camera, so fixed for Nordic movies (Dropped). A true non-light film I find it. Athmospherique :-) It simply rejoices in all my senses and remember how the pictures during the scenes fell and painful when he was trying to kill himself. That point I do not think of standing in the whole plot. Why, if it is an ideal world, then you will not die, yet you are keeping your conscience? There were real world or "unusual" earth with "implemented" rules, but there was no accident in such a way that as a person may remember how it can happen before. <br /> <br /> This reminds me of Kafka and much more, Haxley's brave new world, especially in the part where sex was actually available to everyone, because it was viewed as a right of pleasure. It was a lack of a plot but I think it was good, because you felt the strange behavior, absurdity and lack of real sensations in all these "happy" world and understood. <br /> <br /> I think the end was brighter. The real world is actually a homo homini lupus, if you are not strong enough you eat.
