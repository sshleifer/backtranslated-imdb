This movie focuses on a young man who prays to help his family and friends live their life. It reminds me of other films like "San Off Burnet" and "Asis Francis", and this movie has the effect of very strong Catholic beliefs. Anne Blyth was the first Catholic school student and then bought a statue of Saint Chan (the street name I named the street) as a young girl and prayed a lot for her child. Whenever the problem comes in his life. Francis Bavier (From Auntie Griffith Show to Aunt Bea) and Edmund Gwen (from 34th Street Miracle) to play his relatives. A local cleric in mine said that my sister is like Anne Blath and both of them have first and middle names. An excellent good family film that came from an era when life is a bit easier.
