Mary Hines (Meg Ryan) A wealthy woman has discovered that her husband is cheating with her husband (Eve Mendes). He knows what to do and friends Sylvia Fowler (Ante Benning), Eddie Cohen (Debra Messing) and Alex Fisher (Jade Pinkett Smith) are trying to help. <br /> <br /> OK - there is no reason to resume the 1939 film. It is a true classic and does not need to be updated and redistributed. Naturally it has been done. This has gotten some of the worst reviews I've ever seen for a motion picture. I loved the original and saw it many times - I was constantly compared to it. Now it's not a classic, but it's not bad. <br /> <br /> ** Small Speaker !!! ** First Bad - The story is outdated and updated badly. Truly - a man who is cheating on his wife is very amazing today. Meg Ryan (a wonderful actress) is quite awesome here. Unable to reveal his appearance! I can not believe how his view is bad at something. Eve Mendes is very bad - but it is not entirely his fault. Her role is poorly written and she must compete with Joan Crowford from the original. Smith's character (a solid lesbian) goes into pieces in an operating room. It's funny ... but it shows that a strong female emergency situation is immediately broken into pieces. Also some strange passages inserts where some of the scripts discuss his daughter in judgment about herself. At this moment, it seems more than any other lifetime movie. <br /> <br /> Now it is good - this film does not hold any privacy decision to show people on the screen. For this movie and for women - men do not need (BTW - I'm a man). Like the Bening Fawler, the movie is a great jump whenever he is on screen. Smith is just wonderful - he does not overplay (or underplay) his gay character too much. Messing is very good but he does not do this much. A small role of Bate Miller is just rogue and Cloris Leachman pulls off any role of a homeowner. The direction is very good - especially during a fashion show order time. I have heard that there is a lot of problems for directing Director Danny English in his first full-length film but it does not show up in the final product. There are also some tricky information about the original (most typical lines) that have been inserted into a conflict. <br /> <br /> I saw it was a woman in the audience (there were few people but not many) and they liked it. The film ends in the order of the operating room, which makes everyone hello. So - this was not needed but it is not the disaster people saying it. Also - people say we do not need a movie with all the women. Well - why not? I see lots of movies with all the guys in Cast and complain about anyone! Avoid complaints and bad reviews and see this. I could give it an 8 or 9 by a good performance of Rayan, but this is what I can give it a 7.
