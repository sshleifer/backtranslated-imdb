Some parts of motion in the motion slower, but if you can tune into its weak pace and long silence then it is a satisfactory piece of courtly conspiracy. The story of China's first emperor, his childhood boyfriend and his personal expenses of power. The film is very atmospheric, extremely submissive and courteously contrary to ruthless ruthless ruthless rumors and ritual occasions. One way that evokes shadows and cold spaces is to film. War scenes are rare and short, how the focus is on the war between the rights of the person and the right sides. The Emperor's journey from the idealist peacekeeper keeps the excursion to the cruel quarter, but gives little background or firm insight into the inspiration of the emperor, in reality his actions and goals do not really change completely, only Gong Li's attitude changes him. The most striking performance is that of Gong Li and the famous murderers, when they have to fight, when to go back, to recapture when to kill. The most expensive movie ever made in China, the emperor and the killer do not depend on violent emotion or big war, but the developing environment of danger and inevitability. Gong Li fans will be obscured to listen because of an unforgettablely beautiful, giving a different performance.
