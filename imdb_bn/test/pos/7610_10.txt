I thought this movie was really awesome! Drew's the best one. I'm a fan of Michael Verton too, I thought he was so hot in this movie. Why All Bad Review If I could, I would like to see this movie again. I love the end This picture definitely showed a smile on my face! I was surprised that James Franco and Jessica Elba had it. I love both of them so I highlight this movie. In the end, when there is a huge comment about the truth, what is sometimes true is what happened in high school. Again, the movie was amazing. Defiantly a 10/10. Hope this comment was very useful to any IMDb readers.
