Making the film as dark and visually fuzzy as possible to cover the budget deficiencies is an often used strategy in low budget horror films, but it takes it too far. It's so poorly lit and obscure (and it goes almost entirely at night to start) that you often end up looking at a black screen (though the bad video transmission may also have had something to do with it). Alas, "creepy" is also the best word to describe the movie's plot. The filmmakers throw in different (and unoriginal) horror ideas without any logic, and halfway through you get the feeling that they almost left the effort to make a good scary movie; you know when you see signs supposed to be in deadly danger (or in some cases even dead) do little talk ....
