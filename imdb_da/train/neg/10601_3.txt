This is the official sequel to the '92 sci-fi action thriller. In the original, Van Damme was among many dead Vietnam war veterinarians revived to be the perfect soldiers (Unisols). In this one, it is probably about a dozen years later, when Van Damme has a daughter of that age. Now he works with the government in a classified installation to train the latest Unisols - codenamed Unisol 2500, for some reason. As usual, something goes wrong: the supercomputer on the spot (called Seth - like the snake in "King Cobra" the same year) goes magically, takes command of Unisols and even downloads its computer's brain to a new super-Unisol body (Jai White). We look at the next step in evolution, people! Most of Van Damme's struggles are with a particular means Unisol (pro wrestler Goldberg), who just keeps coming: dropping him from a building - not good; drive him down with a truck - don't go! Shoot him, burn him - forgetaboutit! Much of the humor is the track for how Van Damme is now outdated and out-of-date (he even goes gray around the edges). But even though he takes a lickin ', he continues to kickin'! Most followers of this kind are rather lame - pale imitations of the originals, and although this is not quite brilliant, it manages to be consistently entertaining, especially if you are a pro-wrestling fan.
