Well, I'm disappointed. When I first heard news about a remake of Robert Wise's 1963 movie "The Haunting", I had a fear that it would be ruined by an abundance of summer movie size visual effects. But deep down, I had faith. Surely, with such a talented cast intact ... De Bont and Company will not ruin a movie whose original was a stunning and scary movie that understood the delicate art. Well, subtlety, where are you now !! ?? My fears have manifested ... a promising movie has gone wrong. Yes, Eugenio Zannetti's production design is staggering; The film is wonderfully photographed; and the composer Jerry Goldsmith can never ever do wrong. But the script puts it to good actors. Try to deliver the kind of silent dialogue that is only spoken in movies. In the end, the always wonderful Lili Taylor is the only performer to escape with some dignity ... and it's just barely. But the crime of all crimes is that horror is shown to us. We can no longer use our imagination, feel the terrible fear of fear of the unknown. No, we get some visual effects to show us what we should be afraid of ... and you know what? So wonderfully realized as they are ... the visual effects come out as kind of stupid. And climax is a phantasmogorous mess ... but things had gone awful too long before. <br /> <br /> Everything in Haunting is exaggerated and overblown. I'm afraid there's no real excitement or crack in this old haunted house monster ... only groaning. Check out the original instead. <br /> <br />
