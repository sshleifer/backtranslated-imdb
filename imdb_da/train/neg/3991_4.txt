I'm not sure why Spike Lee made this train wreck of a movie and told poor Stevie Wonder to unite his beautiful music forever with this theatrical mess. I also oppose the way he uses bias as part of the normal prose for professional blacks. Misuse of his team on ethnic filming is a shame. Scenes that appear to be extinct in the blue and have nothing to do with the theme or sub-themes play as if some college kid wrote this. I especially pamper the ridiculous scene where the two leads are playful sparring with no reason and the pads come roughly up Snipes. The exaggeration of the leaders makes one feel that Spike has no respect for his viewers, or he has no idea what a movie is about. The last scene seems to be thrown in to justify the use of a sledge hammer to tackle a point. This film also supports the myth that all people in culture use the F word in an informal conversation. I hope he will realize that the rest of his films are in the same pool as this one, where he does not grow as a film producer. I think his association with Scorcesee in Clockers was a wise move. He should stick to making documentaries like the four little-colored girls. Shock movie doesn't make an Oscar.
