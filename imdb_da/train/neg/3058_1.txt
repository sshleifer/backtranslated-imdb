When I was a child back in the 1970s, a local theater had Children's matinees every Saturday and Sunday afternoon (someone remembers them?). They showed this thing a year around Christmas time. Me and some friends went to see it. I was expecting a cool Santa Claus movie. What I got was a terribly dubbed (you can tell) and really scary movies. Something about Santa Claus and the Merlin wizard (don't ask me what the two do in the same movie) fighting Satan (some joker in a silly devil costume complete with horns!). The pictures made me cut in my seat. I've always found Santa spooky to begin with, so it didn't help. The guy in Satan's suit didn't help. But it was really horrified that they were the wooden dukes who pulled the sledge of the santa. When he hurt them and the eerie sound they made and the movements - I remember having nightmares about these things! All these years I still remember going out of that theater more than a little disturbed by what I saw. My friends were also so scared of it. I just watched an ad on it on television, and all those nightmares came roaring back. This is a scary, disturbing little Christmas movie that is likely to scare the pants of any young child who sees it. Avoid this - unless you really want to punish your children. This gets a 1.
