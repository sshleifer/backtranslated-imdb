I loved the original. It was brilliant and will always be. Still, I actually look forward to seeing re-make. I'm usually a little against re-makes because there are too many of them, but somehow I was fascinated. I really enjoyed it at first. Caine brilliant, as usual, and Jude Law who manages to hold is own beside him. It was pretty wise how it was modernized and it worked. What stops this from being really good is the last seven minutes. It goes completely away from the original, so far in fact it has ceased to be clever and just gets annoying. The end of the original was amazing! So much excitement was built up and it was incredibly wise! This? It doesn't grow in excitement, but in frustration, as it seemed that they decided to make Caines character a homosexual. It was if they tried too hard to be different. And then ... BANG! Law is dead. Roll Credits. This movie is worth seeing just for the performances, but the last seven minutes really pulls it down. What a shame ....
