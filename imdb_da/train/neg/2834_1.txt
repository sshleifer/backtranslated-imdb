I have now seen all four Bo Derek vehicles directed by his husband, John; Everything is quite awful, of course, but it is definitely pits. With the usual flimsy plot, bad scripting ?? of the director of course ?? and not to mention the star's gratuitous nudity, it's about losing a lot of elderly man Anthony Quinn (she accepts her suicide by saying he always admired Hemingway !!) But who continues to appear and talk to her . In fact, he will come back in another, younger body, but actually do it only in the very first scene! Derek is lovely as always, and still plays naive (!) ?? especially during a muddled mid-section that has pursued her by an employee murderer at a spa. Quinn is also typically larger than life (read: hammy) here, but it is easy to consider as his nadir; besides, too much of the duration he works behind a piece of shiny plastic (presumably he is in a kind of limbo)! His 'replacement' is clearly a beautiful look that does not have a talent or even personality. Also mentioned in casting are Hollywood veterans Don Murray (as Quinn's best friend and Bos's business consultant) and Julie Newmar (as Quinn's host's angel in the afterlife)? plus a surprising cameo appearance by billionaire Donald Trump (who probably needed this on his resume)! It goes without saying that John Derek was his own film photographer on the film that the end-credits are filled with useless (and corny) expressions of gratitude to the many people who lent a helping hand and that GHOSTS CAN NOT DO IT swept the board on 1990 Razzie Awards!
