There were good performances by Robin Williams and others, but the film was boring overall and very disappointing compared to the positive reviews. I thought she could become a serial killer who drills people to death: an abandoned guy in ugly clothes runs his victims around food bars and quotes Oprah and recites his medical history until they ask him to shoot them. I think that the film mainly appeals to egomaniacs who believe that strangers are interested in their images. I expect that most retailers will have a break from customers.
