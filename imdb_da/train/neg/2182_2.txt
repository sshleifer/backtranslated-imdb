I bought this DVD for $ 1 at Walmart. After seeing it, I can just return to the store and try to get my money back! The only reason I gave the movie a 2 and not a 1 is that the story has a few new narrative elements, although it never really rises to the level of being interesting. This movie has all the ear tags to be a made for drive-theaters market - ultra-low budget, amateur plays and a liberal dose of sex (for an early 60s movie). In fact, I wonder if perhaps the only reason the movie was made was to make a quick buck, and because someone knew some strippers they could use as extras. The film is about a wacko doctor who wants to transplant his girlfriend's cut head onto the body of an unsuspecting donor. Most potential donors are skanky strippers or a model - whose only real purpose in the movie is to titrate as they remove most of their clothing. But they do too much to make the movie worth watching the naughty bits themselves, and the movie is not quite terrible enough to deserve to look at bad movie buffs.
