Brilliant book with wonderful characterizations and insight into human nature, especially nature's dependence, which still resonates strongly today. <br /> <br /> As for the movie ... eh. Nothing special. The cameraman obviously had an unfortunate dependence on circulating and circulating and CIRCLING around everything, making the viewer quite nauseous. Why the director did not stop this is beyond me - but perhaps he was too busy trying, and somehow failed to draw good ideas from these normally excellent but inappropriately cast actors. All in all, a weak adaptation. Your three hours would be better spent reading (or reloading) the book.
