This is available on a "Drive In Double Feature" from Dark Sky Films, and since I just finished "Barracuda", I also saw this. This is a movie that turns out to be incredibly ambitious and unobtrusive at the same time. <br /> <br /> We begin with two young ladies wandering around in some foreign cities, but where are they exactly? They stop looking at necklaces from some Chinese suppliers, and try out Chinese-style clothing at a store, but then do we see some aztec dancers? And all the time, these girls are followed by two guys who are gradually losing what is not necessary for them not to chase the girls on a wild race in the city, and they finally catch them. <br /> <br /> It seems that one of the girls has a coin on a string around the neck, and these guys will find the foliage and where did she get it? So in flashback we go back to find out. And how did they know she had this coin? Hard to say really. <br /> <br /> Now back in the day, when these two women were 10 years old, they were out with their sisters and their sister's boyfriends on a boat, and after stopping air in their minds they were pulling this young boy back to his home dock, only to have his grandfather come out and invite the "young" outside herbal tea with grandma. But not everyone has tea, Todd has gone back to the boat to look at the young girls, and then when they are away from it, the boats are blowing up and when they return to the house, their friends have disappeared the mystery. It seems that these "friendly people" are raising their own vegetables, but they are waiting for the meat to fall over and serve herbal teas. <br /> <br /> But the girls and Todd left island, but now they are returning, escorted by their hunters, and they are there to find the treasure despite the fact that no-one has ever shown the girls where it was before. There also seems to be another on the island, and thugs start mysteriously dying one by one, and since there are only three, it doesn't take long. And there is even a kind of happy ending that will leave the viewer as confused as they were in the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The two thugs seem to be quick freaks with angry problems and combined without any functional ability, they are joking fun. The Hillbilly-type family is also without function, despite the fact that grandfather is Hank Worden, who appeared in many film and TV shows. The action is confusing, the sites are even more confusing, and the island resembles southern California. <br /> <br /> So what the hell is this? I am not sure, but it is certainly worth looking at once so you can think (or say), huh? 4 out of 10, very bizarre.
