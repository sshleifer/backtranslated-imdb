After listening to and enjoying Harvey Bernhard's Omen II comment, I was shocked to find that he was also behind this absolute garbage can. It's like a really bad TV movie, you can see glimpses in the middle of the day when you have the flu and are too sick to reach the remote. I believe in the bit where Michael Lerner is confronted with what I can only describe as a high school cast by Les Miserables, hung my mouth open in disbelief. And then the mouth went up and down because I laughed so much. Dire. I do not know why I should write at least ten lines, I have made my point concise, there is nothing wise about this whole modern verbiage.
