Let me first say that I love Western and Civil War stories. I'm also considering John Ford as an excellent director. I also have the same high feelings for John Wayne & William Holden's behavior. <br /> <br /> I can't remember seeing this movie when it first appeared in 1959. Last night was the first time I saw it since. <br /> <br /> As in my 4 rating, I can say that I didn't like the movie. <br /> <br /> I will now try to tell some of her shortcomings. <br /> <John Lee Mahin, who wrote the manuscript of Harold Sinclair's novel, was a highly gifted writer and wrote many fine scripts. This script is poorly written and poorly researched. They mention the awful conditions in the Andersonville prison. At the time of the film Andersonville was not in operation. They also use rifles that were not used at that time. <br /> <br /> For over 40 years, John Ford directed movies and won 4 Oscars. He must have been ill during the production of this. His usual style was lacking. It could be that this was movie in the south and east and not in Monument Valley. <br /> <br /> He usually had a stock company of players he used in almost his entire movie, MEST was missing this time. This time only smaller cowboy stars have Hoot Gibson & Ken Curtis roles and of course Anna Lee has a small role. There were no other familiar faces except the 3 stars. (see below) Ford's stock company made most of its films the classics they were; unfortunately missed here. <br /> <br /> Now we come to the main stars John Wayne and William Holden. The Duke must also have been sick, he seemed out of place here. This kind of role usually fits perfectly to his style, he was just sufficient here. Wiliam Holden did the best he could, but nowhere as good as he used to. <br /> <br /> It was required that there be an actress in this type of movie. Here in his first major role (second film) is Constance Towers, a very beautiful person, but not really an actress. She still has roles on television. Let me be kind and say that she has had a long career, more based on her appearance than actors. Also in the caas as Mrs Towers serves is the tennis star Althea Gibson. I'm glad she's stuck in tennis. The rest of the production credits were far from the usual high standard of other John Ford films. There were a few military types apparently made by the marched cavalry, not good at all. The action scenes were good but came at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Ratings * 1/2 * (out of 4) 47 points (out of 100) IMDb 4 (out of 10)
