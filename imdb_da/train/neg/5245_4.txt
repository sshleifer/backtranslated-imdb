I am a current A.S.L. Student & was forced to watch this movie in class, and what I got out of it was the blatant bias involved in the movie. The film is of course leaning against P.O.V. of "common deaf perception" is their no middle. Also, the film did not mention or take into account other situations that are also under debate in this topic. DVS. Deaf People who were born in hearing and later went deaf. Is it right or wrong in that case? The film is prestressed and virtually everything according to the Deaf's opinion with a capital "D". Not that this is bad, but for it to be a true documentary, you have to try to be a little objective.
