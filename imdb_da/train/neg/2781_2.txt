This is a movie that attempts a tale of Thai history located in the ancient city of Ayutthaya. I decided to watch this movie because I thought it was in line with many Thai movies I've seen and enjoyed, one that has Thai actors speaking Thai and martial arts. Well, that's none of that. This movie is shot in English, is chock full of anglo actors, and has production values ​​so horrible, it's ridiculously bad .... but not fun! Who can we blame for this nonsense? Play, dialogue and most of the sets were pretty bad. Some of the battle scenes looked as if they were choreographed by the local high school drama club. The special effects were also mostly bad, but a few were just cheap animations patched on the screen that gave a special cheesy effect. It has a large, epic style outdoor combat scene where a few thousand extras are going to run across a field of costume, but when we see the two armies colliding in battle - HA! What a joke! The film has a few beauties. It was a shame that they did not show a little more skin. At least it would have been something for the guys to appreciate. Do not want to.
