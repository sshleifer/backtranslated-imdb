This is a horrible movie, horrible script, poor direction and obscene ending. Also bad performances, except Clancy Brown, who is criminally underutilized here, and Michael Pollard. Watching this movie was purgatory - you do it to read enough bad movie karma to actually see a good one further down the line. <br /> <br /> The movie presents a father and son that look like they couldn't each have been related. That part of the male lead is not well-written and seems uncarismatic in this role. You can see the plot points one kilometer away. The act of the female leader and that of her brother, the policeman, also makes no sense. So a big action on her side at the end of the movie makes no sense script-wise.
