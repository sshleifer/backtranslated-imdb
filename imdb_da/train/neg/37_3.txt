Devil Hunter gained the reputation of being on the DPP 'Video Nasty' list, but it really didn't have to be. Many movies on the list, where there are only known reasons for God (and DPP), and although this is not the worst of the pile; There is not much here that guarantees prohibition ... which is a shame because I would never have put it through, not for the fact that it is on the 'shopping list'. The plot actually gives the film a decent base - or at least more of a decent base than most cannibal movies - and it follows an actress who is kidnapped and dragged in the Amazon jungle. A hunter is then hired to find her, but along the way he must brave the natives, led by a man who calls himself "The Devil" (hence the title). The movie simply goes for ninety-five minutes, and there are really not many scenes of interest. It's a shame that Jess Franco ended up making movies like this because the man clearly has talent; as seen by films such as The Diabolical Dr Z, Venus in Furs, Faceless, and she kills in Ecstasy, but unfortunately his good movies are just gems among heaps of shit and Devil Hunter is very much part of the crap. I saw this movie only because I could say I've seen everything on the DPP's list (just two more to go!), And I guess so, most others who have seen it saw it. But if you are not looking for Nasties; There really is no need to bother with this one.
