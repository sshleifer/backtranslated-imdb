This could have been a good episode, but I simply had to turn it off. The British representation was horrible to see. Have decision makers ever set foot in the UK before the movie? At least seen foot in England ?? I don't think any British person has had such an accent apart from a comedy shit of The Royal Family! Also with the 2 English boys ... well, I don't think any English boy has acted, talked or dressed like any English kid in Britain's history since Prince William and Harry's preteen public appearances. For American filmmakers. There are more than 1 countries in the UK. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland .. means more than 1 culture! I can handle some stereotypes, but it was so bad I couldn't see it. Brand so cool!
