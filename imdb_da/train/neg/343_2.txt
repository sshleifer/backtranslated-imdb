A truly genuine Canadian-German co-production plays the eternally wonderful Rosanna Arquette an actress whose teenage daughter redefines the term "problem child" - a few weeks before the "action" child murdered her father and mother took the fall of the descendants. Now she's moved up to the Northwestern US to start over, but her child still has a problem because she's devoted to her mother. So dedicated that she kills anyone who can be considered a threat to their bond. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mandy Schaeffer (like her daughter) kills more than people - she delivers such a terrible performance that she also dries out of the movie, even though the incoherent script, useless direction and horrible music (check out the saxophone for the first time she shows her bikini-dressed booth doesn't help anyone; We must find her sexy and scary, but she fails both sides. Almost completely unalluring and not even bad enough to be entertaining (not to mention the fact that Arquette and Schaeffer do not really convince as a mother and daughter), all included with Miss Arquette and Jurgen Prochnow, both of whom are worth much more than this and both of them (especially Rosanna) are the only reasons why anyone is sitting through this farrago. <br /> <br /> One of the manufacturing companies is called Quality International Films - not since the three-hour "Love, Lies And Murder" (from two short productions) there has been such a "you must be fun" credit.
