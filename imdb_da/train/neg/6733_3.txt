Exclamation marks in the title are appropriate, though an understatement. This movie doesn't just cry - it screams loud enough to break glass. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers Andrew and Virginia Stone made frightening, humorous thrillers striving for a semi-documentary feel. Here they shot at actual New York sites with tinny "real-life" acoustics to protrude into verisimilitude. But naturalism in the sound recording serves only to reinforce Stones' maladroit dialogue and mouth-shattering histrionics of tortured butterfly Inger Stevens. <br /> <br /> In a performance that lacks modulation, Stevens plays wife to electronics Whiz James Mason (looking and bored); both are held captive by the extortionate Rod Steiger (looking up and bored) and his slimy cohorts in a scheme to blackmail an airline with a deadly bomb, which Mason has ghastly helped construct. <br /> <br /> Here's another credibility training instance of a criminal mastermind so brilliantly aware of every detail, yet knuckleheaded enough to employ a drug-dependent degenerate as a undergarment. Stone's idea of ​​nailbiting excitement is to trap the hysterical Stevens alone with Benzedrine pop rapist Neville Brand, filling the frame with its sweaty, dull kisser. But the camera's work is so read, and Brand so (uncharacteristically) denies that the effect is hardly lurid, much less exciting. Stonesne, a square couple in the heart, does not even have the courage for their own lack of beliefs. <br /> <br /> The movie ending with Portly Steiger chases the fleethead Stevens on a subway track, so clumsy as its rough heavy. With Angie Dickinson as Steiger's amoral girlfriend Jack Klugman, Kenneth Tobey and Barney Philips.
