Anyone who could find redeeming value in this piece of crap should have their head examined. We have the entertaining, heroin-dependent, part-time hooker wife with lacerations across the body, lacerations received from repeated strokes of a violent son. Now she spreads breast milk all over the kitchen, where the release is somehow related to Helen Keller, who places her hands in running water. We have the man who starts accusing a prostitute who is just his daughter (she is sad because he came too fast) and ends by murdering her female colleague, having sex with her body and then picking her up . We have the child who is relentlessly bullied by his classmates and who comes home and beats his mother. You see it all is circular. Deep, huh? The only decent moment in this horrible pile is when the father kills his son's ailments. It's a good thing that this turkey was shot on video because otherwise a waste of expensive movies would be. If the guy who thinks that artists should be interested in this slop is really serious, most people wonder that artists are crazy. We watched this miserable movie and then put on "Zero Woman, The Accused." Oh, my God, it was a delusion about which one was worse. What happens in Japan these days? Sick, sick, sick.
