My mother holds a cassette of this movie as a general threat to any movie-loving person who annoys her. Everything about it stinks. <br /> <br /> As such, it is a true classic. <br /> <br /> Who gave it 10/10? Have you accidentally looked at a good movie and randomly voted for this? <br /> <br /> Everyone involved in the film making process must be forced to see at least a small section of this movie. It should be an indelible mark on the minds of all that keeps film, sacred, and reverent as the tide of Catholic destiny.
