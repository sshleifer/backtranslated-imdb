I basically found the Eden's Curve to be a very poorly designed that made it hard to see. But there is something I must say about how the instructor caught something about the atmosphere in the early 70s in choosing options and clothing. The philosophy "back to earth" and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs, which were not dramatically decadent, portrayed in many later versions of the 70s, were just as it was "do not ask tell" the pseudo-liberalism of the brotherhood of East Coast intellectuals, except that I would have thought this was more likely for a New England school than one in Virginia, where I imagine the "good ole boy" mentality still dominated elite schools like this one. Another thing I appreciated and related to is that this was a time when homosexuality was not so much attached to the leatherm or drag queens, and I appreciated some homosexual roles that were not related to these terribly overused images. I felt it was very unfortunate that "gay" took over some standard forms in the 80s out of Castro and Christopher Streets, and these defined the movement and omitted large numbers of gay men who were more subdued in their lifestyle. I appreciated the movie mainly as a way of remembering in a more natural way, we were dealing with our sexuality and personal relationships without the "scene".
