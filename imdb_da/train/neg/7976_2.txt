You believe in God, or you don't. You believe in Jesus, or you don't. You think he's the son of God or you don't. The choice is up to you. <br /> <br /> Director Denys Arcand has really done everything he could to bring Jesus back to a pure historical figure, social worker, son of two people, instead of the Son of God the Holy Spirit and Mary who opened heaven again for us. Encouraging the Big Bang, comes a world of evolution, rather than seeing the beauty of creation. The film depicts a theologian who brings some "modern finds" to the actor who plays Jesus in Passion Play, who happily incorporates them into his plays. The depicted priest who runs the sanctuary where Passion Play is performed in Montreal has a sexual relationship with one of the female players in Passion Play rather than showing his love for God through celibacy. More often than not, the director's disgust for the Church is clearly visible. The director has tried to create a parallel between the life of Jesus and the life of the Passion Play actors. This is an admirable attempt, but portrayal of the resurrection with the transplantation of the Passion Play actor's organs in other organs means how the instructor thinks of Jesus. My opinion is not important, the meaning of God is, but I do not want to stand in the shoes of the director and actors when they stand before the throne of Jesus.
