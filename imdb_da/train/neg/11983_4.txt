Marie Dressler carries this Depression era drama about a friendly bank owner who recently aired on TCM during their April Fools comedy month. If you come up with the expectation of great ridicule thanks to the Dressler-Polly Moran team, you will be disappointed as this really is a very downbeat movie. It is also very poorly made, surprisingly so considering it came from MGM. Leonard Smith's bare-bones film is strict from 'putting the camera up and not moving it' school, often to the detriment of the cast, which finds itself delivering lines out of the screen (it's like a pan and scan before it existed!) or has the head cut off. The film does not even have a credited instructor who is behind the apparently fly at night of production. All in all, it is an unsatisfactory mess, with Dressler often over-emotional, and only the bizarre, last coil dash for the bathroom to put it apart.
