Wow, I knew this movie would be bad, but not so bad. Spoilerific comments follow. <br /> <br /> Roddy Roddy Piper is a sick sweet retired politician (cliche!) who helps everyone - smiles like a post-op-lobotomy patient and complains about his dead son. His adopted son returns from armed forces "Special Ops" and because he is "seen things" - portrayed by tying teeth if anyone mentions anything about the past. Time to clean up the streets of another guy who once knew Piper and his dead son (who killed the bad boy) and his adopted son. <br /> <br /> Oh, the love interest is a beautiful young lady who decides no reason why she wants to jump on the leg of the former Army blocks. This happens in about 2 minutes of 1 scene. The action could have saved this movie, but it is even worse than the story and the play. It has all been done before, it has all been done much much better (Ong-Bak is a good example). This is the worst movie I've ever seen - and I've seen Waterworld twice. <br /> <br /> Erm, the movie called HONOR (misspelled for Americans) and the tagline has "from Bloodsport and Kickboxer makers" - check out director David Worth's second movie and you will soon realize why they put these 2 movies over there, even though they are over 10 years old. Such classics as "Shark Attack 3: Megalodon" - say it all right. <br /> <br /> I give you Â£ 10 if you don't go to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> PS - Sorry for not knowing sign names, telling you something yourself.
