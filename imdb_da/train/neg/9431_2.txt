Basically slasher movie premises, 3 young ladies destroy their car and end up being with a creepy family. Yawn. <br /> <br /> See 36 minutes of a snapshot of OJ's car chase with a white sedan instead of a bronco. Yawn. Old lady with hot and cold dementia controlling her daughter ... YAWN <br /> 23 minutes watching the actors eat - YAWN Trying to identify what they are eating ... OK that can be a drinking game here ... no - YAWN <br /> <br /> Free shower scenes ... OK I have a few seconds interest. random and uninspired killings ... YAWN <br /> <br /> It ends ... guy! that psycho is confused - why could the rest of the movie not be like the last 5 minutes ... unfortunately it is - my advice - fast to the last five minutes and see it and then put something good in the player - for me go I'm back to sleep.
