Spoilers <br /> <br /> WOW, END OF THE WORLD is a unique underwater movie experience. <br /> <br /> Here's the full story: A scientist gets messages from space (a la independence day). The messages say that things like a massive catastrophe are happening, and then the researcher later on the radio hears that a large earthquake has just happened in China. He begins to think that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world, so he tries to find out who is receiving the messages (and who also sends messages in space). He and his wife agree to find out that the messages come from a monastery. They visit it. Everything normally looks, including the pastor, played by a bored Christopher Lee. But the scientist is firm and really believes that the messages come from and go to that monastery. So he and his wife secretly go back to the monastery, where they are snooping around by foreigners, disguised as priests and nuns. They are against their will and the foreigner Lee plays forces the scientist to get something they need to return to their planet. When the foreigner gets that special element, foreigners all go one by one to their home plan in a kind of tacky-looking transport platform. Lee, the last stranger left, tells the couple that the land will be destroyed due to a sort of hokey decision by foreigners. Lee goes in the carrier and he's gone. The couple look at screens showing stockpiles of natural disasters that occur worldwide, deciding to follow aliens. Because the land is doomed, the couple sees no place to stay, so they go into the carrier and disappear. The last shot of the movie is a planet mache planet land exploding. The end. <br /> <br /> That's it. <br /> <br /> I've never seen such a boring movie in my life. It's the most underwhelming movie I've ever experienced. The researcher and his wife are two of the worst heroes or protagonists ever put on the screen. They don't care about anything. They see earthquakes on screens and determine "what dunk, who needs the earth anyway?" They don't even try to stop them or do anything to make things better. This kind of story could have worked if the movie had an overwhelming sense of punishment for everything, but the action and atmosphere are non-existent. The actors and the people behind this boring flick go through their steps so much that you can almost feel when they hit their cards when they came out and returned to work. I didn't expect much with this movie because it's a Charles Band production, but I didn't expect it to be that bad. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee was once asked what was his worst movie he ever made and he mentioned STARSHIP INVASIONS. Well, I'm sorry Chris, but STARSHIP INVASIONS was actually goofy fun. STARSHIP INVASIONS is horrible but terribly entertaining. END OF THE WORLD is very, very, very worst: it is beyond blunt and inert, with no entertainment value at all.
