My dear sir, what a movie! Let's talk about "special effects" first. Don't make me mistake here, I'm not one of those fanatics, but I really thought that overlaying was a practice for the long-standing past, mainly in the 60s. So for a while I thought they could have recorded this movie a long time ago and it took them forever to cut and release it. But as far as I know, they didn't have cell phones in the 60's ... What I'm looking for in movies is mostly a good story with a really good message. Acting is secondary, the effects are secondary, I am not even aware of a few inconsistencies. But in a movie like this bad play, adultery, etc. Add up to make a bad movie even worse - that's what happened to me with Celestine Prophecy. My wife said the book was actually really good, and although I am not in all the spiritual things, I can somehow see that it can be brought in a credible way - the film failed. <br /> <br /> There might be one reason to see this one though. If you really love cheesy movies, it will be right for you. If the IMDb stars were for cheesiness instead of quality, I must have rated this movie ten stars. By the way, three stars are the fact that there are worse movies out there, like "Critical Mass" (look up the comments on one - hilarious). Celestine Prophecy is at least entertaining to some extent.
