Unlike the two other current game shows (Deal Or No Deal and 1 vs 100), pacing in this show is far too slow for what happens on the screen. <br /> <br /> DOND and 1 vs. 100 can get away with slow pacing because the games can change tempo - or end - at any time. There is risk involved in any action that the player takes, the reward is wildly variable, and it is difficult for players to leave with a significant amount of money. Suspension is usually used for good use. <br /> <br /> Show me the money, on the other hand, is just too slow. When a question is revealed and it is obvious that the player knows the right answer, you can be sure that absolutely nothing exciting will happen in the next few minutes. It would greatly help the pace of this show to reveal the correct answer FIRST, and then the player has chosen a dancer, instead of Shat wasting time talking about what will happen if the player gets a wrong answer when we all know they are right. The random dance is filler that actually feels like a filler. Too much time is wasted while it is not enough ... and the fact that players cannot choose to finish the game early guarantees that there will be a lot of time wasted. Oh, and I have no one interested in watching Shat shake at his groove thang, especially after eating dinner. <br /> <br /> I am a lifelong game show fan, but I had a lot of trouble sitting through it for an hour. It requires either major changes or early retirement.
