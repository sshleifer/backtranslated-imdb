There are often poorly matched couples (in the general sense of the term) - in Huston's films: "African Queen" "Heaven knows Mister Allison" "Heaven's roots" "Misfits" ... "The Barbarian and the Geisha" (check the title) is another good example, so to speak. It seems that Japanese things were trendy at the time as such acts as "Sayonara" "Suzie Wong's World" and "August Moon's Tea House" witness. Houston's efforts may be the worst of this rather poor party (with the exception of "Susie" perhaps). John Wayne is perfect for Ford's world. In Huston he is like a bull in a Chinese store. His Japanese partner is quite boring. Although dramatic scenes (cholera epidemic) do not store the film from absolute boredom. Only those who are totally enchanted by Houston's work must choose this among all his other amazing films around.
