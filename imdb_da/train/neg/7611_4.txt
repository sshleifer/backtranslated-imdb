1. watched 2/28/2006 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Sydney Pollack): - DVD version I saw the title "3 Days of the Condor" - So so CIA drama full of accomplishments makes it a very laid-back movie. The story presupposes that about 7 out of 8 members of a CIA research group are killed with Robert Redford's sign, code name = Condor, which is the one that remained. Who killed them and why? That's what Redford is trying to figure out while trying not to be the 8th victim at the same time. Along the way, he gets involved with Faye Dunaway character, originally because he needs a place to hide, and eventually helps him after a little lovey dovey time. This is one of a handful of innocent guys on driving stories, but this one doesn't have a lot of excitement. The flat performance doesn't help, and the finish doesn't seal the audience enough either. Despite having a good director in Sydney Pollack and a group of classical artists, the story and the performances are not what they should be, and so the movie is not what it should be.
