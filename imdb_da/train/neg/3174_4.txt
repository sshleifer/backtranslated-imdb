Jeff Lowell has written and directed 'Over Her Dead Body' badly. The idea is first and foremost as old as my jokes, and the performance is just a cherry on the cake. Minus Eva Longoria Parker is almost nothing appealing in this movie. Eva looks good as ever and delivers a good performance. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd looks jaded and least interested. Lake Bell is a complete miscast. She looks masculine and delivers a strictly average performance. Jason Biggs is wasted, so is Lindsay Sloane. <br /> <br /> I expected entertainment more from this movie. Unfortunately I was not entertained.
