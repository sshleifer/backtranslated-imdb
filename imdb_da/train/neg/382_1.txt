Hail Bollywood and Men Directors! <br /> <br /> Really this is the ultimate limit of complete sacrifice made by Indian woman! <br /> <br /> See the current situation in India where the wives become more vicious day by day and very possessive of their husbands - the directors .. also called uncle scars (see movie The Lion King) brought a whole new concept of how both the preserved and the wife can live together happily ever after sharing everything between them ... including the spermines! History line: Married couple - very happy - but coincidentally there happens an accident and wife has an abortion - lost the fetus along with the ability to forever become a mother! <br /> <br /> Now in India, the law usually drives sister-in-law if she doesn't give them an heir! So the wife hits a big plane - surrogate mother ... but the scientists have intervened - "Safe artificial insemination" - NO said the artist (director actually) - "The neighborhood will know that sister-in-law is infertile so they go to surrogate mother! /> <br /> Neighbors! Society !! Gosh the same who watch Fashion TV day and night - see girls in the age group 14 to 40 ... all in bras and panties - well those neighbors suddenly take a upper hand in family planning and decision making ! <br /> <br /> So the wife sends her husband away to a beer bar where girls dance on stage - mostly uneducated and illiterate - but men love such women as they can satisfy their ego a lot! > <br /> He hires the leading dancer in the pub - asks her to carry her baby - in exchange for money - she agrees - she comes home - gets pregnant - wife and holds - both exist in the same house - meanwhile, the prostitute also the taste of the household l ife - so much caring fo lk around - she misses them all and cries quietly! Meanwhile, no one in the family comes to know that the real daughter-in-law roaming around with a pillow under her petticoat !! - The mother or other elderly people never took her to checkup - nor did they try to feel the baby's movements in the womb !!
