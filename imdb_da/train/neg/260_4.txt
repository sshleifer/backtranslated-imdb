Well, I can and will be very short. This is a wrongly balanced, non-compelling movie that could have been a little better. The script doesn't seem to know which way to go ... from fun to clich√©-wise serious ... it's a little silly. The plus for many phrases we've heard before "the hacker is in Florida, or no, he's in Madrid, no, he's in ... he screams the signal". <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
