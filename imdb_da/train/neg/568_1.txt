This "Debut" today on the SciFi channel and all I can say is "I'm speechless" I lost it today so I could see it tonight after work. I had great hopes. Now I turn the towers out and look for a length of rope so I can hang myself. Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen. I wish I could say something good as "It was fun to have fun with this movie", but this movie doesn't give me anything to work with. I know you should not send spoilers here without prior warning, but I still want "This movie sucks" There I said it! They should show this flick to film students to show them what NOT to do! My nine-year-old niece could make a better movie. The only decent thing about this movie is sound and / or soundtrack. OH! I just found a rusty C-clip in my old toolbox. I'll put it on my left hand's thumb and tighten it until the pain erases the memory of what my eyes have seen. I could just lose over this VHS, but I think I will burn it in the fireplace instead. I could wash with soap, but I fear I will never be clean again. Christmas is approaching. Buy this movie and give it to people you hate. -Mike
