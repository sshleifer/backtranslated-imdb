Nicole Eggert was listed as the star of this, despite the fact that Micheal Dorn & Stacey Keach were much larger stars than her. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is a bit of a spin on the "Alien Lands on Earth" movie. Eggert plays the girl who feels sorry that an Alien is being chased by the military and takes the shining creature into her very sexy disguise. A bit of sobriety and partial nudity, a meaningless sex scene are all underway. <br /> <br /> The movie stumbled through a couple of obvious sets and jokes about appearing photographs. I liked the Star Trek jokes when Micheal Dorn was taken over and he got a really cool death scene. It was quite obvious that Stacey Keach was going to be taken over and the movie was quite weak, it would have been nice to show exactly what kind of talent the foreigner went to Eggert.
