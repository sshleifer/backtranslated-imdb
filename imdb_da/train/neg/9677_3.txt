a place I would read that this movie should be a comedy. After seeing it, I would call it anything but. the point in this movie triggers me. the dialogue is extremely superficial and absurd, many of the sets seemed to be thoughtful, and despite all the nudity and implied sexual content, there is nothing erotic about this movie ... everyone is leaving me to wonder what this is about ! The title premise could have been the basis for a fun (if politically incorrect) comedy. Instead, we are treated to cheap, amateurish, unfinished sketches and depravity and weirdness for your own sake. if i want it, i will go buy a grace jones cd.
