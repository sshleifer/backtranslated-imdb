Due to budget cuts, Ethel Janowski (again played by Priscilla Alden) is released from a mental institution (though she killed six people) and was delivered to the Halfway House Hopp Bartholomew. Once there, she immediately goes back to her criminally insane ways and kills anyone who gets between her and her food. HOLY MOLY! Suck this movie! You know you're in trouble when the open credits start and they're just credits from the first movie, apparently downloaded from a TV screen. Nick Millard (under his pseudonym Nick Phillips) decided to return to Crazy Fat Ethel's world ten years later and with a budget likely to cover the price of a blank tape and a weekend camcorder rental. Let's just say that Millard's unique style doesn't translate well into video. Seriously, I made home videos with more production value than this. And Millard is trying to draw a SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT 2 by padding half of the playing time with the first movie footage (which looks like it was taken by a worn VHS copy). The age is again good as Ethel, but the film is so incomplete that you start to get bored of her to join this waste. I mean, at least the first movie tried. Here we have no music, weaker effects (if at all possible), shaking camera work, horrible sound and editing that looks like it was done with two video recorders connected. Avoid this at all costs!
