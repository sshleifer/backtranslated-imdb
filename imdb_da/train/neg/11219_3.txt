This was a film about adultery and revenge. A twin with the "twin" connection senses that something is wrong with her sister. This movie took forever to create the plot. A plot that has been done many times. The action was miserable for the most part. When the plot comes together, the movie ends. Laura and Ashley are twins who live with a violent father. The father seems to favor Ashley, so Laura is blamed for everything. There is a promise that the girls would never be separated, but as they grow up, their lives go in different directions. Ashley gets a job in a dining room where she meets Barry, a married man. Of course, nothing good can come of this. That Barry had tinnitus was a bad excuse for a way to track him down. I waited for this movie to get better and for some solution somewhere, but it never happened.
