I hear smoker about a future "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates Blu-ray Disc". With progress over the last 25 years ranging from Steady-cam to CGI, it will be interesting to see if the franchise can be revived. I just hope it helps remove the bad taste left in my mouth with the entire Magnavision demonstration failure. And yes ... "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates Betamax VCR" was an excellent milestone in entertainment history. After the preliminary "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates Compact Cassette" and the actually sticky "Leonard Nimoy demonstrates 8-Track Tape", who would have expected such a brilliant piece of cinema? I'm crying right now just thinking about it.
