Poorly done Terrible action and an end that the director seemed to get out of nowhere, as the film was honestly nothing boring. Shocking that this movie is considered a prize at the Gij√≥n Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Anyone who came out of the theater was of the same opinion as I - what was the point of making the movie itself? The references to Iraq were either bizarre or just not well thought out. I am surprised that this movie has been released - very, very disappointing and a waste of time. Sorry, terribly negative review, but hopefully it will discourage some people from making the same mistake. It was a pity that we did not have a Q and A at the end of the movie - now it could have been interesting.
