SPLIT SECOND could have been a good movie. A story of a "rage" murder, has a very young Clive Owen, giving a pretty good performance; BUT ... but .... Unfortunately, the filmmakers filmed their own movie with idiotic camera work and really horrible editing. The camera skips the creation in an unsuccessful attempt (I assume) to reflect Owen's stress from business, family and traffic. What it really does is give the viewer a headache. Since the filmmakers did not make a good movie, but only to impress each other with their idiotic photography, one should not waste time on this travesty.
