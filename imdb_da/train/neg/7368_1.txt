I had the accident of wasting 10 pounds to buy SS new movie on DVD: Attack Force. Now I can usually suspend my belief in watching movies like this. A pinch of salt and some beers on a dark evening on the couch watching a noisy late night shoot em up is perfect for a single alpha man like me. I bought this movie thinking I'd see cool martial arts and shoot them up. <br /> <br /> Do I have hell. Segal is old and bloated, the plot was ridiculous even by SS standards and to cope with everything from Segal's play (as it was to begin with) is unusually fierce. So violently, half of his voice was called by a man who sounded nothing like him. Either the SS can't trade anymore (a moot point) of the crew was so horrible in their job that they couldn't record the sound properly. The voice will shift back and forth between Whisper Segal and the man who makes Honda headline headlines! Suddenly, the problem is not because most action films work with the same premise as this one, nothing new there. The usual mix of characters that will die terribly like gunfire and stereotypical bad guys waiting to be blown away. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as if you would avoid going ahead of a speed train or a dose of H5N1 bird flu. <br /> <br /> Exfoliate garbage. <br /> <br /> 1/10 <br /> <br /> This has been a health warning.
