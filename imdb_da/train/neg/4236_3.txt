Well, if you like pop / punk, punk, ska, and a bit of modern psycho billy, then live shows of the only thing worth seeing. This movie has tons and tons of bands coming along with the president of Troma, Lloyd Kaufman as a semi-major role, and lots of stupid death scenes. It sounds like it can be good, right? Now deaths continue, and repeatedly to many different bands of the Warp Tour and the fans at the event. Some of the deaths begin stylishly, but then they are reused again and again, to the point of being completely repetitive. Almost everyone dies of having their heads broken or their intestines being pulled from their stomachs. Gore looks like it was from Andreas Schnaas' "Zombie 90: Extreme Pestilence"; with this is the "watered type of blood", but now the film is actually decent and gives humor something that this movie is terribly lacking. Well, the movie is made by Doug Sakmann from Troma, it has a great low budget potential, and it tries ... but just too hard. Everything is too expensive to be fun in this movie, and that's what brings it down. Everything tries to be for comics and goofy using intentional bad acting, overuse of meaningless deaths, and doing the same ... over and over again. It's basically "Mulva: Zombie Ass-Kicker", "Chairman of the Board" or a movie you've made with your friends: it's fun for those who did it and it's about it. <br /> <br /> Great potential, good idea, great use of effects - but that's the same ... over and over again: A band player, a band dies, fans die. All die, blood is sprayed everywhere, the process is repeated. <br /> <br /> The question is for these types of movies - which are basically 'bad flap-stick' they try too hard or not at all?
