So this movie, when it first appeared in the 1970s and hated, hated, hated it! Easily the most booooring movie I've ever seen in my life. Don't know where Leigh got his inspiration, but it is one of those movies where you will shake the characters to make them open their mouths and communicate. The title says it all because there are no saved moments in this movie, just long, long postings with people who are unable to articulate what they presumably feel. If you want to see something that will drive you to drink then this is for you. If you have nothing better to do for two hours, keep a fork in a toaster: the experience will be infinitely more enjoyable than anything you get from this! Yes, Leigh came up with a lot of really good things much later in his career, but give this a cheeky.
