Steven Seagal .... how could you be part of such a horrible movie? I rented this movie because your movies have usually been pretty clean. I've lost a lot of respect for being in a horrible movie like this. Very, very bad taste! I'm embarrassed that I rented this movie myself. Steven, if you continue to appear in movies like this, I think your career is over. My husband and I have enjoyed seeing many of your movies because you can always "get the bad guy" with a few hand maneuvers and clean it ... and also the language is pretty clean in your movies ... but This is something else. I think twice before renting another movie of yours.
