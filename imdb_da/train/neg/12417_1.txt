Any movie that begins with a cowhand shagging a female calf cannot promise much. As for the stereotype of kibbutz as it was 50 years ago, I was there and it just wasn't like that. OK every kibbutz had just a tiny piece of something shown in the movie (as the young raider kitchen at night), but you can't show the whole kibbutz as being full of all of them - let's say - cheeky moves. Each kibbutz had its own problems but almost no kibbutz had them all. Israel's views were great. I still remember my youth in the Garden of Eden, called Emek (Valley). Yes, and the play was also good, so you see it wasn't quite black - just a wrong portrayal - probably also for that purpose.
