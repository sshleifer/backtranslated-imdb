Rajkumar Santoshi undoubtedly has directed the greatest movies and biggest box office hits of Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> This movie falls short of all expectations like this movie star Two Great Actors Mr. Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar and when you have these two actors in the same movie you are going to make a Magnum Opus. In the later part of the movie, you can see that Amitabh Bachchan's voice has been doubled by another person who was due for his illness. <br /> <br /> Although the film didn't have proper character development as well as filmography, it wasn't good and one thing that Bollywood should learn is that they only need visual effects when needed and when applied with a high budget. The script had so many errors that give the viewer excuses to join his phone call rather than watching the movie. The new comers shake their legs well, but could not act Well, but where the movie loses much time, The Storyline is Manus and Cine matography. <br /> <br /> A talented actor like Bhoomika Chawla has been wasted in the movie as well as Sushant Singh. <br /> <br /> But every director in his career makes a bad movie. <br /> <br /> So watch it only if you are a fan of Multi-Starrer Flop movies.
