Alfred Hitchcok is not my favorite instructor in any way but imagine what he could have done with this! The reason has great potential for excitement. John Garfield is almost always excellent and Raymond Massey is scarily cast against type. Nancy Coleman is not a very impressive leading lady, but the support aids are big and very skilled. <br /> <br /> Yes, it starts to look pretty early. There are too many coincidences. And an important issue is trivialized by being made to a little more ultimately than a love story. It is fun to look for Garfield, Massey and the characteristics. But it's not terribly good.
