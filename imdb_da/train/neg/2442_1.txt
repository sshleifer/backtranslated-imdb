I do not know why I continue to do this for myself !! I continue to defend the Dutch and Belgian cinema and claim that it needs more credit and chances ... and then they taste you around the head with junk like this! Intensive Care is a terrible production and probably the worst ever done in the Dutch-speaking countries. It's a Dutch attempt to create our very own horror franchise, which is clearly based on mainstream American slasher classics like Friday 13th and Halloween. The producers and the authors were very high with this, but fell very low. Intensive Care became an embarrassing product for everyone involved and therefore a true cool flick here. It is almost impossible to hunt an original copy of this and it is only shown on special occasions, such as "The Distaste Night". For exactly 5 minutes, Intensive Care tries to tell a story and even make a plotline ... then it turns into a lax and low brain slash film with cruel - but very hilarious and cheap - make-up effects. The action of the entire cast is abominable even though there are a few respected names involved. The leading male role is played by Koen Wauters ... This guy may as well be the most famous and beloved artist in Belgium. He is a beloved singer, host of television shows and idol of many young girls. He never ever mentions this thing he stares into. Like everyone else in the Netherlands, he tries to convince himself. Intensive Care has never happened.
