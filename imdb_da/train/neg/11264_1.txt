I have not yet decided whether this will replace Anaconda as "The worst movie I've ever seen". <br /> <br /> Even if you ignore the risky accents, low production values ​​and shaky camera work, this movie has absolutely nothing for it. I only went to see what I had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot in a 2 hour movie. The simple answer is - they didn't. Characters appear with little to no explanation as to who they are and then continue to play no valuable part in the story. Even the protagonists work without reason, so when the movie reaches its climax, you don't care what happens to any of them. <br /> <br /> I can accept that books have to be rewritten occasionally to fit into movies and that it may be unfair to judge this movie against the book from which it was adapted. But after my friends and I got out of the cinema, I had to spend most of the home explaining what had happened. <br /> <br /> They even change the true meaning of the book "Rancid Aluminum" by squeezing it into yet another relentless voice over so they can allow the movie to have a cool title. <br /> <br /> A real mess in a movie from start to finish.
