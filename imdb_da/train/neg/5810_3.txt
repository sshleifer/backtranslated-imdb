SPOILERS ALL: <br /> <br /> Gettaway is mostly an action movie. And what action is there for !! Shootouts, chases, dumpsters and much more. It's stars Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin as Mc Coy's. <br /> <br /> This is a remake and I haven't seen the original but really doesn't care about this one, though Bassenger and Baldwin have some fine screen chemistry. But the film itself didn't do it for me. <br /> <br /> Gettaway was really tiring very quickly. The plot is overshadowed by a fight / hunt for the other, and as the violence continues to pour, Bassenges and Baldwin keep their beautiful appearance, whatever the dangers they may be in. . I don't think Bassenger's eye makeup moves once during the whole picture. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I have ever seen, certainly not, but it is not very good and unless you are an action movie purist I can't really enjoy this movie because it just isn't much here. The Gettaway is also not horribly original and goes from unnecessarily brutal to pretty boring. It really could have been better, I think. Pools and Baldwin give OK performances, but they do not have much to do, except to be chased and run for their lives. Sometimes less is after seeing the same thing over and over it becomes outdated. Didn't enjoy this much.
