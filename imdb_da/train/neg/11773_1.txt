I've come out of several years wondering about these records because of the sheer lack of intelligence communicated through the reviews that appear regularly on the movie's IMDb space. I watched this movie greeted by the metro cinema's new york Asian film festival (which had an otherwise excellent selection of movies this year, see vital, snake in June, CHA NO AJI, Survive Style) and regretted every day that one scene from that movie I'm sure you can read a laudatory summary of the movie from Subway Cinema, which is probably why I made the mistake. to draw my friend to the movie. The description built up the kind of horror movie that I had been craving for a while, one that is dependent on pure terror rather than cheap horror. P was actually different. It prides itself on cheap grin. The incredibly annoying announcer described this movie as "Lesbians Team Up to Fight Monsters." Absolutely untrue. There is a sub-plot built into this movie to make it seem as if the relationship between the girl and Pookie actually goes somewhere. More lies. This movie seems like a card made for "Are you afraid of the dark?" The story is ridiculous and only managed to evoke laughter and confusion from the audience after they finally made their attempt to see this movie in some form seriously and try to forget the $ 9 they wasted at the door. I almost wished Paul spurrier was in the audience so I could laugh at him and ask him why he wasted 5 years in Thailand to make a bad softcore horror-cum porn that belongs to the spice channel, which only managed to get the actress excommunicated from his family and caused a minor stir at the Belgian film festival. The only touch that this was due to was a gargle in the small intestine, as it could not extract from the treasure it is. Anyway, I hope I can dissolve someone from making the serious mistake of watching this movie. It was really one of my top 3 worst movie experiences that knocked out soulplane to number 2.
