This is perhaps the worst attempt at a zombie movie I have ever had the accident to see. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Of course, any review found on this site is the work of the film maker, filmmaker, or friend of a filmmaker. How does this movie suck? Let's count the road ... <br /> <br /> The reason? Incoherent. Dialogue? Atrocious. I will not slam the effects / gore as I understand this is low budget. But was there even a zombie that wasn't overweight? C'mon! And for a movie in Rhode Island, why did that truck have a Massachusetts record? Continuity, find some. <br /> <br /> The girl dances while the soldier stands "on the alert". Please put your ex-boyfriend or friend's sister in your movie naked. This was a nasty movie filled with ugly people and has nothing to mention yet Romero on the cover. Next time you decide to make a movie, don't.
