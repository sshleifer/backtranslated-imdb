This movie only gets another star because I work in the center and liked to see it destroyed. The effects were pretty good - I heard it was the most expensive Korean movie ever made. Being the most expensive and still horrible makes it a massive waste of money. I rented it so I won't complain too much about what I paid, but it was a few hours that I never came back. Plot holes in abundance. horribly acting across the board. I do not recommend giving you time to watch this movie, life is too short. If your friends want to see this, run away. I can't stress enough how bad this movie was. <br /> <br /> Where did the other dragon come from? Why didn't he show up before? How did they get rocket launchers on dinosaurs just 500 years ago?
