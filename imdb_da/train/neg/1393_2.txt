I thought seeing job videos on corporate compliance was boring. This movie didn't go anywhere fast. What could have been a somewhat cheesy half-hour twilight episode, turned into a seemingly endless waste of movies on people who parked their cars, a picture of a guy's swimming pool (he must really answer his phone by the way) a dot matrix printer sit down jobs, and Heuy and Louey sit in a yellow light control room that repeats "T minus 10 and counts" as if something exciting will happen. It's not so, don't get your hopes up. The best thing about this movie is watching James Best and Gerald McC, in something other than famous TV personalities, and it stretches to find something good. And don't get me started on the music, which was completely composed of a Tympani, some great marine mammals and microphone feedback. This movie is as close as I have given one yet, but it gets 2 because I could actually finish this insomnia cure and didn't have to leave in the middle. AVOID ALL COSTS.
