With these people failing so many shots, using old footage and gas animals to get them out, not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a created set of actors, what do you think? Old movies of countries are nice, but animal cruelty and indigenous degradation are painful to see in these films. I know, racism is okay in these old movies, but there's more to make this couple lose credibility. Portrayed as airmen, they never flew their plane, Martin Johnson was an ex-vaudevillian, used friends like Jack London for financial gain, while stiffening them of royalties, denying his wife's apparent depression and using her as a sweet prop, all this does These films are unbearable. They were by no means the first to travel to these countries, or the first to write about them. He was OK as a filmmaker and photographer, but it's about it.
