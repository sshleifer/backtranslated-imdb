I usually enjoy Loretta Young's early films: her plays were light and soft and she knew how to wear clothes. But this is just a loser from the word, with the exception of Glenda Farrell's fun support swing. Young is a hat-check girl who speaks to her writer (Paul Lukas) to become a master bridge user. It's not the most cinematic of games, and the long talkie part where their marriage falls apart is just about the movie. However, there is an interesting bit. As Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk start their climate game, a series of quick shots show aircraft, trains, football matches, even a diver in the middle of the air and freeze in anticipation of the event. It's the earliest use of a freeze frame I've seen in an American movie. Wanting the rest of it was inventive and fun.
