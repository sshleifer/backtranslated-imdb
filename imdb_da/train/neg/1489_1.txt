This started badly, got worse, and when the girl attacked the old lady at the end, I literally wanted to take the DVD to the person we borrowed it and choked C ** T to death with it. Avoid this movie, a little good movie and some naked shots, would be almost acceptable if I was 14 and hadn't seen Jenna Jameson naked a million times. If someone feels like watching this movie, I would highly recommend that you use the time more appropriately, as an example I would say trying to slam a Lego house in your bum without lube would be a good start. I hear that this movie was not the original version, I would very much like to see the original, as it appears that this carved version lacks the whole plot, and apparently most of the nudity, someone can tell me how to get in touch with Christian Viel he owes me one hour in my life back!
