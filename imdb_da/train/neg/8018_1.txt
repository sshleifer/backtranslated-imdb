Wow, I hated this movie. The subject should have resulted in a really nice movie, and the main actor was absolutely sensitive and talented enough to handle the subject, but the script - if even a * script - is a mess. This is less a movie than a random slide show that doesn't go anywhere. I will say it does not go fast, except that it is actually the longest 81 minutes you will ever pass through. As I have mentioned, the main actor is good. Then Faruza Baulk (SP?), As his sometimes-harsh but ultimately loving and accepting mother. The film producers have a lot to answer here, because it's a mess. A real shame because I really liked this movie, but it is basically a movie that was never made. Skip this one - it wasn't even worth the $ 6 I had to pay for the pay-per-view.
