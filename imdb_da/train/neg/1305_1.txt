"Demons III: The Ogre" is not related before-successor is on "The Demons" and "The Demons 2 is cool hip horror 1980 classic." Demons III: The Ogre is very stupidly bored, cheap monster. confuse that the author is "Demons III: The Ogre" (Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are poor quality writers and stupid, as the bored William Shakespeare ghost or the demon's egg from the Spiders web or what Huhuhuhuhu makes the girl dream). I'm very sorry, very very very boring movie. I bought The special DVD box called "Demons" on the 3 different movies called "Demons III: The Ogre", "The Other Hell" and "Black Demons" have not closed captions and Subtitles cost $ 14.99 from Best Buy- the shop in the town of Downey. Why Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are bad quality writers who make the silly movie almost like "Halloween III", do not have Michael Myer monster, but the people carry Halloween. I'm very confused. I really love "The Demons" and "Demons 2 is better the boring stupid" D emons III: The Ogre "is not part of" The Demons "and" The Demons 2 "are the same demons. <br /> <br / > Thank you Juan Antonio De La Torre
