Genie (Zoe Vibration) arrives in Egypt to visit her hypocritical, Bible-quoting archaeologist (William Finley) and draws the attention of a group of culture led by a descendant of the Marquis de Sade (Robert Englund). Englund also plays the Sade in flashbacks, ranting in his cell. Genie is led astray by Mohammed (Juliano Merr), who drives a horse and Sabina (Alona Kamhi), a bisexual who introduces her to opium smoking, leading to a wild hallucination with topless harem dancers, a woman who simulates oral sex on a snake, an orgy and her father preach in the background! Meanwhile, they decorate black hat cult members, elaborate on eyeballs and slits in the neck. When Genie releases drugs into her tea, she imagines the seeds that hang from a cross, a gold-painted woman in a greenish g-string and even bloody on a snake-covered bed. It's all because she's the reincarnation of the Sade's lost love. This typically cunning Harry Alan Towers production is superfluous, seedy and rather meaningless, but the sets, costumes, cinematography and location work are all good and at least there is always something going on. <br /> <br /> Result: 3 out of 10
