Really good movie, but not a true story. Rubin "Hurricane" Carter was a notorious liar, a murder and was never found guilty. New Jersey State just did not go for the third time that 20 years had passed. Carter received an offer in 1976: "Pass a lie and go free". He didn't take it. This movie should never have been made, but money speaks. Many people have been unfairly spending their lives in prison and undoubtedly more black than white. Why choose a fake story? <br /> <br /> Jens
