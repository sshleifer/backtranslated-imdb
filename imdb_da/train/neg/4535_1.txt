slow, incomprehensible, boring. Three enthusiastic words describing the books' films. This is certainly a case where the film should never have been made at the expense of the book. The best part of the movie was nature, excellent. The worst part was the slow moving interactions between the actors, combined with endless meaningful eyes. The editing is abrupt and uneven. Despite this, the actors have worked very hard at least trying to be a bit credible with a terrible script. It was striking that even though it was in Peru, there was hardly a Peruvian descent that walked around the set - even in the flashback scene depicting Peru in the 17th century. If you have any sense of history, try to avoid this movie.
