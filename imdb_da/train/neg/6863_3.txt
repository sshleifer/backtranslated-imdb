Oh my God, I give this movie three stars out of ten for the following reasons. The final sequence is once again handled quite efficiently and it was quite fun. That's what it gets the three points for. Other than that, it was terrible. It was not meant to be so much fun, so much is obvious, but the duplication, the double voices, the dialogue they said, how often hilarious. The actions performed and / or not performed also lead to much hilarity and / or throwing things on the screen. as when the whole town is slaughtered, and a small group of people are standing on a balcony that looks as if they were watching a cooking glass, or the "attempt" escapes from the church where they are piercing. <br /> <evil mayor: I think something is going on outside so you have to go upstairs and look out the window. <br /> <br /> Hero: ok. <br /> <br /> Evil Mayor: Now my chance of getting some idiots to go outside and flame with the fire is ineffective and get hacked up. <br /> <br /> Insert sequence where this happens. evil mayor: enemy, wait, i wanna get this little kid and she will go outside and cry dad apparently obvlious to the rat bodies not just scary strangers but are actually zombies without flesh or skin or anything and she wants lead them away and i will escape! Insert the order where this happens. Hero (upstairs): he tries to escape again, fool, and he has left the door open, he's silly, it's a great view. <br /> <br /> woman: where's my daughter? hero (below now): I do not know I can not see her anyway, and she was not outside because I could not see her despite being out there and I have a look at the whole neighborhood and she is standing outside , where in the elves could she be? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, anyone would throw things on the screen after 10 minutes. So watch the first movie with a couple of friends, get a few drinks, and make sure that when you look at this, you're completely blind and can just giggle at the stupidity of it all. and there was not even any decent doing, such a shame.
