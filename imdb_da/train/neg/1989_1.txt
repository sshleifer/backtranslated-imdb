I would have liked to have given this movie a zero but it was not an option !! This movie sucks !!! The women can't act. I should have known it would suck when I saw Bobby Brown. No one in my house could think that I hadn't changed the channel after the first 15 minutes. The idea of ​​black females as gunslingers in Western days is ridiculous. It's not just a race thing, it's also a gender. The combination of the two things is ridiculous. I'm sorry because some of the people in the movie aren't bad actors / actresses, but the movie itself was horrible. It was not credible as a movie. It can be 'entertaining' for a particular group of people, but I'm not in that group. laugh out loud. and using a good line from a great, great movie ... "that's all I have to say about it."
