One of the funny men, Eddie Murphy's smaller movie, is surely this nonsense about a kidnapped mysterious child, three hundred year old dragons and a "Featured One". Murphy is the "Selected", and as the opening song suggests, he is "the best man in the world". A finder of lost and missing children, he is approaching a mysterious Tibetan woman (Charlotte Lewis), telling him that he is "The Selected" and that it is his destiny to find and save "The Golden Child". For if the child were to die, pity would die with him as he is the bearer of mercy. <br /> <br /> If all this hocus pocus has not broken it for you now, it will probably start the movie. Suffice it to say that the plot is abominable and destroys the entire movie. Presumably being another vehicle for Murphy's selfish humorous humor (the comedy is not that great mind you), the movie fails at many levels. Even Charles Dance as the evil Sardo Numspa cannot do much for a cause. Very stupid and disappointing. <br /> <br /> Sunday, December 12, 1993 - T.V.
