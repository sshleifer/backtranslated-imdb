I have to tell you right in front, I'm definitely not an authority on Bollywood movies and have only seen a handful. But if you have never seen one, do not start with this! I have very much enjoyed those I have looked up to this, but I just couldn't stand here. I must also tell you in front that I couldn't finish this movie - it was so annoying. So why was it so annoying? <br /> <br /> 1. There is a character named 'Rambha' in the movie. He is even more annoying than Jar-Jar Binks - which I would never have thought would have been possible. He is so # @ ^! # Annoying !! He spoke in a falsetto voice, and I think it was supposed to be comical relief. Instead, he just tore my nerves and wanted him to die ... slowly! His voice, his mannerisms and his discomfort - he just didn't seem to stop and dominated every scene he was in - and he had to die! <br /> <br /> 2. The heroes had the amazing ability to dodge AK-47 bullets with ease. I don't ask you - there was a scene where several unarmed guys took a little army with guys with these assault rifles !! And again and again they avoided taking a single ball and looking up ruffians !!! This made Stallone's actions in "Rambo II" look earthly !! <br /> <br /> 3. The movie was so gosh-darn high, in your face and intense - it almost made my brain bleed !! It was as if the film was made by people under the influence of meth !! Crazy camera angles, INTENSE music and action, action, action ... This movie is clearly designed for someone who can't take a movie with plot and wants almost 100% action. <br /> <br /> 4. The two main characters and their actions and motivations made no sense ... no one at all! <br /> <br /> Perhaps if you are the most disgusting act and Bollywood fan, you can stand this movie, but I can see why it is on IMDb's infamous Bottom 100 list. Wow ... this movie is bad and very bad !!
