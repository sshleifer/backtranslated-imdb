Blue Monkey (1987) or 'Invasion of the BodySuckers' as it is known here in England was a rather boring horror movie about an old man being bitten in a greenhouse by a mysteriously poisonous plant !! The man gets rushed to the hospital where this worm as creature comes out of the mouth, of course this turns into this insect monster and continues to go on rampage !! Despite the fact that Steve Railsback and John Vernon were in the movie, I found it boring, with a flat predictable story, unattractive characters, cheap special effects and lack of action! Horror fans really don't have to track down this rare movie, you won't miss much confidence in me !!! I give this movie 2/10.
