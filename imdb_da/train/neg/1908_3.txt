Yet another insult and slap in the face of gay men everywhere. This lame attempt at a comedy has nothing to recommend it. Once again, we have an attractive 'just' hero who apparently cannot get any woman interested in him. Yeah right! And we are also presented with the "sympathetic, attractive" gay friend who is actually a fat, bald, ugly old man who should find the manager attractive. Even I didn't find him appealing, and I'm a fat, ugly old gay man (but fortunately not balding)! No matter what talent is here, it has been thrown away in a bad script and really horrible direction. Sir. Sneedeker must be banned from cinema, but then he is no different than the countless other hacks working in Hollyweed.
