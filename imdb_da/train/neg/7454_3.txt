I like to throw a lot, but the story kind of unfolds quite slowly. Danny Glover does a good job so you wonder if he's the bad guy. Meanwhile, the other characters are just part of the story. Dennis Quaid didn't have as much space in the story as he could have had. I thought the first scene was a little over the top grim compared to how the story unfolded. I would see it again though. I rated it a 5 (wish I could rate it a 5.5)
