The opening sequence will show the legion arriving in Paris on November 13, 1918. The troops pull off the train - wearing the uniform where the French army, including the legion, marched into war in 1914! This is a sure sign that the war flicker you are seeing will be a turkey. (The French Army realized in 1915 that war in red pants and dark blue outerwear did not work. Metropolitan French troops were put in "horizon blue" and colonial troops were put in khaki.) Claude Van-Damme (sp.) Remake at least got the uniforms more or less right. Really is too bad when directors make these kinds of mistakes when they go to everything to get other things right.
