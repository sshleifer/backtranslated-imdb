[*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***] This film is the reputation before it, so I was expecting to see it in the mailbox on TCM. What a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> Casting is great and the production values ​​are top notch, but the characters are without depth, the plot is thin and everything goes too long. For a film dealing with alcoholism, family departments, adultery, gambling, and sexual oppression, the film is curiously flat, prosaic, lifeless, and cliché. One example is the depiction of Frank Hirsch's unbelief: his rather strong request to his wife to "go upstairs and relax a little" followed by her predictable speech on headaches, leads - even more predictably - to his evening relationship with his secretary ( "Hey Nancy, I have blues tonight. Let's go on a drive"), all according to well-managed formula. We do not feel that they are real people, but cardboard cuts that appear in a puppet show. Also the source of the obvious friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch is never really explored or explained. Dave's transformation with Gwen is again inexplicable in view of her bold inability to ward off or get out of the pot. His subsequent marriage of desperation to the Shirley Maclaine / Ginny character, from the moment he was presented to this viewer, is apparently doomed to failure, and it was clear - by the conventions of this type of soap opera - that it could only be resolved by to be killed. The moment the jealous lover began to run around with the gun, I started to bet on who - Dave or Ginny - would be killed. It all was fake with a capital 'P'. <br /> <br /> That said, Maclaine's performance and dean Martin's standouts are here. But on the whole I find the film's interest to be pure as a period in Hollywood history.
