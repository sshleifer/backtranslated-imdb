If at least the cruelty and drawn-out deaths had a purpose in history justify their involvement, but the script was just incomprehensible and just stupid. <br /> <br /> It went nowhere, history had no readable continuity. It was just a bunch of drawn meaningless snuff scenes and a really stupid end ended as saying. "The end * beeps * you my hates and my few defenders to see my trash can." <br /> <br /> I don't get it, a masked murderer who has never had his mask removed in prison, a prison ramp scene that was supposed to be the guards who raped an ugly deformed serial killer and killed him and nothing other things? no explanation, no punishment, a really weak main body character that was a waste of an actor like Pare, who did not try to extinguish the guy who killed his police, tortured a baby, a woman and a dog and sent them to you to see on video. Cops, who for some unknown reason walked in the dark by itself (individually) in his farmhouse at night as a bunch of badly written teenage characters to be killed one by one as a bunch of idiots, and no other policeman hears them die in the dark, one after another, and just keep walking around for no reason until they are killed. <br /> <br /> A lot of horrible real animal sniffing scenes in the beginning with no reason or explanation, he was reminiscent of, he looked at masturbating, was it comedy for him ... what was that? no Boll just thought of throwing it in to disturb animal lovers .. whatever. <br /> <br /> when Pare believes in a psychoprase's word to let his family go if he kills himself ... a more equal, stupid policeman, you never saw in a movie. <br /> <br /> I dunno why I'm not trying to completely hate his works. I'm trying to find some reason to explain a horror writer art, but this thing ... pure crap. <br /> <br /> Ball what do you do more? I hope you find out because I know many more deserve people who can't dream of getting the budget you get over and over again to make their movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Boll actually by his best check "post" it was actually okay.
