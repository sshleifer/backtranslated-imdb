I don't think a movie from Van Damme will beat Universal Soldier, but you never know. This movie was good but not as good as 1st. The CEO returns a Luc & must make a fight again. He's trying 2 b fun here, but it's worth an alley of a chuckle. The CEO has a child this time from Ally W. Well it showed a picture of them. 2. Goldberg was cool, he made his famous move - forgot what it's called because I didn't see wrestling sucks. The CEO & Goldberg had some good matches. It was the end of the 1st, but just not that good. The CEO does his best in his career, as always - HELICOPTERKICKEN. Although the final end should have been longer. Anyway, it's worth seeing, but it will never top the original.
