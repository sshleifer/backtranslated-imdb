Someone had a good idea: Let's have Misty Mundae do his own, R-rated version of Lara Croft - shoot two weapons not only in skimpy outfits, but also topless. It was really a good idea. The problem is that the people who had it couldn't make any kind of script or budget to support it. Therefore, we get a "film" that almost does not achieve medium length by playing many of its parts (often in slow motion) and apparently shot completely inside a garage. Misty Mundae's appeal is still evident: she is incredibly sweet and has a natural girl-next to beauty. But her two female co-stars here, with whom she shares a long lesbian scene, are not near her league. If "Mummy Raider" was presented as a Youtube video, I would rate it higher, but as a "movie" intended for DVD usage, it cannot get more than 1/2 a * out of 4.
