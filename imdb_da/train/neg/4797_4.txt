After the boss, Vic Moretti (late great Anthony Franciosa), kills his lady who has cheated him with Derek, their new driver / Vietnam veterinarian, and blames it on the poor guy, Derek finds himself in jail where he has to fight a corrupt guards, Vic's inmate who runs the prison, and, oh yes, illegal trials carried out by a shady CIA agent (great genre and first-time director John Saxon) to turn different prisoners into super-human invincible zombies. Of course, things have gone out of hand, and it's up to Derek and the rest of the unchanged prisoners to save the day after the infected prisoners. <br /> <br /> John Saxon is a great talented actor & as a Saxon director is a ... great talented actor. Saying this movie (John's only direct excursion to date) lacks a certain visual flair would be a bit of understatement. However, the film is not entirely without profit. The dialogue, while idiotic, is just bad enough to be humorous sometimes. Unfortunately, it is not really enough for the film to coast past alone and it takes forever that the film itself begins to enter its own (which is quite late in the film). As such it is most I can recommend this movie to say that if you are a fan of saxon (which I actually am), it is worth looking at, just go in with low expectations, and you must be fine. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dana Lis Mason and Tane McClure get topless <br /> <br /> My character: D +
