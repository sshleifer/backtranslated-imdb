Claire Denis movie seems to fall into one of two categories: the violent and bloody or the quiet and intimate. "L'Intrus" certainly falls into the first category, but it's not as terrible as "Trouble Every Day" or "J'ai pas sommeil." <br /> <br /> Now, since I saw "Chocolat" I made it a point to see every new movie Denis does. And I've always been disappointed. "L'Intrus" was no exception. She has not yet made a film as personal and who moves as her first. <br /> <br /> You get many of the Denis regulars: an older but still magnificent Béatrice Dalle, who only seems to be in the movie to show her full lips, the gap between the teeth, her big split and a couple of lovely coats; the black guy from "Trouble Every Day" and "J'ai pas sommeil", Grégoire Colin, and the Lithuanian or Russian girl. Michel Subor's character was interesting enough, but the camera lay on him for so long that I was annoyed by the curly anchoring of hair hanging over his forehead and was relieved when I found somewhere in Korea that he finally got it cut. <br /> <br /> There was certainly some action - cruel murders, a man's search for a son - and there could even have been a plot, but a view was not enough to figure it out, and two views I fear, out of the question. First, the score was struggling and intrusive (as in "Beau Travail"). For another, the seasons changed too suddenly, giving you even more confusion about what was going on. Oh, there were some beautiful shots, and if you liked "Friday night" with the shots of the heavy curtains and bedding, you might appreciate the aesthetics of "L'Intrus". Otherwise, remove it. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in French and it is possible I missed something crucial. But the dialogue in a Denis movie rarely represents more than five pages, double spaces and with large margins. In "Chocolat" the silence is sublime; in "L'Intrus" it is just boring.
