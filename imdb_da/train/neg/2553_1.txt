Bath. Bath. Bath. Bath. Bath. What more can I say. Kate Jackson must have been desperate to lead. Maybe she should go back to acting ... on the second thought she was a bad actress. Who would put money into producing something so bad. I like anti-Christ movies and usually have a good laugh and the odd scare, but one is just Bad Bad Bad. Starting off the stars was worse than what you find on a soap opera. The special effects if you can call them that, how ridiculous. I wouldn't be surprised if you played the scenes slowly, you'd see the pipes, the blood shooting out. We had to turn the disc off after only 30 minutes. These so-called movie original prints must be destroyed, all discs and tapes destroyed, and all the people associated with the movie must pay back the money to the people who rented the movie. So these people should never be allowed to act, directly or film anything, but their own home movies.
