And I thought The Beach was bad, with the difference that this movie has one of the greatest actors of our time, Nicolas Cage. Don't blame him for the horrible script if anyone can do anything for what the hell was the point of that movie, give yourself a flip on the back. It's a cross between the village and a crappier script. It starts by catching your eye, and as it goes further into the plot, it just makes sense and don't let me start at the end !!!! What was it? The only thing that creates this movie is Nicolas Cage, who is usually good humor and his ability to be fun in the most strange situations. If you go to a blockbuster and this is the only movie to watch, save yourself five bucks and just go home and fire something, and when some ask you why, just tell the stupid one that comes into your mind. and there you go!
