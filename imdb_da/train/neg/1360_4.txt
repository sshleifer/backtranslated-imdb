A reasonable effort is a summary for this movie. A good sixties movie, but lacks any sense of achievement. Maggie Smith gave a decent performance which was credible enough, but not as good as she could have given, other actors were just horrible! A horrible portrayal. It wasn't that fun, and it didn't really matter to its genres, as it wasn't particularly fun, and it wasn't dramatic. The only genre achieved at a satisfactory level was romance. Audiences were not hit and the movie sent out confusing messages. A very basic plot and a very basic story were not drawn or performed at all, and people were confused as to why the movie was not so good and who the target audience was, etc. But Maggie was quite good and the story was okay with moments of skill . <br /> <br /> 4.
