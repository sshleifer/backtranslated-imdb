I only rented this because I loved the first movie. But call it John Carpenters Vampires: Los Muertos is just a trick to get you to rent it. He is actually an executive producer and clearly has nothing to do with this movie (Jeepers Creepers Anyone?) A tragic story, horrible special effects and Jon Bon Jovi as the least compelling Vampire Hunter of all time. It's not even comical bad. <br /> <br /> What we end up with is a dull movie with a terrible script and incredibly bad and clich√©. It's just a number of low budgets. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the Bubonic plague.
