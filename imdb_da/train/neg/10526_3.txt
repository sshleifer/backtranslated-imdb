Tedious girls-at-reform-school flick who plays something like a prison movie. Chris (Linda Blair) is stuck in there after driving away from his fierce father. Once in the de facto prison, she is gang raped by her innate female "inmates". <br /> <br /> Overlong (even in 98 minutes), with a completely pointless end that makes the whole movie meaningless. /> <br /> 15-year-old Linda Blair does her best to avoid showing her body when it is not dressed, but lets a nipple slip during a shower. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of *** *
