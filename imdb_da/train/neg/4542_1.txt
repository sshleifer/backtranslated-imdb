I went to watch this movie with a crowd that mainly consisted of "spiritual" New Age types which, unlike me, very much enjoyed this movie --- although according to those who also knew the book (apparently there is a book there contains more of this nonsense), the film is not quite as good. So, if you tend to think of yourself as "spiritual", you believe in or at least can tolerate things like "aura" and "astralkrop", and are not aware of the frequent use of the term "energy" outside the context of Physics or technology, you may actually like the movie and will probably even enjoy the book it appears to be based on. <br /> <br /> But if you're mostly in contact with the physical universe if your ability to suspend disbelief is easily exhausted by innocent New Age nonsense and plots based on it, if you also have a low tolerance for cheesy light effects to denote the event of spirituality and perhaps even expect a reasonable non-tree dialogue an action, so this is my recommendation to you regarding this movie: Stay. Away. <br /> <br /> Don't even think about it. Tonight, this movie has staggered the Dungeons and Dragons as the worst movie I ever personally saw in a movie theater (I don't count movies, I watched with the expectation that they were bad, such as Plan 9, etc.). At the same time, it raised the total number of movies I almost went to two (D&D is the second). I don't go to movies, not even on this one, but I should have since I first saw the visual image of an aura because New Age BS continues to become thicker and thicker from that point on. <br /> <br /> The foundation is about a group of people involved in some old prophecies, in a quest for spiritual enlightenment, and aiming to bring humanity to the next step in its evolution. Or something like that. In fact, they speak that this spiritual thing is the next step in human evolution, which must make anyone who has the weakest idea of ​​what human evolution is crooked. The movie is shock full of whiskers like that. Occasionally, people radiate what they would certainly mean as "another dimension," or perhaps "another plan," to only become invisible to those around them who have not yet enlightened. Goodness. <br /> <br /> In the end, the director protests the audience by throwing the "insights" out of the prophecy, painfully slow, presumably so we can remember them and leave the cinema as better and more enlightened individuals. <br /> <br /> Good stuff about the movie? Some very beautiful scenery and some decent supporting performances by Elizondo and the Almeida. I can honestly say that it seriously affects my ability to take a person seriously if they consider this movie interesting or acceptable. It is really el cheapo spiritualism of the most naive kind, and unless that is your thing, you better do something else with your time and money.
