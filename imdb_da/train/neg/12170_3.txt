No wonder Pamela Springsteen gave up on becoming a full-time photographer; It's a much better idea to have her behind a camera than in front of one. While this movie is not without its interesting elements (mullets from hell, etc.), it is outweighed by errors. First, Angela, the murderous counselor, seems to be the same age as the campers. Having an older, more threatening camper would have done a lot for the movie. And then you have murder scenes. The budget was apparently too low to perform most of them properly (no saying is calculated), although drowning someone in an outhouse toilet is definitely original. But in general there are lots of movies out there that are scary / more fun to spend an hour and a half in life.
