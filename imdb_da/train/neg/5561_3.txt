I watched this movie titled "Tied Up". In general, I have had Dolph's films, so gave this a try. It was not worth it. I've read some of the previous comments about the box of enticing viewers. Don't be fooled. This is at best a bad movie. The action is non-existent. The reason how small there is of one is very predictable. The movie in places seems to be carved together. This just sucks up the place. Not even worth the price of a cheap overnight stay. As part of a Dolph fan, I was waiting to see him going. At the end of the movie you will still wait. Best to avoid this movie and use your time to watch almost anything else.
