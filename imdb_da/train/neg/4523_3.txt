When this film was released, it exclaimed one of the all-time capsule movie reviews: Sphinx Stinks. It does, but in a fascinating kind of way. The castings are stupid, starting at the top: Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud as Egyptians? Not enough makeup in Cairo for that, at least not while this film was made. But it is quite fun to see them try. The performances run the gamut from mummy-like (sorry, the obvious observation) to the over-the-top, with very few stops in between. The Lesley-Anne Down character seems like she couldn't find Egypt on a map, much less pronounced on her archaeological treasures. This is due, at least in part, to some really bad letters, one of the curses that will be visited on all viewers of this movie. It is my opinion that movies that involve a curse or that draw their basis from a topic that is somewhat esoteric, such as Egyptology, are ripe for stupid, overwritten dialogue. It does not disappoint and convergence turns out to be double-whammy. The reason has a driving source of dramatic excitement: Can this be stupid and less credible? The answer is usually YES. The location images are beautiful and the set design is generally very good, the only consistent reminders that this was not a low budget production. It and the fact that there are so many familiar faces serving in such an unintentionally weaker one. Cheap, no; cheesy, yes.
