My title above says it all. Let me make it clear. If you've seen the BBC's "Planet Earth" that I'm sure most of you have, then you won't like this movie too much. And I own all discs of "Planet Earth", I had seen the rating for this movie very high, and read good reviews about it. I was thrilled to check it out. <br /> <br /> Alas, I went to the theater and the movie started. I saw that it was a Disney movie with production companies listing the BBC and Discovery. And when they started the first scenes about the polar bear, I recognized them from my DVDs at "Planet Earth". <br /> <br /> The movie continued and went on and on, my friends and I loved We were very disappointed when I believe that 90% of the footage comes from "Planet Earth". I say 90% because some of the scenes I didn't recognize. I have a feeling that I simply don't remember them. <br /> <br /> Finally, what this movie really is, is a collection of various footage from the various "Planet Earth" records with a story directed at children. Yes, the story is pretty kiddish. Let me give you an example. When they show the polarizers that go away from the mother pub, the narrator says "Polar cubs aren't like human children. They don't always listen to their mothers" (I can't remember the exact words, but that's how it is) So in a nutshell . This is condensed "Planet Earth" for kids!
