I saw "Myra Breckinridge" when it first came out in 1970. I was a healthy 20-year-old at the time who loved movies and really liked Raquel Welsh. In addition, I had read the Gore Vidal short story it was based on, and thought it was very fun. I watched the movie on a local driveway and halfway through. I was very tempted to turn on my car's car so I might die of monoxide poisoning and not have to watch the rest of this shipwreck of a movie. It wasn't "smart" or "trendy", it was rough and sloppy. All the actors were tone deaf, and the director did not have the slightest idea of ​​what he did. The casting of Mae West was one of the worst castings in film history. As a reviewer here said, her role had nothing to do with the movie or book. Her character in the book is sexually aroused by the young stud who would never do for the legendary Ms West. Oh no, the plot changes so she sexually beats him, very credible from a 77-year-old woman who looks every day at her age. I could go on, but why? It was a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Bluto
