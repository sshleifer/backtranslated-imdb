Probably New Zealand's worst movie ever made <br /> <br /> The jokes are not fun. Used from other movies and just plain corny The action is bad, although there is a great cast <br /> <br /> The story is uninteresting & Drilling Has more cheese then pizza huts cheese lovers pizza kind as the actor Has been 1000 times before <br /> <br /> I saw this when it came on TV, but it was so boring that it could only stand 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie sugar <br /> <br /> Don't look at it, <br /> <br /> See paint dry instead
