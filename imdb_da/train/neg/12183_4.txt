Christ. A sequel to one of the most cloying movies of all time, this has at least a decency to leave the songs (bore a rendition of the unbearable "Tomorrow"), but continues to be nauseous and unfunny. This time, Annie and her friends head to London and get caught in Joan Collins plot to blow up Buckingham Palace or any such filth. The film has a bizarre sycophantic attitude to its eponymous character at odds with how annoying she is: every time the little bugger squeals "Leapin 'lizard!" I could feel my teeth grinding down in the powder. Drearily photographed, slushy and plodding, the film has only a memorable line ("Unhand me, you stupid genius!") And the fact that it is not the original to recommend it.
