Back to the Cabin by the lake just .... was missing. It must have had a very low budget because a lot of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera. So within the same scene - you want some movie quality camera pictures AND simple video camera images. It gives a very strange mix! I think they should have found SOMETHING way not to make "home video" type effect! <br /> <br /> I think it's worth seeing if you've seen the original CBTL, because then you can compare and see the differences. But if you haven't seen the original CBTL .... you'll never see it if you first see this! It will probably seem too cheesy and get rid of yourself worrying about the original.
