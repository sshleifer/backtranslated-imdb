After just completing the book the same day I saw the movie, I knew what was going to happen. I had high expectations for the movie because of the rating. The only reason I give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was okay to try to be a movie. I have a few key points not to like this movie. <br /> <br /> ********** SPOILERS ********** <br /> <br /> 1. The casting. Jack Nicholson hardly fits into Jack Torrence's character. I would also have chosen Shelly Duvall for Wendy. I picture Wendy very differently. I can see why they picked Jack Nicholson himself, the sparkle, the pointed eyebrows, but he shouldn't really see 'evil'. He was supposed to look normal, and he became vicious. Also they make one of the worst movie couples. Danny was okay, but he needed more life. He acted the way to droney. <br /> <br /> 2. The play. They scratched so many things that were in the book and added things. Some of the things that were in the book I was looking forward to in the movie were either erased, changed or handled incorrectly. Some of the things that were in the book that I was looking forward to seeing (the hedge animals, the roque mallet, the elevator) were not in the movie and it was 2 and a half hours !! I was very annoyed. <br /> <br /> 3. The end. The ending was completely changed, Halorann died, Jack froze to death, Wendy was never hurt ... The overlook did not blow up. Ending was so cool in the book, and the movie messed it so terribly that I was off. Hallorann would never die, but Jack killed him with an ax. If they wanted to kill him, at least Jack has a roque mallet. You've never even seen a roque mallet throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> There are other things I didn't like about the movie, but there are things that were okay. The camera angels were cool, the blood that came out of the elevator (didn't happen in the book) was cool, but maybe I was too annoyed that the movie didn't go with the book to try to be scared at all. I recommend reading the book before watching this movie. I welcome Stephen King for actually agreeing to sign a contract not to be Stanley Kubrik anymore. I would never have done it, I would have taken all the rights I could get to shout at him all day. I can't wait to see the 6 hour version, at least it has the hedgehog. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2/10
