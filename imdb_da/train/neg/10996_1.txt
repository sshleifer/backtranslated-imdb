The Underground Comedy movie is perhaps one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. I should have known that it would be bad, as the box had the phrase "guaranteed to offend" written on it ... which means the filmmakers would focus more on burning you out than laughing. This movie is an amateur jumble of childish sketches, bad characters, and worse jokes ... from the pathetic Bat-Man sketch to the painfully eerie Arnold Shvollen pecker shit, they're just not fun. The few sketches that are a little funny are few and far between - to see Micheal Clark Duncan play for example a gay virgin - but even they go too long and are ruined by Vince Offers imperfection in comedy. <br /> <br /> Keep the underground comedy movie underground ... bury it!
