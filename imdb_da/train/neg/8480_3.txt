I can't say this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. But then again I can't say it's one of the worst I've ever seen. OK, so it's basically a girl skating, good at it, wanting to go to an expensive school, can't afford it and have to take a hockey scholarship. She must hide her skating secret from her friends. Personally, I didn't like the actor playing Katelin. She couldn't cry at all to save her life, just make mocking sounds like a little child pretending to cry to get her own way. Katelin was just an annoying person. The way she tried to act all cozy and helpful with people. Also the part where the two skaters call their names and they say something about her choreographer, and she says she "pulls the line" made me hug. <br /> <br /> We all knew where to go with her and spencer Classically, they didn't like each other, and kind of gatherings at the end were just typical. On the whole, I think it's a movie to see if you like skating, but if you don't mind the skates are extremely annoying. It is good to kill time basically.
