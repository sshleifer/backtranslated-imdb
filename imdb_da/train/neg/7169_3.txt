This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. But the little slave girl, Alice and Jared Harris imitate Christopher Walken, is what makes this movie entertaining. Alice smokes, drinks and scary way to show up when the name is, is strange and interesting. I have to applaud Jared for his Christopher Walken imitation, and Christopher Walken to let this be in the movie.
