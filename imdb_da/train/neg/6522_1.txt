This is not a comment on the current movie, but on RUSCICO DVD release for North America. I don't know if there have been different releases and updates, but the disks we rented had 2000 copyright to them if that matter. Yet the sound mix on these DVDs was horrible. The levels are often yo-yo-ed up and down; When the stage cut to a battlefield panorama, the orchestra track would thunder so loudly that I didn't know which would blow out first - my eardrum or my speakers. When it was time for dialogue, the volume would normally fall to something that could hardly be heard. Occasionally, the orchestra and Foley work would stay high while the dialogue was superimposed on a much smaller level. My wife and I found out that we could only watch this movie from these DVDs if one of us held a hand on the remote to continually modulate the volume. And as another user has already commented when we chose English audio, the dialogue continued back and forth between Russian and English; and occasionally when the characters spoke in French on the native track, duplication was in Russian, so you are SOL if you do not understand it. In the end, we stopped looking for the first disk. Before you fork out $ 50 + for this movie on DVD to your own library, I highly recommend getting your hands on a rental profile to see if you can really enjoy this epic flick when burdened with such bad sound especially if you never read the book and will really understand the story.
