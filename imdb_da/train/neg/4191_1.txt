I have seen many a horror flap in my time, everyone is absurdly bad, but no one reaches the depths of this piece of waste. This movie made me angry and angry when I saw it when I was trying to wrap my head around what this movie was about. Now that I've seen it, I understand - kind of - what's going on and why, but the movie itself is too confusing to be fun when you see it. Yes, there are the usual scenes of gratuitious violence, one-liners showing the insane insights into his characters ("The Highway belongs to me ... ME!") And enough nudity to distract us sufficiently from the "plot", but you will still let this movie feel alone and exploited as a puppy that is no longer desired and left in a box next to the road. Blech.
