I'm not as much as Love Sick as I picture. Finally, the film expresses sexual relations between Alex, Kik, Sandu and their triangular love full of intensity, frustration and jealousy. Finally, Alex awoke and realized that they would not get results and future. The exit was sad. <br /> <br /> The director Tudor Giurgiu was in AMC theater Sunday 12:00 on 08/10/06 with us watching the movie together. After the film, he told the audience that the intention to create this film, which was to express Romanian sexual relations, was a kind of complication. In my view, sexual life is always complicated everywhere, I do not feel any special impression and effect from the film. The course of love by Alex and Kiki and Kiki and her brother Sandu were kind of neighborhood narratives. <br /> <br /> First, the two main reasons I don't like this movie are that the movie didn't tell us how they started to fall in love? It sounds as if Alex moved into the building, which Kiki lived, then two girls fell in love. It makes no sense at all. How a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man. Too many fragments you need to picture and connect these stories to your mind. Secondly, the whole movie did not have a scene of Alex and Kik's intercourse, that was what I was waiting for ????. However, it still had some deserves to recommend. The "ear piercing" part was a bit interesting. Alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate biscuit love. It was a touching scene that gave you a little idea of ​​their love. Likewise, the scene of them lay in the football field, the conversation expressed their love was truthful and passionate.
