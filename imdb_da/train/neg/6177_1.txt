The real irony is this: Joe Besser was a top comedian, in other situations away from Stooges. He had a clear track record of being very funny and smart. Moe and Larry and Shemp had actually known him or at least of him for many years and liked his work. So what on Earth happened when he came to the squad as "third stooge"? Of course nothing. In most of these "late Stooge" era shorts, more often than not, the boys are pitted against each other or Joe against the other two and this is not correct stooge etiquette. "One for all, one for every man for himself", to quote Curly from "Restless Knights". One thing about a good comedy team, Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello, The Marx Brothers, no matter how much they all try to exploit each other or turn each other around when the chips are actually down, hold them together and come to each other's help. In this particular, none of it appears. It's almost like watching a dog fight as you try to cheat the others or be mediocre and unpleasant, or for comic effect. One can assume that there was something behind the scenes going on here, art imitating life. Perhaps there was really why Besser was not very tall with Moe and Larry. Just look at the other team's history and tell me I'm wrong.
