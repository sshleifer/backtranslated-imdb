This movie could have been great (because it got a somewhat fascinating premise), but it never rises over pure caricature. The play is seriously mistaken, and there were moments where I was so frightened that I thought I should be in my seat in the theater. Never, and I never mean, see this good-looking piece .... Danish cinema has got very good over the last few years, but if this piece .... crosses the border, I am afraid that no sane will ever rent a Danish movie. This movie is why I chose to register here. I really felt I needed to steer people away from this piece .... my sympathies go to the people who already went to the cinema to watch this
