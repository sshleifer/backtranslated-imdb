I don't know who to blame, the scary writers or the clueless instructor. It seemed to be one of those films where so much was paid to the stars (Angie, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna and Jon) that there wasn't enough left to really make a movie. This could have been very entertaining, but there was a veil of shade, even sweeping, hanging over each scene. When it got an R-rating anyway, why was the ubiquitous whirlpool scene shot with a 70-year-old woman and not Angie Harmon? Why does Sheen sleep through potentially hot relationships with two of the most beautiful and sexual appearances in the world? If they were just looking for laughs, why didn't they throw Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta instead? It was so predictable that I was surprised to find out that the director was not five years old. What a waste, not just for the viewers, but also for the actors.
