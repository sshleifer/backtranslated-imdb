See the lady in Ermine I wondered what Betty Grable did in a project that seemed to be targeting Marlene Dietrich. Someone on the 20th Century Fox may have decided that a gender symbol is as good as another. Darryl F. Zanuck should have known better. <br /> <br /> Betty plays an Italian Countess of the 19th Century, whose domain has been invaded by a troupe of Hungarian housewives captain of Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Her ghost father, whose portrait hangs in the palace hall along with the rest of her noble family tree, sees no slight resemblance in Doug now and another invader about 300 years earlier who she treated when the army failed. <br /> <br /> Also, the current Betty has just been married to Cesar Romero, and the invasion has come at a most inconvenient time before things have been accomplished. It will give someone a bad attitude, I guarantee. Fresh, healthy all American Betty is NOT the actress to make seductive and mysterious. Marlene Dietrich may have put it over here, but with Betty it flatter than yesterday's presidential candidate. She and Fairbanks have no chemistry at all, though Doug is as charming as ever and I can see anything. <br /> <br /> Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin wrote the score for this movie and this is currently receiving an Oscar nomination for Best Song. That Lady In Ermine is a chance for Oscar's glory fell to buttons and bows. Ernest Lubitsch died halfway through the film and Otto Preminger completed That Lady In Ermine. I can't believe that Lubitsch had Grable in mind for the lead here. You also don't want to see That Lady In Ermine.
