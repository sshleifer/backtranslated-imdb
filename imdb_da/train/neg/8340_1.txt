One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was so sad that I changed it from mid-way to see the news. When I changed it again, I fell asleep. The movie starts with a dream, continues with a dream, and ends with a dream. Then there are a few more dreams in between. Come on, what should I be interested in? A movie should have a reason to be interesting. The moment you felt the movie was just a dream is when a sensible movie-goer turns off. Has anyone ever insisted on telling their dreams and what it means to them? This is it !!! <br /> <br /> Terrible.
