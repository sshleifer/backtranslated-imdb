Nikolai Gogol's story "Viy" has been filmed again and released for home video in the United States via Faith Films. The original story is about a priest who has to look over a witch's body with only his faith to protect him. Much expanded and set in America, though clearly filmed in Russia (the houses, clothing and furnishings are wrong despite the English characters), this is a strange movie that doesn't really work. It's the weird setting that tries very hard to be backwoods America, but clearly it's not. There are also some strange, gently slanted moments when the protagonist is a reporter at the beginning and a pastor shortly thereafter. I'm not sure why they did it even after watching the DVDs. The other problem is copying which is beyond terrible. It is done in such a way that everyone speaks when their lips are not on camera - or if they are the voices, they do not even vote with each other on the lip flaps. I don't know if its Faith Film's sake or the producers who made the movie hoping to dump into the West (revealed in the production of the piece). <br /> <br /> The movie is not very good. As I have said, it has all sorts of technical issues that just make this a strange ball curve. In spite of some really beautiful horror images, the film never works like a horror movie. As a film to create faith, it is far too confused in this story to amount to make anyone feel any closer to God. Given the choice, I would give it a passerby, even at a good price. My advice would be to find the 1960's version of the story called Viy, which will bring both some tremors and some understanding of faith in God.
