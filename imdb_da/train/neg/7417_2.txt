This movie is so bad - dialogues, history, actors and actresses - everything! - It is hard to imagine that we will see a worse movie this year or in the following years. The "brother of love" (introduced in Australia among Italian immigrants) has nothing but superficial clich√©s on the Italian culture being offered, and it says that even the Italians from and in Italy speak Danish in the film. The message from the movie - ugly people must marry ugly people, beautiful people must marry beautiful people - is really uncomfortable. Giovanni Ribisi is pretty good at movies like 'Suburbia' or 'Lost in Translation', but here's his pseudo-Italian accent hard to wear. Watch this movie at your own risk. Waste as rubbish bins!
