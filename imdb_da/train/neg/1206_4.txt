This thought long lost flick sometimes comes available on the internet. So I bought myself a copy. Well, of course, the play is terrible and the story is childish, but it has its moments. I think people who applied for this also know the background to it. It was made by a grindhouse cinema owner for an extremely low budget. But for me he probably hasn't spoiled the money on props, but on the makeup. Makeup is for that kind of flick well done. The zombies are visible and are intact. The only problem with such films is the quality of the pelicule. It's awful, fortunately no lift on the sound, but sometimes it's too dark. So you need to look clear to see things. In a fun way they tried to sell this as really not for the squeamish. A voice-over tells at the beginning of the movie to watch out for a character and a man who appears with green flashes telling you that there is a way to go. Of course it doesn't work, made me think of cannibal girls, had the annoying bell as the red things began to flow. They had the original idea that Cannibal Girls was made a year earlier. Do not go to the story, go to the zombies and notice a continuity error. When the girl and the guy love first, she takes off her bra, so they love and suddenly are underwear again ... Try to do it, or if I get a little offline, ... eat ugly body
