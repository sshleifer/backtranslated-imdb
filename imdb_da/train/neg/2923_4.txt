The reason was quite interesting, with the Russian revolution background. I also enjoyed seeing Budapest as the film was partially filmed there. Unfortunately, there was zero chemistry between the two main characters, so it was hard to believe in the love story between them. The love scenes were forced and mechanical. Jordan Kirckland was really stiff, almost ice cold. Rob Stewart was quite charming and boyish so she looked like her older sister rather than her boyfriend. The end, when we finally found out who actually was after them, was rather weak and had no meaning at all. I think I would have had this movie much better if the relationship between the two actors was a little more credible.
