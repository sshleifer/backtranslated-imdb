Awlright, damn it, MooCow will reluctantly admit the truth: I like this cheap, cheesy 70s parody. The idea that large hordes of killed tomatoes are destroying the United States is a good idea, and in spite of itself, the moovie gives some decent chuckles that are almost the sight of horrible extras that run away from large, naturally fake tomatoes. This movie with The Kentucky Fried Moovie is one of the previous attempts at spoofs that became so popular in the 80s and 90s thanks to Airplane! This, like murder spokes, is pretty bad. Many attempts at humor are bleak mistakes and will cause much moans. But thanks to the ravenous tomatoes hordes, the unpleasant "Puberty Love" song and the amazing helicopter crash scene, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes indicates some items, but largely for the wrong reasons. There are so many things wrong with this movie ... and so it's hard to explain. Enough people should also have enjoyed it as the tomatoes made a comeback in 2 moore movies and a cartoon series !! Large lumps of time spent away from the tomatoes are quite boring. And dig the 70s clothes, guy! ; = 8) This tomato is seedy and cheesy, but worth a shame or two; the mooCow says grab a pizza and pop in tomatoes !! : ??
