OK - Disadvantages First: The obligatory 70's alligator (okay, correction - caiman) with non-moving limbs is made worse for scale miniature underwater images (with the full length of the reptile compared to the size of the boats) by means of a toy alligator being swirled around in the toy boat. in practically lit water - even for night shots! <br /> <br /> Unlike most primitive kittens-exploitative-western movies, superstitious native go bat **** and start massaging vacationers seem unjustified this time around. No mistreated truly native - exploited, yes, but far from violent treatment. After all, it was one of the natives (canoodling with a spoiled supermodel under a taboo full moon) that brought the curse of the River Demon on them, right? <br /> <br /> The vacationers are slightly annoying (with remarkable except the token old-soul / mildly blasphemous-little-girl-som-shine-to-the-heroes that you often see in the 70's Euroflicks) but far from deserving of violent death - unless they were your next door neighbors, imagine. A couple are actually killed as heroic - remarkable because none of them fill the role of sidekick. There are only two equal villains throughout the film, so the departures feel more arbitrary than cathartic. The sequence in which the giant caiman crunches down and dries 30 tourists in less than five minutes is likely to hit you as unintentional fun. <br /> <br /> The point at which natives choose not to wipe out the surviving Westerners and practically say "hi, you're not that bad, unfortunately sorry about this tonight" - because they jumped up the monster lizard - have You shook your head when the corny music kicks in. You know, the local military dictatorship will wipe out the village to **** with the tourist trade after the credits ... <br /> The benefits: Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. Barbara Bach. You NEVER know why you are interested in this movie in the first place, right? I thought so. If you are a Bach clerk, you get the DVD reissued by NoShame movies earlier this year (digitally remastered without actual extras to talk about, except the director who notes the current international film distribution). <br /> <br /> The hero is not half-bad, far from an idiot (always a plus in B-movies), and the cynical little child gives most of the comic relief. Worth to see, but get it cheap!
