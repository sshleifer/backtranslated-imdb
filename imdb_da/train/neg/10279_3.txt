This movie was so horrible, it was almost good ... almost. We love musicals, but not this one. Even with the horrible sound quality, poor filmography and many actors who can't sing or dance, Anthony Rapp actually managed to give a good performance (especially towards the end). The character Marjorie, a drunk lady, was also fun to see. <br /> <br /> The reason is very unexpected and could have been fun without horrible song and furious piano music. Admittadly, some of the songs (fantabulous) are pretty catchy (but not in a good way). Open House is a fun movie to watch simply because it's awful! We think it can be a good stage musical (with excellent actors).
