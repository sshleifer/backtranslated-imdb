It is a little fascinating to me that so many reviewers read this as a masterpiece. I'm not boring when it comes to quality movies, and I agree that movies from a technical point of view as well as for several of the portrayed characters are in a commendable class. But there is no point (for me) of this movie that actually goes everywhere; I mean take the viewer everywhere. It is a series of mood scenes, perhaps remarkable as such, but I want more from a movie. I'm looking for history and movement and a fulfillment of arrival, none of which found in this movie. Yes, it can be considered poetry on film. . . But there is a lot of poetry that I cannot live with for the same reason: that it paints pictures without going anywhere. One thing to be said is that it documents an English childhood from the middle of the century, which is necessarily limited in its universality. I was personally appalled by what a young British boy had to experience at that time and place. Having grown up in America just a decade earlier, I can authoritatively say that the contrast is huge. I can't wonder if this contrast has had any effect on those who go through the movie so favorably. In other words, could there be a tendency to judge the movie solely on its "cinematic magic" (which I acknowledge is there) and completely ignore its lack of relevance to the nature of the actual recalled experience?
