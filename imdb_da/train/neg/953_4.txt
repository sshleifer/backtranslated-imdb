"Happy Go Lovely" has only two things that go for it. And these two things are Vera-Ellen's legs. This is a British (Excelsior Films) version of an M-G-M musical complete with second class stars. I can imagine that Vera-Ellen took this role and thought that it could finally drive her to the status of a great musical star. But I'm sorry to say that Mrs Ellen's chance didn't give up. <br /> <br /> Opening a horrible Scottish number and stumbling through a terrible dialogue to the next boring melody, this movie seems very heavy and wasteful. The predictable failing identity plot is very thin, and with the exception of David Niven, Cesar Romero (who is far in his role as a producer) and Bobby Howes (who is totally wasted in no role) the rest of the cast is completely forgettable. <br /> <br /> Choreography is boring, but Mrs Ellen gives her all. She was never as famous as most other musical stars (and she shouldn't be since she couldn't sing and even had a "dance stand in" in several of her pictures. "But when she danced, it was just that too bad, that this movie, which could have made her a star, did not give her the tools she had to shine. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
