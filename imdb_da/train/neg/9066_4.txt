It is about unironic ideas about tackling guilt. <br /> <br /> Merrill prepares the distracted boy to stop his "whining" about Rennie's death. Real men in action, here. <br /> <br /> The crash model aircraft and car crash must have been impressive on the big screen. <br /> <br /> The story tells itself despite the flashback sequences, it plays straight - all the narrators are trusted by us (regardless of the "truth" or "falsehood" dialogue), so there is no game with the viewer about narrative structure. This will be a tough template for future buybacks, such as "Fearless". So all we are left with is individual performance, and at that level it is best for Wynn's management, a virtual one-man show.
