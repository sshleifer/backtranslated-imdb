It is interesting to see what the director was trying to do with this movie. But the problem is that it is not very good. There was nothing really original in the movie, and while the plot was well presented, the protagonists were all a bit low and you didn't disturb any of them. <br /> <br /> Better (and sometimes even bad) picture leaves a little to be desired, but I don't think you can expect too much from people who just make a low-budget movie for it. It is unfair to review the movie and compare it to other high budget films. But alas, that's what to do. On its own it is not very good. And compared to others it is still not very good. But it's not without its good points! I liked the plot. It was built up nicely and tied together well at the end. Sometimes in the really dark scenes it also succeeded in building a creepy feeling. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, however, the film fails to impress. The characters are virtually non-existent and we don't care about any of them. Any of them can die, but it is possible to identify the final "survivor" from very early.
