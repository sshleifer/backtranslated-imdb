At least, the set of ten years old will be interested. Eleanor (Geena Davis) and Fred (Hugh Laurie) A little, a lovely charity couple sat down to bring home from the orphanage a new little brother to their son George (Johnathan Lipnicki). They come home with quite odd new siblings ... a sharp dressed little mouse named Stuart (pronounced by Michael J. Fox). Yes, mouse. Stuart is happy to have found the feeling of belonging even though it is in a super-sized world that contains its new family's cat-cat Snowbell (pronounced by Nathan Lane). Stuart embarks on the experience of family loyalty and superior friendship. George will finally accept his little newborn when the brave dressed Stuart saves embarrassment on a model boat. <br /> <br /> Also in the cast: Julia Sweeney, Harold Gould, Estelle Getty and Jeffery Jones. And the voices of: Chaz Palminteri, Bruno Kirby and Jennifer Tilly.
