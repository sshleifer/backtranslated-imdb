I watched this movie over the weekend, and while I was always impressed by the beauty and polishing of church-produced films, I left the disappointment that it fell so short and uninformed and left investigators with many unanswered questions. <Br /> <br /> The movie is 70 minutes vignettes from Joseph Smith's life. It is not a true biopic, because there is no really coherent story. Most of the episodes are that Joseph does good deeds, plays baseball, runs races and laughs with children, often in sloooow motion. What a great, just people kind of guy that Joseph was, huh? Look at him out there and beat rugs for his wife Emma. Well, howzbout the carpets of his 33 majority wives ?? No mention whatsoever made of polygamy. A sharp neglect. <br /> <br /> It is in such omissions that the movie falls. It delivers too little information and leaves critical thinking that the audience is wondering, why is Joseph corroded and removed, why is he thrown into jail and why does he want to kill him? The film's climax is, of course, Joseph and Hyrum's trek to Carthage Prison (passing a veritable UN of faces that look from Nauvoo's doorways). But nothing is mentioned about why. Nothing about Smith suppresses the Nauvoo Expositor newspaper and orders his press destroyed to reveal the secret teaching of polygamy. The audience is left to wonder or assume that it is just more basic persecution of the Church. No mention that Joseph has been charged with treason for declaring war law and calling out the Nauvoo militia. <br /> <br /> Of course, I certainly didn't expect this church-produced movie to present Joseph of Richard Bushman's latest biography of Rough Stone Rolling, but I was surprised and surprised at how much fabric was actually presented. <br /> <br /> Worse, the substance that was presented was often inaccurate. Two examples ran out at me. First, the translation of the Book of Mormon. The film shows that Joseph read straight out of the golden plates in their two-ring binder, which plates were actually hidden far from the place. It is well known that Joseph made his translation by burying his face in his hat and peering at the stone in there. The second inaccuracy occurs in Carthage Prison, where the mob storms the cell. The Church's history reports that Joseph had a six-shooter and even fired a couple of rounds before jumping out of the window and giving the Masonic signal of distress (as reported in the Times & Seasons). <br /> <br /> Perhaps showing the reality of the war force would have ruined the hugging mood the filmmakers had created, but by omitting it, they were unfaithful to history and failed to show Joseph as he really was: practical with a gun and could defend themselves. In fact, the impression the film gives is that Joseph was a good guy, but also something of a milquetoast that everyone beat up, threw in prison and was eventually murdered in cold blood. He was far from it; Joseph was a disciplined and determined man who endured a lot of hardships and struggled to bring the fruit into which he believed. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie, but walking in it is the cotton candy. Then get your meat and potatoes by reading a copy of Bushman's biography of Smith, Rough Stone Rolling. <br /> <br /> PS: Church-made movies have no credits, but spicy eyes can choose a few familiar faces. Rick Macy is great as Joseph Smith, Sr. and Bruce Newbold, beloved as Thomas in finding faith in Christ, here plays the curvy Methodist Minister who has not shown Christian love to a young seeker of truth.
