A couple move into their dream home, unaware that it and its neighbors have been built over land previously used as a cemetery. The film is said to have been based on a true story, although how much it must be true is not revealed. The reason is hardly unique - see Spielberg's 'Poltergeist' (1982). Within a short period of time, the various supernatural phenomena are experiencing: These range from the disturbing - mystical shadows, the daughter's serious illness - to the righteous ridiculous toilets that are flush and the garage doors are out of control. There is a little depth to the story: when it has been found that the earth had been used as a cemetery, we learn nothing more. The reason does not seem to develop. The characters are not very well drawn or in any way memorable, nor is the atmosphere very special. The movie may disturb some viewers. There is no sense of catharsis or any kind of positive message from it.
