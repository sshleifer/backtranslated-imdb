Assassin Hauser's (John Cusak) mission is to beat an Austrian oil minister whose name is Omar Sharif (Neikov) in the country of Turaqistan run by US interests. Hauser is the Trade Show producer to give him the opportunity to come to Omar. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a satire can be so exaggerated that it becomes most annoying. Here it does too much: the government, politics, music, war, people who are not generally accepted by society, and I mentioned "war". And that's what we have here - a most annoying movie that borders on a very bad nightmare that is brought to life. I still wonder why I continued with the DVD. There are also so many Cusak family members in this that John Cusak seems to be embarrassed that the family is just there or is it just me? It used to be a John Cusak movie, while a little bit offbeat was ultimately pretty good. Not here. Believe John Cusak had a hand in writing and producing this mess. Do what you want. <br /> <br /> There is too much going on in the movie accompanied by constant gun fire, bombing and shouting that you really can't focus or was that point? Probably. It just takes too long to set up the frame, which is largely forgotten until the last 15 minutes. In the meantime, we have meaningless deeds among everyone in the cast. And chemistry between John Cusak and Marisa Tormei? I don't think so, but you know: the boy ?? girl stuff ???? And they needed something to take more time. <br /> <br /> Yes, what they were supposed to be (offbeat and annoying) was Duff's and Kingsley's performances. But when I saw Dan Aykroyd's character at the start of the show, sitting on a toilet with a dump, I knew that the rest of the show would also go to the thought. I wasn't wrong. I'm sure some will sing praise for this effort, but if a rose is still a rose with any other name then it's also a mess ?????????? <br /> <br /> I now remember why I continued with the DVD. I hoped that the story would somehow smooth out and save itself. Never did. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Emergency: No. Language: Yes.
