We laughed our heads off. This script is so incredible that you either relax to CNN or sleep. <br /> <br /> For 30 years, my father was a sea captain, he couldn't believe his eyes when he saw the movie. <br /> <During his experience as an officer he once claimed the command of the ship, the captain drank 3 bottles of whiskey / daily and (sorry) s on his desk. Of course, it was not on a nuclear mission. <br /> <br /> For example, the fire in the kitchen, the fire is the most important thing on any ship, nuclear or not. Giving an exercise at that time is just Hollywood script. When a captain is arrested, he is arrested, taking all his keys and opening the security where the gun is held. This is stored within minutes in a well-kept room. He can't escape, it's like in prison. It's fun, my dad also has a dog on board, but we can see how Hackman lets him throw in the control room. This is not done, ever. My father cleaned all the mess that the dog made where he was. <br /> <br /> Hackman and Washington make the three stars, this movie is credited to, the rest are bullies ** t. <br /> <br /> To see a real thriller about a submarine rental: Thas Boat. <br /> <br />
