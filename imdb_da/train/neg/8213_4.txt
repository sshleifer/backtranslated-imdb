I can't believe IMDb really has all the TV shows known to man! I haven't seen this show for over 20 years. I only remember two episodes, and I can hardly remember them. I remember that Tony may not have been from the start because one of the episodes I remember is the one everyone is trying to get Tony to participate, but he rejects them, but at the end of the show he is typically a member of Power House, with all cheering. The other I remember is the one in which Lolo, for some reason, pretends to be dead (complete with funeral and grief). I can't remember why he's playing dead or how the show ends. <br /> <br /> This is one of those who show that I was convinced that I must have dreamed since no one else had ever heard of it.
