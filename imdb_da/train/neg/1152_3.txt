I understand what this film was trying to portray. How the old ones are often ignored and treated as a disturbance, meaning they end up feeling unappreciated and as their lives are empty. I have no problem with this message, but I just feel that it could have been put across in a way that is not so painful to see. I enjoy a good art film, but when a movie becomes too self-conscious arty (as in this case), the result is often frustrating. Including shot of a person packing a suitcase slowly, taking 5 minutes, trying to make a point but just ending up annoying the audience. <br /> <br /> The female characters are very weak and you just end up telling them to pull it together. This is a movie you feel you should enjoy or judge highly and certainly has its benefits, but I was just too frustrated to see it ever recommending it to another. It may have a deeper message than other Roger Michell movies (for example: 'Notting Hill'), but at least it was a movie you liked to watch.
