Well, I must be the one who says, "The Emperor has no clothes." When I saw this show built for PBS last night, I was both hopeful and worried. I loved "Morse" (even going as far as buying the complete DVD set) and felt it while I always liked Kevin Whately's Sgt. Lewis character, the show was John Thaw, period! After seeing the new "Inspector Lewis" (as it is billed here), I am more convinced that I was right ... Whatever is fine (though he looks awful (both older and fat), but he simply do not have the charisma to wear the show as Thaw. <br /> <br /> And as for his "sidekick" Fox, well ... maybe reviewers from England can understand what he says, but I for one for it most of it could not. <br /> <br /> As for Mrs. Innocent ... I can only say that I miss James Grout, I'm sorry to say that they should have left "Morse" rest in peace.
