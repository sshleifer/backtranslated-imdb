Well, it looked good on paper, Nick Cage and Jerry Buckheimer are collaborating again this time on a mix of hover movies, Da Vinci Code, American History 101 and Indiana Jones. But oh, it's Indiana Jones, what Speed ​​2 is for Speed. A reasonable casting (including John Voight and Harvey Keitel) is battling a puerile script and losing badly. The film is a little more than an expanded advertisement for the Masons. But these Masons are not your usual shop owners who use fun handshakes and play golf, these Masons are the natural descendants of the Knights Templar (and no one mentions 'From Hell' or Jack the Ripper.) I don't think I've revealed any plot spoilers because there are none. There is almost no excitement, no surprises and no climax - it just stops. National Treasure aims at Dan Brown, but hits the same intellectual level as an episode of Scooby Doo, a sense of humor.
