The show is average. It doesn't make me laugh particularly. But I think Courtney really brings it down. She doesn't look natural. She has these three ways of speaking, all robots. She speaks quietly (without intonation), she speaks normally (without intonation), or she does the thing where she starts talking normally and starts shouting gradually. But her shouting is like "let's pretend I'm shouting because I'm not going to be too high on the set". <br /> <br /> She is constantly aware that she is this sweet actress who does this fun thing. It's annoying. You can't really get her personality because she doesn't really produce emotions and doesn't get sad. She has this man who does all these stupid things and there is no reaction from her. Very dry and common.
