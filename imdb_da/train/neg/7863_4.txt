THHE2 is entertaining in that you will laugh a lot and cringe and probably say "oh sh * t!" and "get your face away from the stupid hole you stupid ** s" or things along those lines, but I don't know if it's really worth seeing - I was very annoyed at all with the terrible military signs that seems to know the first thing about battle. Yes, there was more violence, gore and a higher body count than the first, but I still discuss whether it cancels my feeling throughout the movie about how ridiculous it is (and not a good ridicule like Dead Alive or Feast). My time would have been better spent seeing Aja's remake for the fifth time. Then go for a little laugh or go for some doing, but don't go hoping to get out of it.
