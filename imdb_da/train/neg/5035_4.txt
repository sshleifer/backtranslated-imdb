Melissa's sixteenth birthday is just around the corner and she only discovers her sexuality with boys. But it turns out that all the guys that she spends time with all that is being murdered in this generic 80's slasher film. It is up to the local town of Sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his annoying mystery-loving goody two-shoe daughter, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday 13th Part 3) to get to the bottom of These killings. <br /> <br /> This film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the film and less on the killings themselves and thus distinguishes itself from many of the 80's Slas brothers. It doesn't hurt that Alesia has a good body (I feel the need to emphasize the obvious by saying that the actress is over 18 and thus convey that I'm not too perverted). On the back, the film is hampered by a few plot points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary, a grating theme some used too often and an end that is slightly anti-climatic. But the good outweighs the bad (barely). Give this a rental, but I wouldn't buy it. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Aleisa Shirley shows her breasts, bush and ass <br /> <br /> My character: C <br /> Code Red DVD Extras: An intro of the star Aleisa Shirley and Director of the Consumer, Scott Spiegel; Both the director's cutting and theater version of the film; Audio conversation with star Shirley and director Jim Sotos; Interview with Shirley, Sotos & Bo Hopkins; still gallery; theatrical trailer for this movie; and nightmare trailers, stunt rock, rituals and balalaika conspiracy
