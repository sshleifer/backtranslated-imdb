Unfortunately I made a mistake and I paid 7 euros at the cinema to watch this superficial meaningless movie. My points; <br /> <br /> Movies are based on 2 things; <br /> <br /> 1) Ethnic Viewpoint: As it happens on most American films, the author seems to be an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about Asian culture. But unfortunately this is not enough. Knowing kunefe and 2 names of other foods doesn't make a person understand a culture. For example, shaving is a sign of pure life in Asia, but everyone tried to stop the girl. Lebanese people are Christians (ok, they have), and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are quite different from other Arab countries. The biggest difference between Eastern and Western culture is that we do not do ethnocentrism. So we do not judge people after their first question about our life as a father figure did throughout the film. <br /> <br /> 2) Sexual Revolution of a Girl: There is not much to say about this. Show me 10 girls who had these on their sexual awakening than I would say I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> I wrote this comment because the producers advertise the movie in the black humor genre. Please see Dr.Strangelove and understand the meaning of black humor. A black humor must reflect the truth and must focus the audience on the fun parts of it. Where is the truth? Where is the meaning of the movie.
