In an instant, when it seemed interesting, it never came there. <br /> <br /> People go from one point to another point, with really no meaning (if there was one, it was very boring). There was no action, excitement, or any scare, and the characters were rather heartless, so there was no concern for what happened to them. <br /> <br /> Everything was pretty boring. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3/10. I liked that it wasn't shaky camera work, and if there was music, it wasn't annoying to me as some really bad movies and the play wasn't horrible.
