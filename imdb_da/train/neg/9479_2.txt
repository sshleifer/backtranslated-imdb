This movie thought it was better than it ended up being. The cinematography is good, the play seemed solid, the dialogue was not too rigid ... but then there are about 20 minutes in this long scene with a doctor who you know is actually a patient on the asylum pretending to be a doctor - and that just goes south from there. <br /> <br /> On top of that, the demon is the silliest look that has been in the lead since the godzilla-looking thing in the curse of the demon. There are also some odd demon worshipers wearing masks resembling the exploding teens from the start of Logans Run. Ultimately, cinematography could not save this movie. Despite some pretty solid performances from the actors, the story just doesn't go anywhere. I think "Hellbored" would have been a better title for this.
