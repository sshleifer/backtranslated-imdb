I saw this movie from the very positive reviews I read about this from others. <br /> <br /> They certainly saw something in this movie, I didn't see, it's safe. <br /> <br /> The movie starts at a good pace, and the first 15 or 20 minutes are interesting, so it begins to be logged and worn, not to mention absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> Finally, you find yourself saying, "What?!? He will also do it? How far does he go with this thing?" The concept begins with Jeff Goldblum's character, John, entering a deli to buy a bottle of wine. There is a robbery and a new store consultant, Auggie Rose, is killed during the robbery. <br /> <br /> John enters the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the guy. This seems a bit much, but wait, there's more. John is completely obsessed with Auggie Rose. <br /> <br /> For reasons that never give any logical meaning, John, who has a very good life, has a beautiful loving girlfriend, a safe, well-paying job, nice house, good car, expensive suits - Decider that he will be a loser like Auggie Rose and experience life in a low-paying job that lives in a dump with a dippy boyfriend and possible relationship with dangerous people. Why this dim-witted, half-baked movie got good reviews, I never know. Surely Goldblum does a good play - he always does - and his appearance is improved with age - but unless you have a big confusion with Jeff Goldblum and have to see every movie he's in, I wouldn't recommend this turkey. It's about two hours in your life, you're not going to come back - and believe me - you have nothing to be grateful for when the two hours are over, except to be grateful, you're still not there and see this movie ! <br /> <br />
