The film opens up with a long single shot of the hallways in the factory along with workers. My what we've done to the planet you might think. I hope we see other things like this. <br /> <br /> It's very rare. When you don't look at a horrible filmed angle on the narrator in a lecturer, you see him putting his camera to take pictures in various places. It would be nice to choose areas that were more appropriate with their subject, but he does not. So, then you will hear some more narrative, see a few pictures go by and see him create his camera. Why not use the movie camera to show more of the landscape instead? It really kills a sense of pacing and paints the guy who shakes more in vain. <br /> <br /> I could read tips on how someone put their camera up, forward through this movie and waste much less time.
