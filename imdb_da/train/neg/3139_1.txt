First of all, as a long-time student of the Titanic disaster and member of several Titanic clubs, I have the right to comment on the movie. I really don't care how many awards and recognize the movie, but it's still a horrible movie. Cameron had the resources to make a "real" semi-documentary of the disaster, but unfortunately chose to turn it into a po-faced romantic mush. The fact that so many people around the world fell for it, only in my opinion, shows the sad state of taste and common sense that film critics and audiences have today. Who said that all movies should have a totally and heroically in love? In fact, most real events are anything but romantic, and the Titanic disaster was certainly not one. I feel that it needed a better script and instructor with a semi-documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible. I almost threw up the last order where the 'dead' lovers meet among the other lost passengers and the crew who break out in applause. Is this an intelligent movie? Ask yourself.
