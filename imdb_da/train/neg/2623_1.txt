Sly Stallone is hardly the finest actor in the world, but compared to his brother, Frank ... Well, roll out those prices now! Mullet haired, the muppet Frank seems to think that every single part he plays calls on him to do the role of an American / Italian sage refugee from the 'godfather'. Please, someone makes him a working offer "he can refuse!" This movie just stinks out the place, even at the awful overactive in this, Frank still steals the acting dishonours. All people compensate for their lack of talent by shouting their lines and throwing their arms around, gesturing wildly in a style that went out of fashion with silent movies. The reason, what is there, makes no sense as a meteor lands and makes all women sex-crazy nymphetic, but as this is 15 certificate film, it just means they are stripping to their underwear and making moan sounds like dogs on heat. What happens in the end, I'm not quite sure since I lose the will to live long before the movie is finished. <br /> <br /> Avoid this like the plague and see 'Deep Impact' for a fair movie about a meteor about hitting the earth. <br /> <br /> NB Order: When one of the women strips her underwear, she has her knickers / panties under her hanger / belt belt, they are knickers over the hangers to allow women to go on the toilet with less stress. A trivial point, perhaps, but showing how stupid this movie is when they don't even get it right!
