In his way, Mr. Enemy (originally and more appropriately called Hallam Foe? I can't see addressing his title character as "losing"), is a tribute to good acting. Both Jamie Bell, like Hallam, a physically attractive voyeur / creep, and Sophia Myles, as Kate, his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance, are compelling. The problem comes when you try to connect their roles to everything that happens in real life. A young man who spies on the intimate details of people's lives that Hallam does would deserve a pulp. And a woman in Kate's situation would be rejected and scared - she would probably call the police. <br /> <br /> However, these things are not what happens in the movie. Poor Hallam's mother is dead, and his father is married to a woman with whom he has had an affair. Hallam, of course, hates his grandmother and lets him know it. She has sex with him. Kate is a kind of employee who places Hallam in a dishwashing liquid and plays sexual games. She looks like her mother-in-law. Everything happily ends with Hallam "solves" his "problems". A few years ago, the game and the brilliantly recorded film, Who's Braid of Virginia Woolf, a similarly optimistic ending, with the characters getting smarter and better after breaking each other. The problem is, it doesn't always work that way, especially when nobody really cares. In Virginia Woolf, the end is plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation. In mr. Enemy, the emotional revelation, never happens right.
