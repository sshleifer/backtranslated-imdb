Usually I love lesbian movies, even though they are not very good. I am biased, I think! <br /> <br /> But this is only pits. Yes, the scenery and buildings are beautiful, and there is a short but beautiful erotic interlude, but otherwise this movie is just a complete waste of time. Annamarie switches between swallowing and getting tall / stoned / passing beyond whatever matter or substance is practical, and Ella inexplicably sets this abominable behavior throughout the film. In no time do we get an idea of ​​why this is so, or even why the Annamarie is so depressed and withdrawn. <br /> <br /> If at least there had been some kind of closure in (potentially romantic? not even know!) the relationship between the two could have been some kind of satisfaction. But even though Annamarie at one point asks Ella "why do you love me?" Ella doesn't even recognize this. It is never quite clear whether this is something more than a (badly behaved) lesbian on a boring road trip with a pretty woman. <br /> <br /> Even the interactions between the two women and the local people they meet on the Journey, who could have been lively and informative, are instead flat, boring and mostly incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> There's a good joke in the movie, though I'm sure it was accidental. The women travel in a two-seat Ford Coupe with a medium sized trunk. But when they set up camp, they have a huge tent, cots, sleeping equipment and even a table, chair and typewriter! On top of that, when they control a ferry, we see piles of luggage, probably theirs, probably also carried in the little Ford's trunk! <br /> <br /> And throughout the film, we never see a gas station, or anywhere it looks like it would actually have a place to buy gasoline. For the most part, they travel through endless miles of desert desert. So where did they get fuel? There must not be too many lesbian movies out there, good or bad, but there are plenty that are better than this and very few are worse. Leave this in the stand.
