Really bad and easily the worst episode I have ever seen .... ever. <br /> <br /> They tried to do it by giving it "we know we're doing this" routine. It would have been fun if it wasn't for the fact that "The Simpsons" had already done so. And it would still do nothing for it if they first came up with the idea. <br /> <br /> The feedback took place as part of the usual character (mainly J.D's) fantasies. Flashbacks were not even of actual events that occurred, just collections of say, J.D fall over or, I don't know .... Elliott falls over. If I wanted to see a Scrubs compilation, I would go on youtube and not waste half an hour in my life. Scrubs have ultimately fallen into the trap that most sit-coms have to do, and I am disappointed to be able to go 5 and a quarter seasons without an episode like this. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that scrubs shouldn't be like sit-com. <br /> <br /> Just like a passing thought, why in hell was Dr.Cox bald?
