My nose is bent slightly out of shape when I write this. I had posted a previous comment on this movie some weeks ago, which has not yet been shown, so I assume it was rejected even though it met all the usual guidelines. <br /> <br /> I found this movie interesting for the first thirty minutes, especially the performance of Jordi Moll√†, a veteran actor who has appeared in such great productions as "Blow" and "The Alamo." Leonor Watling is also quite good. Unfortunately, everything gradually drops below the weight of a truly horrible melodramatic script. There is also an abundance of free naked that does nothing to promote the narrative or even give an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed work of art. An actual day trip to the beach in Valencia would be much less tough than having to meet these fictitious characters anywhere, anytime.
