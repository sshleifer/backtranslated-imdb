The people who boast this movie are the real disappointments - at least I hope Leonard will see some good $$ out of this when his life savings were confused by a manager a couple of years ago and he is over 70 now . But this movie is simply horrible. In the beginning, Leonard himself says that he is not sentimental about his past, and then for the next one and a half hours, the film emphasizes all the worst sentimental elements in Leonard's songs. It is so bloody necessary with its endless close-ups of hypersensitive singers. Cohen's interview is all done in lo-fi video close-ups, and I would then see a medium or long shot of his entire body! I couldn't care less about the artist's comments, especially the overwhelmed ego boys Edge and Bono. None of the performers in this movie have even made a song as good as Leonard's own music and if you are thinking of seeing this and you are in doubt at all, be aware of them. This would be an acceptable PBS special, perhaps for once to show. But I would even hesitate to get a DVD of this one. When the film finally shows Leonard's semi-performance "Tower of Song", Bono is destroyed by a verse. Even occasionally good performances (Antony, Rufus' first issue, Martha's The Traitor) are spoiled by the connection with the rest of this turgid blabla. Forget about this and buy Leonard's latest album if you want to pay tribute to him.
