Thank God! I didn't waste my money renting it, but I picked it up! This happens to be the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life, f ***** g visual effects, unnecessary doing and nudity! Far from each other from other Zombie movies like Night of the Living Dead and others. There are lots of loop holes and bugs in the movie. OK, if you have time after reading this comment, please check the director's (Ulli Lommel) profile. After seeing that I got a self-explanation why the movie is like this, I think that all movies directed by Ulli Lommel get a rating between 1 and 2. And now I'm not willing to search what kind of movie these are directed by him, but I can finish all this by saying a strong sentence. Even for fun or time past or even in an extremely boring situation, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.
