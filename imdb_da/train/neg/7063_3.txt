The guy made a lot of title design for a bunch of movies, and I think one day he said; I should choose a cheap scenario, so try to put as much title into it as a can (because I'm a title designer) and try to persuade people that this is actually a movie. One of the worst I have ever seen is for sure. If you wanted to see good titles, look at some posters not wasting your time watching it. <br /> <br /> It's a little ironic, don't you think you saw the poster? The only part of his project that should have worked on the title has almost no!
