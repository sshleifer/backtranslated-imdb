All the elements for a bad night in the cinema are in place: Dialogue with the biological technobabble, chintzy sets, balsa-wood plays, a horrible late-80s Casio score and an overall look that suggests something about Sci- Fi Channel Programming Plan, circa 1993. Although "Metamorphosis" starts with a lot of promise, the movie turns into gentle idiocy and MST3K-style cheese, as Clark Kent wannabe 'Doctor' Peter Houseman (Gene LeBrock) is pressed to release information about his secret projects . But when he tests his vague experiment on himself, he turns into a vaguely defined being (carrying more than a transitory similarity to 'Dr. Freudstein' from 'House by the Cemetery'). The FX work is pretty good for such a course of low budget production (although I suppose most are kept in shadow for a reason), but in general, "Metamorphosis" leaves a bad retro aftertaste in your intestine, despite its hope of hovering otherwise us. I can't help but agree with a character's final remark: "(It was) A nightmare ... of the past!"
