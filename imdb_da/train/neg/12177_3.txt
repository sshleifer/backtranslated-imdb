Since the 70s, author / producer / director Charles Band has been responsible for literally hundreds of science-fiction, fantasy and horror B movies. Some of them are wonderful examples of how to use a small budget for maximum effect; many of them are pretty bad. Trancers (1985) was one of the rare gems. <br /> <br /> A Terminator style story of time travel and action, Trancers saw Tim Thomerson, who played Jack Deth, a future policeman tasked with tracking down bad guy Whistler, who enters the past by residing as an ancestor . Whistler is able to control other people with his psychic powers, transform them into obedient zombies (the title's "trancers") and try to change the course of history by killing the ancestors of future leaders. Jack follows him until 1985, determined to stop him. <br /> <br /> In 1991, Jack is still living in 1985. After destroying Whistler, he settled down and married Leena (Helen Hunt), the young woman who helped him succeed the first movie. But for Jack things are not quiet for a long time, and problems arise in the form of Whistler's brother, E.D. Wardo is trying to build a trance army. <br /> <br /> Trancers II lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a huge disappointment considering how good the original was. The story is hard to pick up if you haven't seen the first movie (or at least not for a long time), and there are lots of unimpressive actions and a few bad special effects. Gone is the ingenuity and joke that made Trancers so much fun; instead we get some cheesy one-liners and a script that feels like it was written on the plane. <br /> <br /> About the only reason I can give to recommend this movie to fans of the genre is the cast that boasts many names that will be known to fans of sci-fi and horror movies: Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Richard Lynch, Martine Beswicke. Unfortunately, most of them seemed to have an "off day" while recording Trancers II, and the performances are mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> The Trancers series apparently has its fans; Four further successors have since been churned out. Unless the quality has taken up massive upward turns, I can't imagine they are good.
