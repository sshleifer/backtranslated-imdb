Lorenzo Lama's stars like Jack `Solider` Kelly a veterinarian from Vietnam and a dismissed policeman who goes on a search and destroys mission to save his sister from backwoods rednecks. Atrocious movies are so cheaply made and so bad that Ron Palillo is the third ticket and yet has 3 minutes of screen time and even they are not good. All in all, it's a horrible movie, but the scenes with Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell hanging from a tree bagged and gagged are worth getting a few (unintentional) laughs. Followed by an improved sequel.
