One of my friends bought this movie for Â£ 1 and even then it was grossly overpriced. Although there were big names like Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and the incredibly talented Burt Young, this movie was as fun as taking a chisel and hammering it right through your earhole. It uses tired, bottom of barrel comic techniques - consistently breaking the fourth wall that Sandler speaks to the audience and apparently meaningless mounting of 'hot girls'. Adam Sandler plays a servant on a cruise ship who wants to make it a successful comedian to be successful with women. When the ship's resident comedian - the shameless name 'Dickie' because of his inevitable success with the opposite sex - is believed to be lost at sea, Sandler's character gets Shecker his great break. Dickie is not dead, he is a little locked in the bathroom, presumably sea sick. <br /> <br /> Perhaps from the mouth he just vomited the worst movie from all the time.
