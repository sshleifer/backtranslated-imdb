In Cold Blood, one of several 60's films created a new vision of violence in the Hollywood movie industry. Capote devised the term "nonfiction novel" to describe the book on which this film is based, and the spirit of that form was transferred to the film script, which he wrote together. Despite the fact that we were well into the era of color film, Richard Brooks chose to present this film in black and white to emphasize both the country's sharpness and the gloom of history. This is the first problem with TV remake - color changes tone in history. In addition, the incarceration of shooting a movie to television makes it possible to reduce the possibilities of how the shoots are framed and focused. As a result, we lose the dramatic clash that makes the second part of the original film (police interviews, trial, imprisonment and execution) so claustrophobic. On the small screen, it's just another version of Law and Order spin-offs. <br /> <br /> Hollywood's search for scripts continually takes it back to movies that were successful in another age. It is usually a mistake and it is no exception. <br /> <br /> All actors are competent. The script is OK. The management does not get in the way. It's just that the film doesn't work as well as the original precision instrument. It does not call the viewer into the ambivalence of Smith and Hickock as the original film provokes. At the end of the TV version we are left with the feeling: "Ho hum, who cares?" <br /> <br /> See the original first, on as large a screen as you can, then watch the TV version simply understand why the first one was such an important movie in 1967. Wouldn't hurt to also go on line and read a little about Capote and the original book. It will help you understand the extraordinary effort he put into the material and also part of the controversy surrounding both the book and the film. <br /> <br /> In fact, I've only given this a 4 because I save the bottom 3 locations for true bombs - the kind that scares you about having been sucked into using one
