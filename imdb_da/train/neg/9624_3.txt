Given the potential of this step, reality was disappointing. While it's always nice to see Jennifer Aniston in a movie, even it couldn't turn around. Most of the action was predictable. The jokes were flat to mildly funny. And the characters were not very interesting. I wanted to like this movie, but it never happened. Ben Stiller was fun in "There is something about Mary". Here it seems that he is just going through the movements. If they were to lift plot points from "Friends," they should have known that something was wrong. Toilet humor should have stayed in the closet :-). <br /> <br /> See "50 First Dates" instead.
