I don't really know where to start. The action in this movie was really awful, I can't remember seeing so many "actors" in a movie that couldn't act. Not only the play was bad, the characters were also incredibly stupid. <br /> <br /> There is the action. I think even children know that when someone is shot, blood is involved. But when someone is shot in Snitch'd for ten (!!) times, there is no blood at all. I think it's just me. <br /> <br /> To make a long story short (because believe me, I can continue for hours on this movie), it is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen. This film will no doubt be number 1 in the bottom 100.
