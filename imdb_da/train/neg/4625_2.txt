How could 4 out of 16 former voters give this movie a 10? How could more than half of previous voters give it a 7 or higher? Who's voting here? I can only assume it is primarily children - very young children. The fact is that this is a bad movie in every way. The story is stupid; the action is hard to think of as acting; the characters are characterless and the dialogue is horrible. I saw this rainy afternoon on the Sci-Fi channel. In the sad event that it is ever reused, I suggest you read a book instead.
