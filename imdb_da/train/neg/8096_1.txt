Most book adaptations are bad, but this movie released important parts of the story and changed the description and some characters. They rewired the story and combined scenes and changed the order. They added ridiculous things to what never happened in the book and would never happen. <br /> <br /> If I hadn't read the book beforehand, it would have been an incredibly boring movie, it didn't care about the characters, like them, or didn't like them. It makes the characters jokes. <br /> <br /> Awful. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous. Relax for two hours in my life.
