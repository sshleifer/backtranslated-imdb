This movie was made and cast from my hometown. I remember it and the whole hull that Molly Ringwald was in town ... Storyline ... Essentially 20 years after a movie was "laid to rest" without being finished, a group of film studios set out to complete It - with serious consequences. It seems that somebody does not want the movie to be completed. The story is flimsy. One has to remember that this is a comedy and therefore has to be taken a little heavy in the cheek, but it had no real oomph. The signs are mostly transparent, and the little info you receive about those you just don't care about seems irrelevant. It's strange to hear Kylie's accent as an Australian again and nice to see a child I attended school in a lead role. But it doesn't solve the movie at all. Goodness knows why the decision makers thought they would get in Molly Ringwald. Maybe because of the film's character (it gives a tribute to the 80s movie / bad horror movies), but really an Aussie actor would have done fine. <br /> <br /> As far as casting is concerned, there is a lot about the play seemed constipated. Some of these children (especially the two main chics - the played "director" and "producer") looked like they were trying to act. It's never a good look. The shoots also had a rough feeling about them. Maybe over lights up? Just not as smooth as you are used to. <br /> <br /> Killer. Master. Could it be less scary? However, there are some shock factors and a few gross scenes. I liked the movie, but it wasn't great. It went for 90 minutes but could have gone too less. Maybe if they had tightened the script, it would have been better. They had many characters killed - but no real structure for them to be beaten. Maybe if they had killed fewer people and actually concentrated in a frightening atmosphere, it would have been better. <br /> <br /> Now I know it's a comedy and elements were fun. Or so unbelieveable they were funny. But I'm not convinced. <br /> <br /> LM.
