PROS: Akshay Kumar's performance (is it just me or is this guy always able to trump AB in their movie together?). Some touching scenes in the second half. <br /> <br /> CONS: Whole 1st hour (the jokes were flat to say the least). Each scene involves Rajpal Yadav. Great stupidity in AB's decision making. Let me get it right, he believes brutally insulting his son's soul in every possible way (it will probably ruin their relationship without repair) is a better way for him to get Akshay to take some responsibility and then actually tell him the truth ?? WTF? He believes that Akshaye is too soft to bear the fact that his old father will soon die because of cancer, but believes that offending him will make him stronger? Am I the only one who doesn't see the logic here? Easy movie's biggest mistake. <br /> <br /> - Akshay becomes a stunt man. LMAO !! We are told that he has finished 1st in college each year and holds an MBA degree. But when the time comes to support himself and his pregnant wife, he becomes a stunt man. LAUGH OUT LOUD !! How does abt actually apply for a normal job in the clock field? Or Heck, anywhere where your life is not in danger? These are some incredibly stupid letters. <br /> <br /> - The end. I hate this kind of melodramatic crap. Everything is pushed down in our throats to be sad AB's character, which I could not. The whole thing reminded me a little too much of Srk in KHNH (which I hate). This "please be sorry the guy with the disease" crap has run his course. I felt more like puking than sympathy for the old man. Couldn't see the last 20 or so minutes because of it and therefore had to quickly fwd. all. <br /> <br /> Bottomline: Waqt is just too stupid to be called a good movie. The obvious director Vipul Shah targeted this on the emotionally fragile chicas and oldies who could lessen a story that actually makes sense. Give them some decent song scenes, fancy outfits, lots of glycerin-filled scenes, and some stellar power, and they will happily lap up crap like this.
