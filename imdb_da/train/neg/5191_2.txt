Ahh, the boring t.v. shows and pilots merged in the 70s to make as boring as possible. movie! Some examples would be Riding With Death (the most hysterical of the party), Stranded in Space (confusing and uninteresting), San Francisco International (terribly boring and incredibly confusing) and this turgid piece of Quinn Martin's glamor. <br /> <br /> Shot in Hawaii (although you wouldn't know it from the outside), it's apparently a failed pilot for a lame spy show. The real problem is that you don't like most of the characters, including killing the protagonist Diamond Head, who seemed half sleep for the whole movie; his boss 'aunt mary' who had a really strange supply of her lines and shellacked white hair as well as a brownish brown that looked like it had been stuccoed on; Diamnd Head's boyfriend / mediator (hell, I can't even remember her name) a thin wooden cone with a flat way to talk, it's just not sexy or interesting; and the singing sidekick Zulu (again, I can't remember his character's name), which was not bad in small doses. The most interesting person in the whole production was Ian McShane, who sucked like a bad guy, but still proved his working chops. The Alothugh makeup job this so-called "chameleon" used to pamper itself was just ridiculous. I have absolutely no idea what he was doing or what he was trying to steal from the lab that made him dress like an American dictator with American general. Don't even care about me. The reason was simply not interesting enough to keep your attention for even ten minutes at a time, let alone one and a half or so it goes on. Just call this - Hawaii Five No!
