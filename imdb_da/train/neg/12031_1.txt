First of all, this film is not a comedy; Unless you really strengthen yourself, you can hardly laugh. Second, the movie is slow and dull. The action is not bad, but not special. There is a Lucky Luke cartoon of two families (one with big noses and one with big ears) fighting each other in a small town ... you will laugh much more if you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie. Religions and dogmas are not the best source for making a good comedy, and this film does no more than confirm this rule. There is a similar topic comedy '' The home teachers ''; This had some good moments. My last comment is: Don't waste your time and money to watch this uninspired and boring movie.
