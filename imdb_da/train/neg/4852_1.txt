I saw this movie once and I thought it was OK. So, my friends at work said "Look again, it's better". So I did. And to my surprise, it was the second time! There is a word limit so I have to get the ball rolling here. <br /> <br /> -Battery scenes were so stupid. Why on earth would anyone wait to trigger the explosion ??? None of the characters here are even extremely sympathetic. Not in the first place, not even the other one. <br /> <br /> -Oh, and last time I checked in, a car does not explode from a single gun shot, nor can it be a huge fire extinguisher ... the above 3/10 viewers actually have seen the movie ??? - The camera is so shaken, I can hardly tell what's going on. The open scene with the robot had my stomach off-put, the rest of the movie wasn't much better. <br /> <br /> - The shooter scene. McManus Brothers (from "The Boondock Saints") wanted to roll their eyes, it was so stupid. First of all, why did the guy plant his gun where a person had been shot? Why should he spend so much time cleaning the balls, reloading, aiming and not being shot, as there was so much chaos around him? -SAS types RUNNING instead of staying and fighting back ?????? Huh ????? Are the soldiers ... gays ... ??? I didn't mean to sound homophobic, but honestly, the scene was so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> -Length for its own good, but too short for the amount of material built into it. Bigelow seems to think that the more action the better. Looks like she's wrong - the movie is full of redundant action scenes thrown in to distract you from the lack of a central plot. I know the guards are longer in 163 minutes, but at least the movie didn't hit. This film, on the other hand, does, and for that, longer. <br /> <br /> The only good thing was Renner, which was at best satisfactory. But do yourself a favor, just skip this and don't give in to the hype.
