This was the worst movie I've ever seen in theaters. It was just a collection of recycled materials. People being hit in the head are not fun. People being kicked are not fun. After the third time, a guy was kicked in the balls, not even the youngest audience laughing more. It just got tired quickly. <br /> <br /> I went with my younger sister. She actually laughs loudly at King of the Hill, but this biographical masterpiece bored her. I am not surprised. The story is pretty boring. A midget thief steals a big diamond in what was definitely the easiest heist in Hollywood history. Then he hides out with a family pretending to be a baby. I know that sounds exciting, but it's the whole story. Say these two lines again and again for 1.5 hours and you get the picture There were predictable jokes to a great extent. I felt really ripped off after seeing this. I didn't expect much and I was still disappointed. I want Keenan to just hire some decent writers to write jokes and / or his next script. This was even worse than white chickens, if possible. I've seen high schools that were better and cheaper. <br /> <br /> There was nothing positive about this movie. I don't like my entertainment being stupid.
