Don't rent this movie. It has nothing to do with an escape from the death row, despite the (English) title. I can't think of one good thing to say about the movie. Bad action, bad editing, poor conducting ... ridiculous "plot" and the sound / music was so annoying, it's strange that this movie doesn't come with a warning sign. The only possible way to sit through this movie and enjoy it is for the historic cheesiness quality. They just don't make movies any worse.
