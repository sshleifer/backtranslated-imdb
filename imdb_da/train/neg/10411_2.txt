It is fun. I've seen a bunch of Fassbinder movies, and I've found some to be extremely creative and interesting, while others are repulsive and self-indulgent fairs - like this movie. For me, it varies from big to shame - without much in the middle. I know he has many fans among the "sophisticated", but I can't help but believe that a lot of his appeal is pure hype. From my point of view (and I know I get many negative reviews for this), he made too many movies too fast and was too smug. His gay or gender-bending films (like this one) tend to be really bad - dormant, sometimes rather dull (like QUERELLE and BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VON KANT) and sometimes just gross (like this movie). Couldn't his message of accepting a person's sexual confusion be handled better than showing him being beaten or watching cows being cruelly slaughtered? Show some sensitivity to the subject and make your characters more human and sympathetic - so maybe I would worry about the movies. <br /> <br /> I'm honest at that point after watching this movie, which I might not like with more Fassbinder movies - the bad looks to weigh good.
