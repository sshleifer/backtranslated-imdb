Stewart Kane (Gabriel Byrne, VANITY FAIR) leads out with his local Jindabies, Australian fishing companions for a weekend of rest, recreation and relaxation. But when Stewart discovers an aboriginal woman's body floating down a river, it seems that it's been the worst. The biggest accident this weekend is the men's comments. They do not wander out of the gorge and instead end their fishing weekend with some big catches. Then they run out and report the body. <br /> <br /> The city and men's life quickly becomes a mess. The local media swear to them and accuse aboriginal prejudices coming from local natives. Stewart's wife Claire (Laura Linney, EMILY ROSE) explodes the deeper meanings of what her husband and his friends did, but has to struggle with it through his own mental illness. In the midst of all this chaos is the life that was this young woman, now a media spectacle spread on a broiler. Her murder and subsequent dumping in the water is symbolic of what lies beneath the city of Jindabyne: a division of men and women, black and white, social and excluded. <br /> <br /> The only other people who seem to understand some of the things going on are two young children: Stewart and Claire's son, led by a half-breed Aussie, whose mother was also killed just one few years before. The young girl lives with her grandparents and tries to let her mother be the best way she can and the discovery of a new body seems ?? oddly enough ?? one way to achieve this (again is the underlying stream of Jindabyne). <br /> <br /> Everything and everyone in this Jindabyne Township feels what lurks beneath the surface, but none of them are willing to dive into the creepy waters and look around (the symbolism here is seen when a nearby lake used for recreation and swimming is said to contain the old city of Jindabyne beneath its surface). Nothing, that is, until Claire forces them to. <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting if it's a little too horrified. There are far too many stories to be explored and it just won't finish. too many loose threads. The action was okay, but the movie was horrible. Wobbly cameras, grainy or dark shots and just a general blurring make overall production damage. <br /> <br /> I enjoy symbolic movies, NORTHFORK is one of my all-time favorites in that friend. But Jindabyne needed to blow his head over the turbid water so that it could see his own problems, which simply didn't happen.
