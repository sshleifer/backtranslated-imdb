When I go to watch a movie about zombies, I do not expect Oscar caliber performances or write on The Godfather level, but I expect the actors at least do not look like their efforts to read their cue card and dialogue it sounds not as it was written out 10 minutes before the actor reads it into the camera. This movie was just awful, I actually went up and walked in about 25 minutes and walked next door and looked at Cold Creek Manor, it wasn't very good either, but it seemed like Citizen Kane compared to this pile of crap. On the plus side, the girls were very beautiful, it is probably the only thing that kept me in my seat for longer than the first 5 minutes, actually I left after the hottest was killed, there was nothing to keep my interest behind it.
