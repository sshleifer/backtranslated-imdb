Lame plot and two-dimensional script-tailored characters resemble cardboard cuts. Needless to say, it made it difficult to feel empathy for any of the signs, especially the fiancé; He looked and seemed more like a cartoon. In summary, I think you could say it was on par with your typical made for television drama. It uses almost all clichés in the book. The tortured classical musician who wants to break out and play salsa. The open-minded fiancé is engaged in a "prayer-right" personality, she doesn't love. I will not list them, otherwise it would be a spoiler because I would give away the whole plot. The dance was OK, but nothing special. I've seen worse. 3 stars for good music. The band was really tight. I saw it on YouTube. Fortunately, I didn't pay good money to watch it at a theater. I'm still a little shocked at how many good reviews this movie has garnered.
