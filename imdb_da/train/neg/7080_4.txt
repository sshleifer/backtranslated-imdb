This movie could have been an interesting character study and could have given some insight into the subject, but the real problem with this movie is that it has none of this. It gives no insight or solutions to the problem. It is just the portrayal of 'old' male sex addicts and the problems this creates for his everyday life, normal life and family. Why would you like to see this? It is all so pointless and meaningless. <br /> <br /> It also doesn't help that the protagonist is a wrinkled 50+ year old man. You find it difficult to identify yourself - and sympathize with him. He just seems like a dirty old playboy who is a constant hunt for woman and sex. He has all kinds of intercourse about 3 times a day with another woman and not just with prostitutes. It also does not have a bad visual style, although it all feels a little forced. But it's still better than most other direct-to-video productions. Who knows if the filmmakers had better material to work with, the film would have earned a better faith. The story is really ridiculed at times. There are really some meaningless plot lines that are often more ridiculous than they should of course be. I'm talking about, for example, the whole Ordell plot line. Things get worse when the movies begin to go towards the end. The whole way the story is told also changes back and forth between the events that happened and the protagonist's sessions with his psychiatrist feel a little cheap and simple. <br /> <br /> But as far as bad movies are concerned, this is just not one of them. It's not really better or worse than any other random straight-to-video flip with similar concepts. It still seems odd and amazing that they managed to throw Nastassja Kinski and Ed Begley Jr. in such a simple little insignificant production as this is. Guess they were really desperate for work and money. <br /> <br /> 4/10
