I remember my parents not understanding Saturday Night Live when I was 15. They also understood Rock n Roll and many other things. Now that I am approaching their age, I still remember, and I understand many of the things my children love. But this is pathetic. I can't say I've seen any of Sarah except a few appearances here and there. They were reasonable. I can't see her as something special. But this show is just as far below what I had expected of her. IMDb write up made it sound like potential. So just for that, I started to see the first episode. I hit it halfway through. Something else is better. Witnesses intended for a 5-year-old featured on a suspected adult program. Well, Sarah, this adult is built-in to turn you off. I just can't believe anyone actually financed this insult to comedy. The only good thing I can say is that there are so many bad jokes deposited here, saving other shows from such embarrassment.
