I saw this movie at its New York High Falls Film Festival screening as well, and I have to say I found it a complete and horrible drill. Although it was fun in some places, the only real laugh was that there seemed to be a real plot to talk about, and the actor in some places was horrible and timid, especially the "lovely lady" and the narrator's voice (which I have never heard of) had much to be desired. J.C.Mac was, I felt, the redeeming feature of this movie, true action and grit and (out of cast) the only real actor. I'm sure with another cast and a tighter reign of governance, this could have been a half decent movie. Let's just hope it's not sent out for general release, or if you really want a copy, check out the Lidl.
