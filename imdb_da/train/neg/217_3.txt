This is a movie that depends solely on the somewhat controversial image of incest and lesbianism to be noticed. That is it. The dialogues are pathetic and the sensuality of "sex scenes" is absolutely absent. The action and dialogue is better suited to high school children, but the topic is intended for adult audiences. It's a gutless and shallow movie. It could have been much better if it had a story and more drama. Ah and in addition one more thing: why are inner monologues so overly used? It seems so cheap. All in all, an embarrassing film for Romanian film as well as for mature audiences trying to see it. I know the funds are scarce, but it is not always an excuse for a movie flop like this one does. And please start using some good actors in your movies and stop reusing them from musicians (Tudor Chirila) - they can't act!
