(Spoiler included, some will say) <br /> <br /> This movie is not possible to take seriously. In some parts, it's so incredibly stupid that I just can't help laughing at all. Try me for the order in which Stallone's character jumps about 20 feet with full climbing or (and this is really my favorite) snus a bad guy by sticking him on a stalactite. Yes, what wicked strength had he patterned to perform such feats? I don't, but he does make the reality run for the money.
