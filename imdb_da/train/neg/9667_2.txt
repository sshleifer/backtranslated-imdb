This film is justly famous as one of the most horrible examples of propaganda ever produced. The hunters' insistence equation is simply pathological, and even worse it becomes almost credible in short seconds <br /> <br /> through its pure repetition. The fact that something this raw is, even <br /> <br /> is an object lesson in itself. You must have a strong stomach and a firm grip on yourself sitting through this and I would not recommend trying unless you have a good reason.
