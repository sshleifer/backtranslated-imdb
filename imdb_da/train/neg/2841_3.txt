SAKURA KILLERS (1+ beyond 5 stars) Maybe in 1987 this movie might have been cool ... if you had never seen a * good * ninja movie. Cheesy '80s music ... cheesy dialogue ... cheesy acting ... and way-beyond-cheesy martial arts sequences. The coolest scene is in the beginning ... with an old Chuck Connors playing golf on a beach ... several black-dressed ninjas are trying to sneak up on him, and it seems he is too appropriate to hit his ball to see ... suddenly he gets into his golf bag and ... naw, i don't want to spoil it for you ... if you ever have the bad luck to see this movie, you will thank me. The story is very nonsense about something stolen video tape or something. A bunch of dim Caucasian heroes are trained in the ways the ninja is because "only a ninja can fight a ninja" or something. Strangely, these guys don't seem to fight better after their training than before. Oh yes, the movie is moving very quickly. The battle scenes can't be great .. but they are plentiful ... and the exaggerated sound effects are good for a few chuckles.
