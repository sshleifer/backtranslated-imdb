1. Aliens resemble plush toys and puppets while they have non-working arms. <br /> <br /> 2. Foreigners master intergalactic space travel, but they do not know how to press an unlocked vault door open, but can open a door that is kept closed by five people. <br /> <br /> 3. Old security guards know how to get hold of the C4 and just wait for the right time to use it, say, when they suddenly fired without an explanation. <br /> <br /> 4. Apparently, US Army boot camp involved in the 80s several sessions of "garden tool combat", including pirouette spin of death. <br /> <br /> 5. To impress your prudish girl friend, you need to "save the world ... er ... neighborhood" from foreigners. <br /> <br /> 6. All women are closed, either open or secret. <br /> <br /> 7. Scummy nightclubs look like bad dinners. <br /> <br /> 8. "Scummy" waitresses double as dancers to The Fontanelles (how were they spoken into this?) that can only make bad 60's dance movements. <br /> <br /> 9. Army privateers are dreaming of being Rambo. <br /> <br /> 10. Grenades apparently have a "flash-bang" setting. <br /> <br /> 11. Being burned in living eyes, leaving only one with minor burns on their arms. <br /> <br /> 12. US Army Staff Sargeants seem to always be in the area and do nothing with foreigners in the area. <br /> <br /> 13. Foreigners seem to always "go home", which means back to the vault that they were not locked in. <br /> <br /> 14. Foreigners are attracted to bright light, which apparently means in the Los Angeles area one assumes that the protagonist's house is the most illuminated thing in the area. <br /> <br /> 15. Showing 16 parking scenes in a movie makes the audience cling for more. <br /> <br /> 16. Vans from the 80s apparently have terrible spring systems. <br /> <br /> 17. This movie will feature a comedy. <br /> <br /> 18. Screams must be in this movie. <br /> <br /> 19. This film features spoofs and homages. <br /> <br /> 20. This movie cures insomnia. <br /> <br /> 21. Apparently, garden tools make electronic keyboard sounds when used, not just in combat (tell me I'm not the only one who noticed this). The simple truth is that this movie just came out wrong. Period. There is not much meat on the leg, and neither does it really good. Even average. It's just bad. However, I have seen much worse, and the rake battle scene is pure comedy gold, intentional or otherwise. <br /> <br /> 2/10 - Jaws 4 were worse than this. At least, the film never took seriously.
