So 'Thinner' ... Yep .. This Steven Bachman (reads Steven King) yarns about a man who gets his just desserts from a gypsy brother he just killed. The story itself is there, no doubt about it, but I don't know why I don't enjoy it more than I could have. I guess what really distracted me was the actors. I mean, who's the leader? Robert John Burke? Who is he? And goes crying loudly, can anyone please stop hiring Joseph Mantegna for every Italian Mafioso's role ever? And while we know, every Mafioso must have a pasta cooking Italian mother? The only good play job here is under 10 pounds of makeup, Michael Constantine as gypsy elders. He's pretty good. But the rest I do all of you, "better actors ..."
