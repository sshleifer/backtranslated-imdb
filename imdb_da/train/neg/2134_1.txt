With this roll and budget you expect more. <br /> <br /> John Cusack has made a series of films that adjoin the strange but still work. Neither he, his sister nor Sir Ben could do anything to save this travesty of tired badly written waste. <br /> <br /> The movie is nothing more than a series of synagogues and bad ones. The reason goes nowhere, the writing is constructed, meaningless and the characters are thin. If you think of a movie as three-dimensional, where the story and the characters put a depth in the pictures of the image, this stink comes as flat as the steamboat mix. <br /> <br /> Dan Akroyd's appearance in this brought memories from another truly horrible movie, 1991's Nothing but Trouble. Frankly, this film is the type of project that kills career and gets agents fired.
