It was a decent movie, I really enjoyed it. But the end is so abrupt !! There is absolutely no closure and it leaves tons of loose ends. What happens after the concert? What happens to his girlfriend? Does she join Grant? Will she come in the next semester? And what about Angela? Of course, Holly's performance would knock Angela down a few sticks, but nothing has been shown to indicate how she responds. There is so much left in the air and it is very unsatisfactory. I don't know if it's trying to leave room for a sequel or something, but it's a terrible ending and I think it really does make the movie a joke. I was very disappointed.
