I didn't even know that this movie existed shortly after I saw Blade: Trinity, I ran around on the Trinity table when I saw some users how the Wes Craven series is much better than "crap" it is Leaves so I did my quick research: Checked the scores on IMDb & RottenTomatoes for Dracula: Ascension, and somewhere along the search I found out that this is a successor to Dracula 2000. I also noticed that within Wes Craven Dracula boards There was a really strong following for this movie, which is a major contradiction to the scores I saw. <br /> <br /> Now let's take a quick personal session here. I remember seeing Dracula 2000 and I remember that I did not like it and when I saw the results of Dracula: Ascension just lowered my expectations even more, but then again I am the type of person who really should watch the movie yourself (any movie) so I can make my own opinion. <br /> <br /> A couple of things I went into knew when I started watching this movie was that it is low budget, so because of it, I have to ignore a lot of v / eg and just count with the fact that it will compensate for history and acting, I was also a little impressed with some of the castings in this movie (Jason London, Roy Schieder & Jason Scott Lee) <br /> <br /> Oh? This movie was CHEESY! But cheesy can be entertaining at least, I found the beautiful fricken ridiculous, the poor sound synchronization from resuming dialogue in FEW scenes, the stupidity of the characters in this movie. Sure they all knew about vampires and some of the basic things, Luke even had a book about it, but prevented them from intentionally getting 'infected'? No, it's the worst thing when slasher flicks where the girl gets out of the shower and check out the noise she hears with nothing but a towel on. I should also have flashed at some point because I am not sure how 'Dracula' has clothes on his body, especially since he is wild and angry, and I expect if I was in that situation, I would not be the one who beat him. <br /> <br /> So does the movie end like any middle film of a trilogy ?? It doesn't, instead it's a 'Cliff Hangar' where I'm now waiting for the 3rd installment 'Legacy'. Oh the entertainment value of cheesy film.
