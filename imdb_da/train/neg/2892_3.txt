Ursula Andres' naked body is one of the things that makes you believe in God. The other two women (especially the one playing the girl) also have good bodies. So why is the higher class I can give to a movie of such quality and quantity of nudity only 3 out of 10? To get to Ursula's incredible body, we have to go through a movie that is otherwise unfunny and boring (remember I saw the full 101-minute version, not the 78-minute American that probably cuts much of the foreign material). In the typical Italian comedy tradition, most characters are exaggerated caricatures (the army freak, the "Latin lover", the constantly drunk, the naive girl) who are not funny, simply exaggerated. Final words: See this, but keep your finger on the forward button you need it. (*)
