Stinks. That's all I have to say about this apologetic excuse for a movie. Sucks. Sucks. Sucks. I mean, what the hell did they think? The idiots involved must never be allowed to make other films. The action was so bad that it did not even fail to entertain at a bad level. Attempts at a "lesbian scene" were sad. I felt so bad for the ladies involved. This movie sucks! Sucks! Sucks! <br /> <br /> I heard rumors of a successor. <br /> <br /> God <br /> <br /> Help <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All
