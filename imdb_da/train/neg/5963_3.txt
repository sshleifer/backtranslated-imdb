This movie starts with a performance of a witchcraft practitioner and his mistress. His head is cut off and buried separately by his body ... sounds like "The Thing Who Wouldn't Die" Not? Now it plays a bit, but when the body is reunited with the head, all the interesting and cruel deaths are made, and the film moves very slowly. I think the movie is only 88 minutes long and I continued to think "when will it end"? The characters in the movie are idiots for the most part, and they deserve the right to die to be really stupid. The villain is also very poor as he slowly moves and really wonder how he manages to do anything considering he is afraid of jewelry. The only thing that allows you to look after the head is attached again is the fact that there are so many breasts that blink that you are really starting to lose track. I still want to watch a horror movie, not a soft core porn flick and as a horror movie is the way to slowly move in the way of many slow stretches to be even entertaining. And don't read the back of the box, as it made it look like meat was eating zombies that attacked the city. There is not ... just a small scene where three or four zombies are attacking a house and so easily rejected they are not a factor in the movie at all, and their scene is rather meaningless. So for the most part I say you should avoid this movie unless you come across it for really cheap.
