This movie was boring! <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some fun moments and jokes, but you can't base a whole movie on it! <br /> <br /> The characters are too stereotyped, there are no real stories - but short episodes of freaky side signs that are not freaky enough to make the plot real. <br /> <br /> Shame because most of the players are recognized in Hungary, a mystery why they took the role. <br /> <br /> This is * not * a new hope for the Hungarian film. It was boring even though it was supposed to be genuine or unique. They could have tried much harder than this ... 2 out of 10
