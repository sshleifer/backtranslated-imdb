I must preface this by saying that I am a great romantic. Therefore, I would really like this movie. So I write my thoughts to save the rest of you from the disappointment I felt seeing it. The bursts tell the fateful story of Li-Ann that falls to the suave Jeremy, and they commit to meeting each leap year. A very romantic premise, based on a great novel and with a throw that doesn't feel like you are seeing yet another Jack Neo-flick. So why, why is it so bad? First, I feel the filmmakers are shooting a music video because they chose to replace storytelling and any true feelings with cheesy montages, predictable actions and clich√©s. I am both upset and embarrassed to have been one of the first couples in Singapore to watch The Leap Years, but those of us at the cinema would agree that our muffled groans on the cringe-worthy performances spoke volumes. My hope was to watch a romantic movie that would surpass Forever Fever, the best Singaporean romantic comedy so far, and The Leap Years doesn't even come close. Some blogs have called it The Crap Years, which is tough but ultimately true. Don't waste your money or your emotions as I did. The movie will make you give up on love forever.
