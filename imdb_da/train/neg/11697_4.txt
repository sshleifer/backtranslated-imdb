I am not one of those who believe that King is a great writer, his books are fine distractions for a few hours and often have interesting premises, but in my opinion, they drop out quickly if you give them a serious thought. br /> <br /> This movie suffers from being a fairly accurate mention of King's history. If you have read the book, there are no surprises, no changes, no changes to scenes or characters. This is a movie made by King fans to King fans. <br /> <br /> For the rest of us there is nothing terrible about the movie, it's a "gypsy curse" horror, with its twist, the curse is something many people want to become thinner. The final third has some serious structural problems, and the little forced end seems to break the rules of this genre a little. There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes on your life, but you might as well read the book because there is nothing new here ... <br /> <br />
