Yes, it's one of those movies, so awful, so carefree, so tired that you can't stop laughing. I've seen comedies, good comedies and laugh less than my wife and I laughed at this movie. The other comments give the idea good enough. The characters are so unpleasant, you chase the rats, the effect is so poorly done, you wonder where the primary school art class was responsible, the actor - oh the play - talking about tired dialogue and embarrassing breaks. <br /> But the rat, yes the big rat. Why we didn't see the rat until the end surprised me. Often, the 'big' is not shown to the end because the budget is limited and good effects make up so much money. However, I convince that the big rat in this case was hidden until the end, because the filmmakers are ashamed that the best thing they had was a guy running around dressed as a lumberjack with a third dentist. <br /> <br /> The most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene. After finding out that the rats could not stand high, noise (migraine from the bad actor?), The main body ranks a fire alarm to send the rats to a frenzy. If you ever want to see a few rats rolled while the blood splashes out of their head like a geyser, this movie is for you. Really, you have to rent it and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> But not for more than 99 Â¢, OK?
