The reason it is such a bad movie is that it is so badly written, and it is quite the mistake of the author Robert James Waller, who is also the author of Bridges of Madison County. Scripture is bad because the plot is quite thin and the dialogue is wood and unlikely. A failing couple, a blocked American writer and a beautiful Mexican woman with a story she is ashamed of, are mistaken for a strong self-directed criminal, and after a few adventures (mostly amazingly violent) alternating with scenes that show it the murderous side of the murder, she leaves the fierce partner for the murderer, who, as he is, sees her more clearly than anyone has before. Nothing can help this movie succeed, not even the seamless face of Scott Glenn as the killer, not the appealing Latinity of Giovanna Zacar√≠as as Luz, and not even the fierce performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist assigned the track of the killer. A serious waste of time.
