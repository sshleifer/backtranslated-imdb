The only reason I didn't score this one is that Sibrel shows he is skilled at the technical aspects of making a movie. It's a technically good movie. It has been said, it is a film based on lies and distortions that can easily be rejected. Most of the documentary is used by propaganda techniques to bash the record program rather than actually. And Sibrel's "undeniable evidence" that the landings were faded can easily be rejected if you know anything about orbital mechanics. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend seeing this, but if you do, you can watch it on google video for free. Don't let Bart Sibrel take advantage of your curiosity.
