Bela Lugosi is a vicious botanist who sends bride-poisoned orchids on their wedding day, steals the body in his fake ambulance / sleeve and takes it home to his midget assistant to extract the glands to keep Bela's wife forever young. Some second-rate actors play detectives trying to solve the horrible, horrible mystery. Bela Lugosi scolds it well, but you can tell he needed the money. <br /> <br /> This movie is terribly horrible and most of the actors would have been better off waiting for tables, but the plot is wonderfully ridiculous. Tell everyone what happens in it and they tend to laugh pretty much and require watching the movie. I got the DVD in a discount store 2 for Â£ 1, which I think is a pretty accurate valuation, who pays more for this, would be out of their mind.
