What a dull movie! To sum it up, it was just Nana Patekar who opened her sister-in-law, Karisma Kapoor, while trying to escape from the village with her son. Can anyone say BORING ??? The concept was not that bad, but it was poorly executed. The Canadian sites and some of the village scenes were nicely shot. However, the cinematography came up short. The story could have been good, but the movie just seemed to pull on. There is only so much stupidity a person can take, let alone three bloody hours. <br /> <br /> The best part of the whole movie was the song "Ishq Kamina" and it was only five minutes long. Apart from that, this movie was a piece of shit.
