This movie is extremely boring, it tells a story of a female petrol station owner and her life. Nothing exciting ever happens. The director has really "kept it right" and it feels like a camera after a woman around when she lives. I had to watch other movies by this instructor for a class, the others were not so boring. This movie was also seen on a task ... it is better worth boring with a good character !! Overall, do not watch the movie unless it is required. But do not discount other movies by this instructor because they are not so bad ... and do not discount other movies about Africa, they are usually good, especially when made by a Western director.
