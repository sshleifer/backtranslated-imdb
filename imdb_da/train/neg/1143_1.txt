Even 20+ years later, Ninja Mission stands out as the worst movie I've ever managed to pass through. Scandinavian ninjas go quietly into a scene, burn their uncomfortably noisy sub-machine weapons with wild overload, and then leave quiet. Wow, how are we to find those silent invisible killers? Just follow the shell frames and smoke! Painfully poor dialogue (or was it brilliant and only poorly translated?), Not an Asian in the cast and a lot of 3 Asians among the stunt staff. The reason is ridiculous, it's basically non-existent - so again ninja can't act! Save - avoid seeing at all costs!
