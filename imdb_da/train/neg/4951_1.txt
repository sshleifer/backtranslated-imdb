I commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a "thumbs in the middle" review, noting that I would give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode. I have seen a total of six episodes now up to this point in June 2006. And as a lifelong Batman fanatic, I can say without hesitation: This show is completely crap. Everything is wrong with that. Everything. Getting past just the miserable animation and design, the stories are ridiculously overdue and without any sign development or apparent interest by the authors of this drunk to give any substance to any stories. <br /> <br /> And for God's sake ... Is it just me or is Joker in EVERY EPISODE ?? Is Gotham so much of a turning door's justice system? Or is it just a complete lack of interest for the authors to put a bet into other villains (see "No Sign Development" above). And to make matters worse, every Joker story is the same 3-part formula. <br /> <br /> 1) Joker gases people. <br /> <br /> 2) Joker sets out to gass the entire city. <br /> <br /> 3) Batman saves the day. <br /> <br /> Pfeh. <br /> <br /> There was an episode I saw, it wasn't a Joker story. The title escapes me, but the villain was the scary Cluemaster ... the episode "Think Thank Thunk" with the quiz show. It was the worst Batman story I've ever seen, heard or read. Yes, worse than "I've got Batman in my basement." <br /> <br /> I can't really say what I think this show is because it's probably against ToS, but it starts with "B" and rhymes with "fastardization". Many thanks for the existence of Timm / Dini / etc. era of Bat entertainment, back from Fox and Kids WB days. Things good, and I should have known this, just couldn't have lasted forever, unfortunately.
