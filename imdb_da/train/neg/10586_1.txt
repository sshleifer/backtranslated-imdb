This is a well-informed film in the vein of PBS Frontline. The problem is, Frontline already made this piece and managed to bring L. Paul Bremer in to tell his side of the story. More worrying is the fact that the film director Charles Ferguson - a former think tank wonk - was a warrior until the occupation went south. What did he think would happen? <br /> <br /> The invasion of Poland went really well too, until it was destroyed by the annoying Nazis. And that is how this film feels like an excuse for obsession rather than a deconstruction of the war itself. <br /> <br /> Ferguson seems to suggest that the war might have been better - as if a war could be better.
