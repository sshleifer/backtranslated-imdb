This is the worst piece of cr4p I've ever seen in my life. It was hardly reasonable. It was not scary at all (unless you class scary as loud noises and screams?) Sarah-Michelle Gellar has to stop these lightweight horror movies. I think everyone else in the cinema agreed with me when I called "SHITE" as the credits rolled up. <br /> <br /> On my list of the worst movies ever made, that's how it would go: <br /> <br /> 1. The Return 2. Cabin Fever 3. Silent Hill <br /> <br /> The reason I made Silent Hill 3rd is because it showed some scary scenes, but the rest was definitely cr4p. Same with cabin fever, made no sense, but the return peaked that list. Its worse than Silent Hill and Cabin Fever put together
