I don't know what the Oscar voters saw in this movie, but they have to see some pretty hard things to see in it in order to award it with the best picture Oscar. Luckily, all I know is that there was Gene Kelly playing in it, or it would have been twice as bad as I think it is. First of all, I don't think Leslie Caron was really fit to play such a role. She is not so talented, she is not a fantastic dancer, and she does not look good at all. It's a shame that an actor or actress can ruin a movie just like playing in it, because if Leslie Caron hadn't been in it, it could have made a great movie. The story was intelligent, the steering wasn't bad, and as said Gene Kelly was pretty good. Now I'm not saying all these things about Leslie Caron just to criticize her, I'm just saying that because I think that's what the worst part of the movie is. She's probably a good actress, but I can't tell because I haven't seen her in anything else, but I think she was pretty bad in "An American in Paris". So if you want to see it, go ahead, but I tell you you are better off seeing "Singin 'in the rain".
