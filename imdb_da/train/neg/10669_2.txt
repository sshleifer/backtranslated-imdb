An ensemble of uninteresting and unlikeable characters twist and turn through a flimsy plot that can be interesting if only you could bring yourself to care. This "twist and twist" I am talking about does not refer to the story (which contains all the excitement of a recipe for tuna boxes), but to the director's inability to keep the characters' faces themselves centrally centered in the frame. On the other hand, Angie Harmon has very nice nostrils and left ear. <br /> <br /> The only real surprise in the movie is the big names they convinced to do. When you consider that this movie was never released in theaters despite having a cast cast, you may be inclined to think that something stinks. <br /> <br /> And it does.
