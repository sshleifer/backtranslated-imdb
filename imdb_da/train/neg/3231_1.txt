This movie seems to have many people saying it is one of the most brutal of all times. Having just seen it, I can say that it does not meet these requirements. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is actually denied. But at all, enforcement was not worthy at all. Even the final scene (eyeball stuff) is not really that unpleasant. I had expected something insane, but instead it was of lower quality than gore highlighted in movies as the ultra low budget Violent Sh! T. Anyone who wants to watch a movie will be disappointed as there is no story at all (though most probably know it). Gore fans will be disappointed, as unlike faith, the blood and intestines are few and far between. Not to mention the actor who plays the victim, it may be one of the worst in history. <br /> <br /> Whatever people say, this movie is not so shocking, it is clear that everyone is sucking. Avoid it.
