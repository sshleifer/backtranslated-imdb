Flame in, flame out. It seems to be Gammera in a nutshell, a prehistoric creature that can take it and cut it with just the right task. I'm not a fan of Japanese monster movies, but launched to watch all the flicks on the fifty movie DVD sci-fi collection published by Mill Creek / Treeline Films. It is a great value of about twenty five dollars, so at fifty cents per movie, it really boils down to an investment in time to see some of the goofy deals. Gammera is riled from centuries long slumber by a nuclear weapon and he is not happy. Like Godzilla, he takes it out in Tokyo and sets the United Nations in motion to try to make a plan to save the planet. They arrive at 'Plan Z', the world's hope, and you will not know what is a scene showing a large shed called the 'Z Plan' building; it was a good touch. <br /> <br /> By the mid-1960s, this country was still not quite politically correct. One of the US military scenes in Alaska's air defense sector is General Arnold asking a woman sergeant to make coffee. I suppose there were no private ones around. <br /> <br /> However, good old Gammera was quite sighted but walked around on two legs and went to flame throwing routine when challenged. It was therefore surprised me how Plan Z managed to catch the turtle man in the nostril of a hidden spaceship, whisking him out to Mars to save the world. High fives around for the American and Russian team that made the rescue, let us now come back to the Cold War. Like Godzilla, Gammera at least asked a good dozen movies, but after seeing this a beautiful lot satisfies my interest in flying, flaming turtles. Especially since the DVD package I mentioned earlier has "Attack of the Monsters" with a big look of Big G. It took everything I had to do through to the end of both movies; It was such a relief to get to the last frame of this one that said 'Gammera, Sayonara!'
