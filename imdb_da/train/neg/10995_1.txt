Anyone who has seen Comedy Central around midnight for the past few years has probably seen ads for this movie. I first saw ads for this movie back in 2001. It looked like it could be fun, but I wasn't about to dial the number on the TV screen and order it without watching the movie first. I figured I'd wait until the movie was available for rent at Blockbuster. <br /> <br /> About a year and a half later, I was on Tower Records and in "DVDS for under $ 20" a copy of this movie. As the DVD was only $ 6.99, I decided to buy it. I came home, put the disc in the DVD player and waited for a laugh to start ... and I waited a little more. The race never came. <br /> <br /> I have to agree with almost every other comment on this page when I say this movie was horrible. Sick, desperately tasteless and poorly written and guided, UNDERGROUND KOMEDY MOVIE is a terrible piece of waste and in my opinion is the worst movie all the time. No stars.
