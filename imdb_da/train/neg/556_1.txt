In my book, "Basic Instinct" was a perfect movie. It had excellent action on the parts of Stone, Douglas and all the supporting actors to the smallest role. It had fantastic photography, music and noirest noir script ever. Everything it gives to a movie that is as good as it will ever get! <br /> <br /> This sequel is the exact opposite, it may not get worse, bad acting and a lame script, combined with utterly unreal direction, this is really bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that keeps you focused is the relatively short wait for the next scene, which is an exactly resumed copy of the original. These copies are so bad that they make you laugh and I laughed a lot, even though I saw it, because it was like looking down into a shining monument. The only good thing about this horrible mess is the excerpts of the Jerry Goldsmith score of BI1. Michael Caton-Jones and the half-man responsible for the script even included "There is no smoking in this room" dialogue on the interrogation scene and yes she sends her lawyer (who is now a lawyer) away! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I've seen this horrible movie that should never have been made! It damages the original, so bad. The only redeeming value is the realization that cosmetic surgery (and I'm sure Ms Stone gave the best surgeon money can buy) can do a good job, but of course cannot restore the perfection of the original. And as far as the human body is concerned, filmmaking also applies. There should be a law: Never make a sequel to a perfect movie!
