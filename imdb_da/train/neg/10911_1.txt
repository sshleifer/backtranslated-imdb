I hated this movie so much, I remember living it. It's not even fun. Any movie that relies on unfunny sex jokes and racism humor does not deserve the money it costs to do it. In the first half hour, Rob Schneider drinks a carton of rancid milk. All I could think was "he deserves it to make such a bad movie". Don't waste your time or money on this one.
