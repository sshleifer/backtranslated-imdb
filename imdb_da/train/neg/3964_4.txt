For all the hype about this movie, I kept an open mind about what I would eventually think of. And while it is a bit slow at times, the first 90% of the movie is pretty good, with more than a few "old" scarecrows making a jump and undisturbed. In fact, I thought the cinematography was excellent in many of these scenes. However, where Dark Remains fails, is in its climax. The end of the movie and the denouement is what seems to be MILES APART from its body. The story falls completely in the face with an illogical conclusion, and the answer I sought the most - what really happened to Emma? - was not illuminated! The reason for the negative energy was, at best, ridiculous, and at last I felt very cheated. What could have been a fantastic horror movie was eventually haunted by a terrible ending.
