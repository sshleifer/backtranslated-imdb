The main reason for seeing "Red Eye" is Rachel McAdams, who delivers a star performance and Jayma Mays, who is wonderful as Assistant Hotel Manager. On the other hand, Cillian Murphy transcends so much that he becomes cartoonish. The rest of the movie is riddled with plot holes that I will elaborate on. <br /> <br /> Please do not read anymore if you do not want to know what is happening! <br /> <br /> Here is a summary of the plot. Rachel McAdam's character (Lisa) manages a hotel where the new hardnosed Homeland Security Director plans to stay that night. Rachel returns to Miami from a funeral, but fielding calls from her assistant until the plane leaves. Meanwhile, someone is stationed outside her father, Joe (played by Brian Cox), ready to kill him if Cillian Murphy (Jackson) calls. All Lisa has to do is call the hotel and move the director's suite to one where Jackson's cohorts plan to shoot a guided missile (from a fishing boat) to kill the director and his family. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the plot holes or absurd coincidences: <br /> <br /> 1. Jackson finally convinces Lisa to make the call, and in the middle the phones in the plane lose their connection. Lisa tries to fake that she makes the call, but by chance a guy across the aisle of Jackson is also a call and starts beating his phone to indicate it's dead. Jackson catches and grabs the phone from Lisa. <br /> <br /> 2. At one point, the Jackson headers Lisa and she, of course, are knocked out ... but only for 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> 3. Jackson catches Lisa by writing a note on the mirror in the (extraordinarily large) toilet room, and he slaps her around. Miraculously, the only one who hears anything is an 11-year-old girl whose words are, of course, discounted. <br /> <br /> 4. Lisa sticks Jackson with a pen in his throat as the plane lands, steals his cell phone, and makes a crazy dash for the exit that goes down the hallway between the seats and 18 rows of standing passengers. Despite knowing that there is a passenger with a pen jammed in the throat, the airline companies force Lisa by opening the door to the jet road. <br /> <br /> 5. Okay, all of them are reasonable (if not very unlikely). But here's where it gets really stupid. Lisa enters the terminal at Miami Airport and there is no cell phone signal (every major airport in America has great cell phone reception). <br /> <br /> 6. She runs through the airport with Jackson in pursuit and no security officers even defend them. <br /> <br /> 7. Jackson, who lost Lisa at the airport while the train from the gates pulled away to the terminal, lost his voice from the pen in his throat, but he can still be a little understood. But he doesn't bother calling his husband outside Joe's house. (PS: There is no train at Miami Airport, but it showed them as much as Orlando Airport). <br /> <br /> 8. Lisa steals a car and rides away. Of course this time, when she goes to a call, the mobile phone says "low battery" and soon turns off (when will they stop using this inane plot device?). <br /> <br /> 9. While the phone still said "low battery", Lisa had reached her assistant just in time to save the director and his family from the guided missile launched by the fishing boat to the window in the room on the 40th floor. as the director had been moved. Of course, they do not expect us to notice that the hotel is surrounded on 3 sides by the sea, so the missile could probably have been launched in the first suite, thereby negating the need for the entire Lisa-Jackson plot. What's the story here? Was the director's original 38th floor room one of the only rooms in the hotel with a miserable view? Nevertheless, everyone comes out just before missile hits. <br /> <br /> 10. Lisa drives to Joe's house to save his father alone to see the killer outside. Even though she runs him over (when he shoots at her) by throwing her jeep into the house, nobody in the neighborhood seems to notice or interfere with stopping. <br /> <br /> 11. Jackson arrives at Joe's house and knocks him out (we can't see how ... maybe another headache). He then explains to Lisa that he did not kill Dad yet because he wanted Dad to see Lisa die first (Give me a break. What is this? Saturday morning comics?). <br /> <br /> 12. For the rest of the movie (about 20 minutes), Jackson Lisa is chasing around the house and she is successfully struggling with him. Of course, a real killer (that is, maybe played by Jason Statham) would have gone away with Lisa (or, for that matter, anyone who is not a trained killer) for the first 30 seconds. During this hunt, Jackson meets at least once over Joe without bothering to kill him. <br /> <br /> 13. Finally, Jackson rules and he is killing Lisa when he (you guessed it) is shot by Joe. <br /> <br /> So here's my suggestion ... tell Wes Craven to stick to horror. Or maybe he should meet with Michael Bay (who directed the stupid "The Island") and make "Red Island".
