This was a "sweet" movie first, so it became too juicy and highlighted mediocre songs at best. There is too much King James English spoken to is not only annoying in today's world but not always easy to interpret. Can you imagine young people today trying to listen to this movie? Forget it. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby has some good lines in here and likes like "Hank Martin." Rhonda Fleming ("Alisande La Carteloise") was also beyond her pretty looks and beautiful long red hair. <br /> <br /> It's a nice movie with a good feeling and I can't beat it. Maybe it's worth renting for historical sake or if you're a big Crosby fan, but generally it's not that much.
