No wonder this movie never saw the light of day. The time of the release was terrible. The Gong Show had already "jumped in the shark" when the movie came out, so who would pay money just to see some of the censored clips from the original round of the show? And the show clips are just a tiny bit of this pathetic 90-minute cock by Chuck Barris about how hard his life was to host the show. Did he really expect us to be sorry for him and his broken millionaire life? Does he really think we wanted to know about his life? (Of course, since he later wrote his weird autobiography about his career as a CIA operative.) Did he think that gag having everyone everywhere would audition for him to be fresh for 90 minutes? Or the network director strikes him in every turn? This could have functionality as a plot for a 30-minute sitcom episode, but not as a full-length movie. However, it was fun to see Rip Taylor, Gene Gene and the unknown cartoon again (although they were just his most vulgar routines to make the movie "spicy"). And as someone else has pointed out, it is Phil Hartman's first important film part (although it only lasts one minute). Note that his name is spelled HARTMANN in the credits, which is the name he was born with. You can't miss his voice and facial expressions, though he is much thinner and younger than in SNL days. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a small portion; one of his first after leaving the soap world.
