Once again, Lorne Michaels shows that he has absolutely nothing to produce. <br /> <br /> You'd think he'd begin to understand, after such gloomy "Superstar", "Night at the Roxbury" and "Coneheads," he may not know what he's doing when it comes for movies (and many will argue that he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to television too). Attempting to make feature films outside sketches that welcomed them the third time they were finished at SNL makes no sense. Personally, I like Tim Meadows and think he would be great in the real movie. It's a shame to watch a talented guy wasted in a movie containing unfunny after unfunny situation, and cuddle it all with a terribly bad song and dance scene. Any laughs here will be because the movie is so bad, not because it's fun. Oh yes, we can at least be grateful that there are many other tired SNL characters who will never have movies made about them. It's just too bad that this made it to the big screen.
