The prerequisite for this movie is revealed on the DVD box. A textile worker develops a miracle substance that does not break down. But the film fails to get on with it. Instead, it pads for 45 minutes, noodles around a preamble before making the big discovery. Since the audience does not greatly benefit from watching a whiz kid counting on things, it is a strange choice: the movie has been successfully prevented from engaging in topics. Once the drug is discovered, the film quickly determines that both the industry's bigwigs and collaborators will have the invention frightened and leave the movie with only two flimsy movements; invent the chemical and run from suppressors. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why anyone would describe this as a comedy. The tone is not funny or comical. It is more like a serious social criticism of the day: that capitalism defends both supply chains and production. Which in turn prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world. Yes, it is certainly true, but without anything toying with an attitude to the fact, the movie is simply a serious argument. You need a very broad definition of comedy to find someone here. <br /> <br /> This is more like a British Meet John Doe (Meet Nigel Doe?).
