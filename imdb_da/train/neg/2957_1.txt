What a mess!! Why was this movie made? This and other films of its "caliber" should be teaching materials on how not to make a movie. Children like it, but everyone over 10 must or will reject. To make matters worse was the fact that such a great talent as Whoopi Goldberg and Armin Mueller Stahl were completely wasted in a movie that was not worthy of any communication.
