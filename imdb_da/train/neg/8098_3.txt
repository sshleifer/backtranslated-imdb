This is one of the most horrible rewrites I've ever seen. If they want to make a movie with a miserable story, they should refrain from giving it a title of a fine book. There is hardly a relationship between Wolfe's book and this movie except the title. I don't mind changes if they help a story flow on the screen. At least, the changes should not damage the final product. The last scene in the movie is painfully convincing. The actors are miscast. Of course, the director and / or screenwriter could not decide whether to make a lame comedy or preach a compelling sermon. <br /> <br /> If you've seen this movie and didn't like it, try the book. If you've seen this movie and liked it, read the book.
