I can only assume that the other reviewers of this "movie" are shareholders of the production company, as this was probably the worst movie I've seen in the last five years. From the opening of a rabbi laughing uncontrollably for no apparent reason, it was clear that the actors in this movie would kill to be considered "B level". Both my wife and I were in a good mood before we started this movie and we were really looking forward to a fun popcorn movie. We knew we hadn't rented Citizen Kane and we didn't expect to see the most amazing movie ever. But after 40 minutes of persistently the most painfully scary bit of garbage I've ever seen, we shut it down instead of wasting another minute of our lives. <br /> <br /> If a "comedy" without laughs, terrible action, thin plot and annoying characters is your thing, then this movie is for you. Honestly, Troll 2 is better - at least I laughed at the popcorn sex scene. <br /> <br /> I can't justify writing a longer review of this image because I've already wasted nearly an hour trying to find a joke.
