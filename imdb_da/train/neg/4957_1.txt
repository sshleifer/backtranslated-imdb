I can't believe some people actually like this. But still call themselves Batman fans. Even going as far as saying it is better than BTAS. As it is, it should be plagiarism for them to use Batman's name for this piece of shit. It's not Batman. <br /> <br /> The whole premise of the show is "if you can't defeat anyone getting a bigger weapon to help you," Batman is not just about weapons. He uses his batarang and grappling hook and Batmobile, that's it. He doesn't come up with any new ingenious tech every time he can't beat anyone. I don't know where in hell they got the idea for a Batbot. or whatever. They've destroyed all the bad guys. Mr. Freeze has gone from a sympathetic scientist to a petty criminal who fell into some cryofreezing things. Catwoman is now a 40 or 50 year old woman with a stupid costume. Penguin is now a ninja with a 50 foot high top hat. The Ventriloquist is now called Scarface, which makes Dummy the entire centerpiece for the character. They even got a stupid idea to make him a giant! wtf? And the two worst sign changes are that of Joker and Riddler. they have changed Riddler into a gothic / retro teen freak. and The Joker for an acrobat with dreads. He looks like a bob Marley wannabe. they have complete and completely destroyed batman even moreso than B & R did! I wish I could meet the creators and or the authors and animators of this show so I could hit them with a metal baseball bat.
