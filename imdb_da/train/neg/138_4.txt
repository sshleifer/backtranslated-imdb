The Good: I liked this movie because it was the first horror movie I've seen for a long time that actually scared me. The actor was not that bad, and the "Cupid" killer was trustworthy and disruptive. <br /> <br /> The bad: The story and the plot of this movie is incredibly weak. There just wasn't much to it. The ways the killer killed his victims were very horrific and disgusting. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who can't do it. <br /> <br /> Overall: A good scare but a bad story. <br /> <br /> ** out of *****
