Rob Schneider is a famous comic reason for his movements, faces and notions of "not humans". This time he is the animal. Marvin is a loser who tries to be a hero and one day, no one calls from a man being attacked, so Marvin must take this case and save the attacked man. But on the way to the crime scene, he crashes with his car and gets really damaged. He can't remember what happens, and on the next normal day, his life isn't the same when he finds out he has animal instincts. Of course, we have our female that our main character is trying to reach, but his printers are useless. She is played by Collen Haskell. There are no negative signs. The negative character is fate if I could use this metaphor. Marvin should find out how to become a normal human being again. By the way - his animal instincts help him in some situations. Schneider's performance is so-so. The movie is so unreal that it gets stupid for a few moments, but it is one of the movies that is called thoughtless fun that I have written above. So watch it for the monkey style Rob Schneider, but it's certainly not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best movies that Schneider comes in. He's a great comedian, but it's not his best movie .
