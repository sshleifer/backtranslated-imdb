This movie was a complete waste of time. I watched this movie with a group of cinematic enthusiasts who have varied tastes in movies, but always a huge eye for a genius work (as one of my colleague commented on this site had mad to feel this steaming pile ??); none of them found a single redemption quality. We ended the movie with a bursting chorus of explosives, I don't want to reprint here. <br /> <br /> I can only guess that the positive reviews given here were written by Sir Anthony Hopkins himself. Afterall, as one of these reviewers will tell you, did he fund the film himself? because no one else in Hollywood or anywhere else in the world would risk a single ear or their good name for that movie. Don't let the semi-famous actors appearing in the movie lure you into their links ?? as Christian Slater admits in the special properties of "making of" he signed on to movies without reading the manuscript or knowing any details (a stupidity I am sure he will never repeat). <br /> <br /> I am unhappy with the unhappy individual who stumbles into this twig of complacency written, directed, produced and funded by a man who is too famous to admit to himself that not everything he creates is a masterpiece (and if you don't believe me, please google "Anthony Hopkins" and art).
