It's hard to believe that David Duchovny in 1997 was at the top of his fame, with X-Files, one of the best sci-fi shows ever to be on top of honor. Nine years later, he is almost forgotten, and his tentative to do so on the big screen failed miserably. I can't even explain why he's a fair actor, but probably his fame time cast him into an eternal role that takes a great talent to break away. At the same time, Angelina Jolie was much less well known, and she was really lucky that a movie like 'Playing God' did not lead her to a dead end. Fortunately, the "Bone Collector" and "Girl Interrupted" waited over the corner, and when Lara Croft arrived, she was launched. <br /> <br /> There is not too much to be told about this movie. It's the only big screen movie by Andy Wilson, and there has to be a reason. Everything is banal and most of what is happening on the screen is expected in this story of a former doctor who saves the life of a shooting park in a bar only to find himself working for the mob. The screen's voice is particularly bad, with a moralistic text that kills any shadow of cinematic experience from the movie. You will probably not meet the movie, but in DVD rental shops or on TV. Try to look for something better.
