Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this movie due to the fact that it felt wrong and the characters were not strong enough to carry the movies rather weak attempts at horror. The basic idea of ​​the film was interesting, but unfortunately it was not possible to tense, really scare or shock me - there was a lot in the whole movie that I thought was cruel, but even that didn't solve it. I got to like the character of Kate at the end of the movie, when she seemed to be softer and a little more realistic at the end, the character that Jeremy Sheffield didn't play was actually not necessary for this movie, and I think That the instructor / writer was carried away with the countless characters that were not used if he had left it to the basic characters that made it more uniform on Kate's side, it could have worked - Jeremy's play was at least wood and I felt uncomfortable seeing the bad on screen chemistry - or lack of it. What a shame. Disappointing.
