I have absolutely no knowledge of author Phillipa Pearce or any of her novels, and if TOM'S MIDNIGHT GARDEN is typical of her work, I would probably have had little interest in her books as a child. When I was a kid, I wasn't really interested in litigation, unless it had soldiers fighting with monsters that had a high body count. Judges at this movie version of TOM'S MIDNIGHT GARDEN, I think Pearce writes for lower middle class children since much of the history of orbiting protagonist Tom Long moves to a house without garden and suddenly finds a metaphysical one. Having a garden of its own was undoubtedly something that the working class people did not have in the 1950s, so I suppose there is some politically classed subtitle there somewhere. There is also a romance that involves a young girl named Hattie, but again, cynical children are amused by love stories? Perhaps the worst criticism is that very little at the forefront of excitement or adventure happens within the narrative. <br /> <br /> This is a children's movie that is dated by its source. It's unofficial, but I'm surprised by its high rating of the IMDB voters. I wonder how many of them would have given it so many high marks if they were 10 year olds who had just seen the trilogy LORD OF THE RINGS?
