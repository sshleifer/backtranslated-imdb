I have given 'Kôhî jikô' a low score, not because it was a bad movie, but because it doesn't matter to praise. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen any of the Hsiao-hsien Hous work before, but for the uninitiated (I included) 'Kôhî jikô' is advertised as a tribute to Yasujiro Ozu. (A Japanese director whose last film was on its way in 1962) The film is an extremely sparse work ... with very little dialogue, history, music or emotions. Yo Hitoto plays 'Yoko' a jobless, wandering character who spends her time in her local coffee shop or loosely examines a Taiwanese composer she likes. Tadanobu Asano plays his friend who works in a CD shop and occasionally spoils his otaku interest in trains. And it's all about it. <br /> <br /> We watch as Yoko drinks coffee alone ... walks around ... waiting for trains ... catching a train ... falling asleep on the train. The kind of earthly reality that anyone in Japan can see on a daily basis. Hou captures these common moments of these characters life, but without any significance for these vignettes it is a completely meaningless movie to make or see.
