Well, what can I say. <br /> <br /> "What the ink we know" has achieved almost impossible - leaving such masterpieces by the genre as "The Postman", "The Dungeon Master", "Merlin" and so fourth it will go down in history as the only worst movie I've ever seen in its entirety. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is impressive, because I've seen many a bad movie. <br /> <br /> This masterpiece of modern cinema consists of two interwoven parts that alternate between a stupid and constructed plot of an extremely annoying photographer, abandoned by her husband and forced to take anti-depressant means to survive. and a bunch of talking heads is about how quantum physics probably justifies their new agy pseudo-philosophy. Basically, if you start your day off meditating on like Enya and Kenny G, this movie is for you. If you have a sense of humor, a crowd that knows how to have fun, and a great deal of good weeds, then this movie is for you as well. Otherwise, stay away. Take my word for it. <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me about "What the Bleep Know You" is, it seems to be edited and composed of the same kind of people who shoot cheap weddings on camera, complete with pink heart effects, computer generated sparks across the screen and other various delusions. Who lets these people anywhere near a theater release is a mystery to me. I think that's what too much Kenny G does for you. The movie was imbued with cheesy GCI, the similarities that you or I can produce on our own computer through over-the-counter video editing software, but never wanted to, because it's just too ridiculous. <br /> <br /> script was written by someone without any written experience. Not only were all signs and conversations cumbersome and constructed at all, but "authors" felt that they had to push all relevant information or rather disinformation, which is most of this movie about all the way down your neck. Well, given the target group, it may not have been too bad of an idea. For example, the protagonist uses half of movie pills. Apparently, however, it was not considered convincing enough, so there are at least a few dialogues throughout that refer to her anti-anxiety specifically, only if viewers should not be able to connect her exaggerated pain and suffering to small whites. she takes pills every time she feels down. The play ... Well, I've seen better actors in the Ed Wood movie, and no, it's not an exaggeration. Heck, the little game I was in when I was 12, highlighted much more inspiring action than this. It really did. <br /> <br /> The story is interrupted here and there with a bunch or random talking heads, a strange mix of boiling scientists, boiling doctors, and self-proclaimed mystics, continuing with how quantum physics apparently gives an "explanation" to how man or the woman created their own reality just by participating in the experience of life. The reality you see is a range of probabilities for a lot of different possibilities and is only set in stone once you have chosen the Observer to notice it. What happens when more than one observer observes that they have not said, but then again who cares. Listen to Enya, meditate, observe, and you must be God, and no one gives a curse on such stupid and archaic things as critical thinking, logic, etc. All reason is immediately dismissed as people are stuck in their paths and incapable of to achieve a "paradigm shift" and "go down the rabbit hole". In addition, the Heidelberg Principle of Insecurity seems to be a positive proof of alternative realities, parallel universes and so on. <br /> <br /> Considering the rabbit holes, the analogy permeates the film. All these people continue to talk about going down in rabbit holes. I'm not sure what had to do with anything else they said or showed, but one thing I'm sure is that it somehow involves anal sex. In fact, the film is _extremely_ anti-sex. Throughout the purchase, sex is presented as dirty, ugly and anti-enlightening. At least the talking heads speak, the protagonist achieves harmony and enlightenment by painting hearts all over the body with a magical marker, and continues to walk around with an even more stupid look in her glazed eyes than she began with. <br /> <br /> I want back 2 hours in my life. <br /> <br /> Here are a few random quotes that I happened to remember: <br /> <br /> "What I think is unreal has become much more real to me and what I used to do to consider genuine is often much less real than the unreal. " - Some talk about the spirituality of the sufferer's physique. <br /> <br /> "What does it take for a man to get an erection? It only takes one thought. Nothing changes from outside, all changes are within. One still has an erection" - Some self-presented mystics, head of their own enlightenment school . <br /> <br /> [looking at herself in the mirror] "I hate you! I hate you! fat! You're ugly! I have you!" - Main character, the fat and ugly photographer.
