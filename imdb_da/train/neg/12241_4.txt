This is one of the few episodes (if not the only one) with an undeniable error in its storytelling. While handling the Ralphie situation, Christopher says he heard about Pie-O-My's death in the fire accident. This is an important detail, because in this context, it is quite obvious that Christopher knows at the beginning that Tony is the one who must have killed Ralphie. However, there is no way Chris could have heard of the accident. Who should have told him and when? When he was pulled out of his delirium by Tony's call, no one else was informed. Tony knows it - which makes it even worse! Hearing Christopher talking about Pie-O-My's death could therefore only lead Tony to the conclusion that Chris himself has set the fire. Considering the impressive writing process that the advocates themselves told on the DVD, I really wonder that none of them realized the problem there. The story just doesn't work that way. It is unnecessary to add that I am a big fan of the soprano. Otherwise, I would certainly not care.
