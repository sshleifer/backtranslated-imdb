These 2 points are dedicated to the reasonable performance of Akshay Kumar. I know that Bollywood movies don't really strive to be realistic, but PLEASE a Walt Disney production is more realistic than this plot. The father is dying and doing what any good parent does ... kicking his son out with his son with his PREGNANT wife. A few things that were too hard to swallow - 1. Priyanka 'cool indoor pool in the bedroom' and to walk from it to live hungry in her in-laws garden shed ???????? 2. Akshay suddenly got the job as a stunt man, being bitten by refined dogs, so just walk away. This movie is an INSULT for our intelligence, I really can't believe I've contributed financially to the "people" who made this movie by taking my family to see what we left the cinema with a wrinkle This takes my advice and Don't waste your 'waqt'.
