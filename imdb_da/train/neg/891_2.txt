Having loved 'Paris, Je T'aime', I was very much expecting this movie and I admit that I went in with high expectations but was very disappointed for a number of reasons. Although I didn't expect a recycling of 'Paris' in New York, I expected the same structure. What I liked about 'Paris' was the break-up of the neighborhoods. You got a sense of every director style and story they wanted to tell. In 'NY' there is no clear separation of stories, at various points in the film, signs from different stories come to each other, which made me confused about who I was watching and what had just happened. The control switch was also clear but confusing as there was no flow. <br /> <br /> Another thing I loved about the 'Paris' movie was the one that takes love. It wasn't all romantic. There was love between parents and their children, untouched love, a lonely medieval woman longing for love, etc. It explored so many layers of the complexity of love between people. 'NY' only seemed to go to an edgy, over-the-top sexuality. There were some redeemable shorts (the older couple have spent a lifetime together, Julie Christie's short), but generally the 'NY' movie did not make any sense to me. I didn't associate any of the characters I did with 'Paris'. I remember seeing 'Paris' and feeling a deep sadness, loneliness, longing, hope, wonder ... it just had so much soul. For me, there was no soul in the "NY" movie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if I had gone into it without having 'Paris' threatening in the back of my brain as a comparison, this movie could have provoked a more favorable answer but as a self-evident resumption of 'Paris, Je T'aime' I was very disappointed.
