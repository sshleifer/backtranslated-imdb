It's 1982, Two Years After the Iranian Embassy Siege, which involved the dramatic SAS Rescue from Balconys, and with a war with Argentina over the Falkland Islands currently taking place, which better movie to make than a Gung-Ho "SAS" movie, there again - creating the Iranian gigag siege while using Britains Numbers one action hero of the day, Lewis Collins. Throw in Edward Woodward and a few other well-known actors and you have a winner on your hands? ... Maybe not! The film itself does not make the situation serious enough, while the play is quite different. It's like a movie long episode of "The Professionals" but without the formula. This movie does not go fast and is quite predictable. Perhaps Cubby Brocoli looked at this movie and decided to ditch Lewis Collins as a James Bond replacement for Roger Moore. See if you are a fan of Lewis Collins or SAS stuff in General, if not, save time.
