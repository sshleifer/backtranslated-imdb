Whoa nelly! I've heard a ton of mixed reviews for this ... but one of my go to hardcore horror reviewers found it really disappointing. The man he was right on his nose! This movie was traded by pure amateurs. They should have done a roof, maybe two on each scene, the movie seemed so hasty. The script was also poor .... they had lines that were trying to be unique but failed. Pathetic. "Get your basement off me!" Oh man, I hate it when movies try to do it. It happens all the time with comedies ... but with a horror movie and with below average actors .... the results are incredibly pathetic. The lines and scenarios were all very predictable. But what made me feel so negative about this movie was again the horrible act. It was awful. Besides the little Asian guy who worked on the booth. I thought he was great. <br /> <br /> The movie is about 5 stupid tourists on holiday in Asia. They end up in the wrong place and fall into the hands of a mafia driving sex / slaughterhouse. Sounds like a cool story. But seeing someone with a bad case of diarrhea is probably more fun and intensive to watch. The only reason this is considered horror is because of the murder. There was no excitement. <br /> <br /> I like many other horror fans died to get their bloody little gloves on this. But unfortunately with a big capital U, the movie was incredibly disappointing. I enjoy the ankle fracture and the blood effects. The stupid chickens were also so. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie screams amateur. This is Ryan Nicholson's first feature length, and for the most part he succeeded. There is no denial he has a sick sense of humor and taste for horror. I ask that his next movie not play like another B-horror flick ... unless he tells us it's what it is going to be. Even after this disappointment, I'm willing to give Ryan another shot. From what I've seen of him, he's a true, dedicated man to the genre. Good luck next time because it was bad news.
