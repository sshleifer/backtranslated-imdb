Really one of the most grim movies I've ever put through. I have never taken the time to write one of these, but I felt compelled to see this fringe for filmmaking and feel a little worried about being wasted with my time on such a piece of turd to be honest. There were so many parts that confused me with their complete coincidence and lack of meaning (eg when would the police never shoot people with infectious diseases? When would hospitals never go through such people for lack of cure? Why was the guy who saw Outside he spied on his wife walking around outside in his dress while carrying a gun as she rolled around on the bed?). Also, the characterization - which we almost expect in such films - was horrible (eg, the way the blonde guy - I can't remember his frickin name and not throwing at least - totally turned towards his girlfriend and ran out to leave her) and I ended up having them all meet grisly ends! The production was terribly dissimilar and the filmmaker nothing to write home about.
