I actually intended to watch this movie in the theater. It was actually sold out. I actually went to see Solaris instead, which was actually the worst movie to be released in 2002. <br /> <br /> Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), a hard street street pharmacist, freaks out when he sees one children are shot, so he decides to stay clean and invest all his money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). Things seem to go pretty well until Jack jumps with his girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards). This happened very late in the movie, so if they hadn't revealed this in the previve, it could have been an interesting twist. But they did, so it's not. <br /> <br /> In fact, there isn't a single interesting thing about this movie; everything is given away in the preview. If you saw another preview, you saw the whole movie so you might just think really hard to fill the gaps. Go to the website, download preveve, save yourself $ 3.99. There is not a single surprise or twist in the entire movie, except how terrible the soundtrack is. <br /> <br /> I hope that the person responsible for writing the audio track was fired. Twice. Most of that is what music would be if the only songs that were allowed were released by Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan duets, and (I have to crush the fabric in the space continuum with a concept like mind-numbing like this) they both had less talent and musical abilities. The action is at best poor, the manuscript is at best a crime against humanity, and Denise Richards is at best 67% styrofoam and 33% ziploc bag. You know things are bad when John Leguizamo (he was in the pest!) Supports the rest of the cast with his plays.
