The 80s were not very friendly to the one-time star Charles Bronson. Beginning with 1982's "Death Wish II" and ending with this truly gruesome '89 movie, Bronson's writers seemed to try to top each other in progressive gravity. "D.W. II" left a little to the imagination in his depiction of Bronze's karate's daughter's rape and suicide (a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in obnoxious details). "10 to midnight" was the kind of shabby movie that made you take a bath afterwards. Nothing runs out of it. Other films such as "The Evil That Men Do" and the remaining "Death Wish" movies from this period spread the line between high camp and high barf with their serious depictions of brutality and revenge. I'm not sure if the producers (usually Pancho Kohner) got a kick out to show a tired look, senior-aged Bronson destroys punk young that is young enough to be his grandchildren or whatever, but they creepy craftsmanship (and horrible writings) of these films usually destroyed the little energy they might have generated. <br /> <br /> "Kinjite" - the last of these films - is pretty good-natured, but really takes the cake into cinematic misery. In this movie Bronson: sodomizes a pervert John; forcing a pimp to eat his Rolex watch; Allowing a male prisoner to be raped by another prisoner makes incredibly xenophobic remarks among other things, I have fortunately forgotten. Also depicted is a young Japanese girl's rape (fortunately this was off-screen but well-grounded). <br /> <br /> What did people think when making this movie? What did Bronson think when he decided to destroy his career with these horrible movies? For anyone interested in his best movie, check out most of the films he made in the 60s and 70s as "The Mechanic", "Death Wish", "From Noon to 3", "Once Upon a Time in the West "," Red Sun "," The Great Escape "," The Magnificent Seven "," Rider on the Rain "etc. Etc. ....
