I knew it was not gunna that worked between me and the D-war from the moment we met. First, the title was lazy. D war. Like writing out, Dragon was too much for them. Also ... you really can't be so obvious with your title unless your Blue Monkey. Blue Monkey can do whatever the hell it wants. <br /> <br /> The other sign of a rocky relationship between us was the story of mad progress. Here is the movie, dreamy reporter guy reports on big snake tracks, flashing back to a time he and dad walked into what must have been the competition for the shop in the gremlins and dreamy kid reporter finds a box that lights up. Old store reveals several terrible truths. That Bauraki a presumably evil snake was cheated out of his chance to be a god. tells the child that he is a reincarnated warrior and that somewhere in LA is his reincarnated lover and gives him an unwanted piece of jewelry. Shop keeping also reveals that despite his obvious whiteness, he is a 500 year old Asian. <br /> <br /> Fifteen years later, dreamy reporter remembers this perfectly and starts acting half crazy and trying to find this random girl. cgi haninks follows and in the last ten minutes my brain melts out of my nose. Why? Continue on dear reader if you have the balls. <br /> <br /> So Sarah, the reincarnated lover, has her own flashbacks. I have the advantage of having an Asian best friend and in the scene where she starts freaking out and making a bunch of posters with Asian signs on them, he tells me that who made this movie has no idea what they do. It's a Korean legend, and she is reincarnated from a Korean princess, but everything is in Chinese. Later that evening, her dragon tat begins to hurt, she calls the police because she seems to have a heart attack. Look, in this mixed crazy world, the apparent heart attacks handle differently, for the next time we see her she is locked in her room with a guard outside, and a nurse claims she is crazy. I have a new phobia now, and that is, if I'm ever in trouble, the first respondents will just assume I'm crazy. <br /> <br /> I have another point with my hard mistress, Dwar. There is a scene where Patrick Dempsey Jr (Dreamy Reporter) is in a caf√© 'with sassy black friend. In the scenarios before Miffed Near divinity, Bauraki has killed an elephant, worn through a suburb and killed one of Sarah's friends. Look, people were afraid to come out after 9-11 happened, but we have to get everything hard after deciding on coffee and cakes were worth risking our lives for. Business as usual, no way a giant snake will stop me from getting my caffeine on. If I stay in fear of my life, the terrorists and snakes will win. <br/> <br /> Having received a satisfying helicopter ride, my gruesome lover Dwar treats me to a pi $$ and vineyard scene to end it all. Bauraki has a fortress of its own and its right under LA I guess. They don't really say, but Dreamy Reporter and Sarah hit a car crash that will kill smaller men and when they wake up, yep dragon palace. some retarded dialogue later a good dragon snake god pops out of nothing and the snakes choke / love whatever. And I'm not talking good snake out of nowhere. Maybe you think I'm blowing it out of proportion, I'm not there any mention of this thing in the movie so suddenly ... there! A few seconds later, and good dragon becomes dragon god, Baurki sets fire, Sara becomes a ghost and joins Dragon-God, dreamy journalist back in the middle of nowhere's role credits ... thank God <br /> <br /> Now our relationship was rocked as it had its good times. There was a guy who looked like shredder from turtles and spoke exactly like a madman raider from starry war. I'll call him Tuskan Shredder. He could do whatever he wanted when he wanted it just could never be useful. He could walk through a wall in a scene where it was not useful. He could walk in your dreams as it would do nothing good and he could fire ten random soldier fires on fire, but not when it came to. He was also allergic to touching the junk jewelry. I like him because he was hit by a car twice in the same scene and made amazing thousands of raider sounds. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the actors were great ... if one way or another meant terrible. Jason Behr, who I thought was great in Roswell, I can slowly find out that it can only work in a way, and it is pretentious, spacey and Patrick Dempsey "ish". The one thing I love about this dirty prostitute Dwars is his leading actor, Bauraki. The big snake acted out his heart. I would dare say he was better at playing a cgi serpentine demi-god for evil when John Barrymore played Richard III or Hamlet. There were emotions in each scene, stealing the thunder from his less deadly supporters. When he ate an elephant, I felt like no one passed by, the present or the future would ever eat an elephant with so much feeling. He was more than an actor, he was a natural force and he put his heart and soul into every second of this damn project. Yes, it's my favorite actor in this movie, a cgi snake. I have the balls to admit it, do you? <br /> <br /> Here is hope Bauraki gets more work and is not the type of cast that Jason Behr finds a number of emotions other so dreamy stare and that I must never see Blue Monkey again. <br /> <br /> So D-War is over. I want my CDs back and let's just be friends
