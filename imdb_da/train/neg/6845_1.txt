"I went to the cinema, to see" Beat Street "/ it wasn't bad, it was quite cozy / 'Krush Groove' was a flick I didn't mind / but when it came to 'Rappin' I drew the line . "Words to your mother. <br /> <br /> Will I stop? <br /> <br /> It's just a small sample of the rhymin's stupa-fly style on the display of this waste of movie and local permissions. This movie is seriously wack (it's 80s talk for just f * cking terrible). As a decoration, Mario Van Peebles is a hell of an actor. And as an actor, Mario Van Peebles is a hell of a bodybuilder. Any movie that calls itself "Rappin" had better delivered to the highest standard of the genre. So why were 6-year-olds rolling in the hallways, even back on the day when the standards were so knee-high-to-"Webster" races? Because this rap is weak. So weak that not even B.E.T. or Comedy Central will touch it with a 10-foot gold chain. <br /> <br /> Blondie's "Rapture" is def poetry next to this piece of Dr. Suess in the hood. So don't be a boobie, avoid this movie! <br /> <br />
