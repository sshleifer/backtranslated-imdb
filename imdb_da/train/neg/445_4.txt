One thing that surprised me about this movie (and not in a good way) was that Nathan Stoltzfus, who seems to be proud of being the great historian at Rosenstrasse, was one of the historians working on this movie, considering how much of the actual events were changed or ignored. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer said that von Trotta said she had never meant to Lena to bed Goebbels, but why did she give every impression that that was what had happened? Why not show other possible causes of human release, such as The disaster, which was Stalingrad, or the Nazis' fear that the international press, based in Berlin, would find out about the protest. <br /> <br /> Why did the whole story play the second enemy to a weak family bond story that has been done over and over again? Certainly something as amazing as this could carry its own story! In places it was as if the film had two story lines that really seemed to have suffered in common. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film failed in its goal to draw attention to a little-known act of resistance, which is a shame because it improved, it could have had a great deal of influence.
