After watching this movie, I came to IMDb and read some of the reviews that compared it to Lost In Translation LITE. When I read, I could immediately see the point of the reviews. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bad attempt at a similar theme. Interestingly, the film's format is almost identical, but PACING is incredibly different. "10 elements" speed the viewer through the movie's 1 day timeline, while the better-planned "Lost In ..." seems to stretch out over a few days. <br /> <br /> I 'm sure some people will see this because it has Morgan Freeman and will be disappointed. It seems that his better roles now-a-days support roles in big blockbusters, rather than leading roles in under $ 10m movies with limited release and indie movies.
