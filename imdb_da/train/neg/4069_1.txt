Good God! (and it comes from an atheist), this "movie" is bad! <br /> <br /> much has already been said by the reviewers before (those who have reviewed this paragraph 3 and below), which I totally agree, I can just add a few things: <br /> <br / > Among the three guys who had to eat their own digestive products were cut off by an ax raped by a diet, their balls had blown away ex-boyfriend suffering from the worst torture while listening to the girl's endless and meaningless babble at the kitchen table (which we have, but at least we have the mysterious button). <br /> <br /> having director scarred point and endless cemeteries and reverse scenes, our suffering would have gone by after 30 minutes. The only thing that made this flick at least somewhat tolerable is Emily Haack's breasts (a point). <br /> <br /> forget it. Don't buy it. Don't waste your time and your beauty. my brain is so fried after seeing this, i feel the urgent need to see (and like?) "scrapbook" right now.
