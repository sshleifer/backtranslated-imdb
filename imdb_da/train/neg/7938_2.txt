A family looking for some old roadside attractions that are part of the father's coffee table comes across an old, obsolete old freak show run by an eccentric monstrous man. When their family van decomposes when they leave the side show, they have to stay with an almost abandoned fishing school that was the site of a prison break decades earlier. <br /> <br /> There have been many movies in the freak sub-genre of horror ranging from Tod Browning's beloved 'Freaks' (1932) to Alex Winters hilarious 'Freaked' (1993). It's both classics (or soon to be with 'Freaked'). However, 'Side Sho' will never be. And if it ever reaches classic status. . . Well, it will be a clear clue to the sad state of our genre. From the ridiculously bad opening song to the 17-year-old daughter, who of course is older than her natural mother, this movie didn't have much for it. The script was subpar, but not quite horrible. . . just boring. The direction was poor and the rare freak effects were pretty awful and incredible. The play was immense and the casting was even worse. Anyone who believes in the age of these two camp-age teenagers should not have met a teenager for a long time. There was far from enough doing and violence to make up for the lack of other quality. . . And since there was little violence, it was not well done at all. And I can't forget to mention the final battle scenes that with all honesty were some of the worst I have ever seen in a movie. All in all, this is an easily forgettable and poorly made horror movie that deserves to be left alone at the bottom of the dollar bin. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 2.5 / 10.
