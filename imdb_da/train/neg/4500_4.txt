This movie is not horrible, really. Someone commented that Mo is the type of American Europeans sneaking on. But there are those, and not necessarily Anglo-Saxon yahoos, who don't care about French; and the Xavier sign will not swing them. Let us consider his stereotypical French characteristics: <br /> <br /> 1). Cynical - very cynical. Check. <br /> <br /> 2). Reedy, underfed look, check, despite: <br /> <br /> 3). A great understanding of the kitchen. Check. <br /> <br /> 4). Lukewarm work ethic. Check. (Forget it, he's apparently a rich broker, from seeing him in the movie, he seems to be sitting in ten hours of jobs.) <br /> <br /> 5). Beautiful wife, check out. Despite that: <br /> <br /> 6). Loose interpretation of marriage promises. Check. <br /> <br /> 7). Big sexual ego that says an American girl owes you sex if you buy her dinner. Check. <br /> <br /> If Mo is a hick or not, there is no reason for her to fall to this slick European Twit other than the script dictates it. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Like other male reviewers, I enjoy seeing Karen Allen's cute little body. I want to give the movie four stars; two of them are for it.
