"White Noise" had the potential to be one of the most talked about movies since "The Exorcist" I believe. Seeing as EVP is probably true, it really had an easy passage to be a feared true fact. Not many movies come together that really fears people's minds. As I said, this movie could have, but it didn't. The film deteriorated into a low grade PG-13 scary movie. Nothing compared to "The Ring" or "The Sixth Sense" in any way. Someone just needs to take responsibility for the horror movie industry and just make a movie that not only makes us think, but it makes us jump and scream all that a horror movie has to do. I'm honestly sick of PG-13 Horror Genre because it becomes a genre by itself. We need the old days back, blood and days, Freddy Kruger, Jason, The Mike Myers days. Few movies can draw a thought that this mentality is so scary. So why try to remove it? A few good jumps in this movie are nothing more than one of the stupidest conclusions in movie history without any decision at all ... don't waste your money on this movie.
