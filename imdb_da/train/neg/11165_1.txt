I mean really ... whether I suddenly lost my sense of humor, or it's just a really bad movie. It's stupid, ridiculous and just not fun. When I saw the previve, I knew it wasn't a good movie, I just didn't think it was that bad. .. What happened to the good old times when you could find clever, fun lines on any movie? Since the actors did not have to play ridiculous roles in trying to be fun? Now we find ourselves in movies like this, Borat, Little Men, Scary Movie 4, where I couldn't find the fun parts !! <br /> <br /> Just skip this piece of waste <br /> <br /> PS (excuse my English)
