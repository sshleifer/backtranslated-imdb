Yesterday was Earth Day (April 22, 2009) in the US and other countries, and I went to see the full feature movie version of "Earth" by DisneyNature. I think, like car manufacturers, Disney is trying to convince us that they are interested in the planet. Maybe they really don't care about the planet, I don't know, but I don't think it guarantees a particular entity with the word "nature" in it. I know my youngest daughter loves Mickey Mouse and who should I tell my personal feelings about Disney a year old? <br /> <br /> Apart from incredible cinematography, it was a typical Disney disappointment for me. Pre-run by half-twelve Disney movie trailers, with Disney clich√© ("life-style", "descending with style"), over-dramatic music, recycled material (Disney claims "40% new footage"). I even began to think that James Earl Jones's story becomes a bit boring. I like James Earl Jones, but his work for Disney and Morgan Freeman makes every Warner Brothers tale begin to wear thin. I really think Disney bought some BBC nature photography that was so spectacularly done, they felt they would sell themselves if they hit some orchestral music and recognizable sound bits on it. <br /> <br /> And what is Disney's occupation with showing predators hunting and killing baby animals? There were half a dozen such scenes, complete with bleeding adolescents on the brink to have their throats torn out. I think Disney must admit that animals have a rich and interesting life outside of life and death struggles that appeal to the action-oriented teenagers who were drawn to this movie by their parents. I was also aware of how Disney stopped very briefly to say that man had something to do with climate change. Are they so afraid of the small minority of deniers that they think it is still a controversial issue? <br /> <br /> I recommend skipping this and renting the Blue Planet DVDs on Netflix. Natural films seem to be best done by the British at the moment.
