Err ... this movie sucked. A lot. <br /> <br /> I've read some of the other reviews. Apparently, there are many people who believe that everything Woody Allen writes or stars in is automatically good ... I've seen several of his films, in the hope of missing something. But no, they just suck. Badly written garbage can. The characters are all very stereotypical (not to mention something stupid). The reason is ... I think it should be mysterious. Not sure about that. Mr. Allen's character is ... Woody Allen, on any other movie you've seen of his. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Woody Allen, watch this movie. If you are under 50, don't bother. (If you're a fan of Woody Allen and you're under 50 ... yes, you're atypical. I don't know what to say.)
