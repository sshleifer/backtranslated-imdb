The "math" aspect of this is just a gimmick for trying to set this television show apart from millions of other police officers. The only redeeming aspect to this show is Rob Morrow, though his career must have been (undeservedly) diminishing after Northern Exposure if he signed up for this schlock. <br /> <br /> The hilarious "mathematics" aspect of the show is encapsulated in an episode of starring Lou Diamond Phillips (who just confirms that this show is the last refuge of curse.) To capture a refugee user "mathematician "some theories of" bubbles ". Then he gives this long explanation that if we have seen the suspect in the places A, B and C, then we can use "bubble theory" to calculate where he may be. He does it all on a blackboard, or maybe with a stick in the dirt (I can't remember). At least when looking at the finished product, he took almost three spots and picked a point right in the middle and said "Ok, mathematically, here is where we are most likely to find the refugee." At which point another sign points to "Oh, that point also happens to be the cabin where the guy used to live." Is it mathematics? It's not even connect-the-f ** k ** g dots !!! This show reminds me of the mathematical major I used to work with in banking, which had a mathematical analysis that he could do to "support" points that everyone else had already agreed through either less complex analysis or basic common sense. <Br /> <br /> Only show - When you are a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I can't wait until they hold the NUMB3RS team at OSAMA ... They must use calculus, call an airway in the middle of the mountains and hit Osama and not even scratch the five kids he uses as a human shield ... cuz hey. .. it's all about the numbers. <br /> <br /> Totally ridiculous TV show.
