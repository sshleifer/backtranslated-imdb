The truth is, a movie based on a Harold Robbin novel will not win any awards. This is no exception. "The Lonely Lady" is a pure B image in budget, cast and execution. Technically, it looks like a movie for movies. The action is very uneven. Joseph Cali is especially horrible. Anthony Holland is an embarrassment. As a reviewer said about a particular Katherine Hepburn performance, her reach from A to B. Ms Zedora manages to get to G. The rest of the throw is solid (and wasted in their respective roles). Lloyd Bochner and Bibi Besch deserved better. Still, it can all be very fun in a scary way. As for Robbins, everything revolves around sex and nudity. If you're looking for some fun ... and you're not so enjoying ... it might be for you.
