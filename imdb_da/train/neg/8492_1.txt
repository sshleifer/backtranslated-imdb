Doing so through the opening credits can be your type of movie. From the first screen of a woman holding her hands up to her face with white sheets blowing in the background, one reminds you of a pretentious perfume shop. It's all downhill. <br /> <br /> The leading actress is basically a block of wood that uses his computer to reach the past and reconstruct the memories of photographs to speak history's overlooked genius, Ada, who was perceived as the first computer language in 1800s. <br /> <br /> The low budget graphics would be forgiven if they were interesting or even something integrated with the script. Bad Tilda Swinton is wasted.
