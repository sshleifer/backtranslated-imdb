This movie is classified as a classic of feelings that have no film quality. It moves from the unlikely to the incredible, from the unrealistic to the ridiculous. The incredible plot is about an attempt by two British soldiers and a Hindu gofer to rescue a third soldier who has been captured by rebellious Indians. In the later scene we see a complete regiment with drums and bagpipes marching into an ambush. In the British army, a sergeant does not order a rescue attempt, and if you pass it by, he not only tries with another soldier and an Indian servant when there is a whole regiment at hand. The Indian rebels are so incredibly scary, it's ridiculous ... there are hundreds of them, but they can't keep their prisoner or kill the two rescuers, of course not. At one point, we see the British soldiers throwing stone blocks down from the veil of the rebels scattered around the mountainside in ambush ... one should have an eggplant for a brain to believe it would do any harm. After Cary Grant, when the red prisoner is shot, he lies on the floor and looks around at the water cat ... hardly any action by anyone who has been shot in the back. The water lake quickly blows a bugle (coming from nowhere) to sound the alarm ... he does so by standing high on a wall so that he can be seen and shot by the wicked, and we throw a tear that he tries to try sounding more tones when he is repeatedly shot and the bugle breaks into weak squawks ... instead of blowing the bugle while hiding behind decks like anyone with half a brain would do. This scene has been deservedly parodyed in comedy sketches. If they wanted to make a Buster Keaton comedy, they should have hired Keaton and made it better.
