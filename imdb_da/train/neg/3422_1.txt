Oh dear, oh dear. I started to see this without knowing what to expect. I couldn't believe what I saw. There were times when I thought it was a comedy. I loved how the government's plan to catch the terrorist leader is to fly in a man who is unarmed and expects him to catch him and escape with a rocket pack. If only it was that easy. I finally found a movie worse than "Plan 9 from outer space".
