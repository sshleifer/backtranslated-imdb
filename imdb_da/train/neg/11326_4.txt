This is one of the two post-philosophical fantasy films that Albert Pyun made in 1993 - and that's the bad. Apparently all his energy went into "Nemesis", which was an entertaining non-stop action movie and had a much more expensive look. "Knights" are lumpy and cheesy, a sci-fi at the bottom that often resembles a video game (new opponents appear all the time and must be eliminated as soon as possible). The only thing that saves this movie from the bin is Kathy Long; not a particularly attractive woman, but undeniably a brutally effective combat machine. As for Kris Kristofferson, considering his age at that time (58), I hope his stunt double was well paid. (* 1/2)
