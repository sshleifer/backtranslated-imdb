I have never seen 1973, older highly rated version. I am a Nicholas Cage fan (by the way, fine as usual). This movie probably took all five minutes to hammer out of the entire plot (I can see it being done at a cocktail service at an evening party), if you can't figure out the end of this club in the first thirty minutes, you'll probably find this movie entertaining. It's too late, the horrible route Hollywood seems to have dug to itself with the horror / mystery / thriller genre, incapable of giving the audience enough credit and writing a new, smart and exciting manuscript that spares some crazy music and throw a few things to make you jump a little and then send the final print to your local theater. At least it didn't have the jigging handheld camera syndrome.
