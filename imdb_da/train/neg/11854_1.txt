For my life I can't understand the good reviews on this piece of crap. It was pointless. Matthew Modine was horribly miscast as a leading ladies man. Gina Gershon, yes, others have said it, but I repeat why the stupid accent? Completely unnecessary. And her acting was just bad. I don't know if she was thrown off the accent or whatever. There was no chemistry between these two. <br /> <br /> And the girl Modine fell in love with, suddenly she pushes a half-head salad in her mouth and acts in a foolish way? Where did it come from? I think we should be sad when we saw her marriage with a workaholic starting to crumble, but honestly, I couldn't care less about any of these people.
