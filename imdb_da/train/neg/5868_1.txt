Definitely one of the worst movies at all times. <br /> <br /> Low production values, horrible story idea, bad script, lack of action ... and I can't even come up with an adjective that is appropriately descriptive of how poor Joan River's direction is. I know there is a special place in hell for the people who funded this movie; runs just below the level reserved for battered genocide. <br /> <br /> This movie is a train crash. <br /> <br /> (Terrible) x (infinite) = Rabbit Test. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br /> It's so bad, it's not even fun how bad it is.
