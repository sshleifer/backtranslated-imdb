"Creepshow 2" is a little more than a pale imitation of the original, designed for a slightly different purpose than depositing on the name of the previous movie. It even reinforces the mistakes of its predecessor, which was often predictable and heavy-handed. Nevertheless, there was the first time there was enough excitement to compensate for the periodic lull, which resulted in an uneven but generally rather entertaining effort. The sequel has few worthy moments, so the transparency of the stories is even more evident. Once in a while it delivers, but most of it just links it. <br /> <br /> As in the original, all the stories revolve around the common revenge and just the desserts. A tree Indian comes alive, retrieving revenge over its owner's death. Teenagers are consumed by an aquatic monster. A hitchhiker returns from the dead to pursue a careless driver. None of these premises is in itself bad in itself, but they lack complete inspiration. There are few surprises and no scares. This is a textbook example of unmotivated, by-the-number movie creation. It doesn't help that this inexpensive-looking movie suffers from a flat directorial style, but to be honest there wasn't much to work with. In the end, the second story comes from best, but not too much. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the performance is fine at best. George Kennedy, who owns the bad dealership, does an appropriate if not particularly inspired job. Dorothy Lamour, on the other hand, is quite good as the guilty driver driving sympathy for her situation despite the predictable, superfluous material. However, most characters are rather thin overall. <br /> <br /> You would think "Creepshow 2" would have been better. George Romero, who directed the original, returned to the pen manuscript, based on several of Stephen King's stories. Makeup effects artist Tom Savini turns in some good, gory work. So why is the movie a letdown? I think Romero didn't really want to make another movie, but was forced to do so for financial reasons. It was a decade of horror, clones, rip-offs and whatnot, so this was definitely inevitable. I can imagine the guy writing the script in a hurry, picking up his pay slip and running away. I suppose he had to do what was necessary to get his own projects funded; we cannot blame him. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 (out of ****) <br /> <br /> Published by New World Pictures
