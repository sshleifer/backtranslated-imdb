I'm a big fan of the cartoon series, but this movie fell far below my expectations. I had expected a Heavy Metal 2000 a little feeling of it ..... slow motion, poor dialogue, lots of blood ..... but it was worse than anything I could have imagined. <br /> <br /> The baseline is almost the same as the comic, but the good points stop pretty much there. The characters do not have the energy or spirit that made my attention in the cartoon. The film covers only a small part of the comic, and the part used is slower and more dull than later parts. The focus of the movie is on the insignificant events rather than the more interesting overall plot of the comic. <br /> <br /> With the right people working on this project, it could have been amazing. Unfortunately, this was not the case, so now there is another horrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love. My copy will probably collect dust for years until I finally throw it out.
