To be fair, they did as well as possible with a budget of five shillings and sixpence, but the dialogue was more cheeses than 9kg emmental and CGI was a little old hat now. Maybe if some of the actors were not so perfectly chiselled out of granite it would have made the movie a little better too. To say this was terrible to make this movie a mis-service if you want to see something that is totally unpleasant, you have to sit and waste a few hours in your life to see 'century', it is so insanely awful it is actually good (several large alcoholic beverages are deriguer themselves. Any way up, i enjoyed this movie and it must appreciate a look if you haven't seen it yet, don't expect anything like 'jurassic park, the lost the world 'or' apocalypto '.
