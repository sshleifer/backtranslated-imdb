Now what's wrong with the actors who participated in that shit? Michael Dorn will stick to the Star Treck merchandise. John Diehl, does anyone remember him in Miami Vice? Well like him there ... Well, anything - what can you expect of a movie with a lifeguard from baywatch in the lead? Nothing, and that's what we get. None of the signs are as sympathetic, the special effects are fun (but not fun). The story is a (very bad) joke. There is no logic whatsoever for what happens. I got the feeling that the filmmakers tried some sort of "Attack of the killer tomatoes" kind of thing. Especially in the scene where all the important people discussed national security in a kind of closet ... <br /> <br /> If you happen to see it on television, change channels - your TV will ever be grateful.
