Seeing Smother was perhaps the longest not quite 90 minutes in my life. There was not a laugh to have had; In fact, I can't remember ever breaking a smile. Diane Keaton was horridly unfunny as a middle-aged chain-smoker dog hoarder, the textbook indulgent mother character, a relentlessly annoying woman who clearly suffers from some form of personality disorder. She is manipulative, conniving, melodramatic, childish, narcissistic and worst of all boring. I suppose, in short, I should mention the other characters, but why bother? It was just a large number of movie clich√©s - the stupid, socially horrific superstition who are just trying to break into the "industry", the gruff and the long-suffering, but somehow still lovable father, the gentle wife who can just take it it longer (but ultimately goes beyond the disagreement and comes home), the crew of unhousebroken dogs who like to chew caste pads while everyone is away, etc. God, what a snoring. I have never been a Diane Keaton fan and Smother only reminded me why. Abuses are overactive, no matter how many pictures you made in your prime. Her attempt at physical comedy was particularly humiliating. What was the director thinking? <br /> <br /> While I like Dax Shepard and even sometimes tolerate Liv Tyler, their beliefs were so lacking and boring that it was clear that neither actor confused this movie. It was okay, not even Keaton's endless, self-absorbed prattling was unacceptable, and at times Shepard's aversion to her seemed real. At the end of the movie I would let her go. <br /> <br /> Awful.
