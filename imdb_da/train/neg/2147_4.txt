The original is a relaxing watch with some truly memorable animated sequences. Unfortunately, the successor lacks even the worst of DTV successors. <br /> <br /> The biggest downfall is the lack of a story. Like Belle's magical world, the characters are told through a number of vignettes. Magic World, while marginally better, still manages to make a mess in history. Between the vignettes we see the mice at work, and I personally think that the antiquity of Jaq and Gus are the redeeming benefits of this movie. The first vignette is the best if Cinderella gets used to being a princess. This is the best because the mice were at their funniest here. The worst of the vignettes when Jaq turns into a human is sweet at times, but lacks imagination. The last vignette when Anastasia falls in love was also sweet. The problem was, I couldn't imagine Anastasia being kind to Cinderella when I considered her the more remarkable of the stepists. This was also confused by a rather ridiculous subplot that Lucifer fell in love with PomPom. <br /> <br /> The random music was very comfortable to listen to, but I hated the songs, they were really uninspired and nothing like beautiful Tchaikovsky inspired tunes of the original. The signs were the strongest development here. While still concerned, Cinderella had lost her sincerity and much of her charm from the original, although she has some very beautiful clothes. The Duke had some really fun moments, but they weren't enough to save the movie, just as with caution and the king. As mentioned, the mice were the redeeming benefits of the movie as they only contributed to the beauty of the film. I must also say that the animation is colorful and above average, and the voice action was surprisingly good. All in all, it was a sweet, unoriginal sequel who was horrified by the songs and a lack of history. 4/10 for the mice, the voice, the animation and some beautiful dresses. Bethany Cox
