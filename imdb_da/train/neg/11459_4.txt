Whalers choose the wrong freaking whale. <br /> <br /> A group of yahoo whale operators catch a woman and stretch her up from her tail fin. The whale's mate sees it all together with the moment when the woman's unborn child slips out and pulls on the deck. Captain Nolan (Richard Harris) could tell that the big man is really angry the way it stared him down as saying, "Get out of town before high tide." <br /> <br /> This revenge story has Harris's presence and Bos's beauty, but not much else. This was Bos's first 'released' film, although her first play was four years earlier in 'And Once Upon a Love', published in 1981 as 'Fantasies' (directed by John Derek). <br /> <br /> P.S. Today is the date of this review (November 20) Bo Derek's birthday. I hope Bo has a "whale" of a good time ..... get it? ..... whales? ..... hee-hee.
