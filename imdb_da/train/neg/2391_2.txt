I love movies. I love independent efforts and great studio productions. I love movies with stars and I love those who offer unknowns. I love dramas, comedies, action adventures, science fiction, mysteries, westerns, any genre except horror. I love foreign movies as well as those in English. I love good movies and I even love bad because almost no movie ever fails to entertain or entertain at some level. Except for "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues." When I participated in a show of "Cowgirls", I came to an audience of about 10. Less than halfway into it, I remained alone. Soon I could not tolerate the disturbing mess unfolding for my eyes, and I also went. So far, "Cowgirls" is the only movie I've ever gone out of. <br /> <br /> I don't quite know how to describe this incoherent, vacuumy, unclear, meaningless movie, or how to transfer the missing missing value. Suffice it to say that it is one of the worst big movies of all time, unpredictable and unpredictable at all levels. It is trying to be wise, but its perception of feminism seems hopelessly anachronistic. It is trying to be fun, but its humor is rough and cringe-worthy. This is one of the few films that manages to transform its own ethos by portraying protagonists in as off-putting a way as you revolt against them and their values. To watch a movie, see "Waterworld", "Ishtar", anything but this. Except for the new "Alexander". If you choose between it and this, read a book instead.
