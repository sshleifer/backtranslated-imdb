I was drawn to this movie, curious to see how they adapted Hubert Shelby's brutal novel. I thought that a literary piece of such depth, with a large texture of characters, horrible situations and social criticism, could not translate into a bad movie. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> This flick is a horrible movie experience, not for the content but for its form. Director, Ulrich Edel, in my sincere opinion, performs a terrible management job that does not justify the original book. No wonder Edel is the television director; This movie looks and feels like a bad "made to TV" flick. Some of my views on this bomb (** spoilers ahead **): <br /> <br /> - Lack of directorial creativity. The scenes are slow, feels slow, looks badly shot and hardly goes into anchored position. The only freedom they take is in the film area, with a nice dark tone. Apart from that, the film has the same technical creativity as a television soap opera. <br /> <br /> - All the actors do a great job of portraying these miserable characters. The problem is that the adaptation does not address a fundamental element of the development of the plot: MOTIVATION. All these characters move around like robots, without a clear motivation for their action. They seem to make things out of the blue, like robots, for no reason. Noble misses every opportunity to enrich character development by not investigating the character's motivations and by avoiding the development of each person's personality to its fullest extent. This lack of character development is evident in Tralala. Jennifer Jason Leight does a good job with this trashy prostitute, but her alcoholic decision to let the sailors offend her is not explained. It looks extremely stupid as we see this character making it out of the blue. This is a clear example of poor character development. <br /> <br /> The movie also has many secondary, token characters that do nothing, feel nothing and add nothing to the plot. I would like to have learned more about Harry's wife, for example, and the interaction between the two. It's another missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> Edel only approaches character development with Harry and his fixation with his gay lover, only to screw it up at the end, not clearly explaining - his motivations. Thugs are also a joke in their lack of development. <br /> <br /> - The soundtrack is one of the worst I have ever experienced. Mark Knopfler's awful job. I was seriously expecting more from the former head of Dire Straits, but his job in this movie is seriously lacking. Sometimes, as in the struggle between the union and the police, the music seems completely disconnected from the film. It also feels quite poor and anachronical; I could swear the entire soundtrack was made with a Casio toy keyboard. It is derived from the actual action. <br /> <br /> - The book adaptation of Desmond Nakano is so literal that it eliminates the point of history. It feels as though they were trying so hard to keep the story of action in the book that they forgot to actually develop the characters and once again explain their actions and motivations. <br /> <br /> I can't seriously recommend this movie, not even a Shelby fan, because it can destroy the original book. It is a very uninspired effort to adapt the novel and show very little creative input.
