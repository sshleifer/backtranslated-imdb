Let me start by saying that I am a great fantasy fan. But this movie is not for me. Many colored arguments try to support this film's claim that drag may ever exist. The film mentions connections in various stories from different countries, but fails to examine them more thoroughly, which could have given the film some credibility. The movie uses (beautiful!) CGI to tell us a narrated fantasy story of a young dragon life. This is combined with the popular TV show CSI style flash-forward to make it something scientific, which it certainly is not. In many cases, the arguments / tracks have been removed. In some cases, there were traces that appeared to dragon, possibly existed, or wing or spit fire is simply void. To see this, I get myself getting cramps in my toes. Even a fantasy film needs some degree of reality in it, but one just doesn't have it. Bottom line: It's a pretentious fantasy-CSI documentary, not worth seeing.
