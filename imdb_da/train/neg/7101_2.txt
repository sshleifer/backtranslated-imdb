I'd give this movie a zero out of ten, but I'll give it a second. The reason is that Shah Rukh Khan appears in the film, which is not a real reason. The last point is that Rani appears in this movie and makes a smooch with Kamal. I love Rani a lot and have a respect for being a great actress. That's why I didn't enjoy her in this movie that kisses Kamal, but it's not big. Still, enough of the bedroom scenes that made this movie noticeable, let's actually talk about this movie. Is it good or bad, I think it's a rubbish movie that made me yawn. I'm a fantastic critic, you can see my other 250+ review by clicking on my name, I have good taste. The movie is not entertaining is one thing, and if it is considered difficult to hit the cinema, why is there no morality in this movie. It is a biased movie that is not a true story and it stinks. Seeing Kamal kiss these actresses makes me sick, You can't kiss properly anyway.
