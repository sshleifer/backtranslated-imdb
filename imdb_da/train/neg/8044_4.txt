Well, I watched this movie just over 2 years ago, and now I pulled it out of the dusty shelf to see it again, and I have to say I actually think this movie is good. This movie got a buzz like bootleg I know what you did last summer 3, just like Final Stab was that Scream 4, and well, this movie is not that bad. I think it was wrong, and of course it would be ridiculous to release this in the theaters, but still for a midnight popcorn flick, this movie is not half bad. It has some scares and some really hot women I can add. And it shows Joey Lawrence's new, fleshy look, although it obviously hasn't won him any big Hollywood roles either ... I feel bad for the man, he had such a career in the early and mid-90s with flower, some Disney movies and the eternal Lawrence brothers show ..... Joey Lawrence was a bit play in the sitcom scene, but then in a 360 degree tour his career only went south for low-cost movies like this. <br /> <br /> The movie also throws you in, it makes you think between the crew, which is really a secret that anyone knows, to only be disappointed in the end to find out the secret. It also throws you at who the killer is, I had an idea, but still doesn't think the killer was who he was, but his motives combined with the secret was a huge downturn. Has there been a secret that was knocked out? This movie could have been one of the better b rated movies. But also I am a sucker for college themes and I also at college went spring break in a mansion size beach house similar to that in here, so it just made me feel sentimental about this movie. <br /> <br /> A half-slasher flick. Good for midnight movie.
