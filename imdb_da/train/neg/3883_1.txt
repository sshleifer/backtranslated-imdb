No, just fun. It was godly. <br /> <br /> I watched my local Sci-Fi station last night, playing movies every night within a monthly theme. This month it's "Space Turkeys, Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Loving the Bombs". Movies so bad, they should never have been made. This was a good selection. Everything about this movie is terribly horrible with two exceptions, make make-up (which showed potential) and editing (which made a bit of the rest of the movie in conditions of being terrible). The action is horrible around, the dialogue is horrible, the manuscript, the direction. It's not a good movie. <br /> <br /> It consists of two types of special effects, gore and stock footage of space. I want to focus on gore. Watching this movie, I thought of myself, "What was the motivation behind this movie?" People like to do things, but I was reluctant to think that anything good could have been for everyone involved. I came to the conclusion that this movie was made as a means to increase Make-Up Effects guy's Demo Reel. He (Rick Baker) actually went on a great career, he has worked at STAR WARS (1977), KING KONG (1976), MEN IN BLACK (1996) and even THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING WOMAN (1981) plus a number of other notable flicks. Apart from that, I can't say that I've ever seen a real, living melting man - unbelievable or otherwise - but I have to say that this seemed to be a fair representation of one. <br /> <br /> When I think of bad editing, I usually think of a scene where someone is talking on the phone, and then in the middle of the scene, the phone jumps to its shoulder or something. This movie really serves to highlight the fact that poor editing can take many forms. Especially long and completely useless scenes. Almost every scene dragged longer than it should have, from a little dead air to the crazy screaming scene with Cleaver Girl. And the cut head in the river, the head being thrown into a river (in slow motion), the film continues for a few minutes, and then we cut back to the floating head and see it fall down a waterfall. Although I'm sure they were all very proud of their cut head, WHAT HELL. <br /> <br /> Finally, I will mention the running fat lady / slow motion scene right at the beginning. The jerky slow motion tells me that they didn't shoot the scene in slow motion initially, but later decided that it "didn't work that way" and then slowed it down. Oy vey. In any case, if you ever see another movie where a hysterical fat woman runs into a hall and then directly through a closed glass door - all in slow motion, remember - remember the inappropriate fuser, for * this * is where it is all started. <br /> <br /> Movies like this are best seen at home with a bunch of friends. This is a bit slow most of the time, but it's just more time to come up with your own one-liners. It's not the worst of the worst, but it's pretty freaking bad.
