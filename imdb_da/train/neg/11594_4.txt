Like Freddy's Revenge, this sequel takes a rather weird idea and does not go to great lengths to push a story out of it. Alice from number 4 is basically pregnant, and her baby is haunted by Freddy, who gives him an outlet to haunt her friends. This has the smallest deaths out of the whole series, and the clever cracks are pretty poor, so neither horror fans nor comedy fans are happy. <br /> <br /> I don't have much to say about this. It is moderately interesting to see the characters Alice and Dan returning from four, but not worth watching movies over. Uninspiring and unenjoyable, possibly only the competitive direction saves it from being the worst in the series.
