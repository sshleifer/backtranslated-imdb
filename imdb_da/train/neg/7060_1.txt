This movie is horrible. The characters are amazing and wildly inconsistent. The reason is horrible and some of the classroom scenes are cringe-worthy and make it uncomfortable to see. <br /> <br /> In fact, the quality and characterization of the script would suggest that this film was written by high school students, only the complete lack of credibility for the school environment would indicate that the authors never actually went to high school. The action in most cases was also weak, although much of this was down to a poor script and plot, I am not sure any actors could have made this movie appear. <br /> <br /> Having said that the sound track was ok, and the movie theater was nice in places (though editing was poor).
