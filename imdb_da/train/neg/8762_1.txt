A scientist (John Carradine - unfortunately) finds out how to get the dead back to life. But they come back with marble faces. Eventually, everything leads to disaster. <br /> <br /> Boring, completely predictable 1940's excursion. This scared me stupidly when I was a kid, but just drill me now. I had to fight to keep myself awake! With one exception, the play is terrible. Such express boring actors! Hopeless. <br /> <br /> There are some good things about this: Carradine, despite the script, actually gives a very good performance. And there are a few mildly eerie moments that involve a ghost of a great Dane who goes through walls. There is also one of the worst-looking knockouts in movie history. Yet none of this is fun enough to sit through this. Avoid.
