From reading all the comments posted here on IMDb, this movie seems to be ragged a lot, but I didn't think it was that bad. I've seen a lot worse, actually. <br /> <br /> "The House Where Evil Dwells" is a ghost story of a man and his wife, Ted and Laura Fletcher, and their daughter, Amy, moving into an old house in Japan. Little know, a Japanese ninja murdered his wife and her lover brutally and then killed 100 years earlier with a samurai sword. As strange things happen in the house, the ghosts of the former residents begin to possess the bodies of living people and plan to reintroduce the bloody murder that took place 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie and decided to give it a try, from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story. It was routine and it was grainy, but I have seen worse in my time. The ghost sequences were a little over-finished, we see the transparent bluish characters randomly appear randomly around the family and take over their bodies. To be honest, the ghosts of this movie reminded me of the ghosts in the Haunted Mansion trip at Disneyland. I may be wrong, but after seeing this, it seemed to me that the Japanese horror movie "Ju-On: The Grudge" and the American remake of the movie tore it off. The old Japanese home where a brutal murder took place, ghost activity, curses put home etc. But I can be wrong. <br /> <br /> To sum up, this is a beautiful corny ghost story. Don't go out of your way to see it, but if you like these things and it happens to be on TV, you can give it a shot. 10.4.
