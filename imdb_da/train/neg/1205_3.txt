What is it? A Canadian-produced zombie flick that I've never heard of before. A mortician works on the body of a recently deceased young man. This allows for an extended flashback showing how the guy came there. Basically, he and friends went to a cemetery Friday the 13th and traveled the dead thanks to his stupid chanting. Cut back to the gazebo where our dead body comes back to life and kills the mortar and the owner (who gets their eyes popped out). The final WTF? shot has the funeral home owner in a straight jacket and screams, "I'm not crazy!" Amazingly, he has his eyeballs left. <br /> <br /> Running a bit 58 minutes, this is definitely a weird zombie cinema. It feels much longer, but put me in a kind of trance where I couldn't stop seeing. The movie also has one of these "if you see this picture, turn away from the screen" gags. It is the image of an old man who becomes ill in a theater (prophetic?) And when he comes up (only twice), the blood begins to flow. The scenes are quite awful at the moment. There is a big gaff where a zombie cuts a girl's right hand with a shovel, but - when he pulls the fake hand into the frame to handle it - it's a left hand.
