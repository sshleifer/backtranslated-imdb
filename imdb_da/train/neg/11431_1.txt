It is important not to be offended because of lack of logic or common sense, and those who have "gray things" agree that this movie just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> The problems are in the direction of choice and lack of depth in the character building. The word comedy was very hard to say when I expect to laugh when these words are used. Let's look at the problems in the direction / script. <br /> <br /> Both mid-30s brother and sister seem to be well-adjusted. They meet a complete stranger at a park, and Heather Graham's character goes up to her and asks the most intimate questions that even half-sane person would drive the other way or at least scream to a police officer. He goes so awkwardly and makes some stupid statements, and she falls for him. Then after a date they were all together, he fell in love with her and decided to get married in Vegas in a week's time ???? Hey, does anyone feel stupid yet? He goes out with thousands of women and he meets this one person who says in 10 words that we see on the screen and he will marry her. Not only was there no chemistry, it just doesn't make sense. Of course, it's a romantic comedy, and I think it could, but the direction made it completely flat. Now, Heather puts her head over with her too, and when Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan (very low grade) kiss or more to the point that it was the hardest kiss ever, chemistry could be there. I found it unromantic and unfunny and while many say Heather can't act I think the reality is Heather was clearly the wrong person to this role. <br /> <br /> This was Sue Kramer's debut as an instructor and for me it was just too much for her to chew. It would take a lot of craft to do this movie work and IMHO it could be done with better writers and casting and direction.
