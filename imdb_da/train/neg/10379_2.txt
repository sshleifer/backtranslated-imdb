Film starts in 1840 Japan, where a man kills his wife and her lover kills and commits suicide. It's a very gory, bloody sequence. Then it jumps to the present ... well 1982 to be precise. Ted (Edward Albert), wife Laura (Susan George) and their annoying baby move to Japan for her hubby. They rent a house and - surprise! surprise - it just happens to be the house where the murders took place! The three dead people are around like ghosts (the makeup is hysterically bad) and makes life hell to the family. <br /> <br /> Sounds OK - but it's really hopeless. There is a bloody opening and ending, and nothing happens. There is an assault of giant crabs that is just monstrous! They look so fake - I swear I saw the strings pull one together - and they mumble !!!!! There is a meaningless sex sequence in the first 20 minutes (probably just to show George's body), another about 40 minutes later (but it was necessary for the plot) and a really stupid exercise towards the end. The battle situation between Albert and Doug McClure must be seen as believed. <br /> <br /> As for acting, Albert was OK when the man and McClure were quite good as a family friend. But George - as always - is great in a miserable movie. She gives this movie a much needed lift - but can't save it. I give this a 2 only for her and gory opening and closing. Aside this is a very boring movie.
