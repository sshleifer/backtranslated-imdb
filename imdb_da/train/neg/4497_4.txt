- I had planned to write something that explained what I didn't like about this movie, but it gets harder than I thought. Honestly I can't remember much about it. I saw it just three days ago and it has hardly had any impact on me. It is usually a sign of a real stinker. About the only thing I remember was getting incredibly bored with most. The news of having a Humphrey Bogart look-a-like as the detective was right quickly. It would be different if he could act, but he is a note entertainer. The kitten's scenes were handled amateurishly and there was no excitement that led to them. If you can't see the killer five minutes in the movie, you should see more Euro horror. Castings are a dead giveaway to the murderer's identity.
