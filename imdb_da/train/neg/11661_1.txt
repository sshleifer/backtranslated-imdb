Basically, this is an overlong, unfunny, action / comedy. First of all, I would like to say that I enjoyed Wayan's brother Scary Movie (1) and the successor had that moment. Unfortunately, white chickens do not even live half of the laughs. <br /> <br /> The humor in it is completely raw. If you like burping, farting, stupid catchphrases you should probably look at this. When it's not raw, it's idiotic. The first 10 minutes of the movie gave everything away to me, totally unfunny, simply idiotic. <br /> <br /> But I saw it all since I was with a friend (otherwise I wouldn't have bothered). The story is unthinkable thin, it was also in scary movies, but at least the laughs were fast and constant. I think it's probably also one of the main problems with this movie, but the laughs aren't coming soon enough. Some jokes are drawn too long when they are more obnoxious than fun at first. If you prefer your comedy with a few brain cells, avoid it here. If you want a silly comedy with more laughs then look at scary movies, planes, hotshots 1 + 2. 1/10 Totally ufunny, Thin storyline, A movie that seems to be based on an idea (ie what if we dressed up as white chickens for a movie?) but simply did not have enough material.
