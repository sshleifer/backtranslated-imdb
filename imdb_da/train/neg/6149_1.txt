I will spend some days dedicated to Ron Howard before I swear to work. After treating Lucas at such a young age, Howard is now caught in so many Lucas traits. How do you explain his disaster campaign? Of course, his only useful movie has been 'Willow'. Everything else, including this one, is too dependent on superficial junk. <br /> <br /> Some spoilers. <br /> <br /> He can't even have a half-intelligent focus like Peter Weir. No, poor Howard looked at his Spielbergian knockoff qualities, that he was quickly forgotten. <br /> <br /> Here we have the old saying: "Love conquers everything itself disease." Too bad for Howard, Lynch already came through the whole subtitle with more skill. Heck, even Disney did better than this. Ron even goes to the possibilities of imagined realities. <br /> <br /> Howard's commentary is just awful. Don't even rent the DVD. <br /> <br /> Final analysis = = Cinematic Dud
