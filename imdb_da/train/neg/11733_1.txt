I am shocked that there were people who liked this movie. I saw it at Tribeca, and most of the audience laughed at it on scenes that were not meant to be fun. I felt bad because the leading actress was in the audience but honestly had the plot for this movie in need of MAJOR review ... it didn't even matter, a second the characters question what it really is that they are snarling .. The next scene they are hopelessly addicted and find out how to do it ?? The end just took the cake. I'm not going to spoil the grand conclusion .. but it's pretty mixed up with the rest of the horrible plot / script ... watch this movie for comedy if you need to ..
