I saw this today, attracted to the all-star cast, and partly because I have enjoyed so many other films of this ilk. However, this is one to avoid. There are dozens of badly cut scenes where continuity just doesn't flow, the billiards challenge at first. The fighting situations with the natives are just as good as you would remember in the old black and white Tarzan movies you know where you see a spear flying through the air and the camera cuts to a dead native lying motionless on the floor with it sticking from his thigh. Is that instant death? There are also several quite unnecessary scenes that have nothing to do with the plot, as well as the little girl being rescued while collecting flowers. The really badly animated clay toys are too painful to see. If you see this movie, the crabs that inch forward at approx. 5 km / h, the highlight. Somehow one manages to crawl on David McCullum and give him a nip. It is as if there was no time to get out of the way, as when the obelisk in the city falls over, natives have constantly been in the world to take a 2 step left, but no he screams and it falls on Hi M. I give only this one 2 because of Ekland. And why does Mccullum's voice develop a stutter when the movie progresses?
