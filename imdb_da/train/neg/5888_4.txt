I saw it recently on a faded old VHS tape, and remembered it weakly. When you look at it now, it seems charming. <br /> <br /> Once released, it was recognized by virtually everyone as a ghost about coming out as a gay teenager. To hammer the point home, the mother is seen reading a paperback copy of "1 Teenager In 10", the most popular coming out of the time book. David Warner pushes it up as the persecuted vampire hunter [= gay evangelist], who is, of course, an independent deterrent. The list of sight gags and in-jokes was included to ensure that no one missed the point would be too long to enter. The producers had some good-natured fun and no doubt hope to light up and inform. <br /> <br /> But I have no idea how a teenage audience would watch this movie today. In some places where there is education and culture, the scary trials that gay teens have to go through are a past. But I'm sure there are lots of dark, uncomfortable corners on our continent where it's just as bad as it always was.
