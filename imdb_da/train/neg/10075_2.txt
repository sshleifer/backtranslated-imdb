I'm sorry, but even TJ Hooker's Adrian Zmed couldn't save this sequel. I went through half of the movie and thought this was a spoof of the original. Then came the wild and crazy motorcycle scene (note that this is the only movie by Patricia Birch's leader); and I unfortunately understood that they were trying to be serious. I got a kick out that the opposite gang who lost their "wheels" because of their gaming habits in the original grease was forced to use motorcycles in the other movie. Ashamed of the putz character of Carrington, I would hate to see what they would resort to later: perhaps the Mopeds? <br /> <br /> I never bought the hackneyed theme: hunky-australian-boy-can't-fit-in-outsiders-dominated-school-ergo-go-for-to-guy-with-stupid biker helmet look. It was the Disney story gone terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> So it looks like you can ruin a good thing by placing a bubble gum smacking Michelle Pfeiffer in a musical. The only thing I took away from this movie was an idea of ​​how many points out of ten to give it.
