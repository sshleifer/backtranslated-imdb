The script was very weak without enough scripts to make you break a bit about the characters or what happens to them. The script is far too talky and not enough to do or act to call it slowly. The story comes to the point that you just want everyone to stop and die as soon as possible so you don't have to listen to them, talk this very subdued, rigid dialogue. On a technical note, the music mix is ​​far too high and makes it difficult to understand what is said most times. So again, this can be called a blessing. Overall, this same story could have been better told in a short movie with a maturity of less than 30 minutes. The obvious "in your face" tribute to Sam Raimi and "Evil Dead" would have been good if they were more subtle, but here they seem more like a bald face rip off. C'mon, this kind of 35mm budget and THIS is the best thing that could be done? However, the cinematography, lighting design and shoots were very well done indeed.
