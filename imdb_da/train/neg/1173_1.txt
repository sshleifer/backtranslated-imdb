If I only had one camera accidentally glued to the floor, enough movie for only one roof on each shot and then lost all that movie and had to scrounge some money to buy a few digital video tapes and was forced to make one movie over 2 hours on the French Revolution and also had no sets and had to have my 4-year-old autistic son paints backgrounds, and also the only actors I could find were the people who did not 'I did the auditions for that year soap opera, and I was also forced not to use any music in the whole movie, and also the zoom function on the camera did not work, except once when it accidentally started zooming in and could not stop, oh and if I hated my audience, then I could do something like this horrible, yet erroneously hilarious, vain waste of time. The almost beautiful but totally fake looking backgrounds reminded me of some of George Lucas' latest creations, which made it so much more disappointing because the whole movie had that little glimpse of hope behind the movie would climax into a lightaber duel / space laser match. I don't mean to ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it, but that's not how it ends. All I can think of was wasting more time than watching this movie writing this review. Peace.
