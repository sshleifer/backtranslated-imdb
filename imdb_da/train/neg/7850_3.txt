Alexandre Aja's recreation of The Hills Have Eyes was one of the bright spots in 2006. Not only was it a remake of a classic horror movie, but it was also damn good. So almost a year later we are treated to the sequel to that remake. While original scripts Wes Craven is back as producer and co-scripted, this movie just does not rise to the level set by the original and remake. A group of military trainees stop in the desert to check in on some scientists and break down the mutant family from the first movie (at least those who remain plus some new ones). There are lots of things to do here. What annoys me about this movie is the complete lack of characterization. The viewer gives nothing amazing about what happens to any of these people because we haven't got them. Even the mutants had some characterization last time out and this time nothing. Gore for your sake is meaningless. There must be a reason for this to be interesting. Nothing that happens here is interesting. And what is it recently with rape scenes in movies? Here we get another one without any real reason. Hopefully this is a set of trays that will not be visited again.
