I considered myself to be pretty melancholy, especially when I see a big touching and tearing film. But not for this (who surprised me!) And it's also really surprising for me to see how many people praised this movie so highly. <br /> <br /> There are several disturbing facts in the movies: 1. Despite the guilty-legend Ben's real intention to save 7 lives to redeem his past, I find it disturbing that the film seems to promote this type of suicide . Some people may think that this is a heroic act, and some others think he is behaving falsely, eventually it was a disturbing act for me. <br /> <br /> 2. The movie history line is over-dramatic, but the logic is simplified. Blood type medical cancer is an organ donor. Towards the end of the film, we learned that Emily had posterior blood, which limited her chance of getting the donor within a short period of time. Nevertheless, it seemed that Ben had the rare blood type, the same as her, which enabled him to be her donor and comfortable, despite Ben's blood type rarely could he donate not only his heart but also his kidney, his cornea and his bone marrow, which in all cases require not only the corresponding blood type, but also the tissue antigen. <br /> <br /> 3. Why did the doctors allow Ben's organs to be donated despite the cockpit, he used to kill himself? <br /> <br /> I can over-analyze the whole story as it's all just a movie. However, some disruptive facts described above will hopefully help you rethink your plan to go to see this movie. If you go for a soap opera-type movie, go for it. But you are looking for an intelligent entertainment, give it a miss!
