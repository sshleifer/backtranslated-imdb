The play was terrible, and they both got sports errors ....... Not only did they get the skating rules wrong, but also the rules for GIRLS Ice Hockey. In GIRLS ice hockey you cannot check. You also DO NOT BLOCK for anyone. Not all the girls are disgusting brutal medieval and great. I play hockey and I'm only 4'11 and have been asked to go to school like that in the movie. Also, not all hockey players hate art skitters. Many current girls hockey players were once art skaters themselves. We also skate much faster than those in the movie. I was embarrassed by the movie, it gave people the idea that we suck ....... though I have to mention that it is difficult to transition between the sport because of the fool on the figure skates ..... also some of these twirly moves KAtelin did on the ice you couldn't do in a regular hockey game. She basically tripped the person who is unclear. It is also unrealistic that she will receive a HOCKEY scholarship when she finds skates. It really made me angry that the scholarship would normally be spent on someone who could benefit the team.
