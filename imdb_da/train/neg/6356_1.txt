If I accidentally stumble across this script in text form, I would read it and maybe laugh. However, I wouldn't laugh at the points in the movie where the director seems to have me laughing. Although I'm still not quite sure where these are. I don't care if this is Woody Allen, this writer can't write dialogue, or at least he can't deliberately write dialogue and then draw performances from actors who are able to draw laughter from even the most stingy of clowns . For example: <br /> <br /> (paraphrase) "I'm an art historian, I'm looking to get a job in an art gallery." <br /> <br /> Okay, so it's called the fact, but honestly, do you know of any art historians who would say so? How will you respond? <br /> <br /> "Really?" An art gallery? Who would have thought so? "The whole script is filled with the kind of tawdry quasi-intellectualism that I would not have expected from such a respected character writer. I admit that I have no knowledge of Allen's other work and judging by this, I do not want to start learning "The characters are unhappy without exception, an attempt to illustrate that we all suffer from the human condition? Or really really bad signage? You're the judge."
