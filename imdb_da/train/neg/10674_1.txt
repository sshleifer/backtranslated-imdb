This is one of the worst movies I've seen this year. In addition to Cuba and Angie, the play is actually embarrassing. Wasn't Archer sometime a decent actress? What happened to her? The action is decent, but totally incredible. Make-up is so bad it is worth mentioning. I mean, who ever think of makeup in a modern feature film. Someone should tell the makeup artist and DOP that you shouldn't see it. The end is a massive disappointment - like "and then they realized it was a dream." Don't waste your time or your money. You're better off just staring into the room for 2 hours.
