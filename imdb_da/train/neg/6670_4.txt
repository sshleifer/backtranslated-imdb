This movie really got a good start. It had the potential to become a truly heartbreaking, romantic love story of filmography that captured the love of "Harlan" and Tobe in long, poetic and idyllic scenes. It didn't really have to be anything more than that, and for a moment I was thrilled that someone finally made a beautiful movie for their own sake, another timeless classic, a modern myth. Why, oh why, clear it up halfway through making the protagonist (Norton) another psycho? Maybe I'm missing the point, but do we really need another movie about psychosis? Or is this need in Hollywood portraying the ill side of human nature that suggests a more general disadvantage in the film industry? For a moment I was making a mental note of the director's name; now I'm back and don't care. At least, it should be added to the film's defense that all actors seemed to invest in their roles. Also, Evan Rachel Wood is really great to watch and a good actress with lots of potential.
