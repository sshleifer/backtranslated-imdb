I'm not a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre, but even by the standards of low low budget utilization, this one is truly paralyzed. Even at a nudity-and-gore level, it's incredibly boring (there are some of both, but it's all ... meh). Before the home video revolution, it may not even have been released theatrically (although it may have, * Plan 9 from outer space * played in theaters). There is just one good (and competently delivered) line throughout the film; I suppose they stole it from somewhere. <br /> <br /> The action is among the worst I've ever seen. I mean, even Ed Wood had a few competent players, and the rest tended to be ridiculously hammy, which can be fun to watch. Nevertheless, most of his actors could largely pass. Here are those who do not read their lines as cigar-big Indians as they taught them phonetically. And this movie has a distinction: it manages to become poorly subplotted for most of the movie, so ridiculously overplotted to the end. <br /> <br /> (Update: I should have designated the actor to play the receptionist as an exception. She's not wood at all. Not that she's good, but she's definitely not wood.) Even the worst slasherflicks are in general good for some puritanic meditations on their grotesque offensive, but with this one there does not even seem to be anything to build a moral outrage. <br /> <br /> And you know the funniest thing? They clearly expected to make a sequel! <br /> <br /> It's so bad and boring that it actually gets fascinating in a strange way. I sat through many of the video and wondered why anyone would go into the disturbance by doing so.
