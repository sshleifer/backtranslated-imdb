I've seen this movie several times in a number of short film festivals, and it always makes me feel like I've seen a movie trailer! <br /> <br /> For a school movie is very well produced and directed, but the story ... it needed something else to be a bigger and interesting movie. The character named Tim Watcher needed some in-dept approach. This is something missing in some Portuguese short films - the script is always superficial. <br /> <br /> But still ... I liked this movie ... Parabens! (Congratulations!)
