I've almost always been against recording songs in a movie. My belief was that the quality of the movie would be improved automatically if only the extremely annoying songs were to be provided. However, things have changed quickly after seeing the horrible variety (no songs) & this movie (many songs). While black was weak to extreme, a gripping story delivers with a strong play and good direction. The songs were almost random and mixed in almost seamlessly with the movie. There were certainly no women who were sprayed with water without any apparent reason from mysterious water sources while gazing wildly on the street at night. I was pleasantly surprised by the bold and untouched approach the director used. There was no shine on anything and almost all scenes were completely credible. <br /> <br /> I would recommend these movies to Hindi-speaking people with at least a little understanding of Mumbai's life. The former because the English subtitle was below par and contained many errors that sometimes completely reversed the meaning of the actual statement. The latter because you will certainly appreciate the accuracy of the depiction when you have lived yourself. <br /> <br /> I would certainly rank this as a work worthy of international recognition. The scenes with the gossip drivers were a good touch, and it also served as a source of true humor as well as a different perspective on the whole mishmash. However, the film falls short in a few places where the characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things that detract from the overall direction of the movie. <br /> <br /> I also thought a couple of the more sad scenes were not done very well. It was a touch that was fun to watch, rather than arousing any sense of grief and the whole scene tended to come across as a bit stupid. However, these are minor issues, because the film as a whole really is a rare experience to see. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a cynical, pessimistic perspective and a refreshing experience! Actors, not 'heroes' - this is the key. A chance to look at trustworthy people in an extraordinary setting - everyday. A backstage looks at the extent of depravity and a rare ray of hope for Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
