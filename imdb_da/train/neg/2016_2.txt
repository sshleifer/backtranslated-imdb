***** Warning: May contain SPOILERS ********* My huge problem with this movie is how totally self-centered and self-consuming the haughty wife is !! After having a one night stand with a slim psycho, she is stalked by him. He calls her constantly and threatens her and even sends a video of their night together. He is almost crazy and very dangerous. The problem is that she only thinks he's dangerous to her (and exposes her secret). Not for a second did she ever have faith in her husband! Does she even think for a moment that he may be at risk from this psychotic? As soon as she realized how mental he was, she should have warned her husband regardless of the consequences. Maybe there wouldn't have been a movie, but there really wasn't one anyway, so what's the difference.
