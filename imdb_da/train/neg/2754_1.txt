My original review of this movie was simply the word written over 2000 times. Although this was a very accurate criticism, I felt my review should be a bit more descriptive. <br /> <br /> I'll start with the leading actress; her facial expression doesn't even change in this movie, she doesn't show fear, happiness or depression. Her body language skills come down almost to kill her eyes to the left and right and looks like she doesn't know jack. She is an emotional reminder that I guess has had too much botox. However, her lack of facial expression through the movie is insurmountable by the lamentable love affair with the main actor, who seems to be jumping out of nothing and having them on a beach and falling in love with each other for hours. The main actor, whose hair requires more attention than he did, was at best mediocre and didn't even make me feel like he was really in danger. The only thing that tops the hideous play is the director, story and inaccuracies of the plot. I've seen tampon ads with more structure than this movie. There is no development in character, they just seem to say and do things that I could never believe a real person would. <br /> <br /> This movie would not have been bad if it was trying to defeat the purpose of snakes on a plane, but it was so hard to be a serious act that I couldn't even laugh. I think I now have a brain tumor from watching this movie and thinking of all the different ways I could have used that budget and cg team to create something far better. If I bought this on DVD, I would smash the DVD, burn it, and then dissolve it in hydrochloric acid for good. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!
