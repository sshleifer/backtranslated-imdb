The first question to consider after seeing this nonsense is who gave the idiots the right to use the Omen name for this movie? It is a shambolic, embarrassing, pathetic attempt to continue the Omen franchise. When the movie starts, the sound supports as it has been lifted right from a Bugs Bunny Cartoon, and from then on the movie gets worse! I don't know who wrote the script, but I bet they got an E - because they took it back to show their teacher! It is difficult after a while to tell if this is a comedy because what happens is so much fun and so inconsiderate to the original Omen that it speaks belief. The act is ridiculous, especially from the leading lady Faye Grant. she continues to take stupid faces, or does she have difficulty laughing? It's hard to tell. The worst sequal I have ever had the accident to witness. 1 out of 10
