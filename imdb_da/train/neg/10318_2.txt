Who likes horrible "comedy" shows like Little Mosque in Prairie? The only two kinds of people I can think of that look at this are: One, Muslim, and self-proclaimed liberal defenders of any ethnic group so enthusiastic, there is a show about Muslims that it doesn't even matter if the show is good or fun at all (which it is not). Two old people and people whose idea of ​​comedy are incredibly predictable, poorly written, outdated jokes. CBC must really look at what they are doing and who their audience is. If they only write comedy to real old people then guess what will happen, their audience will die soon, and they won't have any audience left. I would be curious who even writes for this show? Do you think it's actually Muslims or hip, funny young people? No, I testify that it is old white guys who have written the same jokes for the same kind of bad CBC shows since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> Looking at the CBC comedy shows, Air Farce Finally we just got out of the air (thank goodness!) But we still have lame ducks like This Hour having 22 minutes and Rick Mercer as we pay for, not to mention this bad excuse for "comedy" little mosque on the prairie. It must be offencive and fun? Only CBC would think that this lame show is offencive or fun at all. Shame on the CBC to wipe out our tax dollars on shows few people would bother to see.
