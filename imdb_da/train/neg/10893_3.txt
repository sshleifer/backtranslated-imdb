This is one of the movies that should have been much better than it turned out. I fear to think about what the Blockbuster-approved editing should have looked like, because the director's cut on DVD was a drill of the epic proportions. Of course, you do not expect to be "The Godfather", but a play or two may be practical. <br /> <br /> There were also so many sweet guys in this movie, but they were heavily underused. I like to see a nice of hotties writing around in their BVDs as much as the next guy, but I myself have the right to expect a little more. However, it was not a total loss; At least we got a look at a Drew Fuller's (covered) junk and really disruptive haircut. And there is Huntley Ritter that looks even shorter than he did in "Bring It On" (and is also about). There is always a silver lining, children. You just have to look very hard at it. And occasionally you need to use your pause button.
