I'm so offended by this movie, it's not even fun ... And I thought "Mulan" was incredible! However, my expectations for Disney have been low, I never expected them to do anything so stereotypical and yet so far away. There is no respect here for a true Chinese culture, just the Hollywood tradition of random martial arts. I appreciate that they tried to make Wendy a normal teenage girl ... But fortunately most normal teenage girls - especially Asian teenage girls - are much less obsessed with such low aspects of life. And from a cultural standpoint, it's almost impossible. Yes, there are girls who are wrapped up in popularity and fashion, but they are quite rare. And even those who are are still quite decent scholars. Another stereotype, perhaps, but quite true. Because that's how Chinese parents work. How Chinese values ​​work. If they wanted to go to authenticity, they would have made Wendy an ironic girl with glasses and a love relationship with the family. <br /> <br /> This just adds to my frustration with American movies. Asian culture is not about meditation and vague, nature-oriented sentences that sound wise. We don't go around smiling all the time, and we don't all know any kind of martial arts. We are human and I would appreciate it if someone would write an Asian part that does not portray us as a sad caricature.
