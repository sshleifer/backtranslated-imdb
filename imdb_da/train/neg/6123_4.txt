When I was a teenager watching this movie for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. Of course, the reason for this is Bo Derek and her various states of clothing in this movie. But now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this movie is horrible. Mind you, Bo Derek is incredibly beautiful, and she and husband director John Derek make sure you see lots of her. But when you take this aspect out of the movie it will be a great boring trip. And Tarzan, he is all muscular as you think he should be, but when he sees Jane (it is Bo of course) for the first time, he doesn't know what to think. This despite the fact that Bo has a wet victory shirt, with the chest prominent. Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem. If you are looking for a movie to beat a beautiful naked body, then this can fill the ticket. If you're looking for a thoughtful, entertaining, and worthy movie, go elsewhere ... almost anywhere else on it !!!
