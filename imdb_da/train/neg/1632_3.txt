An apparent vanity project for Karin Mani (who?), As a hottie Charles Bronson, goes about wiping up the "foam" that hit his parents or grandparents or something and impresses young hunks with his karate skills. In an important scene, she intervenes to stop rape, and a moron policeman throws her in jail, then after a few cool shower scenes and some abortive prison practices, she must take the law into her own hands blah blah blah. I think there were many movies like this? Scripture is stupid than usual if you can believe it. Mani comes out as the kind of showbiz type that would co-produce its own Death Wish star game, and I find that type sporadic, but the movie is a scary device. Competent actors would be wasted on scumbag roles here and would actively undermine the amazing mincing incompetent DA and a judge to be the producer's uncle.
