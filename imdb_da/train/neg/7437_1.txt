This movie is simply not worth spending time or money. Full of clich√©s and a plot that doesn't make sense! I can't believe so many people have given this horrible movie a 10. My guess is that they are stooges by the filmmaker. <br /> <br /> If I could give this movie a zero, I would. Too bad IMDb does not allow it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I saw it was because I went with a friend who really wanted to see it. What is sad is that I never had great expectations from this movie at first, and yet I felt briefly changed. Take my word, don't waste your $ 8 on this piece of waste. The only entertainment I came out of the movie made it fun with the director's name. In all, highly not recommended!
