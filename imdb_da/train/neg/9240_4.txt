The idea of ​​making miniseries about Berlin air traffic seemed to me as one of the more interesting German (after) war films. It is a theme that has not yet been explored much. But the decision makers in this series filled it with clichés. It already starts with the DVD deck of the movie, which is a direct copy of the deck of 'Pearl Harbor'. Luise Kielberg (Bettina Zimmermann) hears that her husband, a doctor, (Ulrich Noethen) died in Russia and after the war, she struggles to survive. She finds a job at the American base, gets work for the cutest and highest ranking officer (Heino Ferch) in town, falls in love with me, gets pregnant, and suddenly becomes her husband again. Come on!!! We've seen this once too often. Heino Ferch and Ulrich Noethen play their role quite well; However, Bettina Zimmermann does not seem to really convince. For some reason, it always seems that she is a little too late to give the right emotional response to the scenes. It just didn't work for me. The action scenes with the aircraft and the air lift, we are sometimes exciting, more often not. Nasty things always seemed to happen to the same pilot. <br /> <br /> Unless you are a big fan of WWII movies, I suggest you spend your money on something else: Chocolate ice cream gives you much more satisfaction! <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10!
