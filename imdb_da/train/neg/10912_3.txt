I really didn't like this movie. It wasn't really fun and in some cases it was just pretty stupid. Rob Schneider is certainly a very talented person, and while his plays were fine in this, it just seemed like a real waste to him staring in. I think there were some parts that were okay and something humorous in a sweet way , but that's about it. The only thing that actually got my attention throughout this trial of the best jokes was that there were some very nice women present and I am not one to watch a movie solely because of it, but in this case it was the only hook where even the smallest case of redemption could be found. All in all, it was a few notes under an average movie! <br /> <br /> Final inquiry: <br /> <br /> Theaters: So glad I didn't waste too much money on this. <Br /> <br /> DVD purchase: Ummm, let me think .... no! <br /> <br /> Rental: If you have a prehistoric sense of humor then why not.
