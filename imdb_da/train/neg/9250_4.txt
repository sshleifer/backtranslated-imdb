Disappointing, predictable movie where a woman (Mc Teer) travels with her daughter from state to state because she cannot maintain relationships and find happiness. In this genre "Everywhere But Here" with Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman gave a much better insight into a mother / daughter relationship. With better acting as well.
