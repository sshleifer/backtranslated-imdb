I can't believe anyone thought there was anything original or interesting about this movie. I am a fan of science fiction as much as the next guy, and I can also enjoy old movies with ridiculous rooms as long as they are written by someone other than a monkey. (See, for example, my glowing review of the Altered States [1980].) A monkey could have explained better exactly why for a second I should take the basic idea of ​​this movie seriously. The problem is not that the producers had a low budget - it was that they didn't care. <br /> <br /> Now to publicly humiliate the worthless leaves whose glowing reviews appear on the box: <br /> <br> Chicago Tribune <br /> <br /> San Francisco Chronicle <br /> /> San Francisco Bay Guardian <br /> <br /> (In fact, I enjoy reading the latter two. Still, their movie is reviewing credibility has gone through the floor. But I know if I ever make a movie with handheld camera, a cheesy plot and stupid effects, I will show it to these journalists and remind them of what they said about Conceiving Ada.)
