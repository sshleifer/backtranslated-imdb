I love the episode where Jim becomes Greenman. It is well! When Jim throws the little person through the window, the look of his face is invaluable. So when he begins to approach the pastor of his wife to find out she has become Pee-Woman? Good writing and good casting along with great plays make this a must see. I'm trying to find a particular image from that episode. I want to use it as my avatar on a bulletin board because I think Greenman is fun. Does anyone know where to download a picture of Jim as a Greenman? Can anyone point me in the right direction to find such a picture?
