*** May contain spoilers. *** <br /> <br /> If you live at TOKYO TIME, there was some bold experiment where real life will have movie agents provided they would be required to take a combination of powerful prescription anti-anxiety, anti Depression and anti-psychotic drugs (this is the classic psych ward combo that makes the patients into boring zombies) all during the shooting, so this movie would hold much more interest. Or if the film production was another type of experiment where all the players were deprived of sleep before and during the recording, then TOKYO TIME could be explained more easily. <br /> <br /> As is, this movie is full of lifeless, low-energy actors. In the scene where the new man was sitting on the stairs and talking to his sister, it turned out he was having trouble keeping his eyes open. In almost every scene, he speaks his lines that sit down with every part of his body motionless. From the beginning to the end, his facial expression is best described as "near sleep." Don't worry about the actors talking over each other's lines, because these actors can hardly finish droning out any dialogs. Everyone speaks with a depressing, monotonous voice. No laughs. No shouting. No strength. No one has enough energy to break a smile. The result: complete and total boredom. <br /> <br /> And that doesn't mean that the direction is simple and amateurish. <br /> <br /> Avoid this lifeless movie at all costs. Better to see GREENCARD, which has a similar plot and has charm and energy. Or, for an unconventional Japanese novel, check out the long vacation that has ample amount of everything that lives on TOKYO TIME does not.
