What a confused mess. I saw this together with a friend some time ago, and we both consider ourselves open to the many wonders of the cinema, but that is certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> Although it might well be good ideas / concepts, and there are certainly some good performances (under the circumstances), they are all buried under random nonsense. Sir Anthony draws too heavily from the same gene pool as Natural Born Killers, U Turn and similar movies in terms of editing, or maybe he saw himself in Nixon as inspiration. Say what you want about David Lynch, but at least he usually doesn't have a madness method. <br /> <br /> His quote that he made the movie as a joke says it all. It's not worth your money, bandwidth or time.
