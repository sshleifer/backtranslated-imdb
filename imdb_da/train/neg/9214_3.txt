Many things become clear when you watch this movie: 1) The play is terrible. Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are so-so, but parent-child conflicts border soap opera-ish. The other two boys: An all too pouty child prodigy and your stereotype I'm-a-babe-but-I'm-really-sensitive-inside blonde dreamboat; 2) The film as a whole is depressing and disappointing; 3) Robbie's dreams and episodes interfere (acted by Tom Hanks); 4) The inclusion of beginning love ballads is an odd choice ("we are all special friends"); 5) The weird lines and the sides do not get better by the horrible acting; and 5) this is a really bad movie. Expect to be disappointed - and probably disturbed.
