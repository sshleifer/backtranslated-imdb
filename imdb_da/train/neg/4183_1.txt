If it wasn't for "Oh So Gourgous," Natassia Malthe, this B movie wouldn't have been worth a sector of my Tivo disk space! In what low rent was the backyard filmed the specified space port? "Continuity People!" It is a fundamental principle of true filmmaking! In the evening an alleged spaceport and during the day (night and day at a space station?) A warehouse! ??!? People please! The only thing I would recommend this movie to is the wardrobe. To keep Natassia constantly in the tight shape that reveals clothes! Even the women who saw this bomb had to appreciate the clothes she spent some time on, every day filming! The sci-fi channel would have been better to display SpaceBalls! At least there would have been some real humor in seeing something so incredible. <br /> <br /> P.S. Michael Ironside, please fire your agent ASAP! You are so much better for an actor to be similar to this level of filmmaking.
