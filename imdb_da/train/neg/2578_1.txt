To sum up this movie: Without a real plot, this movie consists of 80 minutes of horrible characters, either drinking or making bad jokes. The music is just awful, humor is not fun and all the female characters are jaded idiots or total geeks. It seems to me that the film is actually written by a 14-year-old boy who thinks drinking is cool, women are designed to please men and anyone who opposes this view is geek. Also, the film has nothing to do with the original American Pie movies, except for a few names and Mr. Levenstein, which is a minor character in this. The only good thing about this movie is the beautiful girls. Don't look at this movie and don't be fooled by the 5.4 rating, because of course it overstated and doesn't deserve anything over 2.
