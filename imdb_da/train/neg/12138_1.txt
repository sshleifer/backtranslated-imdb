Serious HOME ALONE / KARATE KID turns off with enough bad character stereotypes to get the author sued and then shot. You could see blatant stunt one use in almost every scene. Oh, and the play sugar too. Although I have to say that the line: "Sorry, guy, I have to take a big dump big time" made me laugh my ass.
