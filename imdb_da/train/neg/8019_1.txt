I read half a dozen other user comments on this board and it seems that opinions vary a lot. I agree with those who found this movie to be horrible. It makes me hard to write it, because I would have hoped it would have been good, or I wouldn't have bothered to see it the other day. I like to support the indie cinema, especially if they are gay, but this movie is almost too much to tolerate. Those who went out, which I was considering doing after about three minutes, probably didn't mind shelling out $ 11.00, or just figured it went nowhere fast and not improving. Maybe I'm a little more optimistic than they are .. either it or they don't pay to get in the first place. <br /> <br /> Logan bored. He is a klutz. He is homosexual. It's okay with that. The problem is that because the protagonist of a movie doesn't necessarily feel that the movie about him must be bored too! There are ENDLESS scenes of this kid, just lying like a lot of laundry, restoring everything you've already learned in the first scene, and the second scene, etc. Etc. Nothing or nobody goes anywhere. No one says anything even external insight or fun or interesting. Probably most terrible of all is that I didn't feel the least part of the empathy for Logan. It is in itself an important implementation. He did not grow, he did not change, he did not learn (there is no one to teach him anything), he did not do anything, nor the film! The scene after scene of the same thing does not make a film production. <br /> <br /> In addition, the title makes no sense at all. 10.1.
