Early film directed by D.W. Griffith; It has a lovely happy king (Arthur V. Johnson) and his queen (Marion Leonard) - but wait! When the king leaves the scene, his queen makes music with the Palace Minstrel (Henry B. Walthall). When the King discovers the lovers, he decides to perform a horrible Edgar Allen Poe-type revenge. It is hard to believe that the lovers cannot hear those who oppose them; even though the actors are trying to see alternately noisy (lovers) and quiet (cement mixers). The sets make "The Sealed Room" look very staged. The performance is okay and the story is easy to follow. <br /> <br /> *** The sealed room (9/2/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B. Walthall, Marion Leonard
