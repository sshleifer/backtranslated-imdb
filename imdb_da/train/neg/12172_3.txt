After the debate of the first Sleepaway Camp, who believed that a franchise could be born. SC II is superior in the aspect. More inspired kills and just much more fun. Although it may not say much (compared to the first movie), Sleepaway Camp II is worth renting. Advantages: Entertaining doesn't take too seriously as SC I. Inspired Killings. Cons: Crappy acting and the mullets abound. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: 5/10 <br /> <br />
