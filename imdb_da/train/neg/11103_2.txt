OK, so I just watched the movie, even though it appeared last year ... I thought it was generally a decent movie, except the story that was stupid and horrible ... First of all, we never learn anything about the creatures Why did they show up, what do they do in our world, and really have they been on earth before we were or just came from space? Secondly, the role of the butcher to maintain the order is just as naturally created ... Really, how big could the subsoil for an substation have been? There were only so many of these creatures, so I think, instead of killing innocent people in vain, they could just have planted some tactical bombs or maybe delete them, and a Nuke would have done the job. I know it sounds funny and it is, but I don't see the killing of people as necessary. Third, Leon acts as Superman, jumping on the train and fighting with Vinnie Jones, who was much higher and bigger in stature. Then again, when he faces the conductor, he does nothing and looks like a glance and looks at all the abominations. I mean OK, the conductor had ghastly help (lol), but if Leon was so brave, he would have gone all the way ... I mean he risks his life first, so don't do anything exactly when he needs to. He could have died like a hero, but live like a coward ... this may be the case, but not after showing so much courage earlier ... Then comes the police ... This was a city that has a subway, I bet there must have been other police, except that lady, other police stations, it was really kind of stupid ... All in all, great plays by Vinnie Jones, interesting idea up to the foundation behind what is not built at all. .. By the way, what does the signs on the chest mean? Vinnie Jones can't handle the rest ...
