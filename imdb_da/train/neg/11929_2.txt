I had seen "The Eye" before I saw this. I really liked "The Eye", it was one of the best movies from the latest Asian horror movie theater. So I chose this "Bangkok haunted" because it was the same instructor and it was a bit popular here. But man, what a disappointment ... "Bangkok haunted" are three stories of love, revenge, ghosts etc. There is no scary at all, not even disturbing (like "the eye" was) ... nothing. I can't even fill out the 10 lines required for the comment ... <br /> <br /> 100% boring. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 2/10
