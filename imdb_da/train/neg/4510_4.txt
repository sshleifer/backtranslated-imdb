I love Memoirs of a Geisha, so I read the book twice; It's one of the best book I've read last year. I was looking forward to the film and was afraid that reading the book would ruin the movie's enjoyment. I didn't expect the movie to be so bad. Some of the best part of the book was left out of the movie, and the characters were weak with Hatsumomo (Li Gong) getting worse. If I didn't read the book, this movie would be a bit confusing and inexplicable. The plot chart of the film says "Nitta Sayuri reveals how she surpassed her fishing ..." See someone how or when Sayuri became Nitta Sayuri? Forget the movie and read the book.
