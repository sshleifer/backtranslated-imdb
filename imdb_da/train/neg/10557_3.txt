It is a horrible little production that is suitable for giving a nightmare and headache. It's a nasty mix of live action and nasty stop-motion animation. It's weird, but it's not the kind of fun, weird ride that anyone could expect optimally. It is the cold, inhuman, unfriendly, morbid, even creepy kind of strange. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. After all, Disney did a fantastic job with the same source material. And Cosgrove-Hall did far more attractive things with stop-motion. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, this is a French production. As such, it repeats the stereotype that the French have no concept of scary.
