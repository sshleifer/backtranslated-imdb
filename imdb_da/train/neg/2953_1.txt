These reviews claiming this movie are so bad that it goes well with one. This movie does not have the guilty joy that Leonard Part 6, Battlefield Earth and Gigli had. These films were entertaining in their horror, but this pile of dinosaur death is so bad that it is painful. I have not been in this very pain to see a bad movie since I looked at baby geniuses and superbabies. Before I begin the review, let me tell you the story. Theodore Rex is a $ 35 million bust The New Line Cinema refused to enter the theaters. They reduce the losses that send it directly to video, making it the most expensive movie in video for decades. Whoopi caved in to be in this disaster after a huge paycheck. <br /> <br /> Plot: A millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can launch missiles in the sun that would kill humanity and start another ice age. A female politician named Katie Coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named Theodore Rex reluctantly pulls up to stop him after the death of a buddy dinosaur. <br /> <br /> The reason is given to you at the beginning of the movie, which rob movie of all its mystery. Then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful. Whoopi looks agitated and tries to wing it with her performance but to no avail. Theodore Rex is flat out annoying and his bumbling behavior is thin after five minutes on the screen. Most jokes are about him and threaten to bite people and hit people with the tail (by accident and on purpose). I thought Burglar was bad, but it takes a back seat for Theodore Rex: the worst movie of Whoopi's career. Don't let anyone tell you that this monstrosity is bad enough to be fun. I didn't see it when I watched this movie. All I saw was a train wreck written by people who may have had some ill admiration for the movie Howard The Duck. The humor is at this level, and Theodore Rex looks like Barney's inbred cousin. Completely painful from start to finish.
