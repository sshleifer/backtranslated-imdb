I really can't think of anything good to say about this movie ... not a single thing. Scripture is a nightmare. The author blurs the line between chemical and biological traits and does not seem to understand the difference. You would think they would at least get a technical advisor. The performances were bad by most of the players ... even though I don't really owe them .. the material really stinks. The editing was just as bad .. I just want to stop now .. it's all bad 2/10
