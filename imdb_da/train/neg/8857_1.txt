This movie is really bad, so bad that even Christopher Lee can't save it. A bad story, an even poorer script and simply poor direction make this a truly outstanding horror movie, the unique part is that it's the only horror movie I can honestly say I would never ever see again. This waste makes Plan nine from the edge to look like oscar material.
