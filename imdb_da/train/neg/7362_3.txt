An average TV movie quality, complete formal story of religious fanatic (Ron Perlman, who gives good "I'm not just president of 'Psychos R Us', I'm also a client.') Giving control of a biochemical virus (think the virus from the movie "The Rock". Too bad for him that he is also stuck in a bank building during an earthquake with bank robbers and government agents trying to stop him (led by the impressive physical, mildly entertaining Wolf Larson, backed by Fred Dryer) together with the standard "in the wrong place at the wrong time" spunky woman (Erika Eleniak forever gentle) and "lived like a wimp but died like a very last minute" man (Brandon Karrer). Has standard background story to sympathize with it religious fanatics (wife and son who were killed in a police attack a few years earlier). <br /> <br /> Basically a decent rainy movie. <br /> <br /> Favorite line spoken by Ron Perlman after that he has found vials seen by the virus hidden in Erika Eleniak's division: "A woman and her mystery. "<br /> <br /> Worth renting.
