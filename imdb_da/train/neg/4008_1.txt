As a fan of the Sookie Stackhouse books, I find this series to be a complete crass representation of them. Vampire Bill is not very nice and looks much older than described in the book. I found out that they have already made wonderful colorful characters that seem very obvious and vulgar. One of the things I loved about the books is that, despite all the shit she goes through Sookie, it's always a lady, and in the television series she doesn't look at all. Not only that, but the prejudices that appear in the TV series are not so widely spread in the books. I don't expect an exact copy of the books, but at least I expected them to be used for the series.
