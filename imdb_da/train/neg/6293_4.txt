I had the pleasure of watching this movie early and I have to say that I thought it would be boring and wondering how could they ever improve on the 1984 version of the Bachelor Party starring Tom Hanks as I thought it was pretty good ... I was right ... Frankly, I thought it might have been better ... Of course there were some fun moments, but it just didn't seem to hit the mark with me ... The play was ok and the story pretty well follows the original, but i think it could have been so much better ... This movie I would say is for teens and the young at heart; full of female bodies, alcohol and sex ... It's just another typical run of the mill party movie that has been done over and over again. 4/10 is my vote for this.
