You have to admire Brad Sykes, even if you don't want to, especially a man who fights for budget fright after budget fear for less than enthusiastic receptions. But continue to do the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood movie is brave and I am so guilty of it as anyone. Brad usually manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a nice idea, a boiling character, regardless, but without the means to take it beyond the base level, he trusts the audience to cut him a little lax and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives an exciting and very fun performance as Ebenezer Jackson and it is a credit to Sykes that he can feel that this oddball tour must work within the framework of the movie. Comes to a multiplex near you, in a parallel universe, somewhere.
