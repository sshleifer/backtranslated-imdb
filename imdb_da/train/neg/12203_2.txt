I think it is time for John Rambo to continue his life and try to put Vietnam behind. This series is getting old, and Rambo is no longer a solid but a cold-blooded killer. Every time he turns up on the screen, someone dies. Vietnam was not a fun place to be and frankly I'm tired of Hollywood, which makes it seem like it was. This is not the worst of the films about Vietnam, the honor goes to John Waynes Green Berets. In any case, John Rambo carries about a 50 cal Machine Gun that takes on what appears to be half of the Viet Cong army, plus a lot of Russians are an insult to see. What's worse is the Rambos cheesy talk at the end ... Please !! Oh yes I heard they are doing another ...
