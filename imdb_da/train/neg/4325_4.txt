The second in the Vacation series is easily the least pleasant as Clark Griswold wins a trip to the whole family to Europe. The tasteless, under belt humor that worked so well for the first time, is practically non-existent here. This error certainly falls with Director Hackerling, who apparently is not as close as a director like Harold Ramis and a very uninspiring script that only has a handful of decent lines scattered around. The cast does what they can; Chevy Chase injects some form of life into the case, but it is simply not enough, and the very funny Eric Idle is wasted in a small role as a very unlucky Englishman. Some potentially hilarious moments are not played to their full potential and leave the viewer mostly worse. All depictions of Europeans are one-dimensional and almost non-universally fun (like how English is SOOO polite). <br /> <br /> Apart from a few scenes, there is hardly a laugh in sight and the end turns this into a complete slapstick. But if you are a Chevy Chase fan (like myself), the movie can be seen, but no more than that.
