I really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie, but wow, it was corny, or should I say, "just stupid." This is just another example of outdated humor. It could have been fun in 1940, but not now .... not even close. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell is always interesting to see. I especially liked him when he started shifting from his boyish look and high voice from the Busby Berkeley musicals to where he is mature and sounds too. <br /> <br /> He was fine as "Jimmy MacDonald", but the rest of the cast just played stupid characters, the worst was the boss (Raymond Walburn) of Maxford House Coffee Company who just shouted all the time. He was brutal to hear and was a great damage to the movie.
