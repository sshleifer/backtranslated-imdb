The fact that this movie did it all the way to the rental ground in Norway is bizarre. This movie is just awful. This picture quality is only a teeny bit better than you get from a cell phone, and the plot is sooo bad. The main character is simply annoying and the rest just sucks. Any person associated with this movie should be ashamed. The fact that the people who made this movie put their name on this is extraordinary. And the distributors; So they even! This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Noticing this is a comedy an insult to humanity. I encourage you not to support this movie by buying or renting it.
