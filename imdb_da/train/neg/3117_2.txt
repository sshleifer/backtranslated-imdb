My husband is a great Robin Williams fan. I also like him but have generally found that he should "stick to what he does best" and focus on comic roles. My thoughts were confirmed with this movie. I was totally upset about the whole movie. The story was predictable. I realize it was inspired by a true story. But my guess is that there might have been some excitement or intrigue, even if one maintains the truth of the story. None of the signs were well developed. There was a side story about the protagonist and his partner. This relationship could have been explored further. But, more importantly, would have been a deeper exploration of the mother of the "boy". Her psychological profile would have been interesting to dive in. Of course, she has a long story that was not touched, except in the most superficial way. If my husband wasn't such a big Williams fan, we would have left 20 minutes into it. Too bad I can't get my $ 20 or 2 hours back.
