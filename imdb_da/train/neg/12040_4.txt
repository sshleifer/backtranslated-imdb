I know nothing of the Iliad, so I cannot comment on the accuracy of that story. But as an independent film I found it very boring. The battle scenes were trying to be big and spectacular, but they were just obvious CGI. <br /> <br /> The action is bad and undoubtedly Brad Pitt was thrown just to attract the ladies. But he doesn't make a good warrior, too beautiful, I'm scared. <br /> <br /> Good points are designed. This movie looks great with the scenery and the citizens' buildings / walls impressive. I like a movie that at least tries to get the characters accents true, but this movie just seems to ignore it altogether. We hear American, Scottish English anything but what you might expect for a film about an ancient Eastern civilization. All in all, I do not recommend this movie to a family sitting down. It's too long, and the young ones will be bored. <br /> <br /> For adults it is OK if you don't care about the lack of realism.
