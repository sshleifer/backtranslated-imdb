Wow, I've just finally managed, after several attempts, to finish watching this god's horrible movie, only to learn that Rick Sloane and his production team have completed a straight-to-video sequel this year. <br /> <br /> Of all the movies reviewed by MST3K - and they really dig from the bottom of the barrel and screen the reputable bad 'Manos',' Werewolf ',' The Incredibly Strange 'and the lesser known disasters like' Laserblast ',' Zombie Nightmare '' and 'Time Chasers' - this must surely be the absolute biggest pile of waste they had ever shown (making it perfect for riffing). Very simply, the movie deals with a bunch of Munchies-like gremlines in the easiest way that exploits people's desires for fame, fortune, skill and, of course, sex in ways that stop being killed. But that's the kind of movie where the play is so ridiculous (a test of machismo, for example, is illustrated by two guys fighting in the front yard with garden tools), the writing is so compulsory (as the often described scene of a gremlin hanging on the arm of A girl who wanted to notice it if only she turned her head quarter to the left ... and this is not the first time in the movie this happens), and the story is so ... rarely noticed (hence the MST3K reef about a "Law in the future where movies by FILMmakers are to be made, that you actually encounter the frantic dolls to kill everyone on the screen. Worst movie ... ever.
