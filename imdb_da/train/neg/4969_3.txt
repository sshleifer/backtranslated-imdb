First, it is not as near as bad as any of the other waste Sci-Fi Channel has produced; That's not to say that Grendel is a good movie, it's actually very bad, but it certainly has the potential to be much better. The film's shortcomings come from character design, character, absurd additions to the story, the visual effects, the music and mostly: the actor. When I talk about design, of course, the way our heroes and villains look. Beowulf and the other Danes seem like ridiculous Vikings, rather than fighters of brutal strength - the helmet our main character carries is just too stupid. Grendel looks like the Hulk, but with strange Tentacle attachments to the elbows. <br /> <br /> The characters are very limited. Beowulf is the same from the beginning to the end, but Finn - a useless sidekick - achieved some two-dimensionality, thanks to his romantic subplot, and Unferth also gets some ideas when he becomes less imagined. <br /> <br /> Like Finn, there are useless additions to this story to make it its own while still holding the source material. Armbue gifted to Beowulf is so ridiculous I am surprised that the throw did not go away from the set. Besides additions, there are omissions like the underlying themes of Christianity and paganism, as well as the consequences of lying. <br /> <br /> The special effects are mighty terrible. Grendel and his mother Hag are poorly conceived, and as such their portrayal on the screen is less than credible. <br /> <br /> The music is overbearing, especially when a character dies. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is not Sci-Fi's worst movie to date. No. It is actually one of the better movies, but it is still bad, it is a good garbage, which makes it a guilty pleasure at best. The only thing that works is the dialogue that is still wood here and there. <br /> <br /> I recommend you skip this movie and watch Robert Zemeckis' take on the old story of Beowulf, simply because this movie (Grendel) is only half the story and not everything gives this movie a three star review.
