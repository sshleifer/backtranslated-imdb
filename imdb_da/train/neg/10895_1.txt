I've seen many bad movies. Most of the time I can enjoy a crazy horror movie for what it is. But it requires real evil for new extremes. It's boring, plotted for what it never goes right, anywhere and takes its time over it. There is no shock, no horror, no excitement, just a lot of guys rubbing for an hour and a half and then a quick finish. <br /> <br /> A shake of the crappy horror genre, avoid at all costs. <br /> <br />
