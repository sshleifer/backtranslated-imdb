The idea is to get something interesting to happen in the first ten minutes to keep the audience hooked. Late Night Shopping manages to avoid interest for much longer than that. When we get to a point, it is so monumentally moronic that I continued to think I must have misunderstood it. But I did not. <br /> <br /> Sean tells the story of an Osaka landlord who rented the same apartment to two people at the same time, who worked differently and then didn't realize they shared. His friend asks, "But what about the weekends?" Sean does not have a sufficient explanation. Sean tells the story of his own similar problem, which is that he is not sure that his girlfriend is still at home when he works at night and she works during the day so they never see each other. This has been going on for three weeks. But his friend does not ask, "Yes, but as I said before, what about the weekends? You must see her so. It makes no sense. What are you doing, Sean? But let's be generous and assume they both work seven days a week. <br /> <br /> We see Sean checking to see if soap and towels have been used. (In fact, he begins to carry soap with him.) But what about his girlfriend balm and shampoo, sanpro and moisturizer, toothpaste and toothbrush. Let's go to the kitchen. What about food and drink? Is there something missing? Have you bought anything? In the bedroom is the common bed made or not? Has her clothes been used and exchanged for clean? Is the laundry basket fuller? On the toilet is the seat up or down? I mean, good grief! <br /> <br /> And to do it all, Paul arranges to leave work early to see if his girlfriend still lives at home. Why doesn't he just call her? <br /> <br /> But it gets worse. In the last act, though no one told Vincent where the rest of the group goes, he manages to find them. Lenny's love interest and Sean's girlfriend seem to be best friends and also manage to find the group. There is not even the slightest attempt to explain any of these exceptionally improbable coincidences. To be fair, the dialogue is OK, but not as good enough to make up for the weak signs or annoying throat history. <br /> <br /> I heard one of the players interviewing and he promised "no weapons, no drugs, no corsets." I thought "great". But after half an hour of tedium I shouted on the screen: "I want guns! I want drugs! I want corsets!" <br /> <br /> Sorting these problems would not have cost much, but on the official website, the director trusts that the movie was not script edited. That's all you need to know.
