I agree with the previous comment, the beginning of the movie is quite good and you get to walk on what to come ....... It's nothing. All open stories remain open; Two characters that initially seemed to be of some importance are completely omitted from the image, saving for 1 or 2 very short scenes. I wander if Ilya wouldn't have done better to just leave them. As for the remaining character, there is nothing with her either. She just visits some godly place, and suddenly the film is no longer about her, but about some geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls out of bread, drinking homemade vodka and apparently flashing each other. Some may say that the movie does well to show a society that crumbles, like the judges of the IFFR, but for me it's just bad taste, poor camera work, a miserable script and scary bad direction. Therefore, I cannot be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to characterization: 1!
