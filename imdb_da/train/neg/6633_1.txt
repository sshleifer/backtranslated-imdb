Where to start? How best to describe just how horrible this movie is ??? <br /> <br /> Let's start with campy hick humor. It's not much fun. Add a bunch of musicians to imitate the actors - The onion is terrible and Deborah Harry is even worse. Pity poor Art Carney, who should have known better than making this movie. <br /> <br /> And then there's the plot. A roadie whose life goal is to work on an Alice Cooper show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a Alice Cooper group. At least they get what they want ... <br /> <br /> And then, when the movie ends, they can't come up with a more plausible last scene than a - well, I don't wanna ruin it is for you if you really want to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> There are some actors who tell you that this will be a "B" movie or maybe worse. Gailard Sartain is one of them for me - and he has a more prominent role. It is a sure sign that the film is unlikely to be very good. If nothing else, the film lives up to the low expectations - even exceeding them by being worse than the poor. Let's just say this. This is the movie that all bad movies compare to. And no one is worse than Roadie.
