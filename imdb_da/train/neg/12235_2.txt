If you want to know what kind of music white people listened to in 1974, this is the movie for you. But you also have to listen to many flutes and violins (see my comments on my girl 1 for reference). Congratulations on admission: I approached my girl 2 with cynicism and irritation, just seen her predecessor. But as an adoptee prepared me to finally search for my birth mother, My Girl 2 made me see, with her theme of searching for mother. <br /> <br /> Put another way I liked about my girl 2 had nothing to do with my girl 2 at all, but relates to a protagonist asking who so many adoptees, "who is my mother "? And if there are home movies from my mother in a play, I'll be sure to make my own movie about it. People are listless. Movies should not be blunt. My girl 2 (like my girl 1) is just ... listless. Avoid unless you are a complete sap that is comforted by a number of small irritations.
