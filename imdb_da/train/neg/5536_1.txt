Zombies rebellion has no redeeming features. I'm tired of people claiming it's not that bad, and that the effects have to be packed more of a blow in 1936. I suppose that's not true: It's not like IQ has risen sharply in the last 7 decades. The average viewer in 1936 was probably as bored with this nonsense as the average viewer today. Why? Just try to see the first scenes, and count the pause between things that happen, the horrible choice of when to cut up close-up, the slapdash editing that seems to contain another two seconds on each shot to polish out the maturity. Pay attention to the completely redundant dialogue: "I have to make tea / go outside / read my book now." "Are you?" "Yes I am." This kind of exchange happens several times. Normally I would love it, be a huge fan of bad movies, but watch the listless actors mumble their tired and boring lines, and all the desire to laugh at the movie slowly disappears. This kind of uninterested, boiling hour-waster is far worse than energetic, imaginative mind-blowers like Plan Nine From Outer Space or Santa Claus overcoming the Martians. Those who claim that this is "better" than the more interesting films have a backward idea of ​​entertainment. This movie is not bad in the sense that your jaw hangs in astonishment: it is bad in the sense that your eyes are slowly closing in boredom. It is far worse.
