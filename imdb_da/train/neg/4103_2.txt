This movie had an IMDB rating of 8.1, so I expected much more of it. It starts with fun and endearing with an energy that feels spontaneous. But before the film is halfway through, it begins to pull and everything becomes morbidly predictable. The characters in the office were lovely in the first third of the movie, but we know them a little too well; They become caricatures, not real people at all. This is the same story I've seen hundreds of times, only told here with slightly different circumstances. The thing is, I could stomach another predictable love story if only the dialogue wasn't so old! <br /> <br /> The only thing that could be worse is if the characters had inconsistent and incredible motives, and unfortunately that was also the case with Dead Letter Office. Hopefully this movie will end in Dead Movie Office soon.
