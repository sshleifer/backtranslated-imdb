This is one of the worst movies ever made. Banal. Predictable. Flat. <br /> <br /> The only thing that considered a point was that there were a few great scenes that highlighted Barcelona. I imagine they would use movies like this in Guantanamo or another hidden CIA / NSA prison to torture suspects. <br /> <br /> Often, bad movies have some redeeming features, it has nothing. If I were in it or worked on it, I would change my name. Really a turd. It's hard to write more than this, but I feel that the world's film guards need a head on this. On the other hand, it will make a good gift for people you can't stand. <br /> <br /> You can send it to politicians you don't like, in laws, ex-wives, teachers you hated, former employees, Dick Cheney, W., and a variety of others.
