There has been a fashion in recent years for often-as-non-ironic zombie-related films as well as other media incarnations of the fleshly resurrected dead. "Fido" is a movie that is either an attempt to redeem it, just a manifestation of it, or both - and it falls entirely into the category of ironic zombies. The wit here is that we see the walking dead in the contrasting context of a broad stereotypical, creaking, clean, alternative story (we are in the wake of a great zombie war, and the creatures now become domesticated as slaves) version of a 1950's suburb . <br /> <br /> It's a moderately fun concept alone and enough for a five minute comedy sketch, but it can't hold a movie alone. The wit that rotting for servants is inconsistent with this idealized version of a small town is repeated over and over and loses all efficiency. The soundtrack effortlessly plays sunny tunes while zombies cannibalize spectators. The word "zombie" is constantly inserted into an otherwise familiar homely line for a cheap attempt to laugh. <br /> <br /> The breadth and artificiality of the "nineteen twenty-five" representation here cannot help but annoy me. It is so stylized, it is obviously "Pleasantville" inspired that it is more obvious to win markers from the 1950s around than actually looks like anything that could have happened between 1950 and 1959. There is something unpleasant creeping about It's as if the movie is emptying emptily and thoughtlessly about how more open, down to earth and superior the 2000s are. <br /> <br /> Because the characters are so broad representations of the pop culture 1950s "types", it is difficult to develop very emotional investments in them. Each has few traits cast on him or her - Helen is obsessed with performances, and Bill loves golf and his haunted by having to kill his father - but they remain quite two-dimensional. Performances within this bad writing are fine. The best is Billy Connolly as Fido zombie, who in the tradition of Boris Karloff in "Frankenstein" actually gives character and sympathy to a logging green monster who cannot speak. <br /> <br /> There are tiny pieces of unbridled allegory thrown around - for commodity fetishism, racism, classism, war paranoia, etc., but none really works at an extensive level and the filmmakers don; Don't really stick to anything. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie doesn't really come by with the flimsy joke of "Look! Zombies in" Leave it to Beaver! "for a good hour and a half.
