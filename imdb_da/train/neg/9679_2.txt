This movie was horrible in the worst way: you just didn't care. You didn't care what happened in the plot; You didn't care about the signs. Everyone was devoid of heart. I ended up going out about 45 minutes into it because I simply didn't want to submit my mind to it anymore. There is too much sex in the movie. Sex can be okay; It can even make the movie (thus Karma Sutra), but sexual intercourse here was not beautiful or sexy. It was just ugly. Don't watch this movie.
