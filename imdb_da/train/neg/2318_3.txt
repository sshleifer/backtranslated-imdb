Kid found as a baby in the garbage and raised on a martial arts academy has an ability to sink baskets. With the help of the man who found him, he enters college and is promoted to the championship when he searches for his real parents. Infinitely better in action action comedy is a true mess as a whole. It looks like striving for a hipper basketball version of Shaolin Soccer, but the comedy is the scatter shot, its focus wandering more than a Chihuahua with ADD on quadruple espresso. I kept asking "What am I watching". I saw it from start to finish, and I still don't know what the hell happened. It's a shame as there are some great action scenes, some funny jokes and occasionally the moment, but nothing, none of it comes together, I want to take a passport.
