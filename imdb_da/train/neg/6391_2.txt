Hg is usually useful and it has never bothered me before - I loved "bloodfeast 2", but I really do not like pseudoscience or play on heuristics. The whole movie is based on a man with esp caused by an electric accident and a witch. I'm not against witches, and I liked "carrie" (the novel and the movie), but this disturbed me. I think it's because of the protagonist who develops esp from an electrical line. also university professor wasting her time studying esp cases. I didn't live in the 60s to know first hand whether esp was a common mistake, but I suppose any theory of such kind would simply be discredited. What really disturbed me was the way the police described schizophrenia as ruthless, unpredictable villains that might seem like normal people 99% of the time and then just snap. nothing could be further from the truth. I detest such concepts because they add to the public idioci. Many people still believe that schizophrenia is a dissociative identity disorder. who wrote this script did not know much about psychology. <br /> <br /> There were some decent concepts for the movie. I liked the way the witch used men; It was a nice change. I liked how she could make herself attractive, but did not do when she was around her forced lovers. I found it interesting how her other lover also burned her face. Had the script been touched up for a few weeks before production and not focused solely on making the audience stupid, this may have been a decent movie.
