I ended up watching this movie before even reviewing any of the reviews at the request of a woman. Just out of curiosity I thought, let me find out if there are people who actually recommend others to watch this movie. I am very shocked to find such long and positive reviews on this site, which makes me conclude that it is a scam. <br /> <br /> As far as my opinion goes, I have to ask, "Are these filmmakers retarded or do they assume viewers are retarded?" The movie is horrible at so many levels, and I'm not even talking about the story or presentation. <br /> <br /> Then these bunch of guys plus a girl (the leading actress) make up a band; guess from the constant presence of guitars, it should be a rock band. Hell, when did the dancers begin to become part of a rock band ??? Anyway, let me accept it as a Bollywood version-of-a-rock band, but entertaining enough all the scores that actually had these two guitarists, do all sorts of cool "ROCK GESTURES" and I assume they played instruments, the sound of the guitar was completely missed !!! I simply can't understand the amount of stupidity here .... <br /> I just have to conclude here because it is definitely not worth pointing out further flaws in the movie. Bollywood directors don't seem to have any shame anymore !!!!!!!!
