This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I'm still not sure if it was serious, or just a satire. One of the movies that uses all the stupid ones that dunnit clich√© they can think of. Arrrrgh. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson was pretty good at it actually. But otherwise it sucked. It was over 10 years ago that I saw it, but it still hurts and will not stop lingering in my brain. <br /> <br /> The last line of the movie really sums up how stupid it is. I won't ruin it for you if you want to tempt fate by watching this movie. But I guarantee you a * nghya * moment in the end, with a couple in between. If you have nothing better to do and you like to point and laugh then maybe it is worth it. If you are forced to go on a date with someone you really do not like, you also suggest watching this movie together and they will probably leave you alone when they see it. It is a reasonable price to pay, I think.
