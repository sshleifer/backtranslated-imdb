I just watched this horrible thing on TV. Needless to say, it is one of the movies you just see to see how much worse it can get. Frankly, I don't know how much lower the rod can go. <br /> <br /> The characters are composed of a lame stereotype after another, and the obvious attempt to create another "Bad News Bears" is embarrassing to say the least. <br /> <br /> I have seen some prized turkeys in my time, but there is no reason to list any of them as this is "Numero Uno". <br /> <br /> Let me tell you the way I looked at Vanilla's ice cream film because it was so bad it was fun. This ... this ... is NOT as good.
