This warning against anti-Semitism is well-designed and may have had its purpose at that time, but it is made without the slightest notion of how to make a movie. The director has no idea about the mise-one scene; The throw varies from bad to worse. The great Austrian cartoon Hans Moser is wasted. In his part he joins in an asylum for the insane who is designed as a set from Das Kabinett des Dr. Caligari; One wonders if the decision makers had all their mental abilities. The restored copy I saw (Dutch Film Museum) gives the impression that some scenes were not put in the right place, but perhaps the original editing is bad as well.
