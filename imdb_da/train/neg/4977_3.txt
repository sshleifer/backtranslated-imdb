This is a television made for television and a rather unnecessary Sci-Fi channel story of the Beowulf story, especially after the latest 2005 film "Beowulf and Grendel". This movie does not really come into Beowulf's history, but only takes us through his struggle against the ravening animal known as Grendel, as it leaves a realm of absolute fear and turmoil while the powerful Viking warrior Beowulf is called upon to free them from monsters rampage. If this happens successfully, the king must no longer sacrifice the children to keep it in check. After a couple of unsuccessful attempts, the creature is beaten, but it is angry and upset that mom will soon attack, leaving it to Beowulf to once again lend his mighty acts of courage and strength to defeat it. "Grendel" seems to have been shot on a small budget, and the CG effects are terrible. As I said, this movie is absolutely superfluous.
