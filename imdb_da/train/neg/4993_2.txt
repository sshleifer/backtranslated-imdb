Went to see this movie expecting a 'not very much' action flick, was still very disappointed. The opening scene promised a little action with a fate of comedy. It keeps you hooked for the first half coz until you expect it is time for the action to kick in. Well, nothing of this kind happens. The movie pulls and the end just beats you down to a point where you get annoyed. What did the instructor think of? Didn't make any sense at all. The film was lacking in all aspects, had no real story and it seemed very hollow, though "Rambo" was in it, I don't think he could have helped the rating at all. There is simply no logic on the film. A perfect way to waste your time and money. By far the most annoying movie I've ever seen, and I'm sure there will be others who want the same point of view after having it. Definitely not for people who have a little movie feeling back in them.
