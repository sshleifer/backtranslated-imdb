The story is seen earlier, but it doesn't matter if you can find out how to make a proper storyboard. It is clear that the director has not used his work on the storyboard. Next to this, the cameraman used too much time for angular angles that did not match the film's message. The funniest thing is, if you look at the film's website, you can read that it was on purpose that the director chose to make the film with bad camera angles. Because it reminds us of hunting. But I have never heard of hunting with bad camera angles ;-) It will have 1 stars because the story is ok. It's a shame that Ti West hasn't spent more time reviewing his story. It's as if the movie was more important than planning. Because you have a camera, it doesn't mean you have to make a movie right away ... come on. Everyone can make a movie, but not everyone will be as good. So the advice to Ti West is: stop and label what you want. Use your time to start planning and not filming until everything is down on a storyboard. You have determined the ability and desire - so do not abuse your talent.
