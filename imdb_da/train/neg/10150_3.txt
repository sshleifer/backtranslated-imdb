Humphrey Bogart would obviously not be in this movie and be forced to play part-Mexican, or he would have been suspended. Believe me, he made the wrong choice! Probably, after the success of "Dodge City", Warners tried a follow-up with Errol Flynn and his usual list of friends, such as Alan Hale, Guinn (Big Boy) Williams, Frank Mc Hugh, and the ever-present John Litel, but they did the great mistakes by trying to present Miriam Hopkins as a love interest for Flynn v. Randolph Scott, and as a singer to really do things badly because she appeared one thing, and she can't sing. The story was not that bad, but with Bogie clearly disregarded, it turned out to be a poor western who was long and on a low budget, but in fairness color would not have helped.
