While I was flying through the canals on a late Saturday night, my friends and I stumbled upon this movie. First of all, Irish actor Pierce Brosnan as Indians? Seriously?! His accent was breaking through so much, though his character was apparently Scottish. Then I was stunned to find out that this movie was made after he had already played James Bond / Agent 007 at least twice. This movie plays up the stereotypes with the inspirational professor figure. The girl who played the pony must be paid to keep her mouth closed. And this movie won a prize? I can not believe it. Brosnan is an attractive man, but we seriously wanted to measure our eyes after seeing this for just 10 seconds. We switched from "Kicking and Screaming" to this and we wanted to switch back. In 1995 we saw the children's classic "The Indian in the Cabinet" earlier in the night, which also discussed Iroquois. The following line represents our desire to run away: "Take me outside, the ground lawn." From "Gray Owl": "If you don't like it, you don't have to look."
