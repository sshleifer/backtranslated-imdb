What * is it with this movie? Couldn't they get a better script? All in all, a "nice" movie, but ... it's been done more than once ... Up to the end I thought it was okay, but ... to go back to the last part ... * barf * So corny ... waiting for the fairy god mother to show up ... but wow, that didn't happen ... which is good. <br /> <br /> I loved Big with Tom Hanks, but to see such a movie in a new form with another child who wanted him / her older / bigger; It's just as good. <br /> <br /> Just make sure it comes out on TV. Don't make me wrong, but that's not all
