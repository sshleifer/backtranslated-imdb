On a vacation at the beach, the red-haired brothers Michael McGreevey and Billy Mumy (like Arthur and Petey Loomis) will find a seal. The boys die their critter "Sammy" and spend the summer with the sandy sea lion. When it's time to go home, the boys begin to suffer separation anxiety. Young Mr. McGreevey decides they can't take "Sammy" back to "Disneyland" ?? is, "Gatesville" - but young Mr. Mumy packs him anyway. At home, they try to hide "The Way-out Seal" from adults, and of course? hijacks ensue! <br /> <br /> **** Sammy - The Way-out Seal, pt 1 (10/28/62) Norman Tokar ~ Michael McGreevey, Bill Mumy, Robert Culp
