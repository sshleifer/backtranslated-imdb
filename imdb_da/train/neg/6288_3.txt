Having read many of the comments here, I am surprised that no one has acknowledged this as basically a prolonged remake of a 1960's Twilight Zone episode called "Mirror Image" starring Vera Miles. Rod Serling did a much better job creating an effective scary story in 24 minutes than Sean Ellis did for 88 minutes with this boring snooze. A short piece can be effective with a mysterious and inexplicable ending, but in a feature film there should be a little more substance and history must make sense. Unfortunately, fabric and sense are two things missing from "The Broken." Yes, it has a few moments, but they are not enough to justify your time. Some additional observations: Although this is clearly a modern story, not a character in the movie has a cell phone! And even if a car accident is the event that makes the story go, there is never any reference to an insurance company, the person driving the other car or to the police, who would have been required to make a report. My advice: skip this bore and see the original instead!
