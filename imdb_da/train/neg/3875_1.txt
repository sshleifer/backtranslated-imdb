I've seen many stupid plotlines in my time, but this one is among the worst. After catching a disease in space, an astronaut returns to earth and begins to melt. He then goes on a rampage and kills people (how is it going to me, I'm just looking at them, I can't explain them.) This is the kind of movie that shouldn't have been made in the first place.
