In line with Disney's well-known practice of stealing .. I mean ... to buy well-known properties and to bastard them. This live-action version of the venerable cartoon classic has to be one of the worst re-makes in a year of bad re-brands. I grew up in the original comic TV series. Any episode of the original cartoon series will make you laugh more than this entire movie. Not present is Penny's cool computer book. Also not present are gag with self-destructing orders that always end up detonating on the boss. New is a smooth speaker The gadget convertible (the original cartoon had a cooler vehicle that could become a van or a car) and an element of a typical, unrealistic Hollywood romance. Don't fill the trunks to pay for Disney executives and even their _ex_executives - don't see this movie. <br /> <br />
