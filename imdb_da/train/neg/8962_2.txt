I think this sucked on ice because it left the dice and gave us a lot of information about who and why. The original CUBE never left the cube, and it left everything to your imagination. This crap party, however, gives you everything. and I did not like it ... Although the play is solid, I think this one was a downer because it was done by other people than the original filmmakers, if they had Vincenzo Natali do this prequel or even successor I think it would have done better and would have been more true to the source. so I recommend that you stay far away from this and HYPERCUBE, another movie, I don't even want to discuss ... (I gave it a 2 to act only)
