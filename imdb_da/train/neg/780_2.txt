This show is terrible. How does George feel like his mother's fun of death? This show is terrible. Of course, the parents are terrible and the children should be taken to child care. The daughter is a witch with a b, and the son is just a complete brat. George is not funny, especially when he speaks his big and unpleasant brand Spanglish. Ernie is a loser, but at least I have chuckled on him a few times, but primarily on how pathetic he is. George's mother, Benny, in a horrible, despicable nature. Yes, her husband left her, but how someone can laugh at the way she treated George as a baby is beyond me. Can anyone explain to me how George's head is big, is fun? It's not even that great! I have moved from characters because they are terrible and it would take hours for me to write and I honestly don't care. I don't care enough to tell anyone who is watching this and wondering if they will see this show that this show is an unfortunate excuse for a sitcom and it's not worth your time. <br /> <br /> I give it start 2 because the wife is extremely attractive.
