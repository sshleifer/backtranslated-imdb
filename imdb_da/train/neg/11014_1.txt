This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. This says quite a bit, considering some of the choices I made in movie rentals. <br /> <br /> I got this on netflix based solely on the fact that somebody I attended high school is topless in it. The Topless scene lasted about 5 seconds, and the rest of the movie was almost as fun to have punk-sticks run under my toenails as they were forced to listen to Roseanne's singing Big Spender. <br /> <br /> "The sketches" are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile bathroom humor and locker-room gags, and it's such a blatant (and poor) rip-off of The Kentucky Fried Movie as you like beg for Big Jim Slade to collide through the wall and rescue us from the stupidity of "Vince Offer" (who it is). <br /> <br /> Unless you are a masochist, avoid this pile of waste.
