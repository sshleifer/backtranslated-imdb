I love cheesy horror flicks. I don't care if the play is underpair or if monsters look corny. I liked this movie apart from the confused feeling right from the beginning of the movie to the very end. Look, I don't need a 10-page thesis or a capital letter that explains a plot to me. But Dark Floors takes "what is this movie about?" things to a whole new (annoying) level. What is this movie about? <br /> <br /> This is not exceptionally scary or exciting, but if you have an hour and a half to kill and / or you will end up feeling frustrated and confused, hire this winner.
