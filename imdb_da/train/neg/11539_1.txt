This is the biggest load of crap I've seen for a long time. The last time I hated a movie so much was at the same time "28 days later" and "Magnolia". There is absolutely no meaning about this movie, except to see some really sick and winding sex / rape scenes, Gillian Anderson relieves herself on the side of the road, and every sentence in dialogue must use the "F" word at least one couple of times in it. It has extremely cheap plays and is very low budget. My friend and I eventually turned off the movie after about half an hour. We had tried to give it a try, but nothing could save this raw. DO NOT SEE IT !!!
