Visually cluttered, plot less, incredibly mind-numbing nonsense. Not even close to Greenaway's better work. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> The overlapping split screen effects do nothing but confuse, the movie is very dark for much of the time, and the 'artistic' composition of images is pretentious to the extreme. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this movie; Though nudity is incredibly unethical, as it seems to fill a large part of the movie, it quickly becomes boring. <br /> <br /> Plus, how to say that Ewen MacGregor's acting is brilliant is beyond me. He showed more ability in the Star Wars series, and that says something. <br /> <br /> I haven't been so irresistible with a movie since I saw 'Darby O'Gill and The Little People'!
