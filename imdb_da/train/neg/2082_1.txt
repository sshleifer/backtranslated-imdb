What a waste of time and money! My hubby and I saw this movie - after seeing the examples and thinking it "can be fun". WRONG! This film is about 90 minutes too long. The actors are trapped in a poorly written script and cannot get out. The jokes are weak and tired, and not even seeing Wilson's naked back can redeem any part of this movie. The special effects ..... are not. I expected half to see the harness and the wires holding Uma in her flying scenes. And as the effects people apparently couldn't control the superhero faster than a speed ball flying or giant scenes, they covered everywhere with a swirling vortex of blurred screen - which hid the horrible effects quite nicely. Wilson's sidekick was a bad excuse for a man and Wilson had no chemistry with either Uma or his office worker. The sex scenes were not sexy, and the fun scenes were not fun. I suppose I had just expected too much from these players. None of the characters were really sympathetic, so I didn't end up breaking a flying fig about any of them. The only memorable performances were the children who played Bedlam and G-Girl as teenagers - at least they had some chemistry. All in all, a super stinko movie - I won't even recommend it as a rental - it would still be a waste of money!
