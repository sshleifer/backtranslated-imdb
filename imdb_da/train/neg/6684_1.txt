This should be redirected "The Curious Case Of The Scrupulous Filmmakers Who Misrepresented A Non-Horror Strings Like A Shock Movie." It is a long, tedious tale of a fraternity, a transparency so transparent that even Delta House Flounder could see through it. Jeff East, a paying stage actor, can be forgiven for taking any work he could get. The same cannot be said for Charles Martin Smith, who previously acted for such cinematic heavyweights as George Lucas and Sam Peckinpah. Once available on tape but fortunately not out on DVD. Misrepresented waste like this belongs to a landfill and no other place.
