I skimmed through the film, but just enough to look at the plot was about. To tell the truth it was a little boring to me and on some spots it didn't make sense. The only reason I saw this movie in the first place was to see CHACE CRAWFORD !!! He is so hot, but in this movie his hair was a little strange. But it's still hot. <br /> <br /> However, despite the warmth of CHACE, it has really not mattered to the movie. I suppose the plot is not so bad, but what really threw me over was that they cried like any sentence. Is it so hard to express your anger without saying the F-word every time? Cussing was annoying and the whole flashy, camera-shaken thing gave me headaches. All in all, although the plot was OK, I found the movie to be a drill and over dramatic. Therefore, I only cut to scenes with CHACE in it. LOL Anyways, not worth renting unless your a die-hard fan of a particular cast member as I was. Oh yes, the throw was hot. The girls were HOT !!! But CHACE is the best !!
