If you like a syfi soap opera, this show is for you as a ticket that I'm worried about, it doesn't work for me, and after watching 3 episodes, I just can't see it anymore. It is boring and slow and for a show that the timeline is based about 100,000 + years ago, if you base it on battlestar galactica's timeline to get to earth, they probably seem to have all the same things as the 100,000 year old Chevy vans driving down the streets and peoples watching the 100,000-year-old popular brand LCD TVs. It also goes the same with the rest of the sets also on the show, which is just too much of today's stuff involved in not overlooking, I think they could have done much better by a job to get around these issues and yes battlestar galactica had some of the same problems but not so bad. As a ticket like the rest of the show, it's almost not as good as BSG was, and it's a bad precursor to that.
