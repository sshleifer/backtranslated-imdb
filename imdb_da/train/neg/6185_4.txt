My first review of 2010 is "Into The Blue 2: The Reef". The story is about two divers played by Chris Carmack and Laura Vandervoort who love to explore hidden treasures at the bottom of a local reef. One day after an exploration day, they are contacted by a couple played by David Anders and Marsha Thomason. They tell the young divers that they will hire them to explore the reef and find a rare artifact about Columbus' hidden treasure reported at the bottom of the reef. <br /> <br /> The next day the four dives to the bottom of the reef and roughly after a full day of diving, they find nothing. A few days earlier and the two built-in divers found out that they are part of a large deadly plot where they cannot escape otherwise, they will be killed. They were hired to find two large containers. One contains a nuclear reactor and the other contains a core. The movie also has a back story about another person (brother to the protagonist) who tries to patch things up with his girlfriend, I reckon this part of the story was a waste of time, this also includes a very steamy sex scene between the couple, as for me is a complete waste and it was not necessary to be shown. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, the movie has some good underwater photography and the colors blend well why it receives 4 stars. In Blue 2, a successor is only by name. None of the original actors or characters return, it has a stupid plot, stupid characters, and a boring climax.
