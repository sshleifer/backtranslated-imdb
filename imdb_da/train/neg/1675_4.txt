The reason probably seemed interesting enough. How can a real life-brutal murder turn into a really boring movie? Now you can see "Wonderland" and find out. <br /> <br /> I had heard of the Wonderland killings before this movie was released and found it an interesting true story of some really sadistic people. Unfortunately, there is no character development, so we never get a chance to understand why some of this was done or get a good sense of connection between the characters. The pace in the direction was very boring. All this leads to an extraordinarily boring movie. When Dawn Schiller - a key character as Holmes girlfriend - was an associate producer and that Holmes wife was a consultant on the film, we should have had the opportunity to get a real insight into the characters.
