Having been forced by my children to see this at least 10 times for each of the last 2 Christmases, I feel sufficiently qualified to comment on this version of Dr. Seuss's classic story, and it's not that good. First, after a classical act like Chuck Jones' animated television special, anyone will find it difficult, but this interpretation is so cumbersome and padded that it is positively numbered. I will admit that there is a handful of inspired gags, but in general the film comes out as a calculated cash grip, while presumably throwing away the commercialization of Christmas. Jim Carrey is typically over the top here, but it is quite contrary to the character of Grinch. As characterized by Boris Karloff, he was a slow burn; methodical and blurred. There is no method for Carrey's madness, and it is only the most obvious mistake. Talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are completely wasted here. Why, Universal, why? I understand that I understand that Tony Hopkins will take almost every role offered (like his farmer Michael Caine), but this must be submitted under "Movies that should never have been made". This doesn't sound good to the cat in the hat, an even thinner thome, which Universal prepper for Christmas. I get the feeling that I will make the same recommendation for the one I am with this one: skip it and read the book or watch the TV specifically. It's 2 hours you can never come back.
