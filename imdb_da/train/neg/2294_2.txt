Poor Paul Mercurio. Having landed the role of Scott Hastings in the Strictly Ballroom, the best movie in history, he managed to find himself making a lot of nonsense. None of the characters in this movie are very unlikely or even hateful, but Mercurio's management is the kind of person you prefer to ignore - totally unloveable and he bears OVERALLS. Big mistake in costume design, one.
