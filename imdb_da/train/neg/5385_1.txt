I don't know where to start. Cast is full of people who have never done anything before or since. Debralee Scott is listed on co-boxes, but is not shown at all in the movie. The script is pretty bad, even for college movies. It is of course very low budget, with a scene in the sorority house that has extremely choppy editing. The people are pretty typical of college movies - slut guy, nerd, suave black guy, hard guy, guy with mustache attractive girl, little town girl etc. The highlighted teacher is about what you expect ... medieval, heavy set guy who gets sidetracked easily. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a college girl, stay clear of this. It's so bad, it's not even fun.
