This is a horrible little movie - and unfortunately the company that made this card made several others. The short one is essentially a one-joke idea that wasn't fun to begin with and can also offend you. It made me definitely uncomfortable to see very young children (most seemed about 2 years old) cavorting about and pretending to be adults - in this case a dancehall girl and bar room patrons. It's the kind of humor that you might have to laugh at your own kids if they pretend to be adults, but I can't see anyone who wants to see this - especially when a very young Shirley Temple is dressed in a pretty slanky outfit and works like a vamp !! And then other children act as adults in some relatively adult situations. At that time, I was sure they didn't try to appeal to pedophiles, but when you look at it today, that's what comes to mind right away! Because of this, this boring movie also bored me and I never hope to see it again !! Beautiful strange and pretty horrible.
