If you've seen other movies like this, they're probably better. Omega One comes to mind. For the credit of the studio they avoided the bubbly, unnecessary, large budget technofest that characterizes films of this ilk. In addition, the setup and the premise were excellent: four people whose past is almost irrelevant to us are trying to get away from an overwhelmingly infectious fatal disease. What is bad is everything else! I get tired of infinitely stupid, careless, wimpy, ineffective, arrogant characters in a movie. It describes virtually everyone in the movie at some point. I rented it and found myself and yelled at the television repeatedly, "no, don't!", "Why are you so stupid," "Look!" Contract. A true lack of character development is obviously halfway in. A movie should give you a strong personal connection with at least some of the characters, so you actually worry about what happens to them. This does not. There should also have been a longer, more involved end to the movie as well.
