Really no need to investigate this much more because of a couple of very sharp and confusing misleading statements. <br /> <br /> A perfect example is when the filmmaker claims "Saul" or Paul of Tarus (the author of the book of the Hebrews He claims) has no idea that Jesus is or was a human being, this claim is either deliberately fake as he accuses others of presenting, or he is unaware of what the "Bible" says. <br /> <br /> First, we can examine his misleading claim of Hebrews 8.4; as he shows a quote, "If Jesus were on earth, He would not be a priest," and therefore he establishes the ignorant and ignorant seer to accept his false premise. Why? He does what the most so-called Bible-believing people he accuses of doing the same. It's taking things out of context. <br /> <br /> verse one of the Hebrews 8 is; 1. "Now of the things that we have spoken this is the sum: We have such a high priest set to the right of the throne of majesty in heaven." The context above is clearly a Jesus who was on earth and approached heaven after his alleged resurrection. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with how the filmmaker wants the viewer to take him out of the contextual text. Here he offers a foundation that "Paul was not aware of a PEOPLE Jesus, but only one in" Heaven "follows? <br /> <br /> Let's see if the filmmaker is honest; Hebrews 7; is clear that our Lord sprang out of Judah; of which the tribe of Moses did not speak of the priesthood. "<br /> Hi, the filmmaker has only quoted from the Hebrew writer trying to show the author of that book, no knowledge of a" Human Jesus "? It is likely that Paul did not write Hebrews, but I do not want to go into this, but the film producer claims that Paul did, and that is the prerequisite for the point listed here. <br /> <br /> It's not like this movie maker does not make decent points in certain areas, he does, but he is about to go in the same blind bias of the religion on which he is based. When he is involved in these tactics, he seems to lose a credibility as the religion he fetches and the film is not longer a documentary, but a personal opinion and a bias of the filmmaker, nothing more, nothing less.
