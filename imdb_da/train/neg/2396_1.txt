Just watched this movie on TV and I must admit I was a little surprised that it was even on. There were so many goofs, mess-ups and bad editing that an old episode of Sesame Street would have been better to see. The action was ok, but you can really feel the "Straight to Video" feeling. The player / crew made this movie a bad melodrama. Yes, there is a message in the movie, but wait until ten minutes before the end to hear it. Believe me, you wouldn't even tell the difference.
