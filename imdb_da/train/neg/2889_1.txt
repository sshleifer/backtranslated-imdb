The case is the best part of the movie, but it is not only worth the purchase price. I was expecting a "Based on the true story" movie just to find a shot at home video hodge-podge of badly shot clips tied with pathetic plays and non-related slaughter scenes. The video scenes had many rewind situations, which were probably used to extend the length of the function instead of effects. I started this review before I was halfway through the movie and waited until it was over, only if it had a better end but low and see it got worse. If I could mark it somewhat lower, it would have been a negative ten. Learn from my mistakes and save your money and time with this.
