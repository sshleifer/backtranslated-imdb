This is a complete Hoax ... The movie has clearly been shot in northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan. Look at chase scene - vehicles are Indian; The writing everywhere is Hindi language used in India. The drive through is on typical Jaipur streets. Also the palace is in Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur, Rajasthan. The filmmakers in their (about the movie) in DVD Bonus seem to make it sound like they risked their lives in Kabul and around. Almost all of their action scenes are shot in India. The scene in which they see a group singing about fire is so false that they did not even think about switching it to Afghan folk song. They just picked up Rajasthani folk song. How do I know this because I have traveled this area to a great extent. They are just on the band wagon to make big of the problem. I challenge the filmmakers to deny it.
