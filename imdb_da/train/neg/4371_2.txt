After leaving TV's popular "The Andy Griffith Show", Don Knott's film stardom gave a huge test with a number of inane but matinee-comfortable comedy cars. Unfortunately, "The Reluctant Astronaut", which is recorded on the cheap (as most of Knot's films), is much worse than his others. Don plays a small town schnook, which is accepted into the Astronaut training camp ... but not as a candidate for space travel - they want him as their new guardian! Some may say that the weak satire capitalizes the then-fresh fever of Americans for the new age of technology, but the flick is really just a weak excuse to keep restless children engaged. It goes well with an OK setup and nostalgic places, but it is becoming increasingly breathless and idiotic. * from ****
