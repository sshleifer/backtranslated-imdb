I watched this movie along with any other adaptation I could get my hands on - including watching games - in preparation for some academic research. The cinematography is very moving, just like the music. Unfortunately, the whole life was taken out of history. I have never seen such a horrible portrayal of Mr. Rochester. All his most basic features are gone. Where's his white? Where is his passion? Scott's Rochester looks more like Rochester's foil, St. John, than the character from the novel. In fact, the actor who played St. John in this adaptation, a passionate st. John, while Scott is happy to smash things or just stare in the ceiling (which he does all the time). I have no idea what they were thinking. I would like to give this movie a slightly higher voice based on the wonderful music and filmography, but I honestly can't bear to watch this movie too long because of George C. Scott's performance.
