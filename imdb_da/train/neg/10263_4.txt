Yes, the Southern Star has a beautiful forgettable title tuneed by the heavy set crooner Matt Monro. It creates pretty much the tone for this inflated and rather boring feature, terrific with George Segal and Ursula Andress as an adventurous couple in search of a great diamond. Add in Harry Andrews (with a strange accent, no less) chasing an ostrich, tons of stock footage of wildlife and poorly composed and boring photography by Raoul Coutard, and you end up with a thoroughly effortless drum through Senegal's jungle.
