It's not a horrible movie, and Glenn and Keitel are top notch actors. Moreover, they do an acceptable job with the very weak script. The landscape is lush and the plot has some interesting twists. I also condemn why these actors and crew made the movie, they are professional and they are paid for it. But I wonder why studios spend time and money making a movie and then not releasing it to the theater audience? Although a movie is a box-office flop, it's probably some money. If you are a fan of Keitel or Glenn, rent the video or catch it on TV as I did. The movie does not help solve the immigration string with Mexico, but the experience is far better than 90% of the standard TV ticket today.
