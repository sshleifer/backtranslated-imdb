The disagreement, unclear, poor manuscript, poor photography and direction ... All in all, very obviously an incredible first effort in the commercial film production of the good people at TBN. <br /> <br /> TBN Pictures has been a great success in the past by helping bring "China Cry", the story of Nora Lam, to the big screen. But "The Omega Code" is an unfortunate miscue. As a Christian who supports TBN and a lot of programming, and who loved "China Cry", I still find it impossible to recommend this movie to anyone. They do very well with their ministry, but this is not an example of that. Don't waste your money ... go clean "China Cry" instead.
