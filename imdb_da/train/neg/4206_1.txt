I was at this film's premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in 1997. After the screening, when the author / director and some cast members offered to answer questions, no one could even be bothered to ask anyone. Rarely has a movie been so badly directed (why on the ground was haphazard cut out of some scenes?), Elderly acted (David Arquette, to rewrite Dorothy Parker, does not run the emotional spectrum from A to B. He parks at A and brings a breakfast) and totally meaningless. Characters behave completely out of character with no reason to force the plot to move in certain directions. Finally, the movie comes to a completely random and pointless end that must "really make you think". Unfortunately, this is what makes you think, "Well, there are 90 minutes in my life, I never come back."
