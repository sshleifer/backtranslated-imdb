This movie is Stephanie Beatson's newsman and her new production company. While it suffers from a few problems that every low budget production does, it's a good start for Mrs Beaton and her company. The story is not terribly new, which has been done in films like The Burning and every Friday the 13th part 2. But the performances are deeply felt. So many big budget movies have just the actors gone through the movements, it is always nice to see actors who are really trying to hone their craft. The story deals with the murder (and possible return) of a confused classmate. The others are sworn to secrecy, but the trauma of the event sends each person in different directions in their lives. Ten years later, friends are murdered one by one by a cruel stalker known as "The Bagman". Who will survive? You have to see. <br /> <br /> If you are Roger Ebert or any number of arrogant critics, you shouldn't bother it. But if your taste is more against Joe Bob Briggs and you want to see a group of people picking up their craft, check out "The Bagman".
