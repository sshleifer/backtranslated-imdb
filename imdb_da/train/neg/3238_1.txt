The Devil's Experiment: 1/10: Hardcore porn movies fall into two categories, those with a shadow of plot (Gee, a lucky pizza boy) and those without (Anal Amateurs 36). Devil's Experiment falls firmly into the latter category. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's the terrible version of hardcore porn. An almost complete plot less 43 minute wait for the cash deposit. Shot on video in 1985, it consists of three relatively non-descriptive Japanese boys who torture a rather uninteresting Japanese girl. The tortures range from the banal (relaxing her 50 times and kicking her a hundred), the stupid (tying her to an office chair and spinning her around), the fear factor (a bath of maggots and goats) and finally money shot. (A well-made eye-piercing piercing). <br /> <br /> That's it, no plot, no motif, just Blair Witch shots and torture. The girl looks bored, and with the exception of shouting, "no one expects the Spanish Inquisition" during the office chair scene, I was sad. Staring dumbfounded on the screen, waiting for money shot. Like hardcore porn.
