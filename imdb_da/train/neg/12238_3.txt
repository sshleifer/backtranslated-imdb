A concept with potential and it was fun to see these two holiday icons together, but ... Rudolph's glowing nose did not require the "explanation" offered in this movie - just as The Force in the Star Wars movies did not need the explanation of "Medichlorians in the bloodstream." But first and foremost, the movie left me cold because of Winterbolt's complicated plot to destroy Santa. He has the power to propose people's minds, why does he do such a roundabout? Breaking the magic of Rudolph's nose, framing Rudolph, threatening to melt the frosty family ... The comedic exaggerated plot of Pinky and Brain and "Phineas and Ferb's" Dr. Doofenshmirtz (which is done on purpose and played for laughs) seems simple and straightforward to Winterbolt's, which we are expected to take seriously. <br /> <br /> There is a special (and entertaining) strange moment when a character throws his two weapons on the bad guy, like boomerangs. I understand if they don't want weapons to be shot in a family movie, but then why do you have weapons in the first place?
