I saw the trailer for this movie and it looked good so I went out and bought it. What a mistake, the actor is a shambles, the special effects (if you could call them that), look like something that wouldn't be out of place at a school game. Some of the characters are so stupid in this movie, you will cringe the moment they are on the screen, unfortunately too often. For a story, forget it. This is a warning, don't waste any money at all on this movie, it must be one of the worst things I've ever seen. If for some reason you like this movie, see Troll 2, you will probably also enjoy it.
