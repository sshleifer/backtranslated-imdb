It's like if you took the general themes from The Usual Suspects and Fightclub, take all their style and class together and mix them with a lot of pretentious new wave "I'm intellectual so my movie must be hard to make sense of" movies maker dirt, mashed in a few extra styles to good measure, carved by the end where you have the revolver. <br /> <br /> Yes, I thought about it after seeing, and yes it made sense, but it doesn't stop being waste. <br /> <br /> Waste of money. A waste of time. <br /> <br /> As the worst movie I've ever seen, with not even a bad movie news value to redeem it a bit.
