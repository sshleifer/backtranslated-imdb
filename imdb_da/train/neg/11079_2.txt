Over the years, after searching half-decent movies for rent for my kids, I've developed a sixth sense to spot the truly cheesy, direct-to-video action that is very painful to sit through (for everyone in age of eight). I dropped the ball on this one and the kids spent half of the movie and asked me "what did she say?" and "why did he do that?" and my eyes got sore by rolling them every minute or so as signs did a really bad job of introducing seemingly random plot changes. And the next time someone decides to have absolutely no skill with a sword, it is simply bringing realism to a movie, so take them through with a dull butter knife. "Prehysteria!" was head and shoulders above this. Practice.
