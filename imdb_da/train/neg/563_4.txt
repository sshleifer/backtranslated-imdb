Should every good story be "enhanced" with added corny Broadway music? Apparently, those who cannot come up with their own reasons believe that classical literature is only there for looting. I admit that Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorites, as it is certainly true that Dickens often wrote things that leave you considerably bummed out and that was a good example of just that ... So of course you take this serious narration and add nauseating music and rent it with every character from imposing orphaned boys to mincing bobbies and suddenly it's uplifting? Argh. Get me a basin. <br /> <br /> The four stars in my rating come from casting that I could compare to My Fair Lady. Each of these films had a cast that a game version could be proud of, but then they have to go and have them sing (see complaint above). Unlike my fair lady, those who sing here could actually do it, and they mercifully spread us Oliver Reed's singing voice (sorry if I'm wrong, it's been a while). My biggest complaint I have said. Why scare everyone except the really shameless by putting stupid songs into a good story? This has rarely been done with good effect. In general, it destroys the story. It did with this one. Jury is still out about whether this story is worth saving, but with all that is about it is impossible to tell.
