This movie was poorly written, badly acted and very predictable. It was very low budget and I can understand why it was never released and went straight to video. It wasn't even campy fun, it was just a complete disaster and I wish I could get 1-1 / 2 hours back! The colors were horrible along with the plot, which has holes so big in what one could drive a mac truck through them. <br /> <br /> The plot itself had the young bride doing things she couldn't do physically - what a stretch! Skip this movie and see something better in the horror genre. Almost any movie is going to think it's better than this. <br /> <br /> ejames6342
