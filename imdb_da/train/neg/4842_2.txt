Who has the research for this movie? It's set in Baghdad in 2004, but all the soldiers have ACUs and all have Universal Camouflage Pattern gear. No one was wearing those things in 04. <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie while I was posted abroad, and I can say that the overwhelming sense of audience was the WTF? This movie made no sense if the characters came and go without explanation, and people make ridiculous things that would never happen in real life. I realize it's a movie, but of course it tries to portray something realistic. It doesn't fail, but it tries. <br /> <br /> It's as if someone came up with a lot of random ideas, chewed them up and turned off and flushed a movie out. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I'm still not sure why I was sitting through it all. GI Joe was one that really made you think about this. STAY AWAY!
