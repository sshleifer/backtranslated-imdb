The same problem I have with the musical version of "Les Miserables" applies just for "Oliver." Instead of composers writing in the style setting period for the play settings, they wrote only Broadway-type melodies that historically were unidiomatic and stylistically skewed. <br /> <br /> Also, the obvious brutality and horrific activities of the dramaturgy do not mix well with some of the sunny dunes that permeates the score. It is an unpleasant mixture that leaves a certain sour taste. <br /> <br /> The thrill of the boy Oliver does not help to do anything: for the time being of timbre and vexingly precious, there is something less than solid here. Fagin performs his traditional routine sufficiently, even though the tunes he is required to sing have little basis in a time-limited manner. <br /> <br /> "As long as he needs me, a hard-hitting, stingy and strained look is given. The two big production numbers, "Who will buy" and "Consider yourself" seem overproduced, with anything but kitchen sink thrown in. It's one thing to go out and another to cross the line in profit. <br /> <br /> The gloom, despair and destruction of much of the novel does not seem to be suitable for such dives and choreography. While the novel is considered a classic, I have to admit that I have problems with Mr Dickens' consciousness, as his works tend to derive a negative vibration. This may be due to the expansion of his pleasing personal life, which was full of disappointment and regret. <br /> <br /> Not all the combined talents of this production, either on or behind the camera, can overcome the non-constructive nature of the base material. All this results in an unpleasant downer experience for me. <br /> <br />
