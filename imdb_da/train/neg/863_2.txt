I've come to realize from watching Euro horror, especially movies made by cult luminary Jess Franco, that you can't expect a plot that makes great sense. But Franco has gone overboard with this movie; and despite a surrealistic atmosphere, and the film's reputation as one of the director's best - Succubus is unfortunately a really horrible movie. I must admit that I saw the American cut version, which runs in about 76 minutes; but unless it was just the logic that was cut, I am sure that the longer European version is just as boring. The reason has something to do with a woman who marries around; practicing S&M and talking badly, and that's all really boring. There is no gore, and sex is boring, and most of the driving period is concerned with dull dialogue and despite the fact that this is a short film; I had a hard time doing it all the way to the end. I have to say that the location looks good, and Franco has done a good job of using his surreal atmosphere; But the positive elements end there. Jess Franco is certainly a talented director who has made some classic trash films - but it looks like it was one he made for the money, and generally I recommend skipping it and seeing some of the director's more interesting works.
