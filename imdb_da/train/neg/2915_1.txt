It's a bad movie, it looks like there are only 5 police in HK, they didn't use a gun and it makes me feel like a Jacky Chans movie. All the time they used their pistol to refer only to the suspect. When they finally use their gun is when they kill each other, what fun movie. In the movie it is as if all the good guys died without a reason. <br /> <br /> Also, their storyline in the movie sucks, the story jumps here and there and bored people. But if you wanted to watch a bloody movie, I think it's just an OK type of movie, I think the US made zombie movies more bloody than this
