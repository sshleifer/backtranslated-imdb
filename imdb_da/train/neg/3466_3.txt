A slasher flick, made in the early 80s, has a curse on the one who has anyone trying to end what is dead. Years later, a group of film students tried to complete the film - also reviving the film's mortal curse. Great idea for a movie, but unfortunately 'Cut' is just another wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Australia has not had the world's best track record when it comes to horror. 'Razorback' (1984) was an out and about dud that was 'Holwing III' (1987), which was still a half American movie. As for our comedy horror foray, 'Body Melt' (1993) is best forgotten. The problem with 'Cut' is that decision makers try to create a clever horror satire on la 'Scream' (1996), but have no insight into the genre or what makes it work. And even though it sounds strange, I say this about a slasher film, but what 'Cut' missing really is something "heart". Sure, it follows the basic "rules" established by "Scream", but it won't play with the formula, but instead of a card copy of the former. <br /> <br /> The murderer, Scarman, is probably one of the most boring and unscrupulous villains in horror movie history. His infinite barrage unfortunately would paralyze one-liners make the dialogue of a porn work like Shakespeare. The cast never seems to be fully involved and looks like they are just waiting for a shoot to be over so they can collect their paychecks. And the feeling of the movie is, as it deliberately tries, not to be scary; looks more like an episode of 'neighbors' or 'heartbreak high'. By the way, the attempts at MTV style, hyper-cinema during the "research" sequence, just look lame, dated and out of place. <br /> <br /> If Australia ever gets the chance to do horror again (Which I hope we still do) maybe we should take a magazine from 'Mad Max' (1979) book. Instead of trying to copy the US, we should try to take the genre ourselves.
