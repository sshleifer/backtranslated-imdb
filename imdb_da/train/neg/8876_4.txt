A kind of parody mix "An Officer And A Lord", "Heartbreak Ridge", "Full Metal Jacket" (and undoubtedly other movies I can't remember now), to a rather boring movie with some bright spots. Gags are always where you would expect them, and Damon Wayan's lines are well predictable. As I said, this movie never surprises you ...
