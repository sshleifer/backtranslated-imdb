A killer, cannibal rape is killed by a Galician politician on the scene of his recent murder. At his grave, a cult has gathered with plans to revive him by throwing at the grave. This of course works, and he wakes up ripping guys penis out and he's back in his old killed ways with a brand new zombie look. The two polish one of those who become a little crazy about the city's foam and have a substance problem, is left on the case. Two of the original cult members also try to stop the killer by reviving another kind of death thing. Thinking they have filed, they leave, but out of the grave comes a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection. It sounds a little confusing, but it's not just nonsense. The act is horrible and one of the police is the same guy who plays Dr. Vincent van Gore in the gore series and he is as horrible as the annoying policeman in this movie. The other policeman is almost struggling to get his horrible lines out. Now I'm too low a budget cinema, but this movie is just awful. If it wasn't for the very easy on the eye ladies and their nudity, I would probably have fallen asleep. There is a bit of gore, but it is never more than some animal species that lie on the of the stomach's stomach. Zombie makeup, on the other hand, looks good, and his foot long penis, which he uses to rape his victims, is fun at times. There is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. The doll with chipmunks voice is the dumbest thing I've ever seen in a movie. It's just a plastic toy on a fishing line. The end is extremely poor. You would expect the killer to put much more of a fight than he does. God knows how they made enough money to make a successor. <br /> <br /> 4/10
