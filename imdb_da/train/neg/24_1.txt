I have to congratulate the genius that has approved this. Edward Furlong, you are not as good as you think buddy, you cannot tackle every piece of cheap amateur kit that is only meant to get some money. <br /> <br /> The movie is bad and I mean bad. Anyone with a camera would get the same result or better. <br /> <br /> Let's just say: Don't go to the supermarket looking for actors. The good ones usually come with a degree, or at least it has some wonderful experiences! The director .. Mr. Jon Keeyes, please find your purpose in life, as a director, you just suck. Your control is poor, the angles are messed up (not in a good way), the lines seem to be read out of toilet paper and the terrible music. It always comes up when it is not going out without any obvious reason. And don't go for the author either. Making movies is not like earning a coffee shop, it requires art and skills, things I really doubt you will ever have. <br /> <br /> Instead of making a badass shootout movie, you should have shot one back to oblivion and wait 'until something good came up. Or just go find a job at a coffee shop. You get less stress and you save movie guests some money and a bad night. <br /> <br /> Vote: 1/10 (min first)
