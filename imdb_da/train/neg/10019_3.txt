Kareena Kapoor in a bikini hmmmmmmmm. <br /> <br /> Ankshay Kumar ... <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor .... <br /> Maybe Saif .... <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor in a bikini ..... <br /> <br /> Good banner .. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor in a bikini ..... <br /> <br /> Not a good reason not to watch this movie .... <br /> <br /> I thought ........ Didn't these people get to JBJ ... <br /> <Why have I forgotten it . <br /> <br /> For all the criticism, the first half of the film is not that bad ... There is some intrigue and YOU FEEL A BLACK OF IRRITATION MIXED WITH EXCITEMENT WHICH I FILL, WHEN SEING GUY RITCHIE MOVIES LOCK STOCK AND SNATCH. <br /> <br /> Kareena Kapoor is in a very thin model. /> Akshay Kumar is Akshay Kumar, whom he can only be. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor is annoying, but a little fun, you forget you don't understand him as much as possible. <br /> <br /> Saif is side by side to Main Khiladi .. again. <br /> <br /> There are occasional laughs and a few chuckles, and a few goosebumps during kareena-saif's love story (kareena in the rain, behind me on my bike hmmmmmmm). BUT THE MOST ENTIRE HALF PROMISES MORE THAN IT IS DELIVERING ..... <<br /> <br /> It was almost a joy as the interval came not only because of the wet cavern due to what people believed in was the things to come. <br /> <br /> Instead, we were treated to memory speaking torture which is difficult to put into words. <br /> <br /> Suddenly seam like a comic sidekick ... <br /> <br /> SUDDEN SEXY KAREENA LOOKER ANOREXIC, YOU AGREE THAT THE SECOND FLOOR NOW IS LOOKING FORWARD AND HIS COMMUNITY LARGE TO HIS BODY (only girls can notice this and get others to notice that the second last floor was my observation). <br /> <br /> ANIL CAPS AND SIDE DRIVES GET ON YOUR NERVE. <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is the only one who performs the madness to some extent, but himself becomes unacceptable after a while. <br /> <br /> ALL WHEN YOU ARE UNDERSTANDING AN ABSURDURITY AFTER THE OTHER. WHY ?? !! WHAT??!!! WHEN?!!! WHERE?!!! WHAT HAVE I MADE FOR DESERVE THIS ... <br /> <br /> A collective gasp went through the audience before each song in the other half, which was common even without the film around it. <br /> <br /> Can't relieve the trauma anymore. <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION. <br /> <br /> THIS MOVIE IS STARTED BY A BUZZ, WHICH YOU FEEL, CAN'T WAIT FOR A HIGH BUT BUT COMPLETE QUICKLY TO BE IN THE CASE OF A MAIN CONTACT AND THAT RAPIDLY TIRES FOR A FULL MIGRAIN ATTACK. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch the movie for any reason other than academic interest. <br /> <br /> + s Cast, Akshay Kumar, first half. <br /> <br /> +/- s what, when, how, who too much confusion. (Use a book to complete this). <br /> <br /> + s cast, the whole second half (needs many pages to fill this out). A total of 3/10 (I try to avoid 1s and 2s also doesn't seem to be extreme but make no mistake this movie is unwatchable no matter how decent the first half is).
