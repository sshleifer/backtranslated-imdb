Bad Michael Madsen; He must be kicking himself to know that people have found out about this terrible flick. I really can't think of anything worse I've ever seen, except for amateur porn. It's so bad and everything here; wood plays, bad script, crappy moral ending, you hate it, and it's in this movie. My question is, "Who the hell put the bill into this piece of doggy doo? Could have seen Michael's sister Virginia naked in a scene, but I don't even think it would save this stink ... For a cool guy who made some exception film, I want to know what Wacky Church sponsored this piece of crapola.
