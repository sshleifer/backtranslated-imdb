Have you ever seen a movie that lost the plot? Well, it didn't even have one at first. <br /> <br /> Where to start? The totally boring scenes from our heroine, sitting around the house, actually have no sense of threat or even obstructing even during the seemingly constant thunderstorms (oddly never actually heard in the house - large double glazing)? The house, which apparently is only a few kilometers from a city, is even more hours away (?) Or the third girl who does not serve any purpose for the plot except to give a surprisingly fast gory murder, as the tedium becomes unbearable? Or even the beginning that suggests a slate of 20+ kills throughout the area, although it's clear that the killer never goes far away from the house? Or the bizarre ritual of salt and pepper, which largely summarizes most of the film's inherent lack of direction. Add a leading actress who can't act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant naked shower scenes, and this video is really unpleasant, but not as you hope. Granted simply to be banned in the UK in the 80s (mostly because of a lasting surprise over extended murder) it gives nothing but curiosity - and a classic "daft" murder (don't worry - it's telegraphed at least ten minutes before). After a walk in the woods, our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope, which they of course struggle for. Halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a big scythe. What are they doing? Push down and run like the rest of us? No, of course not - they fight to the top and stand comfortably and upright in front of the murder weapon. It's really just a movie they say ..
