Now this movie started out fun, but quickly deteriorated. I thought it would be more "adult-oriented" humor based on the first few moments, but then the movie switched to a poorly-made-to-Disney channel type mode, especially a go-kart racing scene that was incredibly long. Alana De La Garza is beautiful but has a really fake Italian accent. The movie looked and sounded very independent and low budget. There was a very sweet moment that I just call the serenading scene but overall this was a yawner. It laughs are very few and far between. The only surprise for "Mr. Fix It" is so ridiculous, it left me more sour than anything else. May be worth seeing if you can catch it for free or TV, but don't waste your money by buying or renting this movie.
