First of all, I saw this movie when I was 7 years old at a Christian Scholl, I attended. Needless to say, I was afraid of fun. Not because it was scary but because the content. Cmon ... I was 7. Anyway, cinematography was pretty bad and the actor was cheesy. It's very bad considering that I was only 7 and I remember it. The only thing that still craves me is the terrible song "I wish we were all ready", where the choir ends with "... you were left behind". I would not suggest seeing this one. I probably just want nostalgic reason. Besides, I'm sure remake is much better. However, the best part of this movie should be when everyone "disappears"; available cars crash, lawn mowers run on their own ... pretty funny.
