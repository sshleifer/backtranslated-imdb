Amelia and Michael are a married couple who cheat each other. Amelia has a long time lover in the hospital and Michael hires a prostitute who does not satisfy him. The two are melting with their adultery, but are able to connect to each other eventually. <br /> <br /> There's not much to this card. The direction is quite forward and dramatic, which is good, the play is sincere, but the story leaves a little to be desired. Why are we exactly concerned about these two people? It is a little difficult to see how this story stems from any other story of adultery, except that it is much more prepared and does not seek meaning in it (a welcoming change of pace if anything). <br /> <br /> I don't know it is possible, I do not associate with these stories because I have never experienced them. But I have noticed that blocking in these stories is typically the same, ie. a few talk together while avoiding eye contact by pretending to be immersed in magazines etc. The good things about short films are that they give a little more space to try something else and I want to see another take . <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
