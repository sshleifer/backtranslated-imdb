I can't say that Aag is the worst Bollywood movie ever made because I haven't seen every Bollywood movie, but my imagination tells me it might be. <br /> <br /> This movie seems like an attempt at artistic suicide on behalf of the director, and I believe he has been successful in his mission. No A-list actor outside this movie would risk sharing the same billing as him for all the humility this movie is bound to carry with it. <br /> <br /> But let's not just blame the director here, who is a cinematographer who looks like he's responding to the amateur home theater of this year's award. There is the over dramatic score that hopes to bring you to the next scene. The candlestick who must have held a cigarette in one hand and bulb on the rod in the other and hopes that the flame burning the cigarette would add to the much needed light in each scene. And of course the actors! Some of them are by no means newcomers, otherwise everyone could be forgiven here. The ensemble of actors in Aag was put together to promote a new beginning and dimension to the reconstruction of India's most beloved movie all the time, 'Sholay'. One should not forget that these actors were not forced into this movie, they are A-list and willing participants to something that we face, it would surely have had a high and eager public expectation ??? So it asks the question, Amitabh aside (for now), did the other actors really believe their performances, even trying to improve the original? Did Amitabh Bachchan read the manuscript and believe that people would remember their dialogue in this farcical disgust for a movie? Don't be stupid, of course he didn't, it was a demonstration to the public about how many money lectures can make actors go. I really hope everyone involved is happy with what is really a vulgar attempt to recreate a classic movie that only successfully pollutes everyone's mind when they see the original.
