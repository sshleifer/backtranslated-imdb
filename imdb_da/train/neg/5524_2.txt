I didn't like this movie for many reasons. Within the first ten minutes of the film, I was extremely disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this movie were to save itself, at least it would pull out of the huge hole it had dug. Unfortunately, it did not arise. The two drawings of the movie for me were to see Jane Fonda and Felicity Huffman. I don't know enough about Lindsey Lohan's work to have been interested in what she would bring to the movie. Then I just felt disappointed and over all three of them, even though there were "moments" in each of their performances. I imagine that for each of them finding their "moments" was a very difficult task given the fact that there was an incredible lack of character development and uninspired dialogue. Although the plot is interesting, the movie on the whole is so poorly written, directed and edited that one's performance as an actor would suffer and be contaminated by it. The disrespectful way it deals with sexual abuse and the trite and insulting view of small-town America, I believe, was the two main reasons why this movie failed to hit that mark. As one reviewer has noted and I agree, the film is almost impossible to market as it is finished. I suppose, or at least hope that (for the actor's sake anyway) there are some real gems on the floor. Sad for us, but if that's true, then the actors can take comfort and feel good at borrowing their talents and time for such a flop. Oh yeah and another thing ... I only wanted once to see an American movie that included the sadly vanishing but wonderfully bucolic settings like this one in this movie where the protagonists were not absurd and / or disrespectfully slaughtered landside with pop cans, smashed CDs and other such trash can!
