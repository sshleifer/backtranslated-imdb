I just couldn't stop laughing !! This movie is incredibly fun and stupid! But remember it is very entertaining! In this movie you don't need to pay attention to anything! The action is the same - LAME! The dinosaurs are the same - RUBBER (Oh, I could see the stick that holds the T-Rex head for a moment.) The raptors are the same from Carnosaur 2, T-Rex is also the same, but ... in some scenes his head looks right and it looks like a kind of project error from kindergarten. The action is fast, sometimes too fast, I'm actually talking about quick editing, they edited it so fast so we can't see the rubber dinosaurs, but OOPPS! too late, they are rubber! Well, only things that are interesting here are to see Rick Dean in this sequel. What can I say ... don't rent it ... watch it on TV, with friends, it's much more entertaining!
