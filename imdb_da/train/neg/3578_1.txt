There is absolutely nothing to redeem this movie. They took a shabby story, mistaken it, miswrote it, misfilmed it. It has a poor dialogue that is poorly done in an enchanting and trashy story. <br /> <br /> As bad as art fails, it's even worse than trading. Who could have been the target market for this. What age group? What interest group? <br /> <br /> Someone should make a movie about how and why they made this movie. What I would pay to see. <br /> <br /> I've seen thousands of bad movies, and this goes with "Sailor Who Fell from Grace" and "Manos" ... my choices as the three most tirelessly bad movies I've ever seen. Everyone connected with it must be forced to speak with VanDamme for all eternity. <br /> <br /> I'm challenging you. Watch this movie and do an academic exercise - how could you take it and make it worse? I can't think in a way.
