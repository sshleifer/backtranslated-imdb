I still can't believe how bad this movie was. If I wasn't a massist, I don't know if I would have survived the show. It looks like it costs about $ 1000 to make, but it wasn't the money that brought them down. The action was horrible - not only bad, 3 degrees could have read the lines better. Secondly, the only other reason to see this kind of film is the skin, and much is lacking in this flick. We don't even get to see the more attractive chicas in the buff. <br /> <br /> Well, good luck next time eh?
