First of all ..... <br /> <br /> What the hell? Why in the world are they trying to sell a low budget shot on Sennat TV with the promise of disruptive, offensive sick waste that any normal man with a soul could not see. <br /> <br /> What's funny about a dog being hurt, a grandmother getting her head off ... a guy getting his hand blown to pieces and two girls going to the toilet? What in hell has this world come to that people find comedy in some things so completely ill. Anyone who thinks this kind of material is fun shouldn't even be allowed to walk the earth. <br /> <br /> But from what I hear, it's not even offensive ... so ... they promise comedy through demented piles of sick waste ... and they can't even pull it away.
