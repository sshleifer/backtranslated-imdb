First is the leader Brad Dourif and KOOK. If you try to take this movie seriously, I guarantee he will destroy it for you. If you don't take him too seriously, he is actually fun to see. As with another reviewer, I loved the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif declare their love for each other - between the dodge flames shooting out of his arm in the car. Another great campy scene saw John Landis as a snorky radio show producer getting toasted and flailing around the room. In fact, I found the last 15 minutes of the movie to be a non-stop laughing rebellion - I'm just not sure if Tobe Hooper meant it.
