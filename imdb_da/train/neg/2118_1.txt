What can I say about seven pounds ... well I looked at a flight from Seattle to Tokyo, and since that flight was long and boring, the movie certainly doesn't help. Will Smith's character Ben Thomas be almost unlikely even with his redemption in the end. The movie's two-hour plus driving time wastes most of the screen time with random waste that just stretches plotted together as slowly as possible. In the film defense, Rosario Dawson's character adds a little life to the movie, but not much. I don't understand how anyone could actually cry during this movie, as all I wanted to do was turn it off. Also Will Smith kills with a jellyfish in the completed evidence killing yourself with a jellyfish is the stupid way to die.
