So thank you so much Disney for destroying the good memories I used to have from my previous movie. I was about 5 when the original movie came out and it was one of the first movies I remember watching. So now that I'm 16 and I feel masochistic enough, I decided to rent this movie. Thus, I managed to poison all my memories of the original movie with this apologetic excuse for a movie. This movie takes everything that made the original intrusive and destroys it down to the smallest detail. In this movie, Ariel and Eric celebrate the birth of their daughter, Melody, and go to show her that everyone in the sea ... BROADWAY STYLE! After the musical number ends within minutes, the witch shows Morgana and threatens to kill Melody if Triton does not give up the trident. Then he gives it up without even a fight. Eric stands there yawning, though Ariel is figuring out how to use a sword and save the tune. Morgana escapes, so Ariel and Eric decide that the melody should never go near the ocean before Morgana is caught. <br /> <br /> Well ... rude, nothing happens in the note. Eric is a total wuss. He never really manages to do anything. Ariel kind of does something. Melody manages to screw things up. Plus, the animation is a new low point for Disney. The computer graphics conflict with the background. Ever the only opportunity for character development is wasted. The songs bite. <br /> <br /> Look, don't play your time. I am absolutely sure that even the small children will be bored of their skulls with this, as nothing even externally exciting ever happens. They will not sing the songs. If you manage to get a copy of this, throw it into the sea and hope that no one ever finds it. Ever.
