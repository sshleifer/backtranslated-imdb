The "Wrinkle in Time" series is my favorite series from childhood. I have read and read them several times than I can count on for the last 35+ years. The signs of all their virtues and mistakes are near and dear to my heart. This adaptation contained very little of the wonderful, magical, spiritual history that I love so much. To say I was disappointed with this movie would be a great understatement. <br /> <br /> If you've never read the book, then I think you'll enjoy the movie. The action is acceptable, the special effects are well done to one made for TV movies, and the story is interesting. But if you love the books, avoid this movie at all costs. <br /> <br /> I found this statement on the novel's Wikipedia page: "In an interview with Newsweek, L'Engle said about the movie," I expected to be bad and that is. "" <br /> <br /> I, as another reviewer here, feel the need to read the book again to remove this movie from my heart.
