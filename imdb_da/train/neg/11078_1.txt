honestly where can i start! This was a low budget, HORRIBLY acted movie, it was so cheesy it had us all bursting with laughter to where totally retarded it was! The sword fighting scenes were not even swords, they played around with some plastic values ​​they bought at wal-mart, and all they did, just groaned to make it look like they were fighting !! Me and my family were in the mood for a really good action movie one day, so we decided to go to the store and look for one, and there was The Sawtooth Island movie. I mean so good, but when we saw it at home, I practically killed the first scene. Oh and the film's story, the storyboard, the script, etc. Were a bunch of garbage that I don't even know why the director and the producer themselves wasted their time doing it !! But if you happen to stumble upon this movie, don't get it !!!!!
