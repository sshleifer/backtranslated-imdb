When the people at Kino Video gathered their fine "Slapstick Encyclopedia" collection, a multi-cassette selection of silent comedies, someone decided to kick the first installment with ONE TO MANY (1916), an unclear one-reel farce made in Florida starring the very young Oliver Hardy. As fun as the set is everywhere, this decision was unfortunate, because ONE TO MANY is a very bad movie that almost discourages the viewer from looking at it. Like any typical farce, this fraud is inspired by greed, panic when the plans go wrong, and complications escalating to the point of absurdity, but unlike the good ones, too many are incoherent, scary and rather annoying. It is difficult to tell at this time whether the hopelessly confusing plot is the result of a lack of recordings or inappropriate filmmaking, but whatever the cause at the halfway point, even the most attentive viewer has no idea what the sign conditions are or what is happening, and lastly end do not worry anymore. <br /> <br /> The only point of interest here is to see the 24-year-old "Babe" Hardy, who looks considerably heavier than he wanted a decade later when he was doing with Stan Laurel, but still full of youthful energy. In the opening scene, Babe awakens a high athletic back roll from a bed. Believe me, it is as much fun as this movie gets. If you read this before you see the first cassette of Kino's "Slapstick Encyclopedia", I propose you fast ahead of this and skip to the good things.
