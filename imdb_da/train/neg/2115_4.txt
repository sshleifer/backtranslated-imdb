Only the glandular secretions - and please do not ask for more details - of young virgins can keep the tearful old amateur user's wife fresh and youthful body and mind. As virgins like most, except those who attend medical examinations, rarely provide their secretions, dr. Lorenz (Bela Lugosi) to be abducted and preserved. He wants to extract himself. <br /> <br /> Which large cheese ball is a prerequisite for a low budget horror movie. If The Corpse Vanishes turns out not to be Havarti of horror, it leaves as an ordinary limburger an interesting aftertaste. <br /> <br /> Of course, the play is almost horrible except for the actors lucky enough to play the crazy dwarf (Angelo Rossitto, who later played the Master in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome); his brutal broken angel, Frank (Frank Moran), who grunts a lot and has a fetish for the virgin hairs; the crazy mother of the two (Minerva Urecal); the mad woman (Elizabeth Russell) who sleeps in a sumptuous coffin and of course the mad doctor (Lugosi). <br /> <br /> An enterprising young journalist, Patricia Hunter (Luana Walters), traces the doctor because of a strange orchid with a particularly sweet odor worn by the victims. When the doctor and his wife invite Pat to stay at night, a violent storm breaks out immediately. That clue tells us that some violent violence is breaking out inside. As it is well known that all unmarried young women in Hollywood at this time were virgins, Pat may have some unpleasant surprises to deal with. They include dark passages, a crusty laboratory where a near dead stomach is stored, a basement mausoleum and later a direct threat to Patricia's own gland secretion. If she survives, what story should she give her editor. <br /> <br /> If you try this damp piece of moldy Velveeta (and why not? don't be superior), don't judge Bela Lugosi by the company he holds here. He had a great influence in Dracula (1931), but my favorite film of his is The Black Cat (1934). As Dr. Vitas Werdegast is he a sad, ironic man who protects his two young friends. When he finally takes a scalpel to Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff) and starts flying the man alive, ah, well, it's a great scene.
