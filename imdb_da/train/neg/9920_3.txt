I love the music in Clash and I love music from Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros. I went to this movie and hoped to learn about the man behind most things. But I came out of the theater without knowing much more about Joe than I already did after reading the post on Wikipedia. The film never comes to the person, his thoughts and feelings. What they were doing was collecting the little material they had, shaking blurry videos, and interviewing some people about Joe Strummer at a camp fire. It turns out that most of these people knew him very little or not at all and that the director just wanted them in the movie to get some more celebrities say "Oh, he was such an inspiration to all of us". Like Bono or Johnny Depp (who they apparently asked to put on their pirate suit to take advantage of his current success in the Pirates of the Caribbean). It seems that the director couldn't even wait until the body was cold before he jumped in to sell his version of "the greatest punk rocker and hippie in the heart" who ever lived, sanctified the person without knowing enough about him. <Br /> <br /> Sure to be a fan, I enjoyed watching the pictures of the band, hearing the anecdotes behind the songs and such, but eventually I felt like what was left when the portrait of Joe Strummer could have been told for 60-90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie if you're a fan, or better listen to some of the Clash music or better yet the undeserved, unknown Mescaleros, where Joe Strummer reached the top of his musical development before his death melting all its rich influences into a great sound.
