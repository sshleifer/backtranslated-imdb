Have you ever wondered what would happen if a few Beverly Hills 90210 characters were thrown into a Thai prison? If so, it's your movie. This is Midnight Express for the MTV crowd. It would be ok, but the story was poorly executed. Constructed plot twists, poor dialogue and unresolved issues abound. This little movie did not give the right to be as cryptic as it ends up being. Potential spoiler and impossible confusing plot line-the faux excitement full moment when the hotel employee discovers the girls don't have a room there and are kicking them out. (This moment is inappropriately played with the same solemnity and gravity as the moment when they are arrested by gun). Later, the same hotel employee is somehow found - and Bangkok is a big city, remember, I've been there - and testify to the girls as if a few free Mai Tais guarantees 40 years of imprisonment. C'mon. Rent another day in paradise instead.
