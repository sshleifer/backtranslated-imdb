2002's unforgettable popular "I Love the 80s" is an inane, idiotic, offensive, and even obnoxious pop culture shoot of a show that was the first in a variety of horrid television programs that ultimately spelled the end of VH1 which was all at once was the only real music-oriented channel left on TV! I used to live on VH1 until spring or winter, I forgot which now, in 2002, when the garbage bin like this began to appear for absolutely no reason. Out of pure morbid curiosity (I guess that's what you would call it). I had decided that I would go ahead and give it a look - nevertheless the first night it happened, even though the advertisements looked like complete crap. At least I can honestly say that I was not disappointed with it, because my expectations were obviously tied to basement levels at first. The weight of this show I found out within the first 5 minutes was less each year in the 1980s, and what was and was not culturally significant or popular (which I expected to see), but rather more of an impromptu platform for a whole lot of really god-fearing no-name comedians to show what they more than likely think is their comic skills * rolls eyes * ... more like a lack of it if you ask me! It is quite easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before appearing on this show because they are all so terribly eerie and pathetic in their attempts at so-called "humor" that I swear. that I could feel my gut knuckle up with every rancid one liner they shot off one after another! All in all, I have no problem saying that "I love the 80s" was / is the trash bin of the lowest denominator, and one of the main reasons I almost never see VH1 anymore.
