This movie is lame and not fun at all. The reason doesn't even make sense. Some scientists working on the edge of science open a doorway to another dimension (maybe hell ???) and his daughter gets sucked through it or something, so one day without apparent reason she comes back and now she has big boobs and wear one skimpy outfit (I suppose the demons in the other dimension have made it to her?) The protagonist is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend, but she is gay, so of course she is more interested in her new girlfriend and they Stumble upon this witch's spelling book (they will be witches or something?) and the evil magic ends up being read again, which is how the evil demon comes to earth as only the bikini top and the spurned guy in love can stop appearing. There are topless scenes with no reason and a guy in it that my boyfriend says is a well-known wrestler, but his part is completely unnecessary, of course they have done something to put him into it because maybe wrestling fans will actually see this meaningless movie. I'm sure the topless girls don't hurt there either. The extra features of the DVD were even more confusing than the rest of the movie. I thought it might help explain what was happening, but it just made things more confusing. Who are these people and what are they doing? Basically, it's a go-camping-to-make-out-then-fight-a-monster movie, but there are a lot of things (like the other dimension and book seller) than make it confusing. I didn't like the movie, but it was just like five money so big. I don't recommend seeing it, even though it was just too stupid, I can't think of any part of the movie that was good.
