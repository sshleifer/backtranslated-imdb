Jude Law gives its all in this beautifully recorded vampire girl who gives a little bit of value. Totally lacking in eroticism, excitement or leading ladies with appeal. A decent fight, a moment of mild excitement. And a one-note plot. The film grows philosophically in a series of conversations between the law's character and a dogged murder detective, well played by Timothy Spall. But despite their best efforts, both actors are placed at the cross of the film's banality. <br /> <br /> With a starring actor - and without the benefit of Oliver Curti's film - crocodiles would blend into the ocean of low budget vampire quickies.
