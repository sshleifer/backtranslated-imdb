Considering that many horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the key characters do something stupid at some point during the case, the girls in this movie will collect gold, silver and bronze at an Olympic ceremony from the Darwin Awards . A mentally handicapped baboon would have made better choices than they did and would have screamed much less while doing so. <br /> <br /> If you like movies with a grainy image, deliberately amateur camera work (my 92-year-old grandmother carries a camcorder with better results), extremely poor sound and no clear plot / story, then this is your ideal movie. Also note that you should enjoy the following: women scream for no reason, women whine for no reason. In fact, reason and logic is not much in this movie. For example, "we must find Stephanie" "yes I can't believe I spoke to her as last night" "she called you last night?" "Yes, she would talk about a date when she was asked." "WHAT? How did she not tell me?" Like in, our friend is chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and a host of grisly weapons, but I have a problem that she didn't tell me she was on a date. <br /> <br /> Okay, so the budget is low. That doesn't mean you have to make it look like it costs half the budget. "Score" is interesting since everyone - with the exception of one - tracks has been written and performed by the film's authors / directors. In fact, it seems that the entire budget has been blown on sampling a track by The Duskfall, a death metal band from Sweden. <br /> <br /> The most worrying thing in the whole movie is the end that leaves us with the option of a sequel.
