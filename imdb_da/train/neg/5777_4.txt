It's fun when you stop and think about it: scary movie fans usually have a deep and close affection for those who scare the daylight out of them. Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE can give us nightmares, but who among us (the faithful) did not feel a very true love of Gunnar Hansen in BRUTAL MASSACRE or Ken Foree, forever the resolute of the original DAY OF THE DEATH? His cameo in the remake made me stand up and cheer (as did Tom Savinis cameo); I'm not asking you. And Brian Halloran and ... Well, you get my scam (if not, just stand down ...). These are some of the horror heroes. To see this, many of them are gathered in a single movie almost unheard of (at least to this extent to my knowledge). If only the author (s) had been up to such a monumental task. Maybe others, somewhere along the line, will try again. As long as it's not another half-hearted effort (such as BROTHER OF BLOOD).
