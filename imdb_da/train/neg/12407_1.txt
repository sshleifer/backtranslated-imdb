Alicianne (Laurel Barnett) is living in babysitter for young Rosalie Nordon (Rosalione Cole) who recently lost her mother. But Rosalie misses her dead mother a lot and regularly visits her grave (conveniently located at a cemetery right behind the house) late at night ... where she also meets her "friends" ... <br /> <br /> This starts well with a really creepy sequence in the cemetery ... then falling apart. The story is thin and there are tons of padding to make the movie 85 minutes long. The play is terrible across the board (with Cole being the worst). Poorly aimed at some of the WORST edits I've ever seen in a movie. Scenes (and sound) are only cut off without rhyme or reason. The film also has horrible (and obviously) post-production sounds. <br /> <br /> For blood and violence - forget it! There is very little and what looks looks incredibly false. I have never seen such false-looking blood - similar to ketchup! Drilling, meaningless - a legally forgotten running film. You can skip this one.
