Just okay screaming about a lovely suburban family dealing with their parents' death and "stuff" in the basement that they continue to feed people they pick up from the street. Of course there is more to it then, but to say more would tell. <br /> <br /> For me it just didn't come together as it tries to get it two ways both as a family drama and a horror movie. The film tries very hard to get ahead of the two genres, but seems more to stumble everywhere as it tries to be shocking, something it never is. It does not help that the final revelation is less a scare than a "oh" as in "Oh, is it?". Maybe if I hadn't seen so many horror movies recently, it might have been better, or maybe it just seemed like I wouldn't have compared it to that much. <br /> <br /> I would take a pass
