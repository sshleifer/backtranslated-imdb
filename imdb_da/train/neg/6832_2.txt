I liked this movie, but Van Damme does just the same old same old waste time after time. Poo knickers are fighting scenes as usual. The only thing this loser released was the Russians, who usually end up being killed in the end. This movie is totally doggy making of the highest character, please kindly get Van Damme some plays you need for them. Anyone who likes Van Damme has problems. It seems sad that the only way Van Damme ever gets a play is when he co writes the film, co produces the movie and plays the screen shot for the movie. AVOID VAN DAMME AND HIS LICKED BACK NASTY WIG. I give this movie a two out of ten, because the one with the sandman was better. To add disgrace to injury, I wasted a kitten on this fertilizer
