This was a new always low among westerns. The scripture is incredibly bad, signs are impossible to emphasize with and are either obnoxious or bland, the violence is shaking and technically not very convincingly done. And Tobey Maguire shows us his talents' flip side, sleeps through his part with the expressionless eyes and the raspy voice of his, which here only excludes manic. 'Ride with the Devil' is one of my five worst movie experiences ever, a Western one that never goes into negative respect.
