This ABC straight-to-TV bug is absolutely no justice to the brilliant fantasy novel that is A Wrinkle in Time. Mrs Madeleine L'Engle brought children and adults into a magical, amazing and original world like no author before her. This novel, the first in her 'quartet,' is a beautiful outcome to life, the universe and the time itself. But it is easy for any child or youth to understand. Its unparalleled morality is widespread throughout the book. This film adaptation can be seen as nothing but a mockery of Mrs L'Engle's work of art. Honestly, what were they thinking? The effects seem to be cheap and ridiculous, the plot is green and uneven, the dialogue is removed, and almost every magic characteristic of the novel has been lost. This was a terrible attempt to bring this book to the screen. I sincerely hope that an intelligent, dignified instructor (Guillermo del Toro, David Yates, Alfonso Cuar√≥n) once tries to put this book on the screen and understands what it really is: a masterpiece. This adaptation can only be compared to dull, false and inexpensive motel space art that has no reason and has absolutely no influence on the audience.
