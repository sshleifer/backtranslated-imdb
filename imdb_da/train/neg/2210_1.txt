This was a really fun movie. Every 1 in the movie tried to be serious, that was what made this movie so fun. I mean to get on the shark's head on a human body. May it be more fun. Good work Sci-Fi keeps the comedy films coming. I never thought that movies could be more retarded. If they stop, they will have to rename the sci-fi channel to the comedy sci channel or something similar. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for the next movie from sci fi. <br /> <br /> I'm ready with a bowl of popcorn and a case of beer or a bottle of liquor and I'm ready to laugh again !!!
