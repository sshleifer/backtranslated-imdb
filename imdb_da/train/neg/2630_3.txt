SPOILER ALERT! ! ! Personally, I do not understand why Pete did not help save Williams's life. I think it would be great to know why William was motivated or forced. I think Secret Service members are people every day, and the reputation of the author was a member of the secret service, now his motivations are clear, familiar. But as a rental, this movie will not satisfy you because the old but used terms, the average action - these are just things in this movie, just to keep you waiting for the end. Klip Johnson as director of SWAT did a much better job this time, and I still wonder how the producers (for example Michael Douglas) left this movie to theaters.
