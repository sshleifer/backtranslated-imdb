I liked the movie despite the terrible pace. BUT I did not appreciate the comment that Canada was referred to as Montana North. It is certainly not Montana North and will never be. The Americans wonder why they are perceived as arrogant in the rest of the world, and that is one of the reasons for that. Stop teaching the kids in the United States to believe they own the planet. Such a centrist world view is not becoming one of the world's great nations. Even in jest. I will never refer to the United States as "Alberta South". Walt would never sit down, so why start now. Apart from that, the movie was pretty foggy, better luck next time.
