Anyone who is not aware of the original British lion movie 'The Wicker Man' from 1973, would undoubtedly have left the cinema with the impression 'Poor' and 'Peurile'. As a devotee to the original I left with the impression pure poor. From the grim reality of bursting tooth spreads, the power of the law and order draws to a web of paganistic barbaric ritual on a distant Scottish island called Summerisle (the original) to a near Amazon ic colony off the Maine coast of the United States, named summersisle, hardly remake the place. <br /> <br /> this is, unfortunately, a case of what could have been a classic remake of a classic being manipulated to accommodate a single minded audience. Nothing more and nothing less. <br /> <br /> Men (or given the reworked context of the movie) Women Involved ... hang your heads in shame.
