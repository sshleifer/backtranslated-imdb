There are so many comments on this movie, but I found them to be misleading. This is a corner cut, overrun scenario, where a normal human being becomes a crime partner to any of the opposite sex for no apparent reason. The boy meets the girl. The girl holds the boy on the gun for something ridiculous. Boy is fascinated. <br /> <br /> You know the drill: The antagonist turns out to be a wild, free spirit instead of a sociopath ... Shoot with a few words of wisdom from Alice Drummond, and you have a recipe for Love. Sheedy is "is she crazy or does she just need a hug?" The role of The Breakfast Club simply serie as a protagonist. And all that's left is a really horrible turkey of a movie.
