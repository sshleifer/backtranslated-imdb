ILL. Really stands for so incredibly crappy I killed myself. There was absolutely no action to talk about. The best part of the whole production was the artwork on the box cover. The budget for this film was sufficient. The movie was sub sesame street. The production is similar to the underground filming for mob hits. The props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store. The ending was so predictable that you had to fast forward to the last 5 minutes and laugh. If there's a book out there for this movie, I'm sure it's better. I would avoid it at all costs. I enjoyed the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth. Just for fun.
