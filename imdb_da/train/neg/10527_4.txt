I discovered this movie with a reseller selling OOPs. And this is definitely an OOP. One year after The Exorcist she's back in business with this movie, but what we all new was that Blair's career never broke out, she never became a megastar. That's one of the reasons why many of her films are OOP. She gives a good performance in this movie. It's about a refusal that is not recognized by her parents and has no friends. The game at age 15 plays a girl of 14, it's fun. The film is also known for the rape scene in the showers, where they keep a cushion on their virginity. In most editions it is cut out why I do not know, no blood is involved, okay, Blair is butt naked, but nothing is shown, no T & A saw nothing to offend people. But the film is slow, extremely slow. I'm not happy about that, but I almost slept. It is just that 14-year-olds become a rebellion against society, but no blood flows, no one does nothing. Why this is categorized in horror is still a marvel to me. If you are a fan of Blair, buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is.
