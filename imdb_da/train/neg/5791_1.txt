As a native film professor, I can honestly say that this may be one of the worst movies with native content I've ever seen. I'd rather get a root canal than watch this movie again. The use of stereotypes, uncreative attempts to exploit portions of traditional coyote stories and poor camera work became worse only with glib uncreative storyline and bad script. The author and director have shown the worst parts of a colonized approach to portraying native people and societies. If this person is native, they have to go home and apologize to everyone they know to be an apple and to internalized racism and the bad sense of humor they have developed. If this person is non-resident, they must seriously re-examine their white privilege and ask themselves if they are unexamined, unintentional racism, or if they are deliberately ignorant. My only hope is that the native actors in this movie had a good time and at least got paid for their efforts. If you want to see good native movies, check out the Christmas in the clouds, dance me outside, the Medicine River, PowWow Highway, Smoke Signals ... just to name a few.
