SPOILERS ALL !!!! <br /> <br /> I had read the book "1st to die" and wanted to see if the movie followed the book so I saw it. Mostly it did. There were some minor differences (location of the last violent scene for example), but not many and mostly the film was true to the book more so saw most movies. <br /> <br /> This may have been a mistake - though the movie was the perfect cast with Pollen and Bellows especially - I wasn't so impressed with the book. Or let me take it back. I started very impressed, was gradually more disillusioned and at the end was left completely dissatisfied and felt almost gypped. No difference with the movie. Here's why. <br /> <br /> There is no "payoff" in the book or in the movie. Rarely have I read one who has done what has created such a downfall with the final resolution, and I was hoping that the movie would vary slightly. All (he did it, no she did it, NO they did both) - was not interesting, not fascinating and more confusing, annoying and depressing than anything else. In addition, love for Lindsay's life dies at the end (after the HER disease clears and she cries at her grave). And then cut to where she is considering suicide .... then suddenly she is in a fight for her life with the real villain who was cleared after being arrested .. but it turns out he and the wife were together in it .. .. HELLO !!! Everything has now become "GENERAL HOSPITAL" instead of a good old-fashioned thriller. I felt cheated and ripped off the book and looked at the movie (I must admit that I kept my attention nicely - the actor was very good at a TV movie) hoping it would not follow the book it ended. /> <br /> I still think the movie can be seen and for some reason does not leave so bad a taste in the mouth as the book (or maybe it's just that I knew what would happen) But I have to say how this story was not well done at all.
