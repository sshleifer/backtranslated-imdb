Before I start, I _love_ Eddie Izzard. I think he's one of the funniest stand-ups around today. Perhaps that means I go into this with too high expectations, but I just found Eddie fun in this outing. I think the main problem is Eddie trying too hard to be Eddie. Everyone knows him as a completely irrelevant cartoon, and we all love him for it. But in Circle he seems to be more irrelevant than fun and totally lost me in places. Many of the issues he covers he has covered before - I even think I recognized a couple of recycled jokes in there. <br /> <br /> If you buy the DVD, you will find a back-scene look at Eddie's tour (interesting in places, but not much fun) and a French language version of one of his shows. Die-hards will enjoy watching Eddie in another language, but subtitle comedy is not very fun. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Eddie, you've either already got it or you're going to buy it what I say. If you just pass by, buy Glorious or Dressed to Kill - you won't be disappointed. With Circle you will surely.
