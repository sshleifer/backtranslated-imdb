Elephants Dream should be the flagship project for the open source community. And while it was a very interesting idea in the concept, it has really failed. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully reproduced, which is probably the only redeeming factor. A major problem with them, however, is the large override of light bulbs. It's terrible, though I think it helps to give the film a dreamless quality. One thing to note is the terrible voice acting. While Proog's voice actor is at least semi-competent, Emo's voice actor is HORRIBLE. I assume that when you have a budget that amounts to almost zero, you cannot afford to hire real voters. For me, it seems that they hired one of the animators to make his voice. <br /> <br /> As a whole, the movie doesn't go anywhere. For me, it seems more of a "see what we can do" kind of movie instead of a real movie. The reason goes nowhere and fails by really showing some interesting point. The whole movie feels like it was made as an excuse to get interesting places. <br /> <br /> Overall, it can be worth the quick download from the official site, but don't expect anything but beautiful graphics.
