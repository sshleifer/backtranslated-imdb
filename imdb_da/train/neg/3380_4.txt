Michael Bennett and Nicholas Dante's Broadway show ran for years, but signs of its power and charisma are lost in this movie adaptation, which probably comes from the election of director (Richard Attenborough, as far as B-way you could get) and leading actor (Michael Douglas, who plays a director choreographer as a slim corporate lawyer). The slender story of a laughing audition for a Broadway show that turns into a therapy session for the actor singers is pushed straight up on us, with loud, brash talents playing to the barriers. Nothing is modulated or subtle, especially a ridiculous subplot of an ex-dancer returning to the theater and old-flame Douglas headers. The indulgent hopefuls are full of promise and heartache, but their personal stories of anxiety are a bit embarrassing; This matched Attenborough's inertia, spell disaster, and even the now famous songs avoid breaking through artificial wrapping. * 1/2 from ****
