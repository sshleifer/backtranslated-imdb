I will start by saying that I could not get through it completely. I picked it up on a rainy day from WalMart as the rest of the reviewers on this site. I figured there was no way I would regret my purchase. Was I wrong or what? Seriously now, who approved this project? They have to be forced to watch this movie again and again until the end of eternity. It's the only appropriate punishment I can think of to release something so bad. The shooting reminds me of the movies I used to make for class projects on a large old VHS camera. The action is not much better. I think the only difference is that there are a few cool comedies. Yay, who cares ... Shecky Moskowitz is unfunny, and the ship's comedian is an even bigger loser. It's about as much of the plot as I understood. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I own it on DVD and have given it to many colleagues to watch. Everybody comes back and laughs and says, "Wow I didn't think I'd ever say I closed an Adam Sandler movie 15 minutes in ...." <br /> <br /> My answer is always "Well now can you "<br /> <br />
