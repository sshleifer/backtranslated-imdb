I once thought "The Stoned Age" was the worst movie ever made ... I was wrong. "Hobgoblins" surpassed it in every way I could imagine and a couple I couldn't. In "The Stoned Age" I hated the characters. In "Hobgoblins" I hated the actors ... and everyone else involved in creating this cruelty. I don't want to include a teaser for this movie, I'm not that cruel. I couldn't submit to innocent people like yourself for such torment. In fact, any discussion of plot related to this movie is pointless and degrading. Words I want to use to describe this movie are as follows: insipid, asinine and insidious. <br /> <br /> Finally, don't watch this movie. I ask for you, from a movie lover to another ... no, from one person to another, PLEASE. For the sake of your own beauty and intellect, do not see it. Destroy all copies you come across.
