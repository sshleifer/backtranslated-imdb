With an amazing cast and crew, this may have been a classic. Instead, it is a repeated paraphrasing of all the conspiracy theories that existed in 1979, about the JFK murder, which was grafted, rather meaningless, to a disjointed plot of the murder of the fictional president Kegan in 1960. They are also not given enough to do - Sterling Hayden or Eli Wallach, for example, or they are asked to go quite luridly over the top - John Huston. Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins manage to pamper themselves very well in their very different ways. <br /> <br /> Photography is beautiful but does not justify an hour and a half of your life or the price of DVD purchases.
