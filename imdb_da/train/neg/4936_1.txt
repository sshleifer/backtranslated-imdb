I wasted my time and gave this chance a chance. This should be one of the worst new shows. If they gave a prize to show that suck, one should sweep the category. The play is poor and history is constructed. Now the dinosaurs were a little weird, but at least it was entertaining. That show lasted three seasons and was finally scraped. This new show, based on an insurance company's advertising, is not fun and really does not matter. Possibly they are original advertisements and the number of times they were, and still repeated what is wrong with this show. It just came to television and we are already tired of seeing the "caveman" people.
