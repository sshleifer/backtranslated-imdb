There is no way on earth you have to worry about any of these signs. A bunch of spoiled middle-class overgrown children take some drugs at a party and go with each other and argue. I just watched this on TV, and I didn't think it was a 'movie' as such, more a post-'This Life 'indulgence that really doesn't have any resonance or proper drama to it. Things like this will be put to use for the week's unreliable, middle-class "lifestyle" crap that takes itself too seriously. It has David Baddiel in it and the bird out of "Cold Feet" you know what to expect. There were many of these things in 2000, it was a particular British disadvantage ... "they are educated and do drugs" friends, but a little dysfunctional and with incestuous relationships "sounds good!". This kind of nonsense, and after Guy Ritchie's comedy gangster stuff ... dark days. If you have taste, this will annoy you to the point of violence.
