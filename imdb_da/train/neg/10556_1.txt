This is a good example of how to NOT make a movie. <br /> <br /> There is very little meaningful dialogue, no context for the events, and constant cuts between seemingly unrelated scenes. The result is a confused, clueless viewer; the plot is absolutely impossible to follow, and the ideas presented are meaningless without listening to the instructor's comment. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot to do with human cruelty and tries to show how wrong it is, with emphasis on child abuse. It contains some stock footage of real, horrific acts of violence, including wartime executions. Although it works in conjunction with the film, I feel that the ideas behind the film could have been presented without resorting to such extreme content. This film is absolutely NOT for the weak lean or slightly offended and should under no circumstances appear to minors. <br /> <br /> The climax is anti-climactic compared to the content of the rest of the film. If you do not listen to the comment while it does, you will probably miss it. <br /> <br /> The director's comment was a one-shot, "put the guy and let him talk, no cuts" comment. Although this is not necessarily bad, the instructor ends a lot and often spends minutes at a time complaining about his college, filming, co-producers, bad movie and a dozen other things. The constant negativity detracts from what is otherwise an important tool for understanding the film. The film was shot many years ago on 16mm and Super8 movies over a period of four years on an extremely low budget. Because of this, the video and audio quality is poor. That alone does not make it a bad movie, but it makes a bad movie worse.
