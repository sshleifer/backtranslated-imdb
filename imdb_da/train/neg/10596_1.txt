Van Damme. What more can I say? Bill Goldberg. LIKE THAT. NOW we know this movie is really awful. <br /> <br /> I saw the first five minutes of this movie on TBS, as it knew it would be bad. But I didn't even think it would be so bad. The reason is horrible, Van Damme gets old (finally), but unlike Arnold, his film is too. <br /> <br /> Forget about this movie. Don't see it. Ever. I wouldn't even be paid to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars - in the heart lies a wonderful, action-packed exciting ride. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe not, but marketers will surely have us thinking, wouldn't they? <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
