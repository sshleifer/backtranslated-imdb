Where to start ... If this movie had been a dark comedy, I would say it was FANN-TASTIC! Unfortunately for me, and everyone else with spare time and a buck to save (remember it was the price I paid, got it from Wal-Mart), this movie was supposed to be a thriller. The only THRILL I got was to see Kirkland's miserable rendition of Anne Wilkes from Misery Sans Snowy Woodland Area. If you want a good laugh, on a rainy Friday night with some friends, then I highly recommend this movie. But if you want to see something at least halfway decent, then don't even disturb. <br /> <br /> For a enjoyable movie, the worse it is in most cases. But Wow ... I mean WOW !! The only person in the whole movie who didn't stink up was the little boy playing by Vincent Berry. The only reason I myself give it 3 stars is because it gave me something to do.
