Jill Dunne (played by Mitzi Kapture), is an attractive, handsome woman, overwhelmed by a beautiful mouthed teenage daughter, Liv (Martha MacIsaac) and a small, two-timing man, Sean (Rick Roberts), both boring self-centered and uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> This was announced as a troubled family, spoiled by a crazy killer in a relentless storm. The storm does not even occur in the last 5 minutes of the movie, and then it is nothing to send anyone running to the storm cellar. <br /> <br /> Stalking doesn't get intense until almost the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie we use to listen to Jill and her unbearable daughter, Liv, argues until I just wanted to let go of the daughter next week. <br /> <br /> Jill's problem with Liv is that she's taken up with Zack, a boy of questionable character, and they're about to make it - in fact, Jill comes home to find them two on Liv's bed. <br /> <br /> The rest of the time we spend listening to Jill's husband Sean either whine at Jill or criticize her. <br /> <br /> Sean was not at all appealing - as his face is so covered in freckles, you can play connecting dots. <br /> <The story begins with Jill being informed of an outstanding bill on their credit card for a hotel she has never been to and that she believed Sean had never been to either. <br /> <br /> Jill goes to the hotel where she meets the owner and manager, Richard Grant (Nick Mancuso), a very nice, older, divorced man who is sympathetic to her. In fact, when he spots her husband there again, he rings Jill and tips her off. <br /> <br /> Jill returns to the hotel, sees Sean with another woman. She is sad, without Sean seeing her and doing absolutely nothing. In fact, she doesn't even say anything to Sean when he comes home. It made no sense to me. <br /> <br /> Jill has given Richard his business card, and then he calls her and she appears to be in real estate. She shows him an apartment. Afterwards they have a drink and things get cozy between them. <br /> <br /> Richard and Jill get it on, hot and heavy. In fact, he seems a little more aggressive than necessary when Jill suddenly decides to cut out. <br /> <br /> Jill and Sean have a confrontation about his cheating. Sean whines about how Jill has knocked him down since her father died. Apparently, his lack of any morality is all his fault. In the end, Jill acknowledges her own lack of morality and closeness to Sean - and of course it's also his fault for Sean. <br /> <br /> The little family decides to go on a camping trip- It means more whining and grousing among them, especially from the spoiled daughter. <br /> <br /> I was so rooting for the stalker to get everyone, but Jill. <br /> <br /> 3 stars
