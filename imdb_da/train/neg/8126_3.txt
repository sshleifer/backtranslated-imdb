I didn't think it was as horrible as some people seem to do. It passes as one of the osteic horror movies you can waste time in the middle of the night when you can't sleep, although it is not better quality than that. It is true that the play is not fantastic - I thought Marianne McAndrew, as Cathy Beck, was, for example, completely overpowered - but the biggest problem is that several aspects of the plot did not really make sense to me. Becks is on a journey described by John (Stewart Moss) as a part work and partly the honeymoon they never had (now it's romantic!) The work part has something to do with touring caves, which in itself sounds strange to a travel group through a cave does it relate to everybody's work?) But it becomes strange when we find out that he is a doctor who is researching preventive medicine (huh? This connection lost me completely.) Bitten by a bat while in cave he begins to transform to what I suppose to be a human-bat hybrid (although we finally see him in makeup, he looks much more like a monkey man of some sort) and a killing spree starts. Here's another problem. The first killing is a nurse in a hospital. First, everyone thinks her death was an accident. The second murder is a young girl who is described as having her neck torn out. The Sheriff (Michael Pataki) tells us that her death resembled the nurse (which means the neck ripped out? - How could anyone believe it was an accident?) And what about the sheriff? He seems pretty unobtrusive to the scene in Cathy's hotel room when he takes a fluid flight and then almost rapes her, after which everything seems to go back to normal. It's saddled with an end that left almost everything undissolved and also with one of the most annoying themed songs I've ever heard in a movie. Even for all that, there was something here that kept me in mind. Sometimes pure cheesiness can get you through an hour and a half. Pretty bad, yes - but not as terrible as some say.
