Cut for the hunt, this is one of the five worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Not that they didn't try. There was something decent to write with some elements of structure in there, a good throw, some good plays. I'm not sure where it went wrong, but it went awful. <br /> <br /> Some elements may have been poor structures and no table of contents, very overactive by the management (which is probably much better when maintained), some bad directions and editing. I had enough of about an hour, tearing my hair out for about an hour and a half and very agitated for an hour and fifty minutes running it. There was also some uncertainty about everything, namely that I went with someone who used to be a heroin addict. He was agitated that it glamorized something that had nothing good for it. It was enhanced by the beautiful 17-year-old girl who was in love with the 30-year-old junkie. <br /> <br /> And the management's huge nature was an off-off enough. There were lumpy plot points that were an attempt at a structure, but the end result was unclear and infinite (with uneven timelines). The characters were colorful but endless, which made me feel bad for the quality actors you just haven't seen enough. <br /> <br /> Skip it. I assumed this was a first-time instructor who was enchanted by his own Turks, but he has done so before. I am amazed at how this and many other really bad ideas find someone who will actually give them money.
