This is a scary piece of storytelling. It's about an hour into the movie before we have a big idea of ​​what it should be about; the characters often murmur intolerably; actions often do not seem to have any relation to each other; no one seems to be worried about who actually murdered the girl; a few creepy children swim in water that seems threatening, but nothing happens; The Irishman is hit in the face by one of his friends without apparent reason ... continuing would be as boring as the movie itself. The only half-entertaining element is landscape photography; But someone could point a camera at the Australian Outback a few memorable shots. Overall - boring, incoherent, pretentious - and even annoying to waste so much of the viewer's time.
