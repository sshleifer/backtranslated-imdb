Unfortunately, this has appeared on Star Movies here in Thailand last week or so. It's a complete garbage game. As another member said, this film is a good example of 'how not to act'. I haven't seen a movie so badly acted for a long time. The actors (can you call them 'actors'?) Are completely flat and deliver their lines with the passion of a dead dog. I would say that to really understand how bad the play is, you must see the movie ... but it would be related to torture. I cringe as the leading lady delivers her lines, and the rest of the throws with their accents (fake or constructed) are just as disgusting. Another actress with the fake British accent was right, yes, but good gentleman was horrible for her. Mix it with her (missing) action and you have a disaster. She should just have said nothing and I could have accepted her as the beautiful girl. Oh my, we got to the scene where the lady of the leading lady says "Really me?" after a forced crying scene from her. Ridiculous. No, really, I just laughed out loud. <br /> <br /> The sets and art directors give some scanty grace to the movie. Some of the sets are colorful and some of the scenes are pretty nice (minus the actors). The old magic potion lady? What?! Another member mentioned the "modern" love song that was in the movie. Totally inappropriate for a period that was set about 500 years ago. <br /> <br /> I understand that the movie was considered "Big Budget" in Thailand at the time of its production. I would be seriously upset if I were the producer of this movie. Just to show that money doesn't necessarily make a good (or even mediocre) movie. <br /> <br /> I would give King Maker a 1 out of 10, but costumes and sets allow you to save the movie from such a rating. 2 out of 10
