I am sorry that a historical period that is so fascinating and so rich in material for film can be made into a hum-event. Wm C Quantrill was hardly shown in the film, probably the most intricate figure in the period. Frank James was never mentioned, Cole Younger, ditto and Bloody Bill Anderson, who would cry for his murdered sister every time he went into battle, was completely absent in the manuscript. Instead, we were forced to see fictitious characters that never evolved into anyone we used to. how sad. Costumes were wonderful though, as was the location shoots in Missouri. I hope Ang Lee will make another movie from the trial and try again, or another movie producer will look at the vast array of material to write a play on.
