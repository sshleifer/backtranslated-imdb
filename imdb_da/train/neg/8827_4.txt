I love the 80s slasher flicks, and I remember when "Silent Night / Deadly Night" was pulled from our theaters, I was very disappointed so I was very excited to see some of these on Fear.net. You are better aware of what I expected of these types of movies. The quality of the special effects was ridiculous based on today's standards, character development too long, but all in all, it was laughable! <br /> <br /> The scenes where he loses it, because Santa, aka dad, feels his mother and later, when the mob actually shows lighting torches - not flashlights like in the 80s, but real torches! - really tickled my funny legs. But the scenes where he controlled the children in his neighborhood gave me a creepy feeling of another character. I also enjoyed trying to find out who some of these character actors were. It took me a while to find out that the protagonist was the beloved teddy bear on the brothers.
