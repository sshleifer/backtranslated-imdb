First of all, I want to say that this movie is worth more than the four stars I have judged it. I gave it four stars because for me this 86 minute movie always seems like 2 and a half hours and is not engaging enough to sit through it all. But "The Big Alligator River" (the title my DVD calls it) is better than your average nature hitting the movie. <br /> <br /> A tourist town in the jungles of Southeast Asia opens and uses the natives while trying to manipulate the wildlife around. Mother Nature seeks revenge comes in the form of god Kroona, a giant alligator. But the creature is not the only thing, tourists and protagonists (photographer and resort staff) have to worry about, the natives are rubbed the wrong way too. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pretty well done adventure / horror story with a good musical score and direction. But the alligator himself, the film's main attraction, is of course false appearance. Some of the close-ups of its jaws are good, but it has to be everything we should see. Some of the underwater shots make it painfully obvious that what we are really dealing with is an alligator that cracks toys, you can probably come to a zoo-souvenir shop. But the natives are trustworthy, if not authentic. Probably not the movie that gives you undisturbed excitement, if any, but shot and produced well enough to be well publicized. And as a lot of creature movies, this ends an extremely high body count. It also has lots of good jungle landscapes. However, it is below par, but who expected to be better, eh? <br /> <br /> Much, much better than the latest US counterpart "Primeival," but nothing to compare to "Jaws". But remember it may not be engaging in a few points.
