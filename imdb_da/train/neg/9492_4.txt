A star for the "plot". A star for the actor. A star for copying to flabbergasted American. Five stars for Monica Broeke and Inge Maria Granzow, with their propensity to take away all their clothes. And ten out of ten to the divine Emmanuelle BÃ©art, two years before she made 'Manon des sources'. Both of them are also undressed a few times, but even fully equipped, her presence is enough to make this film widely available. Watch the scene where she tells her friend about the three "first times" for a girl. It is corny, but still far more erotic than the slightly ridiculously choreographed "love scenes" with Broeke, Granzow and Patrick Bauchau. Moreover, the cinematography is not great; The stills for the final credits are a better indication of what David Hamilton is capable of.
