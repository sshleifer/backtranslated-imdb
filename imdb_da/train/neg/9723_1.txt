Jeux d'enfants or how the movie was mistakenly translated into English Love me, if you dare, a movie is made by stupid people and by stupid people. I just don't know how to expect something worth watching from a movie with such a plot: Two stupid ignorant kids bet that each one will do something (certainly extremely idiotic) to prove each other (wtf?) That they are "cool dudes". I know I exaggerated some aspects, but that's what the whole movie is about. They grow older ... and instead of realizing that they are just a few alienated, we continue to do their crazy things and think they are good people. You could expect a movie from Hollywood, but France? It is even more offensive to watch the film from the country that created Amelie a few years ago, which btw the movie is trying to look like, but is far, extremely far away. <br /> <br /> Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.
