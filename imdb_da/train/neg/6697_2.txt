Crazed Shotgun toting-incest driven avid searching truck drivers and obsessive control disturbance "father raped me when I was 12" handcuffs, and all latex wearing prostitutes are just a few of the characters you will be introduced to in this complete disgrace of a movie. seen at a cable TV station (IE: Skinemax) at 4pm on Sunday nights. (And yes I know it was a whole sentence, but just with me people, this is a long-standing review for a short pointless movie). <br /> <br /> Filmed in "a place" Canada, with almost no budget, plot for this freak show is trite, the police in it apparently never heard of "State jurisdiction" because they end up chasing both Miya (Hookers ) and Trent (Idiotic, Anal Retentive, Generic, Unsafe College Student) across the United States (and I thought only the FBI could do that). The camera is shaken, the sex scenes are mediocre, and the play is so bad it can actually cause accidental acid flashbacks to movies like "Ishtar" and "Leonard Part 6". <br /> <br /> As for the skin scene go (which is the only reason to rent this movie yourself, don't even think about buying it) there are two of them. The first is the only one worth seeing, but what is the Dominatrix Sex scene with Kari Salin and ____ (insert unknown actor here, of course he has done nothing else worth noting) in a filthy, disgusting motel room (the kind with the busted sink drips and the soda machine outside that only has blue tonic water left in it). It's all S&M (riding crops, handcuffs, hot wax and underwear licking) people and finally he comes to the left in a motel room with no money and the police are waiting for his door (it goes to show you, don't let a hooker tie yourself in a "middle-of-nowhere" motel room). Unfortunately, Kari does not show any skin that is worth remembering, and that alone can lead to profound traumatic experiences for some gentlemen, so it is definitely a downer to this flick. <br /> <br /> At the end, * Snicker * Snicker * I know you probably would mind if I revealed it to you, but I don't want you to spend your hard earned money on it one. All in all, I give it a 1/5 to action, a 3/5 for Skin (see last paragraph) and a 0/0 for acting, character development or intricate plot twists. <br /> <br /> - Laughing Man
