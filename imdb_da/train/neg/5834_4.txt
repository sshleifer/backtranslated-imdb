I saw the pilot and noticed more than a few similarities between 3 kg and House, M.D .. Tucci's character is brilliant but socially inappropriate, similar to Laurie's character house, but without the acherian white that Laurie brings to House. Meanwhile, Tucci's 'straight guy', the coveted doctor of victory, has not been developed into a more interesting character, such as the fallible 'straight guys' Cuddy and Wilson. Indira Varma's character Adrienne Holland is too similar to Jennifer Morrison's doctor Cameron as a co-incidence. A person at CBS of course informed House, MD's success and told his staff to get him (her) a similar show, hoping that imitation would prove successful. However, copying a show like House claims the same high-balance white and excitement balance, and Tucci and company just aren't up to the challenge. I didn't know that the show was canceled before I read comments on IMDb, but it doesn't come as a surprise to me.
