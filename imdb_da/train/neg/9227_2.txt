CQ was the worst movie I saw this year. Almost every movie I choose to watch in the theater is at least entertaining or has something to say. This film looked as if it was being directed by a film student to his intro. for film-making class. His father makes amazing movies. His sister made a good one. But Brother Roman? NONE! One critic made sense to compare this movie with Godards Le MÃ©pris (contempt). Mens Coppola, Jr. Taking the same idea, a movie about movies, he tried too hard to make him seem European, artistic and witty when all is just kitsch. The main actor carries the same expression throughout the film as if he were either in awe or in shock by this movie being made around him. Schwartzman somehow manages to pull his role as a flamboyant director. Depardieu is okay. One scene, which has no real film spoof humor, is surprisingly not B-movie scenes, but rather one that takes place in Italy; a montage of shots of several characters inside a very small car that drives around by picking up and getting rid of random people. This was the only thing that reminded me of the cinema, I guess he was trying to spot. Or rip-off. Or both. The documentary with the head that speaks into the camera and occupied by various objects has been played, the end was marked by a "twist" or artistic value ... I suppose the funniest thing about this movie was the movie itself and not as it intended. No wonder this movie was sent back after a festival screening to be edited or resumed or anything, which makes me curious about how bad it was before. I can't believe it could have been worse than this. To watch a good parody of movies, check out the Austin Powers movies. Any of them. The opening to the third is more entertaining and more genius than this whole movie. Lil 'Romy, for the cinema's sake, go back to managing your cousin's music videos. Leave The Godfathers to Father.
