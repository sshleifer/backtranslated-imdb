This movie was terribly horrible. The action was the worst! It was worse than a student movie. Super cheesy, and I think the worst actor was the old lady. First I thought of myself, yes it is an old movie. Then I remembered that it was no excuse! I've seen older movies with much better plays and such. <br /> <br /> The music was terrible. It was really rude. The editing was poor (most of the dialogue was out of sync.) <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie doesn't deserve a 1. I only watched it because I was so sad and the movie was hardly entertained me. It was just ridiculous. My late grandmother's left pinkie toe could make a better movie than this.
