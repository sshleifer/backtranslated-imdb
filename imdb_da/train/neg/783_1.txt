I saw this show and I didn't find it fun at all. It could have been the first episode. Most recently, I realize that ABC plays a lot of stupid shows today and goes down like a station. All the signs of this show are pretty bad actors, but even though they were good, the jokes and script are pretty awful and will still bring the show down. I would say that I think this show will be canceled, but to see how ABC is doing terrible for the quality of shows they play, they can just keep this one simply because it is average in proportion to them.
