I've heard about this novel long ago, many of my friends have recommended reading it. I searched it in all places and finally found it. This is a book that all people should read because it is genius and because of its vision. I enjoyed every page. <br /> <br /> I knew about the movie and couldn't wait to see it. When I finally got very disappointed, many things in the book are not in the movie (I don't think it's a spoiler) that just doesn't make the movie logical ... Michael Radford can be a good director but a bad writer. Especially as a bookshelf. The movie is not dark at all, the writing is really bad, the only thing that is good, even good, is the actor. John Hurt is a great actor and the only face I could see as Winston Smith himself. What reminds me the most is the people in IMDb who called this "The best fit ever" without even reading the book! Or by knowing something about screen writing! <br /> <br /> You can only understand the brilliance of history by reading the book, not considering this as an alternative. As a fan of the book, I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> The point I gave to this movie goes to the actor.
