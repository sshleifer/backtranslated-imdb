It's pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the movie itself. The piece of long "plot overview" written on the movie page contains details I couldn't get from watching the actual movie. I found myself constantly backing up to see what details I had just missed that could tell me what (bleep) was going on. Alas, to no avail - this movie leaves monstrous pieces of history if you could call it a story. It was as if they were trying to trick us into thinking there was some kind of movie here, filmed just enough, so there was an equality of equality and leaving the rest to our imagination. Newsflash for the creators: I paid to see you make a movie. I can sit at home and imagine plots and stories for free. And Rosario Dawson? This is someone I have never paid enough attention to give the name to the face and I can see why. She had one of the most artificial performances I have ever seen for a leading character in any movie, A or B. I figured okay, maybe she wouldn't really matter, just got a big deal on a movie she wasn't into? Wrong. She was listed as one of the producers. The next time you produce something, don't order yourself as the management if you can't act. If you really can, make a decent character for you to stay. Here too, the white / latino question was mentioned - yes, I hate to say it, but this film comes across as a swelling action against white college age men wearing baseball hats. That's what happens when there's nothing in the movie to win on the watcher in Latin characters. The Adrian character seems like a stingy jerk that is no better than the antagonist of history. As for the Mayan character, she did not seem like a real person. Yet I am ashamed of Hollywood that this movie was made by itself.
