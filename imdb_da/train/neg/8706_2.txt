If this is your first time experiencing the wonders of the cinema, if you've never seen a "Moving Picture" before, you think this movie is a god's child. BUT if you've seen a movie, a TV show, even Barney the Dinosaur, then you won't be very impressed with this movie. The Heck Barney dinosaur was even more realistic than dinos in this flick. <br /> <br /> Now I like B movies. I just watched "The Giant Gila Monster" just before I looked at this swill, and I liked that movie a lot better. It seems like a B movie. It has lamer dialogue, hokies acting, cheesier effects and an honest gosh real Gila Monster as the monster! Carno 3 does not pack much of a B movie stop. It has something to do and that the Polchek guy comes close to being fun a few times, but this movie is underwhelming, almost .... limp. It's the little engine that couldn't make of dinosaur movies. I'm not saying you shouldn't watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people may see chewing gum drying on a pavement and feeling entertained. If you're one of those people, give this movie a shot.
