I got myself a copy of this movie because it was the 1964 Zombie Bloodbath movie as one of its alternative titles. Perversely, this movie actually has a better rating on this site than the aforementioned title; which may mean that the other is really bad! This movie is also pretty bad; of course you can't go into a movie that calls itself 'Zombie Bloodbath' and expects to see a masterpiece and in fairness it lives up to the title with the amount of gore on display ... but it feels too old and tired which is not helped by the cruel act and stupid plot line. It's just your average nuclear spill that makes people turn into zombies, etc. The movie starts with a sequence that sees people melt, and it pretty much gives you what you are in; low quality zombie waste. There are lots of gore in the movie, and it is a really good job otherwise the movie would have been really boring. Zombie Bloodbath looks really cheap and was clearly composed of inexperienced filmmakers! The greatest influence seemed to be Romero's superior day for the dead, although it could really be almost anything that contains zombies and doings. It all boils down to a typical predictable and pointless ending, and generally I can't say I was impressed with it!
