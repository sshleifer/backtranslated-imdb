Irene Dunne completed her famous career with this so-so movie. She should have gone out with a bang, the classic actress she was, not in this immense, almost unknown movie. <br /> <br /> This lightweight comedy is okay, but nothing special. The first half is much better as it gets pretty stupid in the second half. Maybe Irene could see the manuscript on the wall and finish. Even her loud voice became a bit annoying in here. Rumor has it, she was not happy with this movie. One can see why. <br /> <br /> The story reminded me of a 1950s television sitcom. Talking about it, I thought David Nelson from the Ozzie & Harriet TV show was in this movie, but it turned out to be a very young Richard Crenna. He looked and sounded like Nelson. <br /> <br /> All in all, to the very best, at best and to a part pairing with a great actress.
