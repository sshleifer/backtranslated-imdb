Hobgoblins .... Hobgoblins .... where do I start?!? <br /> <br /> This movie gives Manos - Hands of Fate and Future War a run for their money as the worst movie ever made. This is fun to laugh at where Manos was just painful to see. Hobgoblins will end up in a time capsule somewhere like the perfect movie to describe the term: "80's cheeze". The actor (and I use this term loosely) is horrible, Hobgoblins are some of the worst dolls you will ever see, and the garden tool fight must be seen to be believed. The movie was the perfect vehicle for MST3K and that version is the only way to see this mess. This movie gives Mike and bots lots of ammunition to pull some of the funniest one-liners they've ever done. If you try to see this without the help of Mike and bots ..... God help you !!
