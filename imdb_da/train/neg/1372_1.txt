Saw this on TV. I'm glad I didn't go to the cinema to watch this or spend the money on rental. The movie is completely predictable - from the corrupt owner and planning to the snake electric cables. The reason is really weak and incredible - the avalanche expert guy is hit by a 20 foot surge of knee joint avalanche (using actual footage) and all he has to do is stand up and shake down. The avalanche thins down at a million miles per hour and stops dead next to the road. <br /> <br /> Some of the actual avalanche materials are impressive and show their devastating power. But the contract between the actual avalanche and the staged things makes this movie look even flimsier. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, don't bother with this, not even on T.V.
