Where does this movie start badly and ended badly! It is made up of extremely poor and unrealistic effects that made me hug in my seat, seriously, my cat could have acted better than this party. Part of it was actually ridiculous because it was so incredible I would have rated this lower but they have nothing else! So be aware of my warning and unless you are so bored with suicide and would like a good reason to continue your suicide task, don't bother with this. I'm still in shock that this could actually be released to the public, it should be a crime and everyone involved should be arrested. I collect that you've got that key now, so I'll leave it to you to decide.
