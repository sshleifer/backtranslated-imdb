I will admit that I am only a college student at this time, an English major knows it. At the time I watched this movie, I was a high school student - I want to say junior year, but it may have been a senior, hard to remember. My experience with quantum physics goes pretty much on my honorary physics course, an interest in quantum mechanics that has made me read about the subject in a number of books on the theoretical aspects of the field as well as any article I can find in Discover and the like. I'm not a PhD in any way. <br /> <br /> That said ... <br /> <br /> This movie is simply horrible. It is designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average New Age guru, who desperately wants to believe how special everyone is. My mother is such a person, and ever since she's seen this movie, she's been trying to get all her friends to see it and buy a copy of the movie. I tried to point out the various errors and problems I had seen with the film's logic and science - and they are many - and she dismissed my claims because "oh, so a high school student knows more than all the people with PhD." In this case, apparently so. <br /> <br /> Leaving the fact that earning a PhD student does not necessarily require a person to be correct or actually intelligent. To leave the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to debunk half of the movie. Leaving it behind, the filmmakers manipulated their interview with at least one of the participants to make it appear that he supported their beliefs when he actually opposed them. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on, but I think the intuitor did a really good job of debunking the movie, so please feel free to read it if you do. <br /> <br /> http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
