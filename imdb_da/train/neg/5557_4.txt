OK, but it makes a good movie? Well, not really, in my opinion. It is not much to recommend it. I found it very slow, boring, actually. It is also predictably largely through and through. Number one and two were somewhat predictable, but not so much. I also felt that this movie was quite campy at times, which I didn't really think fit for this series and character. Jeff Fahey plays the biggest bad guy in this installment. He is a decent enough actor, but I felt he played his character also over the top. I think it fits in with the tone of the movie, which would have been good if I had wanted film.plus, there were some pretty bad a liners. The character has not really developed as I had hoped. NÃ¥vel. It's just my opinion. Anyway for me, while this movie is not abysmal, it's pretty bad. I'm voting for Darkman III: 3.5 / 5
