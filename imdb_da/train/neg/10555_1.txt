First of all: I love good Splattermovies and are not afraid to get in touch with art, but this zero budget is nothing! The picture quality is so damn low, the soundtrack is the most annoying I have ever heard, and as far as FX ... yes, the super-low quality makes some of them not as bad as they would in a real movie (what this junk here is not). No concept, a wafer-thin story, primitive play and rare dialogue - I think I counted 10 sentences throughout the movie, every time repeating about 20 times ... same for many movie sequences (may be an indication for What kind of audience was this fate made!) The story seems to be that a young boy had to see his father's rape and kill his mother, get psychologically damaged and as an adult walks and perform a show of self-degradation. So far, so well ... But for these pseudo-art idiot directors, this plot is just a line to set inexpensively produced shock scenes in a row that has neither a message nor any meaning (newly-released intestines are thrown on a naked, bound woman in a ground hole ... why? and why is it the only time you see both the woman and the thrower in all bloody "movies" ??? Disturbing? Yes!! Ill? Yes!! Required? None! Artistic? NONE!!!!! Anyone celebrating this cheap gore show for art should visit their psychiatrist as soon as possible or see Pink Floyd's "The Wall" to see how a similar subject can be artificially created ... I hope that this was your first and last (!!!!!!!!) movie, Andrew Cobb ... !!!! And all you do-heads out there, remember: Not everything that looks cheap and obviously doesn't make sense is automatically "Art" ...
