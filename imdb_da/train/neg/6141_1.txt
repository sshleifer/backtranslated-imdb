One night I was waiting for my friends to come back to apt and "Gymkata" happened to be; I saw too much of it. It's really fun and terrible, really. Think about it this way - if in your job you had an idea of ​​something so bad and continued to perform it in such a terrible way as this, how long would you just last? Not as long as this movie. It's a must-see, of course.
