Russell Hopton acted in many films until his death in 1945. He instructed only 2 and "Black Gold" was one (the other was also from 1936). Frankie Darro had a sometimes abrasive screen presence, but in this he played a good child. Of course, he was quite popular on the "quickie" circuit - he made so many movies. In this he plays the son of an old oil rig who is convinced he will soon turn oil. <br /> <br /> J.C. Anderson (Berton Churchill) is trying to convince the old man to sell, knowing that oil will be beaten at all times. A geologist, Henry, comes on stage and helps "Fishtail's" father. He also convinces "Fishtail" to attend school regularly. Henry has an eye on Cynthia, the beautiful teacher. This was Gloria Shea's last film - she had started her career as Olive Shea in "Glorifying the American Girl" (1929). "Fishtail's" father is killed when the rig is sabotaged, and Henry is determined to bring Anderson and his cronies to justice. When Henry is kidnapped, Anderson tries to persuade "Fishtail" to sell his oil lease. It all ends well with oil being hit and "Fishtail" going to the military school. It's okay for a rainy day.
