Unfortunately, IMDb does not allow me to judge judges lower than 1. What a pity. This horrible movie is so bad that I actually knocked the damn thing out before the end. The script had a couple of bright moments, but it was so disgusting to control, edit, act, sound quality and especially timing on line delivery, so the judges are totally unbearable. The judges were announced as being a modern day cartoon style western, but in reality nothing was of that kind. It is best that the dog is at the bottom of your shoe. You can try to pretend it's okay, but it just stinks. Why video stores think it's okay to carry this kind of shed with constant gaps in the sound and worse than high school drama class trades are beyond me. We rent movies to see something better on TV. But judges are worse than the most pathetic SciFi Channel original. I intend to claim my money back from Hollywood Video.
