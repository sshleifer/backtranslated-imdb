The words "Swedish" and "action movies" are not mixed. It gets more and more clear with any attempt at the genre. This is another unsuccessful attempt. <br /> <br /> Lasse Brunell (Shanti Roney) is working on a military air base with top secret computer systems. One day foreign criminals threaten to harm their family if he does not do what they tell him. They want the secret equipment and will do everything they can to get it. <br /> <br /> This movie has its up and down. And usually in Swedish action movies there are no "ups", just "downs". So I guess something in this movie showed some quality. To begin with the positive remarks I can mention that the film is technically suitable. The recordings of aircraft and helicopters flying are well shot and look very nice. The action is of very varying quality. Shanti Roney makes a decent performance while Maria Bonnevie is stiff and unnatural as usual (I wonder how long Swedish instructors will continue to use her even though she has a wooden board? Stefan Sauk is ridiculous as the "cool" special forces man coming to the base to investigate. <br /> <br /> And what about action scenes? Well, as I said above, the flying wings and flying wings are fun, but apart from that there isn't much to talk about, and that's a common Problems with Swedish action movies There is just not enough action going on, maybe it is a budget problem, maybe it is film-creating culture, I do not know, but it affects the experience negatively, because frankly the story and the action are not good enough to make this movie can trust it. <br /> <br /> I rate this 4/10 for effort.
