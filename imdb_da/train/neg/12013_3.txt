I should have thought that any movie with the Poltergeist lady in it will not be good. It actually starts okay, but during the first murder scene you find out that the movie you are watching is a movie inside a movie. There are people sitting in a movie theater watching the movie. A girl in the audience is so annoying that I would have turned around and choked her. A little strange but far from good.
