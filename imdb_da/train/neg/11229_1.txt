They made me see this at school and it was terrible. The movie is outdated. The episodes become confusing because the fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting. The teachers talked about it as a treat, but it was really a painful boring experience. I have read that very few people who look like this are actors, but most of them do what they do in the real-life movie. This stands for cheesy that works very often. Also very often, the story becomes mildly scandalous and removed. I do not like the way some of the lines were written and wished they had more meaning for them. Although it was written to be educational, fun, exciting and hip, it became boring, dry, removed and old. I hope no one takes time to watch this movie because you would be fine to see it not.
