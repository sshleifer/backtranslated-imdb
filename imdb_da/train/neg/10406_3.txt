Warning: This review contains less spoilers. <br /> <br /> Now, the authors of the first Tremors are out of ideas. I'm a big fan of the first movie, and the first two followers are pretty good at direct fare. Tremors 4: Legends Begins, however, is a very boring movie. Where the heck is Graboids ??? <br /> <br /> Due to the relative shortage of Graboids over the first 90 minutes, I am convinced that this entry into the series is believed to be a "character study". Unfortunately, there is not an interesting character in the movie except for Billy Drago's character given too few lines, too little to do and eventually too little screen time. What saved the 2nd and 3rd film was the presence of Michael Gross as Burt Gummer. When there was no action on the screen, you could be sure that Burt Gummer should be interesting to listen to and / or watch. However, in this movie, Hiram Gummer plays a very bad and boring substitute. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, when Graboids (Dirt Dragons in this movie) is on the screen, they look good, but it's about as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> I was impressed when I saw that Tremors 4 was built in 101 minutes. Pretty good for direct to video. But after seeing it, I'm sure this movie is good 15 minutes too long. There are long stretches of dialogue that are boring and no longer plotted. Was there a hurry to get this movie done? I don't think more time could have and should have been used on the script. <br /> <br /> I thought I had hit a gold mine when I saw Tremors 4 packed for sale with .... Tremors !!! Which luck I thought, pay for # 4, get # 1 for free. Good after seeing Tremors 4 I like to believe I paid for the original and got this mess for free, I can't imagine paying a single penny to Tremors 4. For fans of the series, it's best to forget that Tremors 4: The Legend Begins themselves exist. <br /> <br /> Tremors 4: The Legend Begins prizes a 3 out of 10.
