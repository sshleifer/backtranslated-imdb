I mean, I thought I heard this dialogue in the movie, but it was so bad and out of place that I can't really believe it. I laughed so hard at what should have been the worst writing and action in human history, I was seriously worried that I could get a heart attack and die right there in the theater. So this is the scene I'm talking about, "the deer" just like his brother's crash and his brother's car exploded right there just feet away from him (the hero). "Absolutely" threw the expected "fit" by seeing something so tragic, and people tried to keep him from running into the burning car. <br /> <br /> In the midst of his fit and his uncontrollable rage / emotional breakdown, he says "I'm so sorry" - he said right? Am I crazy?
