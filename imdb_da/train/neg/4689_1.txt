Really horrible movie made by cinematographer-turned director Ted Tetzlaff. Decent enough watching movies, but for an hour-bomb movie without any excitement at all. Ford, as someone puts it here, however, sleep this one with its characteristic smirk. There are some details thrown around - Canadian ex-army or RAF, averted bombs in the war, his wife leaving him - but none of these backgrounds add much. The bomber itself is a complete mystery. Why is he trying to blow this shipment of mines? For that matter, what time period are we talking about here? World War II or post-war ?? I assumed the latter, which makes the bomber's motif even more prominent. Generally, but just a horrible movie. There are plenty of good time bomb flicks to skip this one. See any episode of "Danger UXB" for a more exciting time at about the same time.
