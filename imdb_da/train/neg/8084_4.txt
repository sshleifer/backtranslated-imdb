I picked up this title from a friend who had it in his exhaustive DVD / Video / Laserdisc collection, so luckily I didn't have to pay for it. I had a bias that it would be a bad movie, but I know what a really bad movie is after seeing greats like kids should not play with dead things and the incredibly strange creatures that stopped alive and became mixed zombies And now there's really something that phases me, unless it's amazingly bad. <br /> <br /> The sun crisis is bad, but it doesn't reach the sweet spot of absolute pain that some movies are on. <br /> <br> Nevertheless, the general plot is that the sun is triggering a large solar flare against the ground, which will essentially destroy it. To counteract this imminent threat, humanity has assembled a spaceship and crew whose duty it is to burn an antimatter bomb (which the opening describes as "the greatest explosive ever") in the sun, which through some dilapidated sci-fi logic will cause the flare to shoot out at a different angle, leaving the ground unharmed. <br /> <br /> Never mind what I've just described to you sounds like a bad episode of the original Star Trek. Even with an ensemble cast (Charlton Heston, Peter Boyle and Jack Palance), Solar Crisis can hardly cope with the level of mediocrity thanks to a plot that starts out simple but becomes increasingly heterogeneous as time goes on. <br /> <br /> The chronic performance of this debacle of a movie is the addition of a villain (played by Boyle), insisting on sabotaging the mission. Through funds never explained, he sends a wicked minion with an embarrassingly bad haircut to exert some vague electronic thought control over the space occupation genetically engineered scientist, played by female senior Annabel Schofield. Why does he sabotage the mission? Because at his moronic point of view, he thinks that flare will not happen and that when it does not, he will be fabulously wealthy because he has dug his evil claws into the stock market. In fact, you have a villain with the most absurdly stupid motivation that can be imagined. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is astonished and progresses very slowly, in time to tap the use of characters that have only vague or useless short roles in history. I could sit here and explain in detail exactly what is happening to show the writer's sheer inability to make a plot that actually clicks or keeps your attention, but I sit here writing this review on Microsoft Word and I know for a fact that this would take three pages and I would only succeed in losing your interest. But then again you will probably get the same effect from watching the movie. In any case, the movie is scary down with extremely poor dialogue. Imagine if all that ever happened on Star Trek Enterprise was that the characters spit sci-fi jargon back and forth on each other. Yes, I know, they already do, but imagine if that is all they did and that they used the jargon to create vague and almost nonsensical scenes that do not give any excitement, excitement or interest to the viewer. <Br /> <br /> This is best exemplified at the time a sign in a Zero-G environment screws a bolt back onto a metal box before continuing to cry in pain for a few minutes before you suddenly explodes. The script earlier refers to the character, which risks an explosion, but does not bother any solid answer to why or how this happens, nor why he really cannot escape. On the whole, you have a sad cross between the bizarre and the ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Then we have several scenes where dramatic construction leads to nothing. Jack Palance's performance is wasted on a sign that only serves to drive the boy's hero (don't ask) around the desert before it gets rough and killed by a bunch of suits. At his death bed, Palance finally tells our boy's hero his last name (while having a terribly broken make-up that makes it look like someone is putting a balloon under his eye), which he kept quiet about before. Colonel Travis J. Richards. The boy repeats it quietly after he expires, giving the viewers the impression that the name later has meaning later in the film. Perhaps Charlton Heston's grizzled admiral character knows him, and the plot will move on as his name repeats. Something. Something. <br /> <br /> No. Pardon. Any hope you have will be struck when that moment turns out to be another of many pathetic, unsuccessful attempts to create drama ?? for a character so flat and hackneyed that it will forever be a spot on Palance's career, just as those of the rest of the casting are also abused. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is a painfully abrupt end with Schofield, who controls the bomb in the center of the sun to redeem his deeds while under the villains spell, a climax containing another of the movie's Substantially well-suited visual effects sequences, even for the visibly careful care put into them, are still ready to make the movie look as chintzy as it really is. The shameful part about this movie is of course the big budget that is tragically wasted on a stink of a manuscript and a supportive caste behind Boyle, Heston and Palance, who manage to spike the coffin closed with pure overhanging. <br /> <br /> Degree: D-
