This movie gets both a 6/10 rating from me, as well as a 9/10. Here's why: As a standard horror movie for the standard horror crowd, where action and gore and scares are taken into account, this movie will drill you. It is basically a family drama similar to what you would see on the Lifetime channel, but set a horror universe. The story and the formula are ancient, retreaded hundreds of times. If you are looking for any originality in the plot structure or the minimal conflict, you will be disappointed. Take away the zombies and you will get something as melodramatic as a beautiful mind and stumble upon cheese. This is 6/10. <br /> <br /> But the basic synopsis and idea is pretty original and over-the-top. It is literally something you and your friends would joke about when you are half-dunk. . . But the joke actually got a theatrical release. The idea gets 9/10 from me. The only reason it's not perfect is because they could have taken it even further, but they didn't. <br /> <br /> The blend of both is mixed. I thought it was fun, but as with most comedies, it wasn't that fun. I had my mother and little sister see it with me, and the jokes we made about it were more fun than the jokes written. There were moments of quite genius, but there were also moments of pure boredom. I sincerely hope that other movies take this kind of over-the-top risk and original ideas. I just can't say it was perfect, or even near it, because of the lack of originality to the plot. A great family movie. A great movie to watch with a bunch of guys (or girls). A great movie to watch with anyone. . . But if you see it alone, it will be a bit boring. Other people always make this kind of movie more fun and richer. <br /> <br /> 4/10
