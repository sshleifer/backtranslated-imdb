The Russian film "4" follows the lives of three (not four) strangers meeting one night in a local bar. One is a musician, a frozen meat seller and a kelp girl. "4," I am collecting, intended to show life's sadness and hopelessness in post-Soviet Russia (the characters have to make stories to make their lives look more interesting than they really are), but the film is so incoherent and boring that I seriously doubt that many people will be able to sit through it completely. There seems to be a proposal running through the film that the shady Russian government is facing some shady things behind the scenes - operative secret cloning facilities selling millenium frozen meat, etc. - but the film is so informal and incomprehensible that I doubt anyone could Find out what someone really is in here. <br /> <br /> In spite of decent actors and a couple of sharply focused scenes, "4" is a two-hour endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs.
