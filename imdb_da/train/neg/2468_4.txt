This wasn't that big. It wasn't terrible or hateful or anything, just forgettable. It had a kind of um, hesitant, diluted air, as if it never knew rightly whether it wanted to laugh or to sweetness or satire. So we stayed with a weak mix of the three. The actors seemed a little lost. <br /> <br /> Also, the ideas were really tired and reused, almost zombized themselves. How many times should we tell the fifties in the states were infected with a banal sense of conformity? And that this was persistent of aggressive consumerism? And the emotional oppression of men is a baaaaad thing? Old hat. <br /> <br /> The biggest crime in my eyes, however, was just as detached from reality as it was. I know it was a comedy and everything, but - especially in a full movie where you have to keep an interest in an audience for a long time - you still need some kind of emotional anchor, some relative guidance throughout history, to do it engaging. In order for the "hero" child to see an old woman, two co-pupils die and ultimately their father painfully in the hands of zombies or anything and for him to greet it all with a beautiful smile and a shoulder neck, I am just struggle to handle it in any positive way. The mother was the same. If you make your two main characters so inhuman at that level, you run the risk of losing me, and that has happened. <br /> <br /> The biggest positive thing I can offer is that I love the look of that kind of apple pie suburbia and this caught it well enough, it was a great movie, especially some of the wide angled shoots on the street and inside Robinson's House. Also, the leaflet was sweet, in a previously done-but-still-fun kind of way. <br /> <br /> And I thought Billy Connolly was okay and it comes from someone who isn't a big fan of Billy Connolly: Movie Star. I just had this fear he had to hammer it up and try to steal every scene, but he played it pretty low for him and surely came out with the most sympathetic character in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, not amazing though.
