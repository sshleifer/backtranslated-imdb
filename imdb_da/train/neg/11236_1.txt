As a former Kalamazoo resident with a love for the city, I was looking forward to seeing this movie. But what a disappointment! Although the play and production values ​​are not bad, the script is terrible, the plot is unrealistic and the theme interferes. <br /> <br /> The main movie in this movie is that women are nothing without men and children. I can hardly believe how regressive it is in that view of women. Has the author lived under a rock? <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed watching my beloved city on the big screen, I wouldn't suggest this movie to anyone. It's terrible. It is an embarrassment for the city it is named for.
