First of all, Zorie Barber (Zeke) can be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. As a sign to be a hip, village writer in the martial arts and proud to be mysterious, why is he so hyper, dramatic and horrible? Did he know anything about his character before they started filming? Did the director? Don't martial arts learn discipline? Apart from that, this movie misses the goal of its lame jokes and set-it-already gross humor. Hand in toilet? <I> Trainspotting </ i>. Masturbation? Hmm. <i> Fast times at Ridgemont High </>, <i> American Pie </ i>, the list goes on. .Bad dialogue: In a row, Eric says "it is none of my activities <i> but </ i> ..." and 30 seconds later Mia says "why is this something of your business?" Bad editing: At least five minutes worth of movies are wasted on NYC traffic shots. <hr> It is also impossible to believe that the four main male characters would be a tightly composed group of friends in every world. I can't comment on what makes everyone laugh, but if you enjoy the roasting, basic bathroom humor and insults, at all, enjoy. If you want something a little smarter, but in the same line, see <i> Boomerang </ i>. If you want a solid, what-about-romantic comedy, go to <i> The Tao Of Steve </i>. But anyone who thinks <i> whipped </i> is witty and a precise depiction of dating, yes, I can not agree at all.
