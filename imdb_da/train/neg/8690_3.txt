All involved (and the audience) should seek the "candidate" to see how well this film could have been. What happened to South American history? What was Julie Christie and Kate Capshaw thinking about letting their roles be card-cut-outs. Until now, I've been watching any genre and / or movie from Gene Hackman. He was either uninterested (which I almost can't believe) or terribly mistaken. I have also seen and defended Richard Gere (and has been neglected for it). But here he had no "power". He was never scary and only occasionally convincing. All in all, I was very disappointed. I expected much more from this director and threw. If you can't find "The Candidate" watch "Wait Dog" again or even "Bulworth".
