In short, the film suffered from a weak first action with some compulsive and somewhat heterogeneous rhythm and pacing, some of a decent 2nd act that managed to build excitement and intrigue despite some inconsistent pacing and some inferior cast castings, and the third action ... there was virtually no third action! <br /> <br /> With regard to the third action, the movie just ends suddenly. There is no solution and no way down from the climax of the 2nd act, so there wasn't much of a third act. The bad dies and that's it; the final credits roll. There is nothing to show what happens to the protagonist and the supporting characters, etc. The audience would probably have left the theater after the movie and ask for "that is it?" A real letdown. <br /> <br /> Music is composed by David Bell, who worked enough enough to operate the movie most of the time, but it is certainly not outstanding. It is just functional, but achieves this by simply being generic and derived. It is also clear that the score is very dated using synthesized timpani for some of the percussion. However, what impressed me about the score is that some excitement pays tribute to the sound of music similar to being ripped off by James Horner from "48 HRS". and "Commando", especially brass. <br /> <br /> In total, the movie had potential as the basic story itself is good, but the performance was deficient in mediocre direction, weak and inconsistent pacing. <br /> <br /> There was almost no third action to complete the story correctly, and this omission is large and unforgivable, as it does not allow the film to finish satisfactorily. This could either be the manuscript or possibly the production cut film or edit the third action in the finished movie due to budget constraints (but I wonder why there is no third action). Whatever the cause, the sudden end really hurts the movie. <br /> <br /> This is good for a show if you are curious and you can get the movie very cheap as well as learn the reason why you need the 3 actions (beginning, middle, end) if you are writing screenshots and low film. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, you might not waste your time unless you can get the MST3K version to at least get some laughs out of it.
