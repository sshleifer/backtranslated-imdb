This movie should be fine for the most boring movie this year. Not even woody Harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom. The murder of this movie must be interesting places in this movie, but it is not, nothing is of any interest. Cast is not too bad, but the manuscript is simply horrible, I just sat in this surprise during this movie and thought how in the world anyone can find this movie entertaining <br /> <br /> The producers of this movie were very clever. They made a boring movie, but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast. People will go to blockbuster and probably see this movie and think, Woody Harrison, Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe this should be good and rent this movie. (They are in horrible time) <br /> <br /> If you like being ripped off, rent this movie and some people have actually enjoyed this movie, but I like to watch a movie with meaning
