I entered the theater for Sky Captain in 2004 expecting a good movie. Almost every review of this movie had been positive, the effects so enticing, the previews compelling. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is not right to describe the feeling I got from this movie. It was anger. <br /> <br /> In addition to being boring and poorly written, this movie is due to a 2 out of 10 star because everything in the movie was stolen from another source. I understand the difference between a tribute and a steal: this stole. More importantly, it seems that filmmakers did not steal to reach a point or move the plot together. They just stole to show they could. There is literally no point in showing a clip of The Wizard of Oz in a theater at the start of the movie, except creating another scene (which I will not elaborate on) stealing from the same movie. Needless to say, all concepts in the movie were neither original nor even a spin on an old concept: it was literally just a rehash of something I had already seen from pulp-era robots reminiscent of the old Superman Cartoons and the recent movie "Iron Giant" for the silent martial artist minion of the villain that has been used in countless films, most recognizable in recent years as Darth Maul in "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace". <br /> <br /> On the subject of the actual movie, most of the performances were entirely wood. Perhaps this is because the whole movie was made on a blue screen, with computer images filling everything, saving the actors. Frankly, it is no excuse for bad action. If a person was ever a child, they understand that lack of visual reference is no excuse for not trying. Finally, there is no humanity in this movie. The main characters are the only real people here. Almost all antagonists are robots, and the number of friendly characters displayed below the film can be counted on one side. If robots are attacking the whole planet, shouldn't we expect to see lots of humanity running away from them? The main characters' sub-parameters prevent us from connecting to really something here. <br /> <br /> The movie was not the worst movie out there and so I didn't give it a movie The film was rather an example of everything wrong with modern action movies: the filmmakers tried to justify the movie with special effects, but without artistic vision or originality of any kind it falls flat.
