The movie is as fun as staring at the sun.Sheriff Pataki is a total retard that does not love to do anything better than sitting on his fat back, making a smoke from his soft cigars and drinking sausage while the doctor seems like a zombie version of Nicholas Cage sucks up all the so-called "Blood", which in fact seemed like Fruit Punch. <br /> <br /> Most of all plotting seemed very angry to even call this piece of shit a movie. The rest of the characters in this movie are the total waste of time, the end was horrible, the outlines were cheesy, and the scenes were horrible. What else should I say to your viewers out there? My advice would be to have your Rabies shot if you have already seen the movie. This movie can give you the foam in your mouth if you didn't get your up-to-date shots.
