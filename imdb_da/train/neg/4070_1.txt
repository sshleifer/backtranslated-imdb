Picture of fugly annoying goth kids from college in a scat movie, throwing in a key of history and a lot of horrible plays, and you're still not even close to how bad this movie is. <br/> <br /> Shots bad, bad effects, worse action. Contrived attempt at shocking horror. Everyone I've shown this gets a little depressed and sees it. The sex scenes are disruptive, not necessarily for their content, but more because they are just something you will end up as soon as possible. The last sex scene is just wild, even before she comes to the guy. <br /> <br /> I'm one of those people who love watching movies that people hate, so I picked this one up. But for your own sake, save yourself time and avoid this disgust. It's so bad. I literally threw it into the garbage.
