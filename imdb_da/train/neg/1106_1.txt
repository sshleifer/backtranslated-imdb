Don't waste your time on this boy. As portrayed, the characters have no redeeming values ​​and look for them to interact is pure torture. "Gothic" was entertainment at least, it's bad. If you like to look pretentious and spoil poets who strive to persuade each other, it may be right up your alley. Lord Byron is portrayed as a complete jerk and why the others would choose to spend more than five minutes with him is really confusing. Mary Shelly seems to be the only character with no spine at all, but herself comes out of the whole trial without an ounce of respect. What a waste of time. See Gothic instead. I also remember seeing another superior movie based on the same subject, but didn't catch the title. I was hoping it was, but no luck. Not recommended.
