I thought this movie would be much better than it was. It sounded like a spy from the spyware, and the beginning of it reminded me of Pleasantvil, but this movie came up short. The reason is just too ridiculous. The KGB and the Soviet Union in Russia have started a spy school to teach their spies' how to act as Americans, but the city they create in it for training is a bit dated, so they take two yankees from the United States to spice things up. I don't know, but it just seems to be out there. It gets really strange when, next to no one in this Russian city, you speak in a Russian accent. Someone is screwed up in the cast. <br /> <br /> For a comedy this is painfully dry. There are one, two funny spots tops and they are nothing to sing and dance about. The movie will eventually put you in bed. <br /> <br /> And as a twisted blow on the face, this movie is so pro-American, it makes me sick. The film continues to say again and again, the US is God, and Russia is the devil. This is the kind of butter campaign that was done against Japanese in World War II. It's movies like these that make everyone believe that the US is full of itself. <br /> <br /> This gets a 4 out of 10 and I'm friendly. It should really get one, but the dance scene was fun, but then again it dragged far too long to be really fun.
