I always wanted Spike Lee's movie, but one was a total waste of 2 1/2 hours. I was expecting more about Son of Sam and instead got a movie that seemed to have very little to do with the serial killings in 1977. The talking dog was ridiculous (you know you're in trouble when all movie customers burst into laughter inappropriately). The whole movie seemed very different and not very interesting. Sex scenes were completely irrelevant to the plot. I'm not against sex in movies, but it should have some point (unless it's a XXX movie). All in all, we were very disappointed with this Spike Lee effort !!
