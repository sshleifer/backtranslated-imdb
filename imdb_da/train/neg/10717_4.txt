I give this a generous four out of ten stars, or dots or markers or something. <br /> <br /> There was a total of two really really fun scenes in this movie. All the scenes with Amy P and Tina Fey and Greg Kinnear (Greg Kinnear !!) moved enough together. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the usual trade in stereotypes, blown speed, lopsided with a silly soundtrack, and "soundtrack" is generous. <br /> <br /> In any case, the two really really fun scenes involved Amy P. She's just really fun in an expensive kind of way. She is a mix of the monkey man's shit as they do on SNL and Lucille Ball. I hope they (Amy P and Tina Fey) just flat out admitted that they did it for the money because if they did it gave birth to the Sarah Palin parodies so I think we can say yes it was worth putting the black guy back in the role of the waiter who is really there to help you be more human. <br /> <br /> Blah. 4 out of 10 which I said is generous. <br /> <br /> But no more, girls, OK? Oh, I almost forgot. The mother from "Two and a half men" is in this movie and she has got some kind of plastic surgery so her mouth now resembles the mouth of a 30 year old so every scene she is in is like trying to rearrange her face, or put it together in my mind, or just answer the question: "No, wait. Wait .. Has she had plastic surgery?" Because you as a seer really do not want her to have had plastic surgery.
