I am the guy who usually holds opinions for himself, but I just came back from this movie and felt I had to express my opinions. Let me start by saying that I am a huge horror fan. But what does a horror movie do? I would like to see a little bit of a good script and character development myself. I know they often lack in horror movies, but Prom Night looked like it didn't even do anything in that department. Next, we all love excitement. It on the edge of your seat tension with unpredictable surprises. Yes, Prom Night had none of it! Of course we like a scary killer. Prom Night has it? No it has a beautiful boy with a cute lil knife. And when all else fails ... at least, horror has its guilty joy of making fun like Gore Gore Gore and the occasional nude scene! Yes, yes, when you have a horror movie rated PG-13 as Prom Night, they also leave those things. So with all these elements missing, I ask .... does it still consider a horror movie? Nix. I will call it more of a comedy. People in my theater spoke more of this when they were when I saw "Semi-Pro" that was going to be a comedy (which also sucked, but that's another story!). I think I'll just give up on new horror. All the good movies of the good films have been recreated in waste, so movie studios can make money. The people I went to see it didn't even know it was a remake! Which made me angry! I wonder what will happen when there are no more movies to recreate ??? Where will horror go next ???
