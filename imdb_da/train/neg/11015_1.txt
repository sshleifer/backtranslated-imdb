I read foolishly the back of the DVD cover of this movie in Best Buy a year ago and said to myself, "Looks funny, plus it has Michael Clarke Duncan, how can I lose!" I continued to pay $ 15.99 plus tax for it. I took it over to a friend's house and we both were horrified at how badly it was written and acted. Wood performances abound. All the "hilarious" and "outstanding" performances that were promised never appeared. After 90 minutes, I hung my head in shame as I knew I could never get it back 90 minutes or $ 15.99. I almost almost shouted, because if that were what could be considered "comedy", I wouldn't believe in movies anymore. My friend and I constantly informed a friend of ours about this movie's scare to the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad it was. During the holiday season this year I saw it with him because he didn't want to see it alone. This was my next terrible mistake, because when I looked, I was just angry. I started shouting at the movie, and I'm not the one to talk to the movie season. Everyone I know has even glimpsed this movie has agreed on the worst they have ever seen. My sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends, but it couldn't save this movie itself. The fact that this movie is not on the bottom 100 of IMDb is amazing. The fact that its rating (at the time of this writing) is 3.6 is a crime against humanity.
