The "confidential" part was supposed to piggy-back on the popular appeal of the lurid magazine of the same name, while the working-time racket theme was tied together with the headline's congressional day studies. But despite the A-grade B movie cast and some good script ideas, the movie plods together for some 73 minutes. It's a cheap jack production all the way. What is needed to deter the bad production values ​​is some imagination, especially from uninspired director Sidney Salkow. A few daylight images would have helped ease the success of boring studio sets. A stylish helmsman like Anthony Mann could have done something about the fabric but Salkow treated it as another pay-day exercise. Difficult that Brian Keith's typical key-shaped style does not work here that comes across as simply wood and dullness, while being cult figurine Elisha Cook Jr. go over the top as a wildly full. Clearly, Salkow is not the actor's director. But you have to leave it to the crooked little number Beverly Garland, which treats its role with distinctive enlistment and dedication. Too bad she was not responsible. My advice - skip it unless you are in ridiculous bar-girls who do nothing else but knock back whiskey in typical strait-jacketed 50's fashion.
