Flat, fun computer images in less than astonishing backgrounds animate a horrible predictable story in this movie. Absolutely nothing takes you in surprise, you can even tell when Bryan Adam's vowels come in, which is always at the wrong time. The protagonist, the Spirit horse, gets an annoying voice when he tells what happens. The story is not necessary, but since everything happens, it is quite clear. You can even tell what the horses say, even if everything they do is close. It would be good, but all horses do exactly the same sounds - one for warning, one for grief, one for laughing, etc. There is no variation between the horses' voices. <br /> <br /> Young children may like this movie, though. It is so violent that a family is sitting and watching, and there is a small danger that someone will be scared. If you have nothing else to do and want to watch movies with your kids, this is not a bad choice. But otherwise it is not recommended.
