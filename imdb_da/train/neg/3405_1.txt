I can't believe how uneducated this movie is. It's like watching the police academy unless it's with people who have no idea what they're talking about, and ... Wait, there's a stupid robot to be a sidekick. I can understand the suspension of disbelief, but it's just utter stupidity. Not only is there no plot for this movie. It's like looking at someone pretending to be a doctor, throwing non-medical words around as if they were chief of staff at a major medical facility. Plus people have been wearing clothes that do not fit a room program. I want to see a valley girls "b" movie in the room.
