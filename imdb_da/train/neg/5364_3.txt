The complaints are valid, for me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too targeted at women. I'm okay with these night-laps, like Grey's Anatomy, or Ugly Betty or the West Wing, because there are stories that are interesting, though they're supposed to never end. But when the idea is parallel to the daytime, which is aimed at just putting hunky men (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly and Chris Lowell) into sexual tension and drum and many ridiculously difficult situations in a so-called small hospital, it looks like General Hospital. .. or a female counterpart to Baywatch. That was what you wanted and they had, so if that is what women want, then it is, but the idea that this is a high forehead show (or something you want to see) is unrealistic.
