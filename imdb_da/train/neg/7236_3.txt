Let's see ... I try to practice the positive in everything, so what kind of things can I say about Pallbearer? <br /> <br /> I know! The performance was - no, it won't work when they managed to drain the whole personality of Gwyneth Paltrow, usually so vivid and ended up creating caricatures out of Carol Kane and Barbara Hershey ... <br /> <br /> Oh - how's the story - no. It will also not fly as it was drowsy inducing. What was the genre anyway? It was not fun that regulates comedy. It was not interesting enough to be dramatic. Was it a romance between Schwimmer and Paltrow? I have to ask, as I can't be sure - let's just call it "losers in similar." I am sure that those who are behind this movie started with a vision, I think they must have had a pitch in the study treaties, but I need help finding it. Although I was a patient who could forgive the sheer stupidity of history, I could not in good conscience recommend a movie that would allow a guy to engage in a professional job interview in a windbreaker and messy, fluffy, silly hair. Are we talking about hair - should we be amused by the conscious black roots and platinum locks worn by Hershey? <br /> <br /> What am I doing? I've already lost 97 irreversible minutes in the movie itself - I can't spend more time on this loser.
