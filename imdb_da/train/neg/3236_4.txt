I have recently seen the first guinea pig movie, The Devil's Experiment, and I have to admit I'm disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie is always included in any list of "nastiest" movies and maybe I expected more because of the hype. The truth is, however, I don't think so. <br /> <br /> If I had seen it and believed in the opening text to be true ("I found this tape ..."), I could have been slightly disturbed by it and thought it was right. Even without knowing that it is not right, I think I would have prepared that it was not. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, the girl's reactions to what is being done for her is just not what they should be. She was going to scream like a banshee in pain. The fact that she does not mean that of course is not right. I didn't want to see it if it was right, but if she were to be more convincing in her acting, the movie would be more disturbing. <br /> <br /> And then there are the infamous scenes: Nothing has affected me at all until scalpel in hand. The hot oil, maggots and indards just don't disturb me. I'm not saying I'm "hard"; just that I couldn't suspend my unbelief, partly because of the girl's action. <br /> <br /> The scalpel made me throw a little, but the hammer at hand just made the hand look rubber. And the last scene with the eye was again a little wincing but no more. I didn't want to look away and I didn't feel nauseous either. Maybe it's because the movie is twenty and old, or maybe I'm just left. The truth is, I didn't find this movie at all disturbing. These are the kinds of things you might expect to see playing on a loop like a modern art installation and as an exercise in stripping away characters, history, etc. and just leaving the torture, it works at some levels. However, as a disturbing piece of film, it didn't work for me. <br /> <br /> I saw Guinea Pig with my wife, who is "just a movie" bent and she wondered what all the uprising was about. We have to discuss why I see these movies and my reasons are many, but also a desire to be influenced by a movie. She said she didn't think any movie could be so convincing that they disturbed her and challenged me to do just that. I played her fire extinguisher scene from Irreversible and she was actually disturbed. I'm not sure I have a point except that we were both more disturbed by a scene in a non-horrible genre movie than any movie so far that turns out to be disturbing.
