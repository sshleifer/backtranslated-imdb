I could only hang out in the first 20 minutes of this low-budget movie. The most sharp absurdity was that while the American inmates in a North Korean POW camp are all supposed to suffer from severe deprivation of food and medicine, walking without bathing, shaking in shaggy and dirty parks and sleeping on rugged floors and - don't forget about persistent torture - they always manage to track impeccably cut hair. With the exception of an appropriately strong-looking Harry Morgan as an army master, casting and acting are simply horrible. Ronald Regan cannot seem to hold on to portraying a single character and instead creates a rather schizophrenic amalgam of previous roles. A mostly Caucasian caste depicting North Korean camp officers could have been forgiven, but when allegedly Russian officers who served as advisers to the Koreans, they sought to wear re-badged Nazi uniforms complete with iodhpurs and jackboots costume department reused from WWII flicks) and talks with accents like General Burkhalter from Hogans Heroes, it's just six kinds of stupid. Don't waste your time on this one.
