Few movies have left me such a feeling of unease, and that's not a compliment. Since I saw it in a theater (how it ended there, I can only wonder). I was subjected to 90 mn hateful, secondary garbage, the main impression is a bit like this other sick film "Don't answer the phone" - but worse. Anything of it all, rape and all, appear without any distance (unlike strong things like "Last House on the left") and utter disdain for the (perfect) victims and all involved, leaving the viewer to be treated as a sadistic voyeur. At the end I felt like taking a bath. No credits to the director
