This movie had the potential to be a decent horror movie. The protagonist was decently done and I was sorry for him and there was a decent amount of backstory. But everything else sucks. Director Emmanuel is quite incompetent for film production. He uses some of the most idiotic shots ever. <br /> <br /> - A few random sequences of random images scattered throughout the movie. I don't know if he was trying to be deep and intelligent and poetic, but he wasn't. It was stupid. Random shots of the trailer protagonist lived in, random buildings, random panoramic images of buildings, random cat going away. WTF? And clouds. Lots of gloomy dark clouds. He really liked this technique of having a scene cut up in different shots rather than just a continuous shot. EX: Guy tries to light his grass and the camera is circling him. Instead of just one shot he edits it as 10 different shots, so it's really EDGY! and HIP! and SMART! stupid. <br /> <br /> The action is horrible, but that's what makes the movie so fun. And scarecrow is a gymnast because he flips and spins and twirls all the time. And some of the deaths could have been better. You expect the main plague to have a long, well-built death, but not. A simple corncob in the ear. The love interest was warm. Voluptuous. Therefore, this movie gets a 2.
