I was honestly surprised by Alone in the Dark. It was so bad I could hardly believe what I saw. There are no signs, just a few stereotypes wandering around and being killed. The degree of character development gave each character a name and a profession, and it is about it. There was no real plot and none of the signs seemed to have any motivation. In fact, many action scenes began on their own that come from nowhere with a pounding techno track. As I watched this movie, I kept asking, "Where does this happen? What happens?" The action was high school drama quality, with stiff wood delivery, as if the actors read from cue cards without understanding their lines. Their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious by terrible sound design. ADR sounded like it was being recorded in an open space. The actors constantly took notice of beating their marks and then almost robot in their movements. So these listless machines are whisked through a series of incomparable and confusing scenarios, often without even the benefits of transition scenes. They were here, now they are there. This happened, now it happens. Random scenes with little rhyme or reason. I had fun watching it. Definitely not worth nine bucks though.
