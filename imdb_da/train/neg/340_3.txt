I guess the reason why this movie did well at the box office is of course Eddie Murphy. I think it was his first movie since "Beverly Hills Cop", so then he was hot. Considering that you made over two hundred million and that was R, and one made about 80 million and it was, it doesn't say it was so popular. I've never been a great Eddie Murphy fan, so that's another reason I don't have anything to do with it. This one has Eddie as a kind of finder of lost children. He must find the golden child, or the world is in terrible danger. The reason is very poor, but as bad as it is, it does not compare with the special effects. I had seen better things done in the 70s than some of the things this one offers, Ray Harryhausen did better things. Still, the main reason why you see a movie like this, because of Eddie, is unfortunately not very fun in this one and it just seems silly to put him in the scene scenes "Raiders of the Lost Ark". I suppose they were hoping for a fish out of the water, but for me it just didn't work.
