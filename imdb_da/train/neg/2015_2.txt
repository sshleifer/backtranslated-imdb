I was really looking forward to this program for two reasons; I really liked Jan Michael Vincent, and I am an aviation killer and have a serious love affair with helicopters. I don't like this program because it takes imagination to an incredible level. The world speed record for helicopters was set at 249 mph by a Westland Lynx several years ago. The only helicopter that was faster was the 1960s experimental Lockheed AH56A. It hit over 300 and was a composite helicopter, which means it had a pusher propeller at the end of its hull providing pressure. <br /> In short, no helicopter can fly much more than 275 because of the rotational flight. And Bell 222, the "actor" who portrayed Airwolf, was not very fast even by helicopter standards. And it was no longer in production. <br /> <br /> There was a movie that came out in this time period called "Blue Thunder" which was much more realistic.
