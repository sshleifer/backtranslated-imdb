I read Chris_m_grant's comment from the United States. <br /> <br /> He wrote, "An amazing 1924 documentary. This geography from today's Iraq was early in the 20th century." <br /> <br /> I wanted to thank Chris and people who are interested in Bakhtiari Nomads Iran, Zagros mountains and landscapes and have seen the movie Grass, A Nations struggle for life. These traditions, you saw in the movie, have lasted for centuries and will continue as long as life lasts. I am from this region in Iran myself. I'm a Bakhtiari. Chris, I'm sorry to disturb you, but the Bakhtiari region Zardkuh is in Iran, not in Iraq, as you mentioned in your comment. Iran and Iraq are two different and different countries. Taking an Iranian for an Iranian is almost like taking an American to a Mexican. Thanks, <br /> <br /> Ziba
