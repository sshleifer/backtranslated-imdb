The next time you are at a party and someone asks, "Today I heard the phrase" The author's will ". Does anyone know what that means?" Tell them to sit through 'Head over Water'. The only way Diaz could have survived this movie was by this literary entity, commonly used by bad authors. There are some comics and you will have a few laughs. However, the film is not up to the smallest logical analysis. Why does Keitel Diaz's hand tie in front of her instead of backwards? Why then she can of course do the chainsaw gag. For me, the best part of this movie was that I saw it on a cable channel instead of using four bucks in the video store.
