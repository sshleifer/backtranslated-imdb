I find it hard to believe that anyone would put this movie in the same context as the exorcist. Where the exorcist was subtle and eerie, Stigmata was stump, clumsy and too formal. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most visually beautiful movies I've seen for a while, but the imagery doesn't make up for the downward spiral of patronizing exhibitions that make it unbearable. <br /> <br /> My interest in this movie was peaked when compared to The Exorcist, and my visit to the official site increased that interest. The site had many stories of "actual" stigma throughout history. But the scene after stage is the movie so obsessed with its quest for "authenticity" that it becomes comical at first, so pretty hard to look towards the end. I began to become suspicious when the pastor, who was responsible for investigating possible miracles, entered the beauty agency where ours would be heroine cutting hair and apparently flirting with priests. <br /> <br /> The Reason: A woman without faith in God begins receiving the wounds of Christ (Stigmata) and is baffled and saddened by the trial. A priest is sent directly from the Vatican to investigate. Is Frankie obsessed with Satan, or a ship to Jesus Christ? <br /> <br /> The only miracle in this movie is that it finally ends.
