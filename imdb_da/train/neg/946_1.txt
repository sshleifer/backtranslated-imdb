Why is this show so popular? It's beyond me why people like it. I think it's one of the worst sitcoms out there. <br /> <br /> Because it's so popular, I've tried more than once to see it, and I can't do it through an entire episode. <br /> <br /> First, the play is horrible. Everyone overcomes the point where it's annoying to see. They speak in unnatural voices, use unnatural tones and have unnatural body language. I have seen better performing in a kindergarten school play. <br /> <br /> For another thing, it's not fun. The boundaries are boring. They are not creative, intelligent or funny. Shouldn't a sitcom be fun ?? Why don't I laugh? <br /> <br /> Finally, what are the seventies about this? It's about as authentic in the 70s as "Happy Days" was in the 50s. <br /> <br /> What about Ashton Kutcher? Who tossed this odd dweeb? And now he is making movies? Oh, save us all! <br /> <br /> If people think this is quality TV, it worries me.
