I had great hopes for this movie. I thought the assumption was interesting. I stuck through it, though I found the play, rescued Helena Bonham Carter, unremarkable. I was hoping that my time would pay off, but in the end I was abandoned and wondered why they themselves were bothering to do this thing. Perhaps in George Orwell's version there is a message worth transporting. If this movie did something, it inspired me to read Orwell's classic. I find it hard to believe that his story could be as disappointing as this adaptation. If the film producer's message is "the everyday life is worth living" then they have succeeded. I would recommend this movie to anyone; 101 minutes of my life wasted.
