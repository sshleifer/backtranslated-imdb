All the ingredients in the low-brow b-movie cool movie theater. Topless (and bottomless) girls, kung-fu kicking chefs, slave traders, evil mustaches Germans, Cameron Mitchell and sword-wielding zombies. And, of course, the breasts of Camille Keaton, who is the most well-known showcase, are in the feminist utilization classic, I spit on your grave. We also have to mention the brain Shepard, who plays a hooker in the latest movie The Cooler. <br /> <br /> Lots of blood and action with knives and swords and martial arts among topless dancers in a bar in a bar whorehouse, and in a boat load of martial arts artists heading to some zombie island where bad martial arts go to death or something like that. Tops and bottoms come off easily and often as travelers are well-lubricated thanks to the boat's owner. <br /> <br /> So disaster strikes when their boat is destroyed and they land on the zombie island, where the monks sacrifice young girls to the dead martial artists to bring them back to life. <br /> Just when you thought it had everything, there is piranhas in the water. Yum Yum A great fat German for dinner. <br /> <br /> Only things for your next zombie party.
