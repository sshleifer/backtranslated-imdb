This is one of those movies you think decision makers would refuse to release because it's so terrible. Of course, they thought that children are stupid and are great at absorbing endless ads and think they are entertainment because it's slapstick fun. What about the talking car with buttons that says Wendy's, McDonalds, M & M and Skittles? There was no speech car in the comic book. (Dr.) Claw must be wicked, not beautiful and charming. Why is Rupert Everet 'Claw' anyway? Were the authors on drugs when they wrote these scenes? It seems they were (badly) lampooning Robo Cop, with making a man a crime fighting android thing. I tried to get my money back but there was a policy where if I watch more than 30 minutes of a movie, you won't get a refund. I'm sorry I saw more than 30 minutes of that pile of crap. After I was told that there was no refund policy, I decided to see the rest of the horrible waste called Inspector Gadget.
