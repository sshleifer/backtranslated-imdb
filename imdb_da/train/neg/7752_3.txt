The movie is about a sabretooth on lost at an amusement park, where teens are on a scavenger hunt. Since there are no rules, they break into a building and begin to be killed. The deaths are cheesy and are stupid. But at least it had better effects than sabretooth. I gave it a three because Stacy was in it and I loved the movie Sabretooth. I thought it was okay, but some deaths were off-screen. There was a stupid scene in which the two teenagers kiss and the sabretooth's head jumps out and the boy leaves his girlfriend from behind and leaves her to make her completely fake and looks red. Then sabretooth stands up in the ventilation holes and bites the children off the head. The end with the owner was completely fake looking graphics. Even that death was stupid because the statue went through its mouths and hangs there, which will support it, and there is a scene when a goth girl loses her contacts, doesn't find them and thinks she doesn't need them. The movie is idiotic and a waste of time.
