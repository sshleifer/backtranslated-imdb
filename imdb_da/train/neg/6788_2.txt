The idea of ​​people's name is good that a killer does not want his only daughter to end up in an institution and asks the parents of the girl he killed to take care of his daughter. And you can expect from the actors, especially Scott Bakula to do some good acting, unfortunately they don't! In people's name turns out to be the regular Friday night tearjerker. Flashbacks with the girl being killed are pretty pathetic and at some stage you can just predict what the actors will say ... If you want to watch a good movie on this topic, watch Dean Man Walking!
