A scene demonstrates the mentality of "Terminator Woman" quite well: Karen Sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villains' camp. Karen runs over an armed guard pointing her gun at her, but after a few seconds it throws away and challenges her to a fight. Karen kicks him in the balls, gathers the gun and runs away! So again, when a movie is directed by a martial artist and written / produced by another family member, you know that you shouldn't expect too much. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble get a bit of fun going early, and the movie may have proven better if it had focused more on their love hate affair. But after approx. They are separated for 20 minutes, and the film slows down to a crawl, and even with the occasional battle scene to experience things, it lacks excitement. The final has Trimble fighting Qissi inside a cave, and Sheperd goes womano-a-womano against the beautiful Ashley Hayden on a speedboat, but the battles are intercut in a way that destroys their flow and reduces their value. On the positive side, kudos to the costuming department to give Karen the chance to show spectacular cleavage throughout the movie! (* 1/2)
