This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is absolutely no history, the gags are only for retards, and there is absolutely nothing else that would make this movie worth seeing. Throughout the film Fredi (oh my god, what a funny name. Haha) does not ask himself how he came from a plane to the middle earth. There are lots of silly and totally involuntary characters whose names are funny. eg. : Gandalf is called Almghandi, Sam is called Pupsi ... and so on. I didn't even smile once during the whole movie. The gags seem to be made by people whose IQ is negative. If you laugh when someone's coat is caught in the door (this happens about 5 times), then this movie may be for you. Another fun scene: They try to guess the password to a closed door (don't ask why - never ask "why" in this movie) and the password is (haha): dung. So if you laugh at these examples, you like this movie. For everyone else: Go to Youtube and see "Lord of the Weed": It's a lot, much more fun.
