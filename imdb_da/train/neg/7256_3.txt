I bought this movie on blu-ray because it promised great visuals and music. I was also a big fan of a similar movie ... Baraka. The film is highly stylized after Baraka, wide angles, very similar images with cameras set to capture long time passes in each shot. Even some of the scenes were identical (street with traffic). While Baraka told a great story, coinciding nature, man-made environments, spirituality and horror in the world in an exciting way and good music, this movie just jumped from shot to shot without covering history, mediocre musical score and then. ... POOF, it's done! I thought there should be some kind of mistake! World history? Half of the movie is Egypt and the landscape (similar to Arizona, but I don't want to check out). Serious people, this is terrible, rent it if you need to, but don't buy it. The filmmakers must be ashamed of themselves to put this out.
