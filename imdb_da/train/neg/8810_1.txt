This movie is one of those who regret that I have invested 90 minutes in my life that I never come back. The prerequisite is really interesting - essentially it is a zombie girl from the perspective of the undead (let's not share hair about whether they are actually dead or not.) Unfortunately, they fail to deliver a compelling story within this framework. in the life of the central characters may add to the realism of the film, but it sucks all the entertainment value straight If they had put a little more effort into keeping the viewer engaged, they would have been much more likely to drive home the social comment.
