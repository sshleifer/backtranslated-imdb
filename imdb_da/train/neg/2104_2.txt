I purchased this video at Walmart's $ 1 bin. I think I overpaid !!! In the 1940s, Bela Lugosi made a long series of 3-rate films for small studies (in this case Monogram - those who made most Bowry Boys films). While most of these films' misery does not approach the level of horror that his last movie has achieved (Ed Wood "classics" such as Monster Bride and Plan 9 From Outer Space), they are nevertheless poor films and should be avoided by all men the most deadly fans. <br /> <br /> I'm an old movie junkie so I gave this a try. In addition, a few of these smaller films were actually quite good - just not this one. Lugosi is what a mad scientist wants to keep his pretty bizarre and violent wife alive through a serum he collides with young brides. They never really explained why it should be brides or why it should be women or even what illness his wife had - so you can see that the plot was never really carved at all. <br /> <br /> Anyways, a really annoying female journalist (a Lois Lane type without Jimmy Olsen or Superman) will come to the bottom of all those apparent murders where the body was PROUD! Then she follows some tracks all the way to the door of Lugosi. Lugosi's home is complete with his gall wife, a female assistant, and two strange people who seem to be assistant sons (a nasty, jigsaw puzzle, and a dwarf). Of course, this clever reporter falls repeatedly throughout the film - apparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand! Finally, the lunatics ALL die - mostly because of their own hands and everything is good. In conclusion, the reporter and a doctor she just met to marry. And of course, the reporter's silly cameraman falls when this happens. If you haven't noticed, there is a lot of fainting in this movie. Or maybe because it was such a slow and thought-provoking movie, they just fell asleep!
