Simply, I found the TV show "Mash" trite, preachy, oh ever so "politically correct", repetitive, pretentious and greatest sin of all, and that is that it was (was) incredibly boring. You have Alan Alda as the lead leader, "(star)" who is so in love with himself and his wisdom that it actually made me uncomfortable to even try to sit through an episode. The original series had both McLean Stevson and Wayne Rogers, whom I am happy to admit had some panache and style for their character presentation. However, Harry (Henry) Morgan and Mike Farrell are both unique and composed together, like eating caviar and fresh oysters with Wonder Bread. The Loretta Swit, which I also regretted, was not a mistake either, and Gary Burghoff, who was good at the movie, got tired and acted like the show was wearing. Seeing a show a year showed it to me. Jamie Farr was just low brow "comedy" and is not even worth mentioning here at all. The reason I did not give it a (one) rating that everyone reads this now would wonder is that ratings of every kind are not only a subjective call but a relative. Television, except for relatively few exceptions, is so immense. As relatively speaking, Mash had a certain quality of production, (of television standards) in that era and today, and therefore it is deserved by a two. Rob Ritter
