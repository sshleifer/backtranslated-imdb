Awful, simply awful. It proves my theory of "star force". This is supposed to be awesome TV because the guy who instructed (battlestar) Titanica is the same guy who directed this shlop schtick schtick about a chick. B O R I N G. <br /> Find something a thousand times more interesting to do - like watching your TV without a picture and no sound. 1/10 (I have judged it so high b / c there is no negative score in the IMDb.com rating system.) <br /> <br /> -Zaphoid <br /> <br /> PS: My theory of "star power" is: the more "star power" is used in a show, the weaker the show is. (It is called an indirect proportionality: quality 1 / "star power", less "sp" gives better quality, etc. Another way of looking at is: "more is less.") <br /> <br /> - Z
