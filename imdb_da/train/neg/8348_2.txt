I just finished seeing "El Otro". I've always taken my hat off to Julio Chavez's performances as he is a great actor, but this movie is really depressing and slow. I think it would have been even worse if it wasn't for Julio. Still, it is definitely a movie that you will never understand if you are not from Argentina, and even if you are, I would recommend not renting this movie to have a good time with your boyfriend, boyfriend, family or friends. .. it's really depressing and incredibly slow, and the plot doesn't make sense either. Probably the instructor wanted to show the fragility of human life, but what he does is drill and impress the audience with scenes that shock you a little. It gives you something to think about, but not in a good way. Overall, I didn't like this movie.
