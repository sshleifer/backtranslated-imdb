Considering its pedigree, this should be a much more enjoyable movie than it is. Even with a lip-smacking collection of eccentrics in the cast - which aficionado wouldn't eagerly anticipate a movie that gathers Lemmon, Lanchester, Kovacs and Gingold? - The whole event is dully paced, drearily shot and, more often than not, unclear. <br /> <br /> Kim Novak's gifts were not essentially comic, as she continued to confirm in Kiss Me Stupid. James Stewart was a fine comedian whom he almost demonstrated in films from everything from The Philadelphia Story to Harvey. I think he gets better out of this mess than anyone else does. Except maybe the cat.
