Oh, my dear ... I thought CBS primetime television shows were the worst things Gerald McRaney showed up in ... Four people are experimenting with a scary mind control <br /> <br /> computer. That's it, don't rent it. <br /> <br /> I saw this under one of its many titles - "Gray Matter" and it is perhaps one of the worst movies of recent memory. The other <br /> <br /> reviews are right, it's terrible. Never have so many establishments <br /> <br /> shots appeared on the screen, NEVER. Cast is terrible, the direction <br /> <br /> is terrible, and the script is terrible. I can't stress how terrible this is. <br /> <br /> Avoid it as if you wanted cups. <br /> <br /> This is characterized (PG) by physical violence, a gun violence, mild <br /> <br /> Gore, a little disgrace, and some adult situations
