I went into this movie with expectations from the hype that it would be insight and uplifting. Surely something more than a cheap advertisement for the band "Wilco." <br /> <br /> Instead, we get a lot of moping and whining about the "process", a creepy and undoubtedly one-sided decoration of a band member kicked by the primary Donna lead singer / songwriter, a gut-wrenching announcement of the fallen friend - as an 18-year-old - to say "the friendship had run its course" and this tricky, uncomplicated story of how to "record their emotions" by dumping them, only for the band to get 50 offers immediately from other brands (oh, the excitement ... not!) They tried their best to make it look like it was a load, but I suppose it was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that didn't existed. This does not even take into account the long stretches where we get many of their latest songs pushed us completely without any history, insight or even a decent job on cinematography. The strained attempts at emotional sincerity or a reasonable perspective on life made me sick to see. <br /> <br /> From the band, this band sounds like a bunch of rolling little babies popping around to find a voice they don't have and think they're a kind of guardian of the art of music that they definitely not. And I thought the music sucked, and I couldn't even understand the lyrics because of the murmur of head songs. <br /> <br /> I give it a 2/10.
