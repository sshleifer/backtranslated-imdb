'The Omen 4: The Awakening' is a television sequel to the original 'The Omen' movie. Instead of Satan holding a little boy's body, he possesses the body of a little girl adopted by rich parents who are bullied in school and who end up revenge against those who make her wrong. The movie seems to struggle with any horror factor, and many of the events that happen are simply stupid instead of particularly scary, and it's hard to believe that this little girl is Satan, even with all the events that surround the. I just found this movie very exciting or scary, especially in relation to the original.
