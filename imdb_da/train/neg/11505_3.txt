This picture reminds me of a Keneth More picture from 1957 called The Admirable Crighton "while on a boat, he was serving and on the island he became a master and was rescued back to the servant. Madonna did it in some movies, though this does not burn. If there is any picture showing that Madonna can't act, this is it. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if this was a subtle copy of "The Admirable Crighton," but it certainly looks like it, and if so, then Hollywood has to run out of ideas and it is sad to give the actors platform to improve their career profile and this particular fails in every corner and detail. <br /> < br /> The reason is loose and the actor is mediocre.The script should have been put through the shredder before it was put in place .While many have canned Madoona for all his plays, I think that in movies like "A separate league" was right good and comfortable and "who is the girl" showed a quirkiness of Madonna's path l not shown before or after. Other Madonna movies are not that fun, and I would have liked to see a Madonna animation series with the character from "Who's That Girl" I like the music from these two movies but "swept away" remains at the bottom of the pile here and will remain so. <br /> <br /> Everyone has a bomb right?
