As hard as it is for me to believe, with all the awful realities out there over the last few years, you have to take over the top spot for the worst yet. I still wonder if this was actually just a spoof made by the SCTV band. If Andy Kaufmann was still alive, I would be sure he was behind it. Can a rock band bend anything lower than does INXS make such a shameful thing like this? The premise is simple and moronic. Audition a lot of karaoke refuses to become the new leading singer of INXS, to take place for Michael Hutchence (who committed suicide in 1997). Eight years and no hits later, the band binds the ultimate act of pathetics by exposing themselves to auditioning a bunch of talented wannabes to be the new leading singer for a band 20 years past its prime. So they believed in all those horrible singers (I thought American Idol had its share of doozies), making vicious transfers of almost any classical (and predictable) rock song that can be imagined. And then they cut into the INXS band members who seriously discuss the benefits of each of these candidates. You could see better (and more original) rockers at almost any nightclub in any city in the world. <br /> <br /> It has all the usual uncreative elements in any other reality show. Lame reality participants, lame interviews, lame host / emcee, lame "judge" of performances and lame start-up of a participant at the end of each show. Can these shows get more predictable? It is clearly a promotional bullet from the band. a final hope of regaining their lost star before they are finally buried in oblivion. Michael Hutchence, if he had any sharpness when he is alive, should be rolled over in his grave. Not that INXS was ever a good band, but I didn't know they were so pathetic. If INXS is at all representative of what rock and roll have become, this show would be the ultimate proof that rock and roll once died.
