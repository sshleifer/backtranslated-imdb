If this is based on the relationship between true and life, as is alleged between Mrs Curtin and Mr Levinson, I am thrilled that I do not know them personally. This is painfully slow, and both characters take stupid pills throughout the movie, while the theme song is played in the ground. Many silly scenes with people who seem stupid do nothing for a comedy.
