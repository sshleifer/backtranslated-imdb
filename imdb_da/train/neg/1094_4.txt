Hard to describe this - if you were a fan of Russ Meyer movies back in the day, you will surely be happy to see that Haji still looks really hot, even though Forry Ackerman hasn't gone so well (what he still does These movies anyway? If I go up to him with a camera, will he be in my movie?). It was a pretty fun premise - a superhero whose giant breast families are her secret weapon - but sometimes it didn't blow the whole length and the jokes were on par with your average Joe E. Brown comedy (or Abbott and Costello if that's your thing ) - basically just bad saying. Yet I found this movie fascinating to see and for more than 2 reasons. Good work, but still a fundamental point of production.
