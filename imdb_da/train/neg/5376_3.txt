THE CHOKE (aka AX in the UK) is a slasher allegedly produced as a straight-to-DVD movie. I say "presumably" because the movie's title doesn't have "V" in brackets to indicate it was made for DVD movies (though it has the look of one). <br /> <br /> The reason is simple ?? a band holds a concert in a former meat packing factory, and they are killed one by one. I think most would agree that the movie should never be a masterpiece, but it does not apologize for the errors here. Even straight-to-DVD movies like BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (which have a very low IMDb rating) have many redeeming qualities and occasionally come as one of the so-called "bad ones, they are good" movies. But the choke is far from being either a serious slasher (like HALLOWEEN) or being a "so bad good" movie (like NAIL GUN MASSACRE). <br /> <br /> The movie starts well with a character killed by a drill. The blood effects were very cheesy, but understandable given the very low budget. But from there it is all the way downhill. <br /> <br /> There are so many mistakes in CHOKE that I could spend all day talking about them. But a few obvious ones stand out and I go into them. <br /> <br /> The aforementioned concert held by the band seems to start with about 50 people present, but after the music stops, there seems to be only about 8 people left (and yet they are all supposed to be locked in!). <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are not at all comfortable. Most band members are aggressive foul-mouthed morons or just as weird. No one really cares about what is happening to them, and even their supposed friends forget them when they have been sent. The highlight of the film is the presence of a homeless man who seems to regard the meat packing factory as a kind of church (seriously!). He spits some really fun lines for no apparent reason. But unfortunately, even his presence cannot save the movie. <br /> <br /> There are too many scenes of people walking around talking without any characterization. About 65 minutes of the movie is used when looking at characters walking around talking. Signs disappear for long periods without explanation. As with other straight-to-DVD movies like CROCODILE and GRIM WEEKEND, the characters spend a lot of time agitating on each other aggressively without any provocation at all. There are lots of over-the-top outbreaks (mostly from the male figures) and you almost result in a full blown battle. In fact, the format can be said to go as follows: characters go round - murder takes place - characters go around - murder takes place. You get the idea. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are spoken without the f word being used. Maybe it was supposed to be fun, but it just comes out as sad. And more to that point, we have all seen this done a thousand times before (usually for much greater effect). The movie is completely devoid of any excitement at all. The dead bodies serve to give the only indication that the signs are in danger. A madman runs around loose and yet the characters behave just like total morons. They make a little effort to get out of the factory or find a weapon to protect themselves. And much of the time they do not even let themselves be afraid. <br /> <br /> In the same vein as DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, the killer is not seen at the time of the murder (except for the final murder when the murderer's identity is revealed). A random weapon looks like nothing to kill that victim. There are no seen stalking signs at all times. In DRIVE-IN MASSACRE, this worked to make the movie fun (unintentional of course), but here it is not fun at all. <br /> <br /> And as another reviewer has pointed out, soundtrack includes music that is very bad, even for those who like punk rock. The extras seem uncomfortable to dance. The result (at the end there is no music in the beginning!) Consists of a band of Sugarbabe wannabes who sings a very bad song that is completely unrelated to the film. <br /> <br /> Do not misunderstand the points made in this review. This reviewer likes bad movies (like NAIL GUN MASSACRE and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE) as much as the classics (such as HALLOWEEN and Friday THE 13TH). But it seems that CHOKE was trying too hard to fit into one of these categories without being in either. And while straight-to-DVD movies go, this is a bad effort. <br /> <br /> In a positive note, the movie contains some pretty good gory murder scenes. But when the surviving figures do not take the situation seriously, these scenes lose their meaning quickly, as the intensity they give disappears into oblivion. <br /> <br /> Fans of the traditional 1980s B-movie slashers should take steps to avoid this movie. And fans of the classics like HALLOWEEN and Friday the 13th should do everything possible to avoid it!
