I rented this movie about 3 years ago and it still stands in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I don't think I've ever finished it. It's worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember making a flashback to something in 1970 and in the flashback there was a man with polo shirt, Oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I can't remember). I don't understand how they might have said it to be in the 70s. He might also have had a cell phone, I can't remember, it was just awful. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they themselves carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day, it's the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen some pretty bad.
