Zu Warriors should surely have been an animated series because, like a movie, it's like seeing an old anime on acid. The movie just starts out of nowhere and people just fly fighting with metal wings and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices for her lover on a cloud or something. Where this princess is a god or an angel is past me, but soon this flying wind comes in bad guy and kills her while the guy with the barbarians is fighting with another mysterious God / Demon / Wizard thing. The plot line is either not there or extremely difficult to follow you must be insanely intelligent to get this movie. The plot soon follows this Chinese mortal, who is called upon by this god to fight the evil flight, Princess kills evil guy and soon we have a very badly choreographed Uwe Boll as a battle scene complete with terrible martial arts on a mountain or something. Even the visuals are weird some may say they are amazing and colorful, but I would say they are blurry and acidic like happy (yes it is a word!). I watched it both dubbed and with subtitles and both were just as bad and hard to understand .... who I kidding I didn't understand at all. It felt like I was watching episode 30 of some 1980's anime and totally missed how the story began or I started reading a comic series 5 at number 4 because I had no idea how this thing started, where it went or how it would end, i was lost all the time. I can honestly say this was one of the worst movie experiences it was ever to see Inu-Yasha on episode 134 drunk ... yes that's right, you don't know what the hell is going on. Don't waste your brain trying to figure it out.
