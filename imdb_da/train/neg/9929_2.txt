Seeing this was like getting a big mackerel in your face again and again. Even when you thought, "The mackerel probably won't come back," * left it there. I'm not sure what they were thinking. This is the kind of pilot I saw and wondered: "Should the actors know they were on a convicted ship that would never become a series?" Not only black stereotypes, but also Swedish and Indian. And while "Blazing Saddles" made these stereotypes a mix of comedy and discomfort, these stereotypes were just as offensive. There was no plot line, the end was turned on, and the jokes were not. Still, if you're a comedy student, see this pilot to see what you shouldn't do.
