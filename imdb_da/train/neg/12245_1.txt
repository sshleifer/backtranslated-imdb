Why, o 'why ... did I pick this one up? Well ... I needed a no-brainer in the summer heat, and the deck looked cold. Of course, I should have known better. This is a really, really bad movie. And it gets embarrassing when decision makers know it's bad and try to cover it by adding some sexy / beautiful women and some sex scenes to it. Well, people ... it doesn't, do it! <br /> <br /> If you want a tough movie about a great reptile that is actually very, very good, well-played and fun: rent Lake Placid! (it is an order)
