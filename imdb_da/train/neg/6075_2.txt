One of the worst movies I have ever seen with Robert De Niro, The Fan is a pointless clich√© of an exercise in slasher flicks. It tries to spin or twist the genre with preposterous plot lines of a crazed fan turned psychotic - the movie meanders in nothing. (spoiler) We believe that a knife-throbbing idiot has access to and kills a baseball player in a sumptuous hotel without witness, security or cameras? The movie is nonsense trying to draw on our heart-strings through the hoopla of baseball ending mockingly unsophisticated and gimmicky. Not sure what all the actors thought when they boarded this raid. This is as big a dud as they come. Get far away if you prefer thoughts in your movies
