This is a very old and cheaply made movie - a typical low-budget B-Western in many ways. Gary Cooper was not yet a star, and this movie is very similar to the early movies by John Wayne made for "poverty row" studies. With both actors, their familiar style and persona were still not fully formed. This incarnation of Gary Cooper does not work exactly like Cooper a few years later (he speaks faster in this early movie, for example). Unlike the average B movie of the era, there are at least a few interesting elements that make the movie unique (if not good). If you ever want to see the woman married to Errol Flynn for seven years, it's your chance. Lili Damita stars as the female love interest and this is a very, very odd casting choice since she has a heavy accent (she was French) and was not even close to being "movie star beautiful". Besides, she was also married to director Michael Curtiz. <br /> <br /> But for me, the most memorable and weird aspect of the movie is the apparently homosexual plot - like a BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN from the 1930s (and we thought it was a new idea). Gary Cooper's character was raised by two men who hate women and do all they can through much of the movie to keep Cooper free of women. This misogyny alone does not necessarily mean much, but there are so many traces in the whole movie that indicate the filmmakers who really tried to portray them as gay couples. Especially at the end, when one of them is killed, the other shot of an arrow and loves to die far enough to crawl over to his fallen vein's body and then fall - with his arms cradled around him! This was pretty edgy for the time being, and I think that makes this boring movie really fascinating today! As far as Cooper and the plot go, the film is a little disappointed and very clear. Unless you are curious about Damita or the gay undertones, do yourself a favor and find a better Western.
