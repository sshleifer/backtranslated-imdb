In Theodore Rex, poor Whoopi Goldberg is set up as a hard police officer who is going to work with a pathetic dinosaur on a case. The film is trying to be fun and trying to make a story about kidnappings and more, but it never works. The film is far from fun, and the story is ridiculous. I voted 1/10
