This movie was disappointing. It was incomplete and boring. While Alec Baldwin tried to portray himself as the Perfect Fair and just the prosecutor (not to mention executive producer), the film never showed any of the defense councils or attempted to challenge the audience with an actual meaningful debate on the subject of how a country could be headed down such a terrible road. Of course, no one will defend the Nazi point of view, but it was the Nuremberg Trail point! Four hours of simply bashing at the Nazi .... c'mon! It's already done! <br /> <br /> I really think Alec Baldwin should just stick to being Kim Bassinger's husband. <br /> <br /> Right after the movie ended, the TNT showed the 1959 Trail Trail at Nuremberg. That movie is FAR superior.
