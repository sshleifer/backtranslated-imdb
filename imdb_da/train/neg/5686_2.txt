Hey. This is my first review for any movie I've seen. I went through the hassle of doing this to tell everyone that this is quite literally, the most obnoxious movie I've ever seen. I want the movie to be nicely made, which I will give some understanding due to budgetary constraints on doing so. I felt that I saw a very poor remake of the movie saw. As I can agree, it is also very graphic, but I liked the movie saw. <br /> <br /> The scene where he takes the hammer to the head of the bound victim in the chair is the most disturbing scene I've seen. The scene lasted almost forever, indeed, it was probably about 5 mins but still. I would like to note that I like some horror movies and I give credit if they are good. This director uwe ball, and his group of people used to make this movie must think about it before making another that looks like this. one last note haha ​​!! FOR ALL PEOPLE NOW FRIENDS TO BE ANIMALS THAT HAVE BEEN DEATH TO DEATH, LETTING ROT, WITH WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND WILL AND A FIVE MINUTES SCENE WHEN HAVING THE MAIN SMASHED IN WITH A HAMMER, then you will enjoy this movie if not And you like horror, go with a higher budget movie, for example. I can't believe people actually make movies like this. nevertheless excuse anyone who loves uwe ball and took it to heart, it's just my opinion of the movie.
