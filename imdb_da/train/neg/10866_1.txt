Let's see where to start ... bad acting; I'm not sure if I would call it that way, as it reads more like a no-effort script. The actors do not even seem to be in their parts and seemed rather lifeless and listless. Of course, there was a scene or two with nudity, but it couldn't save this movie from its lifeless characters. To call the protagonist is a rapper for the people who actually do. The song lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more like sensual rants. <br /> <br /> Budget? Did this movie even have a budget? It seemed like they were spending less money than I've seen in a home-shot YouTube video. Poor lighting, props, poor sound after production. Bad special effects if you want to go as far as calling them that. The story could have been good if the people actually seemed interested in doing so, but there was no life to this flick; I don't care who directed it. <br /> <br /> I've seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the bottom. Don't waste your time or you would like to listen to this impartial review. Check the ratings, you will see that the 1s quickly exceed the fluffed 10's with almost nothing in between. I wish I would have looked a little closer before I waste my time. What a sigh-party!
