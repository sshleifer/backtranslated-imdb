this movie was horrible. I could hardly be awake through it. I would never see this movie again if I was paid for. The so-called horror scenes in it were incrementally predictable and played over. There was really nothing about this movie that would have made it original or worth the $ 7.50 I paid to see it. Don't see it, don't rent it, don't read it online because any of these things would be a complete waste of your time. Sarah Michelle Geller gave a faint performance and should really be ashamed of blaming her good name with this movie. Shame on Sarah for being connected to this horrible, horrible movie. Horrible movie, no need to see it.
