This movie is really bad. The action is simply awful except Michael Ironside. I'm not getting the story. Richard Grieco is the only survivor after a battle between two Mc-gangs. He comes to a city, and suddenly he is chosen to fight against the bad people who want Indian land. On the cover, he said he was an Indian who came back to his hometown, I didn't hear it in the movie if it wasn't clear. <br /> <br /> Richard Grieco was a hell of a bad actor. Stiff and ugly. He also said his lines. And we didn't want to talk about Sean Young, she hasn't been any of my favorite actors, but in this movie she plays an Indian woman who falls in love with Bolt (Grieco). She's horrible. <br /> <br /> When I rented it, I chose between this and Subterfuge with Amanda Pays. I chose this one because of Michael Ironside was in the casting. Maybe I should have taken Subterfuge. Don't see this unless you think Richard Grieco looks tough on a motorcycle with sunglasses. I will soon pick up the cast list because I have it at home. I wrote it down after I watched the movie.
