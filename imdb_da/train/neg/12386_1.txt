It's hard to make an impartial judgment on a movie like this that had such an impact on me at such a young age. This is undoubtedly the worst kind of exploitation movie. I was unlucky to watch this movie for the first time in my youth, I will never forget it. I thought it was the most horrible movie ever made. I saw it again earlier this year and was once again appalled. <br /> <br /> I'm not a jealous or one to say what others should and shouldn't see, but I did a lot of offense about the way something as horrible as rape was dealt with in this movie. I love the lowbrow movie theater, but it's just ugly. Rent some Rus Myer instead.
