Need for excuse to get out of the house while painting dried - left the film after an hour to return and see paint dried. I can't remember ever going to a movie before, but I really tried to stay. The script was not up to the cast and just kept "going and going" bad - come on! Uma Thurman doing these things? Quite lame special effects. These were older characters and actors doing superficial horny 20-something life - just kind of annoying and wrong feeling. This review is based on the first hour only - it may have been better. I had to come home and see if the paint dried a darker shade than when it went on.
