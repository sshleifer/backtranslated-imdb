The only reason I give it a 2 is that filmography is so stylized these days that it at least has something to comment on. <br /> <br /> This movie is asinine. It's like so many other 21st century abrasives. Gore is free and simply disgusting. I didn't care about any of the characters, but I didn't care that some cretin plated to pen this crap: I would complain about the money I spent but my date and I went back wisely after 40 minutes and went to a adjoining theater to watch the adventurous and entertaining "Live Free or Die Hard", which probably got a much higher rating from me, simply because I endured the full poop for "Captivity" for 40 minutes.
