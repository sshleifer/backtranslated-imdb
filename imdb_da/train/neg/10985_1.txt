I don't know what Margaret Atwood was thinking about letting this movie have the same name as her book. I have always been a big fan of The Robber Bride and was so excited to learn that there was a movie in the works. I realize that the translation of book to movie is not perfect, but this movie was the worst ever. The women's names are correct and some of the history is correct, but it's about it. I feel like I've lost a good deal of my time trying to make it through this movie. This should really have been a mini-series to tell the story it was written. <br /> <br /> The actors of Roz, Tony, Charis and Zenia were well-chosen, although I was initially skeptical about Mary-Louis Parker. I just wished they had a better script to work with because it really had nothing to do with the book at all.
