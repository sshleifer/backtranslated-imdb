Hey Arnold! is a slow-paced and slightly boring movie. The reason is not very creative. The Paul Sorvino character (Shenk) buys all the upscale, cheap buildings to build a gigantic shopping mall, shopping complex and office buildings. This plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies. It's boring. Paul Sorvino is also not very exciting, so the idea of ​​him as the bad guy is not very scary. Gramps remembers something about a historical document, and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal will find the document with Helga's undercover help, whose father hopes to get rich thanks to Shenk's Mall. The kids have to move around the city on buses, and the exciting hunting scene involving a bus is not only silly, but emphasizes how this movie is written for very young children. Hey Arnold, the television cartoon is usually very entertaining, and it has enough humor to appeal to adults. The TV cartoon is usually faster and more imaginative than this movie. The Hey Arnold movie is about five times more reassured and a great way to put someone on, including kiddies to sleep. Hi Arnold was a tough one to stay awake all the way to the predictable and completely boring end. If you want to send your kids to a completely non-offensive movie then it is. I get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie, the producers started with a 30 minute TV cartoon script and tried to extend it to 90 minutes. This Mall Story could certainly have been covered by the television comic. Hopefully Arnold will bet on a better writer if ever there is a successor.
