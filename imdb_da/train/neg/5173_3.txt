When I saw this at a store, I thought it looked really good and original. Like Wolfs Creek, Texas meets the chainsaw massacre, and I think it only costs three quid (about $ 6). To be honest, I don't think it was even worth it. <br /> <br /> It looked like the directors - the "butchers" couldn't decide if they wanted to make a sort of horror or a gory slasher horror. It ended with a clich√© ride gory sadistic hour and fifteen minutes with all the characters being one-dimensional and you couldn't care less what happened to them, but to try to make the audience aware of the characters they added a useless monologue at the end and beginning of the film, which, to be honest, was not necessary. The only good part was really the middle / end - I won't ruin it for you. But that was the only "good" part. <br /> <br /> All in all, a pointless clock. It felt like a two hour movie, but was actually only 75 minutes. If you want an artistic movie, don't bother. If you want a slasher movie - don't bother - the movie moves so slowly, with nothing ever happening.
