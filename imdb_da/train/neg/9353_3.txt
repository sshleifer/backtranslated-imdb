I was enticed by the title ... I expected an insightful and exciting journey to alcoholism, instead I got a rather boring and uninspiring story of a robust shot. The leading character is not given much psychological depth unless you are willing to classify cheesy teen-like poetry as psychology. It was a shame because the core of history could have been good with a better effort to portray the inner feelings of a man who had to live with alcohol and violence since his youth. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the general idea seems to be more like "I'm the way I am because that's how I am". And the ridiculously bad attempt to give some kind of poetic edge to a subclass man makes things even worse. The resort to the overused cliché of the "poète maudit" series of a quick fix, an inexpensive way to make a boring movie seem smart, artistic and meaningful. <br /> <br /> But "16 years of alcohol" is not very smart, artistic or meaningful ... The leading character does not develop at all, and the weak attempt to change fails without a good explanation. Just like the first attempt, quite a bit of the blue happened. The movie borrows heavily from classics like A Clockwork Orange and Trainspotting, but it eventually fails to regain their grandeur, not even for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Jobson puts too much emphasis on the artistic side of the story and neglected the rest and gives us a movie that is pleasing to the eye but insensitive to the brain.
