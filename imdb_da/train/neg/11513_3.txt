* Can contain spoilers * <br /> <br /> I bent backwards to be fair to this movie. I knew the star Madonna. I knew it lasted a whole week in theaters. I knew it got many bad reviews. I do not expect a deep and thoughtful study of class, culture and sexuality that we got in the Italian original. The benefit of the doubt lasted for ten minutes. Madonna plays a rich, pretentious, nit-witted Gorgon who goes on holiday with her henpecked husband and flamboyant friends (the brunette woman is as bad as Madonna, showing some really stupid facial expressions). Adriano Giannini plays the ship's first mate, whom the Madonna character welcomes humiliating and treats like dirt in every scene they have together. Why is she such a bitch to him? Simply because the plot requires it, so later, when the two are marooned on a deserted Mediterranean island, they should turn around and he will teach her a lesson. It is just as inexplicable how they fall in love despite having nothing in common and abusing each other in two-thirds of the movie. "Swept Away" is a silly, simplified, superficial film from the beginning to the end. Madonna gives a typical wood performance. There are many stupid scenes: Madonna sings and dances viciously for Giannini's demands, a fantasy scene with Madonna and many scenes where he beats her and kicks her in the ass. Guy Ritchie does his "stylish" editing, which is ridiculous here. The film contains some of the worst dialogues I've heard in a larger movie in several years. The end is juicy and incredible. It's basically "The Blue Lagoon" meets "Overboard" minus the former's nudity and sense of humor. Madonna's ego is so big that she insists on continuing to prove herself as a competent actress. Please give it up, Madge, for our sake as well as yours. However, this is not her worst movie. This distinction still belongs to "Shanghai Surprise". She hasn't done anything worse than that ... yet.
