Extremely complicated and boring. I'm a light guy, but it was just too much for a tired brain. It would really benefit a few early traces of who these people are and what they do. Probably better for the US market. The GC itself suggested that this alone did not deliver its Oscar and you can see why. <br /> <br /> Still the sand dunes are beautiful. Nail pulls are uncomfortable. The stupid father of the lawyer is a mystery. The cricket is good to see. <br /> <br /> Very difficult to write the required ten lines on this, despite being over 2 hours long. Thank you sky they shortened it. We don't get the pictures much, but the last movie we saw, Walk the Line, was 10 times better, and I don't really like Johnny Cash. My wife says George still looks good with the beard and a few extra pounds, so that's it ... am I almost there yet? <br /> <br /> What about now
