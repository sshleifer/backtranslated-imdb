This film reminds me of how college students used to protest against the Vietnam War. As if some children had heard without cheeseburgers in Cow Dung Collehe, the president would immediately change all US foreign policy. The worst thing is that while dangerous is the concept of politics based on whether the USSR and the US went to war, it could mean the end of the world, WORK. The United States and the Soviet Union have never been at war. <br /> <br /> We only had conventional weapons, the concept of another war, a "win-able" war in Europe and Asia was not unthinkable. <br /> <br /> Not that I think they should get rid of this movie. It should be seen by film students as an excellent example of "How not to make a movie." <br /> <br /> It must be 0 stars or maybe black holes ...
