Waitress: Honey, here are the eggs you ordered. Treasure, like that, get it? It's called meaningless foreshadowing. <br /> <br /> Edward Basket: Huh? (On the way) Basket: Here's your doll back, little girl. You really shouldn't be so careless with your belongings. <br /> <br /> Little girl: Yes, whatever. <br /> <br /> Crash! Boom! Whoosh! Crackle ?? Basket: I think something bad is about to happen. <br /> <br /> (Later) Basket: Mmmm. Vicodin! What?? ? (Tears open letter.) Wow! My ex-girl's handwriting is really improved. And see, her missing daughter looks a bit like the girl with the doll, which I accidentally was kind of responsible for being killed in a way. And she has a kind of hairline. I wonder if I should torture myself and find her? Let's see what my friends in the district are thinking. <br /> <br /> The basket's male policeman: HAHAHA. Willow is a fun name. <br /> <br /> Basket: I think there's something going on. <br /> <br /> (On the island) Basket: What's in the bag? AHHH. <br /> <br /> Tree-named crone: However, it's not her daughter. <br /> <br /> (In the inn) Cart: Can you swing it? Big-boned, wood-named tavern wench: Huh? Basket: (crushes a bee). Everything is alright. Quite beautiful, formerly promising actress who plays a funny crocodile girlfriend: That's good. Honey is not a plant, though. <br /> <br /> (On greensward) Willow: Oh yes, and I forgot you are a father, my child, Conan, is, I mean Rowen. (Yawns.) I could have stayed and had a life with you. But I did not. I wanted to be a princess of the hive instead. I mean nothing. (Nods off, jerks wave, expands eyes to anime proportions). Mwah, kiss-kiss. Love you! What are we talking about? Basket: Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Who burned it? Willow: Edward. Sniff. Blink. Why. Is. You. Yelling. On. Me? Is it because I jacked your Vicodin? Sniff. Snore. What are we talking about? Basket: I think something bad is about to happen. <br /> <br /> Arrow: My lips are hurting. <br /> <br /> (In the school room) Rose: What is man? Unappal twins, in harmony: Phallic symbol, false symbol. <br /> <br /> Rose: Echo? Echo? Basket: Get off the bike. <br /> <br /> Rose: And I'm the good twin. <br /> <br /> Basket: I think something bad is about to happen. <br /> <br /> (at the beekeepers) Cart: Hmmm. Hello? Ow, ow, ow, oh gider. Silly old bear Snore. <br /> <br /> (At Queen Bee's mansion) Sister Summersisle: You have so much potential. What are you doing here? Were you not stud Cher relaxed in Moonstruck's face? (Lick's lips.) Cart: I was asking you the same. Where's the girl? Sister Summersisle: How to drone further. Let's talk about the importance of my redundant "s". Basket: Keep an eye on the semi-truck barrel against us! Aaaaah! Oh. Forget it. Goddamn! (Pops another pill.) Mmmm. Thorazine. <br /> <br /> (Back at the Inn) Big, boned, supercile tavernawench: I've been trying Weightwatchers, Jenny Craig, South Beech, and I've still gone up in a pack size since last year. <br /> <br /> Tree-named crone: HAHAHA. It is better to roast the curious policeman, my dear. <br /> <br /> Big-boned wench: Absolutely. Basketball: It was the last straw that broke the back of the back basket! Take it with you! (Snail her.) (Edward Basket is mystically attacked backwards) Awesome Taverna Wench: EEEE! Get it out! Leave the island already and take me with you! Should I tackle you or what? Get out of it, I say! EEEE! Basket: Take it with you! (Brave kicks her face. Her eyes roll back in her head and become cartoon Xs.) Voluptuous wench: Snore ?? (At the Nicolas Cage Grill) Ellen Burstyn: And who can forget the part where Basket's mobile phone rings in the middle of his carrier package scene and then the call is lost. It's like a wireless ad: Help me! Can you hear me now? Hahaha. <br /> <br /> Kate Beahan: And remember when I produced the balls, I jacked from the Basket's gun? He looked so surprised. You need to be more careful about your belongings, Nick. Hahaha. And your movie choices. <br /> <br /> Everyone: Drone must die! Basket: (screaming) Oh, you bitch? Well, I don't wanna help your treasure! Aaah. My legs! Treasure, (honey, take it?) Put that torch down and walk away from the basket. Honey! Smokey Bear doesn't say play with matches. Hahaha. What??? Beware of the fast semi-truck! Ahh! Oh. Goddammit, these backlinks from my drug search phase in the 70s are getting old! Where's my heroin? Ouch. Ouch. My watch is not fire resistant. Ouch. I think something bad is about to happen. Can you hear me now? I'm ready for my close up. Goddamn! (Six months later) Awesome wench in modern wear cloth: I told the eponymous Basket Case to take me with. Innocent young drone: I like helping people. <br /> <br /> Voltuous wench: So get me out of my sequel contract! I think something bad is about to happen. Eeeee!
