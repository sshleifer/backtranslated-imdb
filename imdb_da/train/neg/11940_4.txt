Well, I want to lie if I said this could easily compete with Spiderman or Batman movies. Still, it was more appealing to me because it is moral value. I first bought VHS when my son was about 2 years old and it immediately became his favorite. My wife and I are eager supporters of Robert Townsend and have been since he used credit cards to fund his first movie, "Hollywood Shuffle". True, he should take advantage of the technical advisers' talents and knowledge of making the movies more credible, but his films are still fun. Meteor Man delivers a hero with an Urban Contemporary feeling. I've always felt that if there were superheroes, they wouldn't give the same scenarios as depicted in the comics. Meteor One is realistic with real problems: car broken in, bad neighborhood, local drug dealers who use children for distribution, etc. The scope of his mission was largely within the community. <br /> <br /> What I found to be truly entertaining outside of James Earl Jones's "Youth Forever" show was how the neighborhood responded to his newly discovered forces. It wasn't long before they had a full agenda lined up for him, without his input, of course. It was fun to hear them offering to lend him to other communities where their extended families lived. <br /> <br /> Yes, the reason was weak, the movie was predictable, there was bad acting, and the continuity was rotten, but it ranks # 1 with my kids. Robert Townsend works to bring movies "at home" so to speak. I doubt he will ever be recognized as the talented actor / producer / director he really is, but there are and always will be those who love him for his efforts. <br /> <br /> A point to consider about the movie that I find entertaining: Throughout the fight with Simon, no one has bothered to call the police ???? What mother and father do you know who will see their son fight from a window? My mother would have been right there, scrapping by my side, toe-to-toe. Dad wanted to read his gun. lol <br /> <br /> Rent it and check it out. It's worth looking at least once for those of you who are fans of Sinbad, Luther Vandross, Bill Cosby, Big Daddy Kane etc. Good work with cameos Robert!
