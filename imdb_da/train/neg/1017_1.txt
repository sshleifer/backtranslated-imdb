Oh dear god. This was terrible. That's bad, so there was this. This movie doesn't make any sense at all. It runs all over the map and is unaware of what it says at all. The music seemed like it was trying to be like Batman. The fact that 'Edison' is not a real city takes away. Since I live in Vancouver, so watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable. Why didn't they make it a real city? The only thing that was decent was 'Tilman', where John Heard did a fantastic job. He was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy. It was actually a shame to see John Heard playing such a big bad guy with a lot of screen time, and the movie is a lick. Too bad. Hopefully, an important person will see it, and at least give John Heard credit where credit is due and recruit him as a free guy, which is where he should be. on the A list.
