Men I love police film filled with action, shooting, hunting, etc. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was let down after watching this short and unsatisfactory movie. We've seen it all before, the hostages, the bank, the surrounding ... Another two bad guys shooting down several officers and innocent people who simply stay in the fire - without being hit by some Kevlar. Not just a couple of shots, no, hundreds of shots. Going back to the bank where the stupid hostages did not lock the security or the doors when the evil boys went out. How stupid the director thought we would be. Okay, the shot between the fake a documentary was good, but after watching the movie I only got the idea: why wasn't the police getting a decent shooting course? And why were there so many police and was SWAT on a really long break. Really bad.
