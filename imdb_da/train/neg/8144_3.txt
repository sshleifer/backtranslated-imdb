I just saw this at the 2006 Vancouver International Film Festival. Synopsis in the festival guide sounded pretty good, so we decided to check this out. I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> In addition to being poorly written, it was boring. I don't want to get away from the actors as there is not much they could do with this bad script. First bite was clich√© without being ironic, over the utmost seriousness without being fun. The movie would have been better had Hunt Hoe walked with a kampy horror feel. Instead, he took himself seriously and it resulted in a dull movie. I can't recommend this movie. It felt too long and all in all just plain weak.
