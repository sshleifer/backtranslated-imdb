I only today, picked this up at 99 cents only store today and I still think I was ripped off. "Dream to Believe" is a rather boring and unrealistic gym drama and $ 1 is just for freakin 'expensive for this. This movie is probably only known for 2 things: 1. It has a young Keanu Reeves. And 2. It is led by Paul Lynch, the man who also did Promo Night. Now on the movie. <br /> <br /> It's about a girl named Robin (The Game of Olivia D'Abo) who is badly hurt from a car accident that also costs her father's life. So the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastics tournaments, she is often admitted during her classes and finally she meets a wild child called Tommy. (The game of Keanu.) Robin, when not in training, works part-time with his mother and stasist, in a laundry owned by her fierce stepfather. Eventually she is chosen to compete. <br /> <br /> All in all, Keanu is alone and some catchy 80s tunes that prevent me from giving this one star, nor is it one of the worst movies ever, but still far from good. The DVD itself does not get any medals, nor does it seem to have been downloaded from an old VHS, and at the end the sound is not synchronized, and when the final credit is almost over, it falls to black even though the sound may still be heard . So this can probably be passed as a bootleg. The DVD artwork has no meaning, nor does it because it has what seems to be newer images of Keanu and Olivia, and the background has nothing to do with the film, as it is not in the film itself, so the cover is of course photographed . Avoid at all costs unless you are a Keanu fanatic. I will no longer hang on to it. I will probably give it to The Cinema Snob, which is a great YT critic btw. Hello, if any of you have crazy movies that they no longer want in their eyes, then give them free to keep his show running.
