Slasher films are often seen as the derivative, repeated and honestly unoriginal. I happen to be a horror movie fan, but this movie was just so bad, words fail me. The script is seriously missing, the plot is ridiculous, it seems amazingly bad. Just an all-round stink that I wasted the time of my life on. This had the entire entertainment value of a 15th sequel to a movie that was bleak at first. <br /> <br /> Who greenlit this mess? <br /> <br /> I just liked two things in this movie. The first was the killer mask - which was lovely. The second was the austrailian affinity with humorous profanity. Save yourself and avoid this hideous mess.
