This film should have pictured a 'ladie's man' bachelor degree who was ready and willing to settle down once and for all. But I didn't care about his mission to settle down, because I didn't care about his character. I don't understand what all these beautiful women saw in him. He had absolutely no class or charisma. He should at least have had a way about himself that made the ladies weak in the knees, except that his saxophone played, but to no avail. Just because he's a musician, he's not sexy. Not to mention, the things he did to get the attention of a married woman, he fell in love for a period of five minutes knowing her was utterly outrageous and ridiculous. Does this man have any shame, what-so-ever? Had he cleaned up and stopped doing and saying stupid things, he would have been more attractive as a sign, but unfortunately his character was bland and boring. Gina Gershon's character was unnecessarily British. She could just as easily have been a stretched out-of-towner with her ordinary speaking voice than a bad British accent that would sometimes fade through the movie. <br /> <br /> The only two characters I cared about were the fish and the frog. Now they had two chemistry! Academy nominations for both ?? STATE! Plot holes, lack of character development, horrible action, unnecessary drama, clich√© moments ... What a mess in a movie.
