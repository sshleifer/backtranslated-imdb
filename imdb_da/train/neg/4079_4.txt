I bought a DVD of this movie for my girlfriend who has the same name as the ghost girl in this movie and enjoys movies about the paranormal. The movie was shot completely on video so it looks like a PBS is special about it. The special effects are fake looks, but there are actually some scary moments in the movie that made us jump into our seat. There is a particularly effective scare that involves a Virgin Mary statue. But the play is bad, the "plot" scenes are long and very boring, and I will tell you, I have no idea what happened at the end. If you get the movie, rent it, if you buy it, make sure you pay less than $ 5.
