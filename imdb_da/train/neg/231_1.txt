It starts badly, what about the three women who appear to simulate junior high school wussies sitting around giggling with their gin, endless cigarettes and a caramel chocolate treat for the one who tells the best 'man' story and then it becomes worse - = - spoiler alert = - = what about Andie's character falling for the young organ player who used to be her student when he was 14 years old (she is the head of an English school, believe it or not), for only to have him destroyed thanks to her bitch-from-hell 'girlfriend'. .. and from there it is basically invisible flap: she forgives her friend and has the organ player's love child, and the 3 women finish as they started, drink more gin and smoke more cigarettes blah blah blah. Andie's character throws the caramel chocolates into the street, in a pathetic attempt to symbolize growth. Have mercy.
