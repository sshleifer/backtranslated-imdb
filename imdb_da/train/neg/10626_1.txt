This documentary is based on mushroom cake as soon as you put some true evidence on it, the integrity slows down slowly into a large pile of crap, for example Bart Sibrel claims that they must have had more light sources because the shadows appear to cross. If this were the case, there would not be two or more shadows for each object, as Apollo 11 went through the van Allan radiation belts, they spent 30 min there, not the 90 Mins claimed in the documentary, and they received a dose of radiation more equivalent to one. of an x ​​ray. <br /> <br /> seriously doing some research what really happened, don't let this pile of crap of a documentary mold your mind about what really happened
