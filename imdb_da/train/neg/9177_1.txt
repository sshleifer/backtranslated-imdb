The Dead of the Dead was the worst movie I've ever seen, between the pathetic 'matrix' 360 camera angle trials and the cheesy action I fell asleep. I don't think the director and the nominee could decide whether it was raining or not because there would be rain on one side of the boat and not the other. I would rate this movie a 1 out of 10, (10 is the best, 1 is the worst). Also jumping scenes from the movie to the game were really annoying, it makes you wonder if they just made up for losing time. I ask anyone reading this not to see it. It's not worth the time.
