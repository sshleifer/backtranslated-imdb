An idiotic dentist finds out that his wife has been unfaithful. So no new story lines here. But the authors managed to create a stupid, obnoxious film. If you enjoy watching children vomiting or seeing a dentist imagine pulling all his wife off in a bloody horror type, watch (or hire) the movie. If not, move on to something else (ME LADY LOVE, anyone?)
