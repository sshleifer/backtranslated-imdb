After the success of the (horrible) Gilligan's Island TV movie gills, a number of television films were made in the 1980s reunion of casts from classic shows. Most of these movies were completely missed out on the boat as far as recreating the humor that made the shows so special. MUNSTERS REVENGE is among the most disappointing because it goes to a Laurel and Hardy-type comedy style that really wasn't in the original series. Yvonne De Carlo, a wonderful comedienne and essential for the series, is totally wasted - she has less time here in this 90 minute movie than she did in a single 30 minute episode. And since the roles "Eddie" and "Marilyn" in this movie are no more than cameos, what was the point of making them younger and reworking them? With very little rewriting they could have used Butch Patrick and Pat Priest. Although I saw part of Munsters spooky family members, I was happy to enjoy Sid Caesar as the hammy food scientist mainly because there is too much of him and not enough of the under-utilized Munsters (ironically the yearly 1981, emperor's old partner I comedy , Imogene Coca, was also inappropriately thrown into a major role in a television movie reunion RETURN OF THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES). Another strange inexplicable bit at the beginning of the film is the Munster family represented as wax figures in a local horrorwax museum. Why should they be in there as they were a "typical" (if strange) American family, not famous monsters? This was the last Munsters project with the original cast in their roles. There was a horrific revival of the series in the late 1980s with a brand new cast and a 1990s television movie that included DeCarlo, Lewis, Priest and Patrick in cameo roles as a family dining.
