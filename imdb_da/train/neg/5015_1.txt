As a film critic for several Dutch websites, I have to see many films, and not all very good. Some movies are so bad, you won't be surprised to be released directly on video. In taboo, IÃ¡m surprised that it was released on video at all. This is really low budget poor quality bad dirt waste. <br /> <br /> A group of young people play a game of taboo. They write down their most boring desire or action, and later people are murdered for their taboo. The question is if we believe in what we see? <br /> <br /> The movie has a potentially interesting plot twist and I won't give it away here. But what could have been interesting stays silly, badly acted and without reason. <br /> <br /> Some of the players have played in major titles before, so why on earth did they write this? If you see this everywhere, try to avoid it. There is no logic, no human sense of quality in this movie.
