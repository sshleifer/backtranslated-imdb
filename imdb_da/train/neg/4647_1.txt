Half of the reviews were good so I took a chance for $ 10. Safe Priscilla Barnes had some sex talk but it wasn't much. The whole plot later that she may be the second actress mother and the documentary producer who falls for the young woman stretches it. It's not fun, it's not that great, it's not much more than a waste of time. Boogie Nights was based on real people who were in the adult business, this is based on nothing that has ever happened in the industry. It could have been shocked at what is popular today in adult movies that mocking today's gonzo videos and the big orgy that they had 5 minutes to shoot what a joke a major orgy has been doing bigger and better decades ago in early 1970s.
