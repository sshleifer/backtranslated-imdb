This movie is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. From the very first scene I knew it would be a shredder. It starts with a seemingly poor girl killing a bunch of nuns in a mission. As it turns out, the people in it were obsessed with some random zombies. Some years later, some college children draw some promises. Terrible acting goes from promise to head. Things jock shouted at him to do things in a quite non-chaloton way, with the promise of responding and overtaking it all "eager to be popular role". What really took the cake with this is the final battle. Absolutely terrible special effects with the guns. For example, weapons make a noise without a nose flash and vice versa. This is accompanied by stop animation zombies (why they are moving in stop motion is a mystery), cheesy music and about 40 guns that come out of nowhere. In general, this movie is crap. Like many others, you can rent for 50 cents at your nearest low brow movie rental site.
