An actor asks, "What is my motivation?" To understand his or her character. Having seen this "docudrama", this vague and random farce, one wonders what a person's motivation was. <br /> <br /> This inexpensive daytime TV (Oprah show) missed by a mile is a great opportunity to explore major issues. <br /> <br /> Its characters were all superficial and superficial, its history line far less socially redeeming than a "Simpsons" episode. Gratuitously, it emphasized investigating the police as unprofessional and incompetent. It failed to offer why the court could treat the protagonist, a female nanny, so differently than it would have a male perplexity. Why did this unmanned woman begin to "care" her second class student, began an affair with him when he returned to his sixth grade class? Why did the boy's mother testify for her? The simple answer is overwhelming narcissism, plus generational rationalization and greed. The film gave no hint about it. Why was the viewer not informed that the victim's mother sold interview rights to write and TV tabloids, parading his young son on "The Today Show"? At Mary Kay's lawyer she even applauded a "son of co" statute so she could take advantage of her crime by selling her story to the highest bidder? Why was it not explained that LeTourneau's father was a former right wing Republican Congressman, the American Independent Presidential candidate of 1972, the President of the John Birch Society? In 1983, John Schmitz's political career ended when he was found to have had children of his own college, only postponed when the mistress sexually met their infant son? Nevertheless, Letourneau's father had removed his many children from "for liberal" Catholic schools and struggled to keep all schoolchildren from receiving sex education. <br /> <br /> A month after her conditional release, again pregnant with the now 14-year-old's second daughter, Mary Kay received 7 1/2 years in prison for several attempts at violations. A prophetic editorial editorial about the sad affair then appeared in the Seattle Times: "At the end of two miserable hours, LeTourneau was led out into prison, and this terrible melange of television seaminess was completed until casting began." <br /> <br /> Surely, 18 months later, filming of this travesty was on its way.
