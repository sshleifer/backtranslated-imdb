This movie was pretty absurd. There were a lot of fun parts. Its going straight into the box of movies in my memory where I think, "Hmm ..... that movie had a few fun parts, but in general, pretty ridiculous plot (or lack of)." <br /> <br /> I thought it seemed that Ben was trying too hard to be a cooky fun guy. And I didn't understand how he was a self-made multi-millionaire and still such an idiot. Anyways I like Ben Affleck. He does some shit, but hey, I can forgive him. I mean, I liked the Jersey Girl, I didn't think Gigli was his fault, I like him in general. I think he's like a kid you feel sorry for, he just can't seem to get it right. <br /> <br /> My advice would be to avoid this flick. It didn't really develop into a usable plot, and Catherine O'hara and Jimmy G. were not used as well as they could have been. They deserved better. Overall, this movie is not home alone, it's not a Christmas story, it's not Christmas holiday or any of the other classics. Forever Forgettable.
