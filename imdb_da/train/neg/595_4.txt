Creep - "Your journey ends here." Some very graphic scenes and ... yes, it's all about this movie. No real plot, no story. No sympathetic signs, yes, 'signs' are not correct, considering that you have no idea who really is. I think they are being chased by some weird-looking 'things' in the sewers (who is this thing? Why is he there?), It's pretty scary, but I don't care about it? No I do not. Why don't I? Because I have no idea who these people are, and I do not know if I want them to live or die. It is one-dimensional and depends on gore and sound effects to scare you, which it rarely does. <br /> <br /> This movie has no meaning, any purpose. It feels as if I fell asleep and missed the 45 minutes to build. It jumps right into the action. Basically, some women and her friends are locked in the London Underground, chased by a strange creature, and finally they come from it. <br /> <br /> Creep has its moments that make you jump, the art is good, the location is excellent and the sounds are ok, but it doesn't make a decent horror movie, so unfortunately all that goes to waste . <br /> <br /> It's nothing new. Another predictable modern "horror" where Kate (the leading character) consistently does the stupid "hello, I know you are very much at home, I think should make sense in this situation, but oooh no! I am going to do it Total opposite, because I'm a stupid blond "thing. I wish they wouldn't do it, it's done so many times, it's boring and predictable. In fact, I'm pretty annoyed, the stupid woman was not crushed by the sleek, gray foreign look. <br /> <br /> "Your journey ends here" is the film's roofline. Well, Creep's journey only stops for a moment in the movie. If you've had a few beers, get a couple of friends back with you, then be sure to see it in every way. But if you want something original and wise, avoid.
