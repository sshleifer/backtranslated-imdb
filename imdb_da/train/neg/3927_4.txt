Such a common horror story of a luxury building in Brooklyn that stores the gates to hell. It is reminiscent of Polanski's "The Tenant" (released a year before "The Sentinel"), but is too far away from the film from the Polish filmmaker in every aspect possible. The "tenant" was so disturbing, while "The Sentinel" is not at all. <br /> <br /> What is more surprising from this movie is the cast: it is full of big names on American cinema (Burguess, Gardner, Wallach), veteran actors acting for food (I guess). Rating: barely entertaining. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 4/10
