I grew up, Joe Strummer was my hero, but even I became cold with this movie. For better and worse, The Future Unwritten is not a simple "behind music" style documentary. Rather, it is a biographical art film, shock full of interviews, performance footage, home movies, and mostly pointless animation sketches lifted from "Animal Farm". The film is continuous but long lasting for about half an hour. The pitch of the campfire while touching the tank is actually quite annoying in execution. First, without titles, it's hard to know who half of those interviewed are. Secondly, who really needs to hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp and John Cusack mumble licking on the man? They were not relevant to Strummer's life, and their opinions add nothing to their story. <br /> <br /> This image is best when Strummer touches the facets of his life through taped interviews and conversation, most of whom did not know: his elder brother's suicide, manifested by the death of his parents, the joy of fatherhood. For me, these were mostly moving because it showed Joe Strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved, but as an ordinary person who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life, we must all face. <br /> <br /> There have been better, simpler documentaries about Strummer and The Clash. (Westway, VH1 Legends and Kurt Loder's famous early 1990s MTV documentary come to mind.) Joe Strummer: The future is depreciated, only for the dead.
