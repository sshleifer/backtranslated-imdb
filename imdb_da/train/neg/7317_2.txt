After reading the other comments on this movie, I would like to share my own view that this is a tough movie to see unless you are a total Brooksophile. I'm not. <br /> <br /> Looking at a purely objective observer, the film is an unbalanced narrative that gives us more undisturbed neuroses than being able to absorb in a meeting. It's pretty hard to see. The Brooks character (Robert Cole) is so unsympathetic and uncomfortable that it is difficult to relate to him --- let alone the root of him as he stumbled from a dysfunctional self-centered situation to the next. And he should NEVER make a topless scene and expect to be taken seriously in a romantic context. No man could have such much exposed foliage and should turn on a child like Kathryn Harrold ---- unless of course he is Albert Brooks in an Albert Brooks controlled production. "Modern Romance" has its fun moments ----- but they are fragmentary and rare. More often than not, I felt like I was on a limited journey with a thoroughly unlucky person and wished it would end already. It confirms the problems that can develop when too much control of a movie is placed in just one person --- a person who lacks the self-discipline in order to step back from it and see what is clearly happening. <br /> <As most people know, James L. Brooks, who played the director of this movie, is actually what he portrayed. Six years later, he threw Albert Brooks into the very successful Broadcast News. James showed us how Albert can shape a credible and entertaining cartoon. Albert allowed us to see James (generally not cast as an actor) making a rare cartoon in a surprisingly effective way. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Modern Romance" will now have moved on to the next commentary comment about it. For you I say ----- there is enough pain in the world without having to find it in a movie intended for entertainment.
