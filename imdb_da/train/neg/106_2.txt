1. Looked at 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): Mindless 3-D movie about carnivorous zombies in a 3 story movie movie. And yes, we'll see zombies eating human flesh in 3D !! Wow, not !! It has been done again and again in 2D in a zombie film, but what usually makes a zombie film better is the underlying story not the actual meat eat. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The meat meal was just thrown in as an extra. We are bored in most of this 3-part chronicle because of the lame (twilight-zone like) easily understood and slowly revealed final s. The last story is actually the story the movie started with (having a reporter examined one so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see meat-eating zombie in one too. Well, I think I've said enough. See the classics, not this 3D drilling party.
