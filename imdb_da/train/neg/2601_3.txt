I just watched the movie for the first time. I wanted to see it as I like Drew Barrymore and wanted to see one of her early movies. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a girl (played by young and beautiful Drew Barrymore) who moves from NYC to LA to overcome her recent troubled loss. Shortly after moving to a guy who falls in love with her, it becomes obvious that she has an evil twin = doppelganger who mocks her. The movie is pretty bad and miserable. Both the dialogues and the play do not really make the film worth seeing. In summary, it's just something for fans of Drew Barrymore.
