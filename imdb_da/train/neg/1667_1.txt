I really liked this movie to the end. Sure, it was cheesy and pretty unlikely, but it was still my attention on a rainy afternoon. Until the end it is. For her final achievement in the prestigious classic conservatory where she has struggled to catch up with the other classically educated students, what does the protagonist do? Wow them with her understanding and execution of this time honored musical tradition? No. She tortures and slaughters the great sensuous Habanera from Carmen and makes it a completely forgettable Brittany Spears wannabe pop song. My ears blew! And at the top moment of horror, her teachers gave her a standing ovation! Any teacher who was not in a Spears-induced fantasy would have failed her on the spot. Save your time, save your ears - skip this movie!
