I recently saw Belle Epoque and thought it might be wonderful when it won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. I was a little underwhelmed by the film's predictability and simplicity. Perhaps the conflict I had was that from the moment the film was filmed for now, a manuscript that falls to beautiful women and eventually falls to the good girl has been done so many times. Except for the predictability of the plot, some scenes in the movie really felt out of place with the story (eg, a particular wedding event). At times, the film was a bit predictive in its ideas and compared to the Franco era, the film was set and the Church. The only thing that the film was about to be was that the violet moments of nature, nature and character were a strong independent woman in times when women were not really associated with these qualities.
