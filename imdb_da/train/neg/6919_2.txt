My room comrades & I shorted our television from the many tips we did while we watched this hilarious piece of 1970's self-pseudo-zen drunk. I wanted to read about this campfest for years and scanned my local television listings for years in search of this unpleasant rage. Several years ago, our local ABC affiliates were known to show cool flicks for their late night weekend flick (ie "Frogs", "Night of the Lepus", etc.). Then one day happened: at 1:40 on a Saturday night (over 5 years ago) it was! We had over 15 people over and flicked not disappointed! <br /> <br /> Look! Andy Griffith as the silliest and most unpleasant bad guy since Jaye Davidson in "Stargate"! See! William Shatner has a wide variety of things at the top of his head that only slightly resemble human hair (or something organic for that matter). <br /> <br /> Listen! jaw falling in the 1970s psychobabble that makes "chicken soup for the soul" sound like bf skinner <br /> <br /> Feel! Content like any decade was better than the 70s. <br /> <br /> For those still reading ... a plot bypasses the middle class middle level a - holes that choose to suck up to their s head (Griffith) by joining him at a cross dessert dessert that spans California and Mexico. They carry all leather jackets, see more Christopher Street than anything else. Along the way, they stop at a canteen, get pounded, smoke smokes (the sight Robert "Mike Brady" Reed smoke a common is a picture you will not soon forget), start a fight, try rape and just act as a bunch of suburban middle class jack offs. Although I have an excellent copy that I taped the TV, I wish this one would be released on video so that the whole world could enjoy its half-baked goofiness.
