Even when I watched this movie on a teenager, I just wondered how ironic it was that Pia Zadora starred in a movie about an artist who slept his way to the top. As beautiful and sexy as Mrs Zadora is, she couldn't keep this excused excuse for a film from refueling. Not even her photo shoot for the Penthouse, where "The Lonely Lady" was promoted "back in the day", could keep this movie from refueling. The only thing that could have saved this movie? A completely different script. Give this one a lady.
