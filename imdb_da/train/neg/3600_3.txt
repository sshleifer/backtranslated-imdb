A question for all of you girls out there: If a man you've never met before accidentally phoning for that purpose and continuing to do so at the most unclear moments, you would be fascinated by him or so confused you called the police ? Yeah, that's what I thought so I couldn't swallow the idea of ​​Marti Gerrard putting up with Connor Hill's unworthy attention. <br /> <br /> ***** MILD SPOILERS ***** <br /> <br /> This is a really stupid story. Connor Hills wife is murdered and the plot is about the question is Connor calling Marti so he can get an alibi? But there's a massive hole in the logic here, couldn't Connor have used a hitman? something the prosecution apparently ignored. And was there no forensic medicine on the murder scene? So why is the whole trial of Connor calling Marti at the time of the murder? Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. And it's so predictable that it's brainless. <br /> <br /> My memory of this movie is that for anyone who made the Winter Olympics Marti Gerrard is a real crap downhill skier
