I grew up seeing and loving TNG. I just recently finished watching the whole series of ST Voyager on DVD, which may have increased my sense of disgust at this episode, as the difference in style and approach between the two shows couldn't be more sharp. The idea may have been good if used as an opportunity to further expand Riker's character, which is how it would probably have been addressed at VOY. They could have presented memories that would be "new" to the audience, rather than just reviving old show clips. The input and output transitions between the "memories" and the "present" in this episode begin as a clich√© at the beginning and become very unacceptable as the weary pattern is worn again and again. Bar no worst episode ever.
