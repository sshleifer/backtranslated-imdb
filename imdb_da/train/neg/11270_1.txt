I have seen bad movies, but it took me. Didn't make any sense, and all the signs make you swear every few seconds, oh, and I think you have a low sperm count. It is well. A welsh man plays a heavy cockney. A beautiful English blocker plays a spooky, unevenly crooked villain of a paddy, and some minor lights play bad pies. <br /> <br /> And there are some Russian gangsters. Oh yes, one has a gun and maybe speaks some nonsense while it is high on drugs. Avoid this movie like the plague.
