This movie is pure guano. Mom always said if you can't say anything good ... but even mom would say I had to do my part to warn others about this movie. <br /> <br /> I can guarantee this is the movie that Geoffrey Rush wants just to go away. I would hope that Greg Kinnear fired his agent from a cannon to give him the script. Then Ben Stiller probably asks for someone to pitch "There is still something about Mary." I have always been a fan of Wes Studi, thanks whatever you care about having a mask through the movie, so maybe people won't identify the movie with him. <br /> <br /> It starts promising with a stylistic spoof of the movie movie of the Batman movies and just loses something ... as a coherent plot and half decent effects. The jokes are telegraphed one hour before the punchline comes, and even then they fall flat. To see an effective spoof of the cartoon world, see "Chasing Amy". <br /> <br /> RUN! DO NOT REMOVE FROM "MYSTERY BUT"!
