One is the highest rating I could have given this movie, considering zero and negative numbers are not allowed. Pee yew, meaningless mess on a movie with a lot of wasted b-list actors who have done better work, written and directed by a guy with the mentality of a twelve year old who smiles and giggles on stupid puns and poop and speed jokes. For example, Gene Stapelton's character, which tells Marilu Henner's character that she "swings both ways" sexually, was a cheap attempt at humor that suggests the film's general lameness ... You want good, cheeky humor? Rent Animal House, American Pie (only part one), Old School or Office Space.
