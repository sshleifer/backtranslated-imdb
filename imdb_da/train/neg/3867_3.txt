Oh-so-known comedy story of key-shaped, cozy guy Paul (Jason Lee) who, after the night of his bachelor party, wakes up to bed with Becky (Julia Stiles), an attractive blonde, he just met the night before. Having lied about it to his fiance Karen (Selma Blair), he is forced to tell more and more lies to cover his tracks. I'm sure most of us have witnessed a story like this at least once before ... on film or on television. The movie is formal and EXTREMELY predictable, with one end you can see a mile away. <br/> <br /> At least, the cast gives some interest and keeps it observable. Lee is at the forefront, and Stiles is very fun in a shining comedic role that differs from the very serious roles she usually plays. Becky is a free spirit that seems to change jobs as often as other people change their clothes. <br /> <br /> But you know it's not exactly written. At least one question is unanswered: for what exactly is Ray (Lochlyn Munro), Becky's brutal ex-boyfriend being investigated by IA? <br /> <br /> And I didn't like Buck's character (David Koechner), Paul's founder; He is a super-uncomfortable moron who came so fast on me, I asked someone to beat him. <br /> <br /> Add another debit: A free, unredited como of comedian / actor Larry Miller, again plays a grouch (in this case, it is slightly justified - his character is an ultra-conservative minister). Not good at all, but as usual for me I give it a three out of ten based on the effort of the cast alone.
