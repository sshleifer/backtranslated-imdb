The film looks super on paper. A romantic comedy where a frightening lover gets caught up in a smuggling thriller should be generic crossing gold, especially with this superb space combination. I'm afraid Lawrence Kasdan just gives his two stars too much rope themselves and they duly go and hang out. Adam Brooks' script may well be blamed, but you would expect better from Kevin Kline of a Fish Called Wanda. Instead, the two ping pong from each other and the unlikely widespread romance never reconciled satisfactorily with the reason they are in and dashing around France. <br /> <br /> Jean Reno is a star-a-heart and I think he was a star-with-a-part. Mind you, he continued to do these Pink Panther remake (s!) So maybe he was ok with this ... 3/10
