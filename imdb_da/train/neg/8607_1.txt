<br /> <br /> The movie "Snails" is unique because titular pests are actually the good guys in this horrible natural history that has gone wrong. You see, these poor swallows have been mutated through the pollution of evil people and do not mean to do anything malicious, they are just snail snails with sharp teeth eating meat and secreting poison, but swallowing nonetheless. The real bad ones are the people who either actively try to destroy our beloved snails or overreact when they encounter them. <br /> <br /> Take the scene where the guy puts on the glove full of snails. They were just hanging out in a comfortable working glove when this naked hand came out of nowhere and they reacted instinctively, defended themselves and bite the guy. Now, instead of seeking medical help for his snooze, this guy runs around his greenhouse, screaming like an idiot, wasting some very volatile chemicals, starting a fire, knocking a shelf over himself and cutting out his own hand - so The fire and volatile chemicals mix and his house explodes. How can you blame it on the snail? <br /> <br /> This film paints a portrait of people who are less than favorable. The characters in this movie are the stupid sheriff who hates everyone, the full hick that is the means for his dog and the lumpy sidekick whose wife is at least forty-five years older than him. There is also a set of drunk teens <br /> <br /> being attacked while they are being copied, and we must see the genitals of the shiny long-haired freaks. Meanwhile, there is a guy who resembles a demonic Leslie Neilson shouting, "You have no authority to declare a good birthday!" for some reason. Finally, this parade of ridicule is rounded off by the guy from the MST3K classic "Pod People" whose face explodes after eating a slug-lace salad (another easily avoided fate is due to the helpful, harmless snails). <br /> <br /> People are portrayed as greedy, stupid, racist, alcoholic, and in a meaningless scene that would be rapists. In the film's climatic scene, the evil people try to burn the snails, which cooperate helplessly in the sewers. Well, since they are idiots, people succeed in blowing up the whole city. They alone do more harm than the snail ever did! <br /> <br /> If you hate people and I know I will appreciate "Snails". If you are a fan of poor cinema, you will also appreciate this crapfest from the director of "Pieces" and "Pod People". There are probably bad plays, silly dialogue, illogical plot twists, lame special effects, pointless scenes and bad dubbing to keep your attention.
