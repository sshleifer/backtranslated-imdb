I sometimes watched this movie, and all I can say is that this is low budget waste and that it has nothing to do with a real story. Actors' performances are very poor, but it is the result of limited functionalities. Anyone who saw this movie now thinks of Hitler as some crazy, skinny lunatic, who runs a gun like some Chicago gangsters. I can only say that there are much better movies about Hitler and Germany in those years and that the uprising is much below average. I can recommend German film Downfall, where you can see the brilliant performance of Switzerland actress Bruno Ganz in a roll Adolf Hitler.
