I was really looking forward to this show considering the quality of the players and the fact that The Scott brothers were involved. Unfortunately, my hopes were dashed! Once again, we are led to believe that the KGB is a group of creepy morons who have no idea what they are doing. At one point there is a ridiculous scene where 4 KGB agents could not handle a CIA agent. I get tired of these biased, one-sided, and completely inaccurate depictions of the Spy game that took place during the Cold War. I find it ridiculous that the United States is unable to make objective films about their engagement in the 2nd and 2nd years. Like the pathetic U-571, where we are led to believe that the United States got the Enigma machine again, completely wrong. <br /> <br /> For its credit, "The Company" is very well filmed and acted. The sites are also exceptionally suitable. Alfred Molina puts a good performance, just like Keaton (The conflict between them is very well done). I really wanted to like this show and no doubt I will end up seeing the other 2 episodes, but I really want American productions to stop trying to portray their Spies, soldiers, etc. As super men who are very intellectual and physically superior to anyone on the planet. It gets old quickly and seriously detracts from the plausibility of what might have been a 10/10. <br /> <br /> S
