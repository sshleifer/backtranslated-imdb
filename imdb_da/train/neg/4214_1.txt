I just wasted a few hours watching this and in 80% of the time in complete disbelief, I can give this waste of the turkey price this year, no problem. To say that the plot was incredible is some great understatement. Frankly, I'm lost to words to describe this complete tripe. Not only are the letters completely and completely without any originality (this kind of thing has been done much better in dozens of "serial killer flicks"), but the play was fierce. For those who pay to see this, I hope you get your money back, for those who were paid to do this, I hope you give back your money. Believe me, there are many new releases out there that are much, much better. Go see.
