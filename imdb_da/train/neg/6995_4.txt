Fun, how many of the people who say this is far better than Romero's version, tends to be very young (judging by their other posts). What we have here is a beautiful, action-packed, gory and "Whoopee" filled 2 hour MTV video. Frantic editing, pop-video camera work, "cool" music blah blah blah. In fact, it's not bad compared to other recent remakes (chainsaw massacres were a total disaster) ... pretty good acting all round, totally predictable in "who will die next" bets and a total cash in on Dawn Of The Dead name That will generate lots of revenue only from fans of the original who will go and watch it out of curiosity ... <br /> Don't remakes by classics come on your nerves? Can't they really come up with something original? Why Reintroduce Dawn Of The Dead? The things that made the original special (the middle segment child thinks is so boring, must be slow to show how to achieve everything you ever wanted you to still not be happy) is missing. This is an action flick, clean and simple. The faster the better. If you're into action flicks (and like this, the 2004 version is well done) fair enough, but for anyone who likes a little stuff for their movie ... get ready to sigh (again) ... < See the theaters over the next few years as we get The Godfather series restored by the most fashionable pop director at the moment, and Star Wars remade with all the kids saying how the new version is miles better cos the old version is slow and dull and keeps a camera shot for more than 5 seconds ... Not bad, but in 10 years they will still discuss the Romero version, not this card
