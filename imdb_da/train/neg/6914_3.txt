I watched this movie for a while (while I was working on a trailer for the film's production company) and it was terrible. Hewitt is at best mediocre, Hopkins phones in performance (but still blows Hewitt into their scenes together) and Alec looks bored. Trust me in this: You should avoid this movie as the plague if ever released. It seems to go on forever as the tired plot unfolds at a snail's pace. It is relentlessly unfunny, the cinematography is crazy and the direction is pedestrian. Alec Baldwin will go to the film school if he plans to look again. With regard to his action, his character is totally unlikely, which makes it impossible to root for him. Dan Ackroyd is quite funny, and the surprising make-up of the jury near the end of the film is cute, but this movie is simply horrible.
