This is not as fun and crooked as the DVD box claims. I really love the twisted and animal films, but this one is really boring! It's an hour of ripped penises, flying Baby Born dolls and a lot of rape! I think the intention of this amateur veil was to make an It's-so-bad-it's-good movie, but it fails. It's just bad! A few scenes are ok, but on the whole it's a mess. If you like amateur splatter like this (Only way better) I would recommend Andreas Schnass's Violent Shit 2 and 3.
