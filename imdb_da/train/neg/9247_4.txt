"The Bank" (1915, Chaplin) "The Bank" was one of Charlie's 1915 Essanay films. While this group of movies is more visible than their colleagues in 1914, it seems a bit below average. The gag with the watchful dual combination-locked vault and the hard luck ending, Charlie has woken up from a dream where he strives with the main lady hair, to fight only on a mop's head, which he had used as a quasi pillow, are both classic Chaplin moments. They are both ironic the beginning and the end. The center is filled with battles with the rival co-worker guard and busting a bank robbery to win the girl. Mop is probably the biggest physical plug of this movie, and Charlie uses it for expert comedy effect, whether it's the meaning of his character or not. The mop seems to be Charlie's alter-ego doing things he wants he could do but didn't want with his own two hands. Interesting things, but there is better.
