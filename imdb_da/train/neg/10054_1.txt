I am not alone in admiring the first Superman movie, a movie masterfully performed by Richard Donner. I'm not alone in scoring Richard Lester's Superman 2 ... which brings us to the Richard Donner clip of the same movie, unfortunately it's still an absolute abomination. Superman's world is one where suspension of Vantro is required in strong doses, but Superman 2 stretches things too far. It doesn't matter who instructed Superman 2, because the script insults a first-degree intelligence. In a way, there is no plot because the characters have zero motivation to act as they do, unlike the original superman. With or without his powers, the superman's strength (or lack thereof) is handled in the least credible way. There is too much to criticize, so I will not disturb. I condemn this movie ... Maybe the slapstick in the Lester version is more appropriate for the moronic script that this movie is based on. Super-Duper bad.
