I saw this bomb when it hit theaters. I laughed all the time. Why? Because the stupidity of it seemed to have made me go crazy. I look back at it and realize that there was no fun thing in the whole movie. At nothing, intentionally. It is terribly fun that Lizzie cn chews a piece of Nurplex and becomes a gigantic carnivorous demon ... but her lovely little dress is completely intact, even though she is now hundreds of times bigger than she was when she first took it on. Or the kind of movie where a man can be shocked by a defibulator and only fall unconsciously and return to attention without ALL medical help. And let me not get started with the "ridiculous fate of the villains" that they decided to create "conflict". Uh huh. <br /> <br /> For the person complaining about Disney who only tarnishes kids- The raunchy parts of this movie seem to reject this statement. Do we really need Daryl Hannah to accuse Jeff Bridges of having kinky video tapes? You do if you are Disney and you are out of ideas to make the movie appeal to the over 8 audiences without writing a more intelligent script! I'm deeply convinced that Disney pays the credit card, so it's movies that can get away with murder and still get family-friendly reviews. <br /> <br /> What a waste of DVD format.
