I can't believe that people like Guillermo del Toro and Kim Bassinger were involved in this piece of waste! The script is so poorly written and the control so weak (both by the same person) that it is difficult to find more one-dimensional characters in a movie. The dialogues are so boring that this so-called thriller got laughed at by the few fools who entered the theater. The setup is difficult and invites you to believe that you will see a chilling thriller and suddenly it turns out to be the most stupid film of persecution. Bassinger's character is so stupid that she actually stops to scream to God "Where are you!" so the people after her can follow and then take a leak !! And then she apparently came in at least wood in the world, I mean, she runs all the way around, and the killers never slip off her, and it happens in the middle of the night. It makes me really weird, it really is that the best writers in Hollywood can figure out that they are using millions who produce it.
