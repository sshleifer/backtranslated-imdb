I watched this movie for 45 minutes and counted 9 mullets. It's a mullet every 5 minutes. Nevertheless, this movie is living proof that the formula works. If it's not broken, it doesn't need the fixin. A streetwise-yet-vulnerable heroine, a hardened ex-cop martial arts champion with a heart of gold and a serial killer with 'problems'. Pure magic.
