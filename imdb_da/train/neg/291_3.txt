Movie version of Sandra Bernhard's one-woman off-Broadway show is gaspingly pretentious. Sandra spoof's lounge acts and superstars, but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting and fitfully fun. Her fans will say she is scathingly honest and it can be true. But she is also sharp, with an unapologetic, in-your-face bravado that is not suitable for a movie in this genre. She does not want to do well - and she is certainly not out to make friends - and it will always rub many people in the wrong way. But even if you meet her halfway, her material is missing here seriously. The filmmaker Nicolas Roeg served as executive producer and, although he is not directed by him, the film has its cool, detached signature style over it. Bernhard co-wrote the show with director John Boskovich; Their strangest touch was to have all of Sandra's internal audience looked completely out - a feeling of many real viewers would probably share. * 1/2 from ****
