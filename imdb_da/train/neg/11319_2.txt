Vampire cyborgs rule the world and use human blood as fuel, but there will be a change of power thanks to a dismissed android (Kris Kristofferson) and a warrior woman (Kathly Long) as they face Lance Henriksen and Gary Daniels (Who plays cyborgs in this ridiculous movies) Of all the questions that are not answered by this terrible movie, it is most poisonous. Who was the idea of â€‹â€‹throwing country songs Kris Kristofferson as a cyborg warrior who is able to give as good as he gets. No, don't make me wrong I could see Kristofferson as a vigilante or something, but not as a cyborg. It is strange that this is written for Dolph Lundgren, but Lundgren must have had the wisdom not to do so. But despite the catastrophic casting, Kristofferson is easily the most comfortable of the film. He gives a performance far more human than the unimaginable Kathy Long. (And Kristofferson plays a robot) despite miscasting, Kristofferson gives the few moments of interest. Lance Henriksen is dormant and Gary Daniels is wasted, but in principle, Knights baffling failure. You stand in horror and wonder how the hell thought this was a good idea on paper. (This is a movie where a split Kristofferson struggles with robots in a backpack) The worst of all, it ends in what if successor, fortunately it is not yet materialized, although I still have nightmares on the suggestion of the likelihood of such an event . br /> <br /> * out of 4- (bad)
