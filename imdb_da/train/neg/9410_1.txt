As long as you like it! If you like watching people wake up, get up, dress up, take a shower, prepare dinner, see each other, have sex in the dark and then go back to bed to sleep ... if you like tacky apartments, narrow bedrooms and kitchens, long minutes of silence. If you like to be bored for two hours and feel the excitement of "really intimate false art", then you like it. But if you don't, just try to watch a good movie that is thousands. "As long as you are here, but will we stay?" This German film won the Torino gay film festival: Italian journalists still don't understand why the jury made such a bad decision when the festival presented many talented films. Maybe being good at a German, because they don't often get prices? Well, "The Lives of Others" did ... but this one is excellent but not gay. So maybe it's a matter of fashion. Germans are they "in" again? No matter what? Or maybe just for a hustler's look at some directors?
