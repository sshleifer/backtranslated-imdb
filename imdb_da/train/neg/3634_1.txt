Drilling children's imagination that gives Joan Plowright star billing, but little to do. Sappy kids pursue their dreams. Frankie will be a ballerina and a baseball player (yuk) while best friend Hazel runs for mayor --- she is 13! Complete pedestrian in every way, plus the added disadvantage of syrupy performances by girls as well as baseball girls. Certainly a smaller effort for Showtime --- no limits?
