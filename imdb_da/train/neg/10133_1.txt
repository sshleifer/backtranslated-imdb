Unless you are mentally ill or the most lethal swinging fan, you will get tired of this horrible excuse for a movie in under 5 minutes. Plot - Even for a Seagal movie, the plot is just stupid. I mean, it's not just bad, it's hardly coherent. <br /> <br /> The acting - Incredible tree. Literally, better functioning in porn's. Ironically, this film is trying to put on this audience, as a "lesbian love scene", which is completely cringe-worthy. <br /> <br /> Special Effects - wouldn't look out of place in a 60-sword and wizard girl. <br /> <br /> Unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other cures, do not make the same mistake as I did and buy this DVD as you will be asking for one and a half of your life back.
