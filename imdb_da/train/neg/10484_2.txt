Being an Elvis fan, I can't understand how this proyect could be done. Is by far the worst Elvis-related movie of all time, absolutely creepy, silly and many mistakes in The King. Come on, Elvis' tomb in a public park? A mention of suspicious feelings in 1958? ... and these are just two examples. Some people in the cast are trying to do their best, Mike Starr is fun (especially as an imitator), Tom Hanks cameo is a surprise, but the guy who plays the young Elvis sucks. Everywhere the film is lacking in fun and becomes more boring minute by minute. If you want to see an ultra cheap, crazy but absolutely fun little movie related to Elvis, I really recommend you "Bubba Ho-Tep" instead of this mess.
