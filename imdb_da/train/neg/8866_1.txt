In theory, the 'director's comment' should have worked. The talented Rob Bryden plays Peter DeLane, a former television director who tells his experiences behind the camera. Among the programs he allegedly worked on are 'Bonanza', 'Flambards', 'The Duchess of Duke Street' and 'The Bounder'. His comments are not least informative, because of his habit of walking out of the point. <br /> <br /> In practice, however, the disorder failed. It's a one-joke show, and joke isn't very fun. The scripts are completely missing, and Bryden fails to convince as an old man. When he sticks to something entertaining to say, which is like every five seconds, he sends out a crazy laugh. Instead of being amused by DeLane, you will shoot him. If senile old men beat you like fun, then that's for you. It didn't help that the shows that were mocked were pretty good except 'Mr & Mrs' and 'Crossroads'. For joke to work they should be really dreadful like Charlie's Angels, OTT, Telly Addicts, Neighbors and New Faces. time, so fortunately we are spared the horror of future editions. Wouldn't it be deliciously ironic if the 'Director's Comment' was one day even a spoof?
