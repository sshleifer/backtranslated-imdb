I saw it with my boyfriend after stumbling across it while zaping channels. I think we both hoped for some kind of happy family sweet Christmas movie, but were very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Actor plays the soldier, seems to have 0 feelings at all, his face looks the same, whether he chops down the Christmas tree when he sees the girl, he loves to be kissed by his girlfriend or when he is happy Surprised by the girl he loves, he is a horrible actor, and without us any of us laughing at him. <br /> <br /> Then there is the sweet blonde girl, blessed with the ability to count the dot and cheat on her boyfriend, what a catch! and her ambitions in life are to live with her parents and count more dots. So it's basically a story of a guy without feelings or emotions that falls for a guy who counts dots and cheats on his girlfriend, it's as predictable as it gets, and really a waste of time, you get nothing at all to see this, apart from some weird laughter, because it is so cool. I love it when her father says he eats only French fries and not French wine, and they all laugh, this is the hillbilly attitude that this movie is about if my boyfriend's dad also bossed me around like, I would tell him something or for, but not our army veteran, no gentleman, he lets us all bosses over him. <br /> <br /> The movie is what First Blood would have been if John Rambo was burned as the biggest wimp in the world.
