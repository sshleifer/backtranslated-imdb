When good instructors / actor combinations talk about the team, J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson are usually not mentioned. Probably because the end of nine joint ventures between the two of them runs the spectrum from the really good action entertainment to mediocre. Unfortunately, Kinjite falls: Prohibited topics in the latter. <br /> <br /> It's boring because Kinjite could have been much better. But for my life I do not understand why it was necessary to father the missing Japanese girl, a guy used to get some cheap jollies because the romance of his marriage has gone out. It could have been good for another movie altogether, but it didn't serve any purpose here. <br /> <br /> A fair police drama with Charles Bronson as a vicar who has seen too much in his work style and has a strong prejudice against briefings. That part could also have used a little explanation as well. But he will have to overcome it if he and patient partner Perry Lopez are to find a captured Japanese schoolgirl. <br /> <br /> Bronson's time in the vice squad has told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper. A stylish, murderous pimp played by Jaime Fernandez is the guy, and he and Bronson have some history. In fact, in the movie's best scene, Bronson made him eat an expensive Rolex watch and set his car on fire. <br /> <br /> At one point, Fernandez happens to see Bronson and Lopez in an all-night delicacy, and this is after his rolex snack, he sprays the place with a Uzi kills everyone, but Bronson and Lopez. I really think the little incident would have had more than a few vice police from the LAPD after Fernandez. But it's another terribly big hole in the plot. <br /> <br /> There is still a very serious justice at last for Fernandez. I wish the whole movie had been better though. This was the last movie from the Bronson-Thompson team and J. Lee Thompson's last as an instructor. He should have gone out with something better.
