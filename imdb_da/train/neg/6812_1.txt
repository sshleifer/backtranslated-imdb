from the start of this movie, you quickly become aware that the name of the movie has nothing to do with the actual movie from watching a naked woman being chased by people in very stupid masks to servants running around in the worst clothes, I've ever seen and all this in subtitles makes it the kind of movie you should think twice about watching, and when the movie slowly moves along you, you soon realize that the vampire is not a vampire you'll have to wonder where the title comes from some parts of the movie, made a little sense with Pierre and is a father, but since the movie comes to its really stupid end, you must think why join a movie this way and surly they had a better end if It is only there in heads, it is not a movie to see basically
