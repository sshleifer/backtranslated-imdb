I'm sorry, but it could have been scary in 1978 when it came out, but in modern times it just doesn't stop. The only interesting scene in the whole movie is the opening scene where Michael kills his sister Judith wearing his Halloween mask. The most striking moment in the whole movie is when his parents tear off the mask to see that their son killed their daughter. The film goes downhill from there and does not stop for the last fifteen minutes, but then it is too late, we the audience has lost all interest in the story. There is hardly any sign development and people always cry out that Laurie is such an unusual heroine when there really isn't much for her. I'm sorry to disagree with anyone who is afraid of this movie, but if you want a big scary movie, watch The Shining or Rosemary's Baby. These are the two best horror movies ever made. Halloween is certainly not in their ranks. I can't believe Roger Ebert gave it four stars because there is no way that this movie could ever deserve such a high rating.
