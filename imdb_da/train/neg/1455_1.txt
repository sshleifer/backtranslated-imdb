I have rarely been exposed to such a fuzzy nonsense in a movie based on a historical figure. A horrible joke of a movie I cringed all the way through. Terrible, thin, distorted and riddled with direct lies and half truths. <br /> <br /> The famous Hitler cinema Ian Kershaw was originally to be a consultant for this movie. He found, however, that the manuscript was so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused, and also demanded that they stop using his name as a source (it made him believe that people would think he was involved). <br /> <br /> A scene shows Hitler beating his dog. There is not a source for this. Hitler loved animals over humans. He introduced the strictest animal welfare laws in Europe, banned vivisection and animal testing. He was also a vegetarian. <br /> <br /> The movie turns its winner of the iron cross into a farce involving bribes. Except lies. He was awarded it for repeated acts of valor over a long period of time. <br /> <br /> There are no historical documents showing that Hitler has ever had a sexual relationship with his niece. Not one. <br /> <br /> Apart from these, Hitler is portrayed as a refined simpleton in this garbage game. <br /> <br /> If he himself was half as ignorant, demented, and thick as he is in this nonsense movie as in real life, you wouldn't even know he'd ever existed. Never mind German leader. In fact, this movie was horrible. <br /> <br /> Go see the Downfall and give it a very wide berth.
