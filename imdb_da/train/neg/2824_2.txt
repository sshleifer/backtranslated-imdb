I'm a big Porsche fan and the car was the best star in this movie. <br /> <br /> Haim, the now-dried drug-abusive child star of the 80s is bland as usual and commenting on the back from smaller figures / actors would be meaningless; Needless to say they were all very average. It's a cool movie like a walk down the memory channel in the 80s - with some weird clothes, some good pictures of the Colorado scenes and a very harmless yet meager plot. All in all, please don't waste your time watching this unless you love 80s movies, Corey Haim, or like myself, love old school Porsches (this looks especially good) because life is too short for watching crappy movies.
