This movie was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> I take the opposite picture of the critics. This is not the case if the material is not up to the level of the actors; Here, the actors (Bette Davis and James Cagney) are simply not up to the level of the material. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were as big as Davis and Cagney, and seeing how it happened, one night turned out - a full-time classic. With a very similar story, Davis proves she has no talent for comedies (it's good for her that this is only about the only comedy she's ever tried!) Davis' one-tone performance oozes beauty, but none of the nuances of Colbert's plays in that one night. Cagney, who was a great comedy actor, just seems out of sync with his costar, Davis. The script gives some decent lines and gags, but the delivery seems better suited to drama than comedy. <br /> <br /> Part of the problem is the soundtrack, which, like the delivery of Davis and Cagney, seems more suited to a light drama than a comedy. Jack Carson, who played similar roles throughout his career, has more capable handled very similar material. In a rather typical supporting role, Eugene Palette delivers a respectable performance. In a slightly different role as an old western relic, Harry Davenport, it is very good. But in one of his poorest performances, William Frawley is rather annoying. His character's constant references to fictitious police are a bad effort for irony. <br /> <br /> I really love all these performing artists and it is a shame that as an ensemble they do not achieve more chemistry and no better result than The Bride Came C.O.D.
