I missed this movie in the cinema, but had an idea behind it that it was worth seeing, so when I saw it on the shelves in DVD I thought "time to watch it". Big mistake! <br /> <br /> A long list of stars can't save this turkey, probably one of the worst movies ever. An incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and poorly presented. Perhaps it would have been more sensible if I wanted to read Robbin's novel, but unless the film is quite different from the novel, and with Robbins assistant in the manuscript, I doubt that the short story should be a scary reading. I hope the actors were well paid as they were embarrassed to be in this waste of celluloid and early DVDs, for example, Pat Morita. Even Thurman has the grace to look uncomfortable at times. Save yourself about 98 minutes of your life to something more worthwhile, such as trimming your toenails or sorting your sock drawer. Even when you see it in the "under $ 5" throw-away bin in your local store, resist the urge!
