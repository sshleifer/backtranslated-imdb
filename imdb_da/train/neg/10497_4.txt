So, Steve Irwin. You have to admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself in a river that is clearly filled with crocs, snakes, lizards, tons of the above-mentioned reptiles and mud, not just daily but enthusiastically. He was never able to make me do that, but he managed to get his wife close. <br /> <br /> This movie does not fall into my parallel universe of movie category - the movies of people who just had their teeth drilled, have migraines, or have no movie experience and therefore quiet mediocrity (currently well populated by Disney movie). It's too noisy. Well, Steve is too noisy. He's just so happy all the time, and would cut right through blas√© teenager (I can hear it now: "That movie was so STUPID") or Tylenol with codeine. I want to say that his enthusiasm is about to catch, but if it was, I would own a room full of snakes and that hasn't happened yet. I agreed that they are beauties, but I still don't want to pet them. <br /> <br /> Plot was actually predictable. Bad guys were so bad in an instant I thought I was shopping at a consumer electronics supermarket. But the movie was full of animals, and Steve and Terri why I saw it. The plot (if you could call it that) was really a reason to throw another hook into a truck. My expectations were low and stayed that way. <br /> <br /> I hoped, however, that there would be a bit of a sequel, where Steve and Terri (working on their plays) have a movie with a real plot and several fur animals. I still can't believe we won't see Steve anymore. I hope Terri and the kids will continue to be involved in the Australia Zoo and Discovery Channel. I can't imagine seeing a crocodile without having a member of the Irwin family who tells me how wonderful that hook is. Crikey!
