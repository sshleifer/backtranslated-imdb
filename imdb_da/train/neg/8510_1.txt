When we were in high school, some of us boys occasionally stiffened stink bombs. It was considered fun then. But the producers, directors and cast "Semana Santa" ("Death of Angel" in the DVD section of your local video rental) are adults and they still put them. <br /> <br /> As the previous reviewer wondered if the cast was eager to get out of home and home, I doubt more than one roof was made for any of the scenes. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino, hot in "Mighty Aphrodite" and other top-rated movies, seems to have undergone himself for this project. Her plays are non-existent, but are mainly confined to clever star stars, who must indicate how "sensitive" she is to the various victims of the film. <br /> <br /> But let me warn you - don't be the next victim! Go away from the DVD if you find it on the shelf. Tbere is not many good shots of Mira (the only highlights I could find in the movie), and the support casting is of inferior quality, giving a mishmash of poor dialogue with embarrassing "Spanish" accents worth for the best high school theatrical production.
