I'm not a regular viewer of Springer's, but I see his show glimpse and I think the show is a fine guilty pleasure and a good way to kill sometime. So of course I want to see this movie expecting to see "Jerry Springer Uncensored." First of all, Jerry appears for about twenty minutes of the movie's running time. The second hour and twenty minutes are used to build this pseudo-farce about trailer trash, jealousy, incest and deception. Jaime Pressley (who looks hot like HELLLL) is a trailer-trash ending that sleeps with his father-in-law (a very unusual-looking chain-smoker, drunken Michael Dudikoff, who finally strays from his action hero persona). The mother finds out the affair, they come into a fight, they will take it to the "Jerry" show (that's right, no jumping). And then we have a parallel story with an African-American couple. They take it to the "Jerry" show. The signs collide. Blah, blah, freakin 'blah! The trash has rarely been this DRILL !!!! I wondered why Hell Springer has millions of fans, but none of them checked his movie. Well, now it's completely obvious !! Whether you love him or hate him, you will hate this movie! How can I explain? It's a total mess on a movie picture (if that's what you call it). It is so poorly edited, with scenes that just don't connect, and after a while the plot almost disappears and it's simply over the map! Imagine a predictable soap opera transformed into a comic farce. With rarely laughs. <br /> <br /> My only positive note is a hot girl-girl scene. It's as risque as it gets. Don't make me wrong, the scene is pretty risky, but if you look at the overall movie comparing it to the material on Springer's program - this catastrophic farce seems extremely clean. My score: 3 (out of 10)
