Many people would like to point to this television movie when they argue with the big legions of Hanks-philes out there that Tom actually made crazy films (I think the "Bachelor Party" was great, but that's another story). The film focuses on a "Dungeons and Dragons-style game" that eventually drives our young gump to hallucinatory madness. The story is charming early in the 1980s, focusing as it does on the imminent threat to our youth, made up of the evil role-playing games. <br /> <br /> However, I prefer to see "Mazes and Monsters" as turning point to "what happened to Chris Makepeace?" history. we can all remember him as "Rudy the Rabbit" in "Meatballs" and like the relentless Clifford in "My Bodyguard" where he gave us all a vicarious excitement by knocking out the shed out of Matt Dillon. Few can argue (especially those of us who read "Dynamite!" On a regular basis) that there were great things to him. <br /> <br /> Then came Rona Jaffe. The line between bad acting and bad writing is razor thin, so I leave it to you to decide if the failure of Makepeace's performance in this is. I only know that the last major release I saw him was "Vamp" and it was 1986. He had a small role as Sean Penn's brother in "Falcon and the Snowman", but then the Brat Pack fax had become passed to others with straight hair and flashing resumes. <br /> <br /> I cannot recommend this movie in good conscience. See it if you only want to see a younger, more idealistic Chris Makepeace before Rona Jaffe feasted on his soul.
