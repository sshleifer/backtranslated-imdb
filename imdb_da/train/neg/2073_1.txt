Oh God. Oh my god, I can't get over this movie. It was godly. terrible, terrible! Don't even waste your money to buy it in 99 cents bin. No, avoid it at all costs, I warn you !!! <br /> <br /> It was the worst movie I've ever seen. In my life. In my life !! <br /> <br /> First of all, G-girl? Are you kidding me. Get real that sounds like some new Barbie doll .. Super Women? Are you kidding me. It was so fake false false fake. The city's people didn't even like to say that there was a flying blonde just zooming around the city, saving a fire. Ohh, great! <br /> <br /> Jesus, was it just me or did the movie seem offensive ?? I guess what you need to be a superhero, is a pair of double d'er, blonde floating hair, no glasses and a leather skin color?! <br /> <br /> If it was trying to be romantic ... than ... God, I don't know. It was terrible if love means taking one for an art exhibition and having sex in a bed and in the air. Than they had absolutely love! <br /> <br /> It was pathetic, everything went too fast. First, the guy was single than he was dating G-girl .. than they broke up than he dated the Hannah girl .. and ... it just goes on. <br /> <br /> I must say that this movie made me wonder .. How the hell did they get it in theaters ?? !! <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs.
