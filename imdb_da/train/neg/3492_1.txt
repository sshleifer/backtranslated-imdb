I don't buy kung fu movies for a plot. I buy them for battle scenes. A bad plot can be forgiven for excellent battle scenes, but not vice versa. The story was decent, but moved too slowly to my liking. There were about 3 or 4 mediocre combat scenes all the time that lasted only a few minutes. The last match was a little longer, but at that time I was so sad that I wasn't even aware of it.
