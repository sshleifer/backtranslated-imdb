Fans of creature feature films have to endure many horrible movies lately. Blood Surf shamelessly ends up on the list of stupid, superfluous pulp horror titles on ridiculously large animals wishing to turn their food chain upside down. Crocodiles are extremely successful as we already had to fight our way through the immense 'Crocodile' (directed by a disappointing Tobe Hooper) and 'Lake Placid'. Blood Surf is just as bad as these other movies and ?? even ?? It likes to exaggerate enormously. The saltwater crocodile is supposedly 90 years old, over 30 ft long (!) And it kills for fun! During the film, he is delighted to devour a bunch of completely stupid surfer-dudes & dudettes who came to seek new excitement by surfing in a shark-laden area. The only beautiful aspect of this movie is its tropical location. Although it is a completely inappropriate framework for a movie like this, lagoons and nature look great. Every other aspect is simply disastrous. There are quite a few things, but it all looks false and ridiculous. The dialogues are quite painful to listen to! You won't believe in any of the lines these actors have to say! I know surfers must be a mentally underdeveloped group, but I hope for their own sake that they are not so stupid! Early in the film one of the characters refers to Jaws as being a 'mechanical toy', but the croc looks at least ten times less real than Spielberg's large white shark. The visual effects in 'Blood Surf' are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress. I don't want to say too much about the play, as it is secondary to flicks like this. The girls look sexy in wet shirts and their breasts are pleasantly happy as they run away from the animal. You guessed right: Blood Surf is a very bad movie. So bad it will be fun again. But 'fun' for a completely different reason than James Hickox intended.
