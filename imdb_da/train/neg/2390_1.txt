I absolutely love all of Tom Robbin's books, so I was very excited and interested in watching a movie made after one of his books. I knew there wouldn't be any way the movie would capture half of Robbins' magic, but after watching the movie, I never wanted to read the book again. The movie Even Cowgirls Get Blues does not include an eighth of the contents of the book, and it seems to focus more on the love relationship between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. Along with the incredibly weak plot line in the movie, I think that better actors could certainly have been chosen to play the characters. The only actors in the movie that I thought played their roles fit into Robbins' descriptions in the book, Julian's friends, in their five-minute clip at the beginning of the movie. Those who haven't read the book can enjoy the movie, but as a huge Tom Robbins fan, this movie was just a disappointment.
