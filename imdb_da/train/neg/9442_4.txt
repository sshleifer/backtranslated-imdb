I tried to like this slasher as I try to enjoy all the slasher movies. I mean mindless slaying mixed with a little nudity and a little excitement, how can you go wrong. But Unhinged, I think an example of that formula goes wrong. The main problem is the horrible act of the three largest girls who landed in the house. It was as if they were under sedation and it prevented me from becoming interested in their situation. The movie is aimed at excitement and creepy, but by the numbering it gets them and leaves the film rather boring. It's a shame because if the movie was better executed, it would have been ace. The story and characters are pretty scary, and there are some dark and bizarre humorous moments of interaction between the mother, the girls and the daughter of the old house. There is some good nudity, and occasionally splashing blood, just not enough to give the movie the kick it needs. The final is pretty twisted and horrible, and gives the film a big boost, but unfortunately it is too late. So, in my opinion, this is one to avoid unless you really love blurry slasher movies. There is a great deal of potential, but the film delivers too little to be worthwhile.
