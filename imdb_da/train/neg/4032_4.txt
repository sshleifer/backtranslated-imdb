I had never heard of this before it came on Cable TV. It's very typical for the late 50s sci-fi: sober, depressing and not a bit paranoid! In spite of the equally typical involvement of a romantic couple, the film is largely transcribed in a documentary style - which is perhaps a cheap way to leave much of the exhibition for narration and an excuse to put as much stock footage as it is possible for man for what is unmistakably an extremely low budget venture! Although not uninteresting in itself (the apocalypse via renegade missile angle, which was later used, with much larger aplomb, for both DR. STRANGELOVE [1964] and FAIL SAFE [1964]) and mercifully, the film's one-sided approach to his subject results in a lot of unintentional laughter - especially in the scenes that imply an impending birth and a gang of clear youth offenders!
