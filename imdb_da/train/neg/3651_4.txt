I was expecting a very funny movie. Instead, I got a movie with a few funny jokes, and many that just didn't work. I didn't like the idea of ​​bringing in the descendants of Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty. It was confusing. It would have been more fun if they just had someone new, instead of Moriarty resurrected. Some of the things were fun. Burt Kwouk was very funny, as always. McCloud on the horse was fun. McGarrett from Hawaii 5-0 was not even McGarrett-like. Connie Booth is of course very good with accents. She's from Indiana, but played English and a New Yorker pretty well. Unfortunately, she was not presented much in the script. I was expecting a more fun movie. Instead, I got a pretty confusing movie with a bad script. Rather ironically, when both Booth and Cleese were together on this one. Maybe they were breaking up in 77.
