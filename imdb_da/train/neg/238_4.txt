A Cinderella story made for adults living in dreamland. The romance is very unrealistic, fluttery, lovey dovey, perfect, etc. The Cinderella plot for the end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my stars. If you're looking for a dreamy romance with a twist, it's definitely you are movie, but for the rest of us real world people, I highly recommend saving your three hour time. Wake up people! <br /> <br /> Four of the five people who watched the movie with me would not recommend the movie. We had a good time bashing majority of the unrealistic scenes. Maybe I'm missing something .. I just can't believe a movie like this can beat a classic like HDDCS !!
