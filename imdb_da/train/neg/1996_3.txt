This sad little movie has little resemblance to the 1971 Broadway revival, which was such a "nostalgic" hit. Keep in mind that when Burt Shevelove corrected this revival, he rewrote the book to a large extent. I have the feeling that this scriptwriter has also made so much of a change from the original 1925 version. I played the innocent filar Jimmy Smith on the stage in 1974 and thought this $ 1 DVD would bring back memories. Not a chance. Even the anticipated pleasure of seeing "Tops" Roland Young playing 'my' part was a big disappointment. Three songs from the play remain, and are made very bad. Even the classic duet, "Tea For Two", is made as a virtual solo. The many well-known faces in this 1940's failure do not pride themselves at all, and the star, Anna Neagle, embarrasses herself. When I feel gypped by spending a dollar, I know the movie should be bad. Another commentator mentioned the Doris Day version, which is actually called "Tea For Two" and is about making the scene play (the original of course) so that those seeking the true "No No Nanette" can find a more recognizable version there.
