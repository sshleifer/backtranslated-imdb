As you may or may not have heard, there are no actual battles between vampires or zombies in this movie. You might then ask why the title suggested such a thing, but it is really good because nothing else about this movie also has any meaning. There was absolutely no story or plot, just things that happened. The action was incredibly poor, worse than safeauto commercials bad. <br /> <br /> Not only was there no fight between vampires and zombies, but I think there was only one scene of zombies in it. Their makeup looked like it was being used by an 8 year old girl. The scene was completely random and out of place and highlighted one of the characters that knocked off the zombies with a stern trimmer (I do not chew) but they used chain sound effects. <br /> <br /> This was undoubtedly the poorest movie I've ever seen in my life. The only fact that I would not completely ridicule any person responsible for the production of this movie is if I learned that it was produced entirely by 11-year-olds. <br /> <br /> But even with all the criticism I offer here, I would suggest seeing this movie based solely on the fact that it may well be the worst movie ever and because of this is quite comical. Even with counting the errors in it, you should keep yourself entertained.
