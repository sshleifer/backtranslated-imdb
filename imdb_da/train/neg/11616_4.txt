I didn't like the movie, Joshua. Maybe it's because I saw another, much better-like movie titled Orphan 2 days earlier, but maybe it's just because this movie wasn't very good. I go with the ladder. Certainly, an evil child's plot isn't exactly original, but that doesn't mean the movie couldn't succeed. It could have been exciting and entertaining and chilling, but instead it was slowly built up, boring and unintentional and left me no more thinking than "it wasn't so good" when it was completely over. <br /> <br /> In the end, Joshua's motivations are revealed. I don't want to give it away, but the reality is that he didn't really meet his goals since, despite Vera Farmiga as his mother, Abby, disappears about 3/4 through the movie, all arrows point to her home again soon. She was committed to a mental institution because she lost her mind, but then Joshua's father / her husband was accused of manipulating her medicine, telling the public that the institution realized she was not actually mentally ill, but rather dosed medical. Then she won't come home soon? Wouldn't Joshua have failed? Will his mother not live with him and his sister and possibly his father soon? I question the Father, as his future is open. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day I don't care about the characters. The evil demon child Joshua was not really scary. The story slowly moved, and when it went up, it was still boring. Suspension fell flat every single time. When it was over, I couldn't believe I'd put it all through. <br /> <br /> 4/10 just because the play was good from the parents, especially Vera Farmiga as a mother, but if you want to watch a movie about an evil child, see Orphan. Now it's a movie that took an unoriginal concept and created a brilliant movie.
