So don't even think about renting it from the shops, because it's a hell of a bad movie. You think JJ Abrahams had written this movie. Basically, a rat is washed down the toilet and somehow needs to come back. Fans of the horrible "Shrek" like, but "Wallace & Gromit" fans will probably turn away in disgust. Also, why didn't they do it in plastic or clay? I mean, CGI animation ?? For an AARDMAN movie ?? !! Of course, Aardman does while they let Dreamworks do it all. Wrong, wrong, wrong !!! Almost every character is horrible, except for the freaky frog guy who is just right for a movie villain. But everything else about the movie is DULL, DULL, DULL !!! I almost fell asleep with boredom watching this movie. No, wait, actually, I fell asleep with boredom that saw this movie. It's just awful. But fortunately, it's not as bad as "Shrek."
