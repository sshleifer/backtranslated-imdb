Animal Farm (1954) was a very good read about the dangers of totalitarianism. How good ideals can be changed and distorted by those who are ignorant or steer with an iron fist and an empty head. Unfortunately, this movie does not show any of these. What we show is a propaganda piece with a lot of finger waves and points. The animation and direction were good considering the budget and time period, but the essence of George Orwell's novel is lacking. <br /> <br /> If you are one of those who want to see how to customize a novel or are just interested in seeing an adaptation of this brilliant novel, then by all means watch. I just found this to be something mediocre. Just one man's opinion though. <br /> <br /> Remake is a notch below but not too much.
