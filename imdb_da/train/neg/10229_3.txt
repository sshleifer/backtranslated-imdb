I base this on my observations of an episode I saw last night (9/27/06). I don't think I want to see again. The plot was completely wood, plotted quite predictably, the end completely unrealistic - I mean who would believe in a $ 30 million judgment for the death of a reusing drug addict with terminal cancer? The main actor (Victor Garber) seemed so uncomfortable, almost embarrassed by his role - perhaps he understood how bad the writing was !! I am well aware that the drama offered this season is rather poor, but they can probably find better writers. Maybe they outsource the writing to India or China !! I bet we won't see this next season!
