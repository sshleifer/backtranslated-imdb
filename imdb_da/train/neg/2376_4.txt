George Brent is a reporter sent to interview an heir. She is apparently heir to a face cream. He interviews her on her yacht. They fall into each other in a swimsuit. <br /> <br /> It turns out (quite early) that she is not an heir. She is part of an advertising campaign for the cold cream. <br /> <br /> The movie follows up and down in their romance. <br /> <br /> The support molding does a little to bend it up. Davis and Brent carry the picture. Although it is quite predictable, it is also quite entertaining. It's far from her best. But especially in view of its obscurity in her oeuvre, it is not one of her worst either.
