Dum is so stupid, in this thoroughly uninteresting, supposedly black comedy. Essentially, what begins as Chris Klein tries to maintain a low profile, eventually morphs into an uninspired version of "The Three Amigos", just without laughs. For black comedy to work, it must be outrageous, which "Play Dead" is not. For black comedy to work, it may not be medieval, which "Play Dead" is. What "Play Dead" really is is a city full of emergency jobs. However, Fred Dunst makes a fairly fair imitation of Billy Bob Thornton's character from "A Simple Plan," while Jake Busey makes a fairly fair imitation of Jake Busey. - NOTE
