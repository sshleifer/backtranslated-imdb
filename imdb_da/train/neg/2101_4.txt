Bernard Rapp died last year and was a highly-grown journalist. Cinema was one of his greatest passions (he wrote a great worldwide film book) and then he was bound to run a camera at least once in his life. But the films he left received lukewarm reviews: "Tiré à Part" (1996) despite Terence Stamps' sensational performance was highly caricatured in the depiction of the characters "Une Affaire De Goût" (2000) was a beautiful affair, though Bernard Giraudeau delivered a perverted performance, "Pas Si Grave" (2003) was another downfall and "un Petit Jeu Sans Conséquence" is just as sublime as its predecessors. Its cartoon potential is exploited in a clever way. <br /> <br /> But the notion of concept predicts a twirling, spiritual comedy. A couple held by Yvan Attal and Sandrine Kiberlain, who invited their friends, move fully into a huge mansion. To play with their guests, they pretend to share business with each other. And things don't go as planned, because the message of their separation does not surprise them. The two lovers begin to consider their couple's validity. <br /> <br /> In spite of the lush landscape and promising material he had available, Rapp's undisputed expense cannot survive this game with unexpected consequences. The plot follows a well-worn pattern of characters that have specific known features and masks that are revealed about who they really are. Verbal or situation comic effects often fall flat. A bad edit falls a little more the movie with this bad habit of Rapp to cut many rows to pieces. Even the players' sincere input into venture is debate. They seem to be bored and to recite their lyrics than to live them, especially Sandrine Kiberlain. The audience is soon caught in a deep village. It is regrettable to say: Bernard Rapp's films never lived up to his intentions as "un Petit Jeu sans Conséquence" witness.
