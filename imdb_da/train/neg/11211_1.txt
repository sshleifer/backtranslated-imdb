There is so much going wrong with this movie, but to sum it up: Terrible act - so bad, it must have been intentional. bad script - they may have had some good ideas, but it was not the best way to present the story. ridiculously bad ending - in some cases the end of saving the movie - not in this case. If you manage to pass through the entire movie, you will want to kick yourself at the end, because the end is not even worth waiting for. This is the worst movie I've seen for a long time. It was complete torture that sat through this movie, I would have appreciated any warning in advance. So do yourself a favor. Just watch this movie if you absolutely have nothing better to do. Even then you will regret having put yourself through the invisible torture.
