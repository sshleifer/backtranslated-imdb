Nell Shipman tried a plot to lead up to a chase final in 'Back to the Land of God' in the previous year, and she failed unhappily. This time she does it better, even though it seems meaningless. "Something new" hardly has a plot outside the hunt. There is a short premise that creates the hero (co-author and Shipman's boyfriend) in order to save the girl (played by Shipman), then it is nothing more than an exciting, inappropriate hunt from there. Of course, it plays like an hour-long advertisement for a Maxwell Sedan, but the whole movie is conspicuously ridiculous. It doesn't seem like she learned much from last-minute rescue films by D.W. Griffith or its parodies of Mack Sennett and other comedians she imitates. <br /> <br /> One of the sights is that Shipman writes and joins the film as the author of the film's story, which has a lead writer (Shipman again), although she doesn't do much else or humor with it, even if she tries to. Again, other pioneers had the author's joke in the inter-titles, such as Anita Loos with 'Wild and Woolly' or Frances Marion with 'A Girl's Folly' (both 1917). At least Shipman gives the impression that she doesn't take herself or the film seriously - nor do I. "Something new," despite its claim is hackneyed.
