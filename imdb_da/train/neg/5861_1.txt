I saw this movie when it first came out in 1978 when I was a civilian in high school. I took a date to see it. I didn't "get anything", needless to say, because the movie was so bad! Joan Rivers' career thought never as bad as it deserved after making this horrible, eerie boy. In fact, unfunny is not a serious enough period: this movie is ANTI-FUNNY! You go out to feel like any laughter that may have taken place was knocked out of you before it could happen. This is not worth looking out for curiosity, or without being so bad - it's good. "Not even the gang of MST3K could have made this worth seeing! That Billy Crystal's career survived this early suicide attempt is a miracle.
