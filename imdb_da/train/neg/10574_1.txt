With the exception of FAMILY, this new season is worse than Season One. I can't imagine what they are thinking. As a fan of horror one can tolerate a lot of fun and thoughtless chaos, but this series gets worse with every turn. I can't imagine how scary it should be for the actors and crew to go to work every day, so it's fun to churn out such a crap. HISTORY! Is it too much to ask for? GRADE! How can we make fucking fate over any person's fate in these stories? If we are not engaged, who cares about being cut up or what? Almost every episode ends with thoughtless bloodshed, goes too rough without any revelation or conclusion or the reason we've been exposed to an hour of blood ring. Even Dante's efforts in the season had some disruptive sexist violence and made a meaningless conclusion. Ironically, the production values ​​and beliefs tend to be up to speed while the content is completely crap. I have great hopes for the Exec Manufacturer's Garris VALARIE UNDER THE BIG, but we should see.
