Yet another British romantic comedy that audiences all over the world seem to have a ravenous appetite for. This weak action is an unintentional parody of the genre - all the classic clich√© scenes are here from ridiculously deepened misconceptions to running after the departure of trains to declare their love. The characters are one-dimensional caricatures that save for Love-Hewitt, which manages to bring some cohesion into the movie. Things threaten to spiral out of control in the plausibility department as the film progresses; Our good-natured suspension of faith eventually comes down during the terrible end. If you're looking for a Bridget Jones, Notting Hill kind of experience, you won't find it here.
