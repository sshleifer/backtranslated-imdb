This was a disappointing movie for me. It came to me via a boxed set titled "Classic Film Noir", which was a gift from someone who knows that I typically enjoy movies made in that style (I insist that noir is a style, not a genre) . I don't think it's a noir movie at all. There seems to be a trend these days to notice and market each black and white B film made from 1947 to 1955 as noir, and the label does not always fit. There is a persecuted male protagonist, Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb), and most of the film's action takes place indoors. It's just about the only noir elements I could see. There is no sweeping paranoia, or any real reason why one should sympathize with Ed Cullen. Jane Wyatt was overblown and convincing as a femme fatale. I do not want to destroy this movie for potential viewers. But I would be interested to hear what other well-known film-makers have to say about it.
