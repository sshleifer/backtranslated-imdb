Yes, people are racist. People are even racist in college. This is a good point and the problem of racism has been dealt with many times before in countless films. What sets Higher Learning apart from the package is that it deals with the issue of racism in the most ham-fisted and predictable way, possibly, indeed, it is also in college. <br /> <br /> This movie deals with this problem of racism, which Frankenstein deals with most problems, bases it on your head repeatedly in a brutal and sluggish manner. Most characters are cartoon-like, one-dimensional caricatures (lesbian feminist, angry black man) that respond to situations as dramatically and predictably as possible. Instead of challenging stereotypes, this movie is overcrowded with them. The angry black men feel cheated, feminists hate men, etc. (A feminist even has a sign that says "Dead men must not rape." See what I mean?) I will not give anything away but in this movie if Someone seems like a shifty loner or a date rapist, they will probably behave exactly how you expect them. The changes that the characters go through seem obvious to everyone, but the people in the movie. The great twist in the plot is linked to whether the violent neo-Nazis will act as violent neo-Nazis. I guess you just have to look to find out what's going on. <br /> <br /> Another problem I have with this movie is that it should be "gritty" and "hard-hitting", but they make Nazis evil. I agree Nazis are evil, but that's my point. Everyone thinks Nazis are bad; we do not break any new ground here. Nazis have been portrayed as villains since the 1930s. The movie does not challenge any views or make bold statements. It is only about problems that we all know about in a clumsy, after-school special way. Being anti-rape, anti-racist and anti-Nazi is not exactly taking a tough stance on a controversial problem. <br /> <br /> Higher learning is predictable, cartoon-like and in a word stupid. Avoid at all costs.
