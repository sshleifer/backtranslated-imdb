Yuck. I thought it was odd that their old book on curses was made using a common script font instead of hand written. The play is sometimes so apathetic, and so over-dramatic at other times. Why would a "demonico" kill the two suspiciously doctors who helped him immortalize? Just for the heel of it? And is it really necessary to show Lilith's motorcycle when she is out somewhere. We'll get it! You've spent a little bit of money to rent some triple crotch rocket. It doesn't mean you have to show it all the time! The "lair of faith" resembles an old school Battlestar Galactica with some last-minute changes. There is a scene where we are introduced to a few people at a talk show for approx. 30 seconds before they are killed without apparent reason and without significance. Everyone is a smooth sign. Forgettable characters and an even more forgettable plot make this one of the most unimaginable movies I've seen the SciFi channel come out with. Stay away unless you are in bad movies.
