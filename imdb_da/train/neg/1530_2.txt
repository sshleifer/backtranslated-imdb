I wished I had wallpaper Men in WHITE so I could see it again <br /> <br /> "What do you mean, you really enjoyed it Theo?" No, I mean, I could see it again to see if it was as retarded, stupid and as embarrassingly unfunny as I can remember it <br /> <br /> Many people have claimed it was made for children. May I suggest it also made by children? because the script's entire structure lacks any discipline from the producers and the authors, and much of the paragraphs seems to have been included because it seemed like a good idea at that time. does not help but I really started to get sad. Honestly, you can believe that during the movie the cast to lie to their families, they filmed a hard core film, so their embarrassment was to appear in something as gloomy as this. To give you an idea of ​​how bad the play is, every time BAYWATCH babe Donna D'Ericco disappeared from the story, I waited patiently for her to come again so seconds later I forgot that she was in the movie. Understood ? A star from BAYWATCH appears and seconds later they forget they are in the movie. This tells you everything you need to know about the standard for MEN IN WHITE <br /> Just enough, it tries to be a live action cartoon similar to DE GOODIES (although DISMALS would be a better adjective for this movie), although the movie deserves some credit for never falling down to toilet humor, but considering this is a kids movie (this did not stop ITV broadcasting it at 11am), so there should be no one near Knuckle humor in it anyway
