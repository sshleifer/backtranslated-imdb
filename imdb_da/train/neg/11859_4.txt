Well, if you are planning to sit through this amateur, gentle and pokey flick about a middle-aged widowed mother who has a little more in common with her young adult or old teenage daughter than she would like. Set in Tunis, mother piano around the apartment, gets assaulted and decides, though reluctantly (she just can't help herself), to take the cost and dance in a local cabaret. Meanwhile, she takes daughter dance lessons. The common denominator is a Tunisian band drummer. This movie is so full of filler, I watched the DVD on x2 and read the subtitles, fast forward through much of the very common dances and loooong pictures of the walk (they go everywhere) and more hikes and just slap on x4 just to come Through this dull, uneven, low budget flick, as some have got some pretty good critical reasons. Go figure. (C)
