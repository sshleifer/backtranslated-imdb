May (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) pay a seemingly rare visit to their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London. Even when the visit begins, Toots suffers a deadly heart attack that leaves May to drive, be uncertain and question her life and future. She finds herself attracted to her daughter's boyfriend Darren (Daniel Craig). Her actions lead to inevitable consequences. <br /> <br /> Beautifully filmed, but for all his hired realism and recognition, the mother offers a collection of mostly unpleasant rejection signs, and asks the seer to engage with them. Reid shines in May, and it's her skill and dedication as a wonderful discreet actor who rescues the movie from a completely depressing mire, but Michell and Kureishi have allowed Craig, Mackintosh and Cathryn Bradshaw to create such utterly unpleasant signs that it becomes more and more difficult to worry about what happens in May. As written, the characters played by Mackintosh and Bradshaw are actually so completely selfish and cold that one begins to wonder what Kureishi was just trying to say. As stated, they are either unwilling or unable to lift Bobby and Paula over the two-dimensional in their terrible selfishness. <br /> <br /> Worth looking for Reid's performance, but slightly different. A crying shame ...
