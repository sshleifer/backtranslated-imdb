The original book of this was set in the 1950s, but it won't do for the TV series because most people look in the 1930s style. Ironically, the tube train at the end was a 1950s train painted to resemble a 1930 train, so underground can also play on that game. Hanging the story on a Jarrow March plot was weak, but the 50-inch version had students who started thinking about the world around them, so I suppose to make them think about the poverty of the marches, is much the same. All the things that Japp had to take into account for himself were weak, but they had to put something in to fill the time. This would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. It is obvious that this episode is the victim of style over content.
