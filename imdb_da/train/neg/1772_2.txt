"Sleepwalkers" is the first movie to which Stephen King has written a script. Given this and the excellent Santo & Johnny song that they used as the theme of the movie, you would expect a strange and ultimately fulfilling viewing experience. Unfortunately, this is not what you would get. The thing is, they might have made it a good movie. The beginning is exciting with the small urban atmosphere. But something strange happens about 20 minutes in the movie. The movie becomes fun without any obvious reason! From that moment, the whole atmosphere of "Sleepwalkers" is destroyed. For those of you who have seen it who can ever forget good old Johnny screams out "COP KABOB !!" after you soften the pencil into one policeman's ear?! But don't despair, humor has no redeemiing quality. I just rented it again to see if the maby I had wrong the first time, given how original the plot sounded, but I was right. Man what wasted. I can't believe they got the rights to the Santo & Johnny song. I gave this a 2.
