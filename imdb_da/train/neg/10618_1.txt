The film is seriously horrible and fights rape victims. On the surface it can be a daring movie about rape, but if you dig under the surface, which lies a not-so-positive message of rape. Aishwarya rape victim turns out to be a helpless victim who cannot cope with all because she is a woman. She needs a man to help her. When society makes jibes about her and throws comments on her, she doesn't stand up for herself. It's all left to Anil Kapoor to do all the talking, while Aishwarya does all the crying. The director (Satish Kaushik) went down the wrong path by portraying a rape victim as weak and submissive. What would have been more effective is to portray a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a brave way. The director is famous for being chauvinistic. His films are usually full of weak women, but he tries to hide them in controversial roles. He must learn that just because the role is controversial does not mean that the character itself is strong. <br /> <br /> The most degrading scene in the movie is when Aishwarya 'cleans' herself after being raped. She does it to please her father who thinks she is now dirty. Although it is legitimate for Shah to show the stigma of rape victims in such a bright light, that is what he does not show us about if his father was wrong to do his daughter like that. Thus, we are left with a confusing message of rape. <br /> <br /> The comedy is not necessary in a strong professional file like this. Even more, the comedy is simply not fun. Ash is wood in her role, while Anil Kapoor does nothing but shout. The music is mediocre except for the title track, which is beautifully pictured (the only bright spot in this movie). Sonali Bendre's role is disappointing and meaningless. Overall, it might have been a great movie to remember ending up being a horrible mish-mash that will cause some viewers severe indigestion.
