This movie makes more mistakes. a few US players in Spain, and the Spanish actors speak English. 'Spaniards' English is ok, but the way the play is performed makes it all quite annoying. the dialogue throughout the script is very weak; It may have been a Spanish script but incorrectly translated who knows and who cares. I can only assume that these are famous Spanish players who are forced into English, they can be good but not in this flop. You will find out the movie within the first 5 minutes, it's so pathetic it is. so the rest is just bad. lots of waste of time, lots of UN needed plots. Oh I mention one of Baldwin's in this.
