Ariauna Albright is a really good actress, but why she participated in this lame writing travesty is a mystery. What could have been entertaining wins up as classic boredom. The unique thing about Ariauna is that she can shop as well as look really sexy as opposed to her partner Lilith Stabs, who looks nice, but it is obvious that she has spent the money shopping school in a spa or a beautician. This was a production that cried out for some T&A & with an imaginative scriptwriter could have achieved it in the flow of things. But Ariauna does what she can in the circumstances and to some extent saves her reputation. The Tempe firm should be aware that when you dress two attractive women in skimpy fetish cop uniforms, viewers expect some fetish play & T & A. Nough said.
