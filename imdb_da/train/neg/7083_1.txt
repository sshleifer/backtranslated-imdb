My husband rented this from a video store that thought it was excitement. (He never reads synopsis). <br /> <br /> It would be fun if the case was visible. It's simply not. The same thing over and over, plot, and where did they find the leading man? The leading man, Michael Des Barres, is not even fussy, especially for this role he gets. Also, sexual harassment at work is something you want to see, hire Michael Crichton's "Disclosure". At least Michael Douglas looked good in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul, who can usually be seen, plays an embarrassing scene here. There are also light effects cheaper than your home web cam. Don't even waste time renting this. 0/10.
