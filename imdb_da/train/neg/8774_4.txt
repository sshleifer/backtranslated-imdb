Storyline: The movie, which spans four odd hours, adequately covers the events in the Kargil sector near LOC in 1999, when Pakistani infiltrators crossed the local population and had entered deep into the Indian territory and Indian retaliation. To know more about the story, I would suggest readers to read the news about Kargil. <br /> <br /> Comment: If you are looking for a formula story in this movie, you can be sure it is absent. LOC is a story of pure sacrifice, patriotism, courage and many and many bullets and blood. The movie hall where I saw this movie was filled with whistles and bowl when the movie shows Indian Bravery. The movie audience seemed to resemble the audience as in an India vs Pak cricket match. <br /> <br /> Watch the film as a tribute to the army victim and for the characterization of the real warlords (4 PVC honored heroes) who have sacrificed their lives so we could see that day. The film has made a brilliant depiction of the army that has fought all odds under rough weather conditions. The film's negatives are that it is too stretchy and the songs are very boring.
