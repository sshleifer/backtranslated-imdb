I think it's almost all I have to say. However, I feel obliged to explain my actions myself. I have hardly ever seen such a luminaire production, and I mean in all senses of the word. Although he physical camera work, boom mic operation and other technical aspects of this movie are ridiculous, unfortunately it is not the only areas. <br /> <br /> Unlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts' great characterization and plot, this unfortunately has a terrible script, horrible acting and worst of all, horrible annoying characters. <br /> <br /> It is a crime that, for each independent movie receiving, distribution like Haiku Tunnel, there are 101 other indie films that died silent deaths. I don't know who the Kornbluth brothers at Sony, but that may be my only explanation of how this amateur family production has ever been distributed. I'm very confused as to why they picked this up. <br /> <br /> The only part of this movie that holds out intrigue is its title. But the reason for that is even a disappointment. I hope this review will save a few people who may be fascinated by this movie title from seeing it. I've seen many movies in my time, and I'm very forgiving when in the cinema, but it was too much. I will never forget 'tunnel' to mark an important point in my life experience with cinema. Shame it is such a low point.
