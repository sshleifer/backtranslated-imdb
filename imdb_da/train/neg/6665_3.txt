OK, the story - a simpleminded loony goes into a life bored to death, young chick and her kid brother and chaos in their lives - is mildly interesting. Anyway, ideas are nothing (everyone has some ...) - the performance is everything. <br /> <br /> This is what bothered me with this flick. And it disturbed me immensely. The rhythm (control, editing) was slow, the pace was uneven and the climax was expected. We've seen these freed highways five, six, seven times - why? The Norton character's problems were seen as a childish game, not deep enough to understand his problems / soul / blah and to root for or against him. Is he a sweep, a manipulator or just a loony? References to the "taxi driver" were ridiculous and unnecessary and certainly not in favor of this flick (or to E.N. for that matter). <br /> <br /> And IMHO, it's wrongly executed at the end. Cheap emotional tricks for teenage lovers somewhere in Central America. This guy should have killed the child, blame the father, create a real destruction. Or the child should have killed the father at the end, etc. But no, we've got the cheesy end where the kids miss the loony, the father is confused about his own life and relationship with them, and the loony dies of course. The happy dysfunctional family remains scary, confident and happy bored again so we could enjoy our popcorner, undisturbed. <br /> <br /> And the scene where the loony enters the movie, oh my God, I should think long and hard to find something stupid than that! You don't shoot such a scene with a hidden camera and hidden crew. Creators of that movie probably thought it was a good idea, but it was more than annoying. Again, if you are a 16 year old girl somewhere in Kansas, anywhere or anywhere, and dreaming of having sex with a crazy man twice your age, OK, then you like this movie and its "message".
