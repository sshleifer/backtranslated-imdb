Franco Rossi's 1985-hour Italian mini-series Quo Vadis is a very curious animal that creates a completely convincing ancient Roman world shot in real fashion (very few long shots, no big cityscapes), but plays drama so much down in favor of allusions for classical literature and history, the story is constantly lost in the background. <br/> <br /> The changing structure (much of episode 1 is played through voice over letters) and lack of narrative speed makes full six-hour version demanding and exhilarating, and certainly too often uninvolving, but it has something going for the. The two main forces are the characterization of Petronius (a fortunately called Frederic Forrest, whose own voice would almost flatten his dialogue) as a man who used so long after a sharp angle to survive the court life that he is unable to to experience emotions, and Klaus Maria Brandauer's unique takes Nero as a wannabe actor if each movement and action is intended for how his "audience" will receive it. Elsewhere, Max Von Sydow's cards appear in a few episodes, rewarded with the show's most impressive and truly moving scene, where he meets a child as he tries to leave Rome. This is the kind of thing the show could do with more, but it all too often seems to flutter every potentially emotional, inspirational or exciting moment in the relentless lowering direction. Unfortunately, Francesco Quinn makes a dizzying anonymous hero blends in with the walls and comes across less like a Roman officer than the quiet, slightly helpless but unofficial guy who works in the same office as you who never say much on office clerks - you know it You think Dave is called or something. The budget constraints are very visible when meeting Lion Lion time for Christians and Ursus struggle with the bull is so crucially low key that it just passes over you before the show just suddenly loses interest and suddenly ends. <br /> <br /> Not a trip I can especially recommend I am afraid of, but if you do it, it is not without its small rewards.
