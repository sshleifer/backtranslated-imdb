Back when I was a kid and I lived with my sister, she bought all the horror movies she could find, and that was one of them. VCR's had just become a household article and we had no more than 150 movies and we saw hell out of them all. <br /> <br /> I was on the farm the other day and I saw this VHS copy of BLOOD LEGACY and I buy some horror movies I don't have and I knew this movie was so familiar. I thought for a second and realized it was one that my sister had bought. She had sold it many years ago in a yard sale I guess - who knows. <br /> <br /> I remembered nothing at all about it and I saw it the night I bought it and it renewed my memory because of a few scenes. I'm not sure how I felt about it as a child, but I'm sure I enjoyed it because it was new to me and I wanted to see and enjoy something there. <br /> <br /> I'm a frightening freak, but there are certain requirements so I can consider it "good" and this fell very short. It was one of those speeches and drilled me to death. What death scenes you see are made using the shadow on the wall followed by blood stains and if you are lucky you get so much. The story is good, and I've seen a couple with similar plots, so I think this should be buried and forgotten. Don't look at this people unless you have a hard time.
