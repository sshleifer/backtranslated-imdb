I got Mirror Mirror mainly because Yvonne De Carlo was in it (I thought she was great in American Gothic) but unfortunately she didn't have a very big part in this movie. It starts ok, and the pace moves well together ... but at the end it starts to become a bit boring and boring. This is not to say that this is a boring movie, but it's just very average and nothing spectacular. I didn't like the "posession" side of it and there were no decent doing scenes. Plus, the 'main' story was very confusing, and the end doesn't make any sense at all. However, I liked the story of the gothic girl and how she became revenge over her ailments. <br /> <br /> I would not particularly recommend Mirror Mirror to horror fans - it's not something to overdo.
