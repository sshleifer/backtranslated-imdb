Nicholas Walker is Paul, the local town of Reverand, who is married to Martha (Ally Sheedy), but is also a regular womanizer and decides to drop her own death to run away with her current affair Veronica (Dara Tomanovich). But in this way he gets a bram of amnesia (hence the name of the film). Sally Kirkland is also present as a mad old coot who is pissing for the good Reverand in a shades of "misery" kind of way. It is boring to see a beautiful good throw wasted like this. Not least John Savage in a horridly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator. In a movie billed as a "black comedy" one has to bring both elements into the movie. Although this brings the former into spades, it unfortunately does not contain any of the latter. Moreover, you cannot emphasize with any of the characters and as such have absolutely no interest in them. Technically not a bad movie is just a very forgotten movie. Eye Candy: Dara Tomanovich gets topless; Sally Kirkland also shows some skin <br /> <br /> My character: C- <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Showcase
