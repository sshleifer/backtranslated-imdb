I'm a little torn at DARK ANGEL. The movie seems to be a "loving" tribute to the biggest pin-up for ever living - but there is so little "content" that the movie itself is almost meaningless. I can't really see what the motivation or "point" of this movie is - since there is very little biographical information in the story - then those who don't know much about Bettie will not know more after seeing DARK ANGEL either .. . <br /> <br /> The film basically relies on the past few years of Betty's career in bondage modeling. Almost the whole movie consists of "re-enactments" of some of Betty's more "famous" photo shooters and loops. These re-enactments literally record 75% of the film's running time and provide virtually no insight into Bettie as a person. The film briefly touches on her short-lived legitimate plays and her subsequent decision to leave "business" and become religious - but all this is pretty much glossy in favor of showing long and drawn-out re-enactment scenes ... <br /> < DARK ANGEL is not a horrible movie - there is no substance for it. The second problem is that the actress playing Bettie only looks like she's in the farther away shot - close to it's a no-go. The other thing that annoyed me is that although Bettie made several topless modeling shots, the only nudity in the movie was a short segment shot in a zoo in the final credits. The film itself is of course extremely low budget, but does what it can put and costume wise within its limitations - so it's not something from me there. The plot is beautiful wood and unmemorable from everyone involved. In fact - the most memorable thing about the whole movie for me, noticed during the final credits that the actor who played Irving Kaw's real name is Dukey Flyswatter. No joke - check the cast list. Can't say I recommend this too high unless you are a true Bettiefile completist and should own something that concerns her. And if you are so bad - then you have to seek treatment anyway ... 4/10
