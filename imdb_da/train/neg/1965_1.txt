Stephen J. Cannell apparently decided some years ago that he would expand his horizons and dabble in horror. The result, "Dead Above Ground", is a scary piece of junk. Now I had noticed his name in connection with this particular movie I would have put it back, but no, I didn't wear my glasses, and so I missed it, wrong, I really need to bring them with me while video is acting. First question would be who the heck is the target audience for this? It's almost like a "scary" kids movie, but then again there are topless babies and some gore and some bad words spit here and there. The main characters are so sweet that you will see someone, someone, go after them with some kind of agricultural implements. Seems like a guy opens a bed and breakfast that has a checkered past, a child-killing witch who gathers children's teeth lived there. Probably something the real estate agent failed to mention. Of course now in modern times there is a little girls ghost around to warn the real living little girl who now lives there that something bad happens. It does, and there are also two Bubbas who carved that property when the new owner took over so they are out of revenge. This whole thing has the feeling of some tailor-made junk that is for the kids on Halloween, except of course the things that do not suit young children, so it's not only mediocre, it's also confused. A big boo and lift to Anchor Bay to put this out, given their usual track record with fine releases, this is a new low. The UK gets a Phantasm Box Set, we get "The Toy Fairy". Hardly seems fair. 1 out of 10, absolute waste.
