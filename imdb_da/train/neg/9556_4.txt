This movie is mostly hunting scenes and special effects. It is very weak on the plot. Most of the computer's talk was just mumbo jumbo. I saw this because I was a big fan of the original War Games movie, based mainly on computer facts and real computer terminology. This movie had none of it. Most of the computer scenes were not only impossible and very unrealistic of real computers and networks, but just lame. It's as if it was written by someone who has no understanding of real computers. <br /> <br /> The Ripley game was lamb and was basically just an arcade game. No real hacking, so what was the point? Movies were boring. Lame sequel.
