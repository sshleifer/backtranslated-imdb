God, I'm so sick of the shit that comes out of America called "Cartoons"! Since the anime became popular, the US animators either produce a cartoon with a 5-year lazy ass drawing type (Kappa Mikey) or some Japanese animation rapture. (Usually cleans up classic characters) No wonder anime beats American cartoons! <br /> <br /> They're not even trying anymore! <br /> <br /> Oh, I just heard about this night; I live in the UK and when I found out that this show first came out in 2005, I never knew that Britain was so up-to-date with current shows.
