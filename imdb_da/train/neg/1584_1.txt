I read the running man from King's books as Bachman, and I felt like the protagonist John and his family. This movie could have been so much more. The problem? It was put under the big action movie craze. I saw the movie and had pain throughout the case. I felt nothing for the character and less for his case. Yes it had fun scenes (or ridiculous), though I think it didn't store the movie in my eyes. If you read the book, you can feel the climax and fire in the heart of John as he gets his final revenge. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a low number. It couldn't have been so low if I hadn't read the book.
