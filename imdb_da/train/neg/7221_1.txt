.... CAUSE IT IS CRAP! The kind of movie that makes you go and slip the film producer and say "why?". Terrible camera work ... counting times the camera is trying to remain stable on a person and cannot. The dialogue is ridiculous. The action is comical. It seems that they took over a ghost town in the west to see if they could make a movie at the least possible amount. I'd bet $ 10, they used home camcorders to do this. Either that, or most of the cameramen were full. Really, trailers are more entertaining than the movie. If you ever want to host a "worst movie party", take it with you. Want more entertainment ... staring at a wall.
