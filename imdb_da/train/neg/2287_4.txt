I've only seen Gretchen Mol in two other films (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco) and can't really remember her, but she did a good job as a naive girl who posed pictures because it made people happy. <br /> <br /> She didn't really think what she was doing was wrong, even when she left the business and found her religion again. <br /> <br /> The pictures she made were certainly tame by today's standards, and it is fun to see that men with cameras are all excited and politicians are pacing on the malice of pornography. David Strathairn (Good Night and Good Luck) played a great part here. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron (American Psycho) wrote and directed an excellent biopic of the most famous pinpoint ever.
