This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen without a doubt. The only thing interesting in this movie is the cameo adventures of some great genre directors and king himself. The film has a good premise, but falls apart about 15 minutes in history. I liked Madchen Amick in this movie and think she could have a very good movie career.
