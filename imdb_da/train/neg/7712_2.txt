<br /> <br /> Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes is a "parody" of bad monster movies that end up being worse than the movies as it spoofs. The (very modest) story tells of tomatoes that upset those who treat them badly. Basically they spin and grille (yes, the crops) and the next thing you know the person is covered with ketchup. The actors are no names that never made movies after this, so there would be no point in mentioning them. There is a guy who is hired by the government to try to stop the threat of tomatoes. He is accompanied by a black guy who is the master of the disguise and a girl and a guy who dives. Anyway, there's another woman who spies on the first guy working for the government. If it doesn't make you much sense, you understand it. This movie would never have been very good at first, but it even lacks fun to laugh at stupid attack scenes. The movie is horrible cheezy, which, though it is all meant, really really hurts what could have been a (fair) entertaining movie. At one point, a giant wax "slides on an unconcealed wooden plank with wheels on it.
