In his 1966 movie "Blow Up", Antonioni had a completely questioned background of British youth protesters. By asking such questions against a substance of hippie youth movements, Antonioni deliberately or not questioned the effectiveness of these organizations. How can you fight for a cause when what you think is true can actually be a lie? At the back, the film said that we must fight and actively challenge what we see precisely because others can deceive us with false images and false truths. Although the hippie aspects were the most sticky of "Blow Up", they created a nice texture and made the movie more meaningful than it would otherwise have had. It was a very careful and mature little movie. <br /> <br /> With "Zabriskie Point", Antonioni throws all the ambiguities and subtleties of "Blow Up" and goes full blown hippie. The result is a movie flood with bad metaphors, stupid ideas and heavy handed storytelling. How could anyone who showed such restraint and intelligence across their careers do something so silly? <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a nice series of close-ups as we see a group of radicals discussing the significance of the revolution. Suddenly a man (Mark) stands up and leaves. He hates the rigid and orderly nature of the revolution. He acknowledges that while revolutionaries struggle for freedom, to commit to such a militant cause is to effectively give away your freedom. And like Jack Nicholson in "The Passenger", Mark will just be free. <br /> <br /> As such, Mark buys a gun and goes solo. He takes orders from nobody. When police raid their university campus, Mark shoots a guy and runs away. He then flies to a nearby airfield, steals a small private plane and flies out to the desert. Antonioni treats the desert as a peaceful utopia, contrasting it with the ruthless capitalist cities with their billboards and hollow modern appliances. He sees the desert as a kind of garden of Eden. <br /> <br /> In the desert, Mark Daria meets quickly and falls in love. Antonioni gives us a ridiculous sex scene where hundreds of hippies have sex in the sand. Free from the limitations of modern life, these wooden frames and student radicals can now celebrate their individualism by humping in the sun. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with Mark dying and Daria fantasizes about blowing up palaces and stately homes by the rich capitalists who killed him. It is Antonioni's challenge for his audience. Pick up pistols, pickets and explosives, he says. Tear down the walls before they stay in! <br /> <br /> Of course, the film had no effect on the audience. They recognized "Zabriskie Point" as just another self-centered commercial attempt to be radical. A kind of commodified radicalism. It felt untruthful and tame. <br /> <br /> Thematically, the movie is pretty stupid. Antonioni basically says that if you are unhappy with the modern world and the fat cats that exploit you, either escape to the desert (Mark) or actively fight the system (Daria). It's all good and good. But while artists constantly warn us about such dystopian nightmares, they are largely incapable of showing us how to effectively manage change. Like the end of "Fight Club", nihilism and violence achieve nothing. In the real world, social change tends to be instigated by humble inventors, moving forward with less technological advances. I mean, what liberated women more than contraceptives? <br /> <br /> 3/10 - A very bad movie. The problem is, Antonioni doesn't really believe in rebellion. He is a quiet and contemplative man. An introvert who seems to have made an extrovert movie just to gain more worship from the counterculture that embraced his former movie "Blow Up". As such, "Zabrinskie Point" comes across as a very pretentious and stupid movie. It's essentially a 50-year-old man saying "Look at me, I'm a bold rebel!" <br /> <br /> There are many films where audiences are encouraged to fight the "system" but they all fall. into one of four categories. In the first category you have movies like "Network", "Cool Hand Luke", "Cuckoo's Nest" and "Spartacus". These all show that the life of freedom fights all end in failure, but in any case survives the "spirit revolution". The message is that you cannot influence the change, but by dying or failing, the optimistic notion of martyrdom survives. Essentially, we must continue to fail instead of giving up hope. Then you have movies like "Fight Club", "Zabriskie Point" and "Falling Down" that just encourage you to explode. Tear it all down. Blow it all up. Everything is a lie, so you might as well go out into the guns flaming. These films are borne by angry, reactionary emotions, rather than any common sense. <br /> <br /> Then you have the category "Fly instead of match". Terrence Malick and Antonioni are master of this genre. Films such as "Passengers", "Red Islands" and "Badlands" show people running from worlds they do not like and throw islands or peaceful harbors for themselves. Both directors are pessimists, as Malick has destroyed his islands and Antonioni has his islands that do not give any sense of happiness or solution. <br /> <br /> Then you have the fourth category. Films like Donnersmarck's "The Lives of Others", Ashby's "Bound For Glory" and Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange", treat artists as a force of change and rebellion. In these dystopian worlds, where everyone is content to be a slave to the state, it is the pristine creativity and will of the freedom of the artist / criminal who keeps the system in control. By simply existing outside the crew you create waves. Your comments, actions and critical eye challenge the status quo. As such, Donnersmarck's film writers and artists have undermined Nazi Germany while Kubrick has Alex the artist / criminals fighting Nazi dry, painting the city in blood and semen.
