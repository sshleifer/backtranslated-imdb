Dreck about three beautiful women in California who go to cover some festival (or something). All hotels are booked so that they stay overnight in a scary old house. What they do not know is that there is an eerie resident who likes to kill ... Yawn. Drilling, meaningless, completely silly horror movie. Bach and her two friends are certainly beautiful, but the movie itself is boring dull! Bach and her friends are no actresses - their faces are glossy all the way through. The final "revelation" is ridiculously predictable, and there is no blood or do to keep you interested along the way. There are some expected free female nudity, but that's not enough to save this. Drilling, meaningless and unknown (for good reason). A 1 all the way.
