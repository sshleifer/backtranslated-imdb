This TV-produced thriller is all talking, little action. It seems difficult to create your in-depth plot, but the writing is so confused that the exhibition is at best overcast. At the end, I didn't know more about these signs than I did at the beginning. It has a quasi-"Ten Little Indians" scenario, but ditches it in the middle of in favor of spotlighting Sally Field and her cover of a killer. Fields surpass here with a gracelessness I have rarely seen from her. The early introductions are good, but the writing immediately strays off-course and eventually goes over the top. Lots of hysteria and constant thunder and light effects (which don't add anything). A curious failure from the producers Aaron Spelling & Leonard Goldberg. With all this talent they couldn't give us anything more than a script full of red herring and Sally Field hiding in a closet?
