An excellent performance by Alix Elias highlights an otherwise misaligned and confused pile of dragon. I've seen this movie, maybe 12 times, and with each review I find less and less pleasure. Why is Munchies so fun? Has it ever been explained? Are they a reflection of our malevolent, bourgeois animal welfare? If they are, why not make it more obvious? Why not peal back just a touch of the subtlety that plagues this movie and make the connection explicit? Another part of this movie that bothers me to no end - motorcycles. The jacket the little monster carries on the front appears to suggest 'street-wise' travelers. The sunglasses say 'cute cool guy'. With all this I am ready for Easy Rider meets Muppets. All I get is Munchies (1987). What gives? Stick to the Gremlins series if you are a fan of diminutive, clever cracks, reptiles - it gives you the treatment you deserve.
