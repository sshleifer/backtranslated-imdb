When a big action star who fell from the earth's surface ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent. Reunion with some former co-stars to clean up the city. <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> Low key, part of the problem is casting Chris Klien as a previous action hero. He's not bad, but he's really not trustworthy like the one who was taken to be a tough guy. As I said, he's not bad, he's just ashamed of what his back story is. The real problem here is the combination of the script, which is really not fun and appears artificially at times, and the direction that is pedestrian to the drop port. There is no life in the way things are created. It's as if the director had a list of shots and passed the list. It gives an uninteresting movie. And yet, the film occasionally brings to life, as in the last performance ending the film. This sequence works, but because the earlier parts of the film flowed drained of much of its power. <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend the movie. It's worth a shot if you're a fan of the actors or a big fan of independent cinema in all its forms, but otherwise it's just a disappointment.
