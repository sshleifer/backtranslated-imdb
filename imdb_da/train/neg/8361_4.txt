-SPOILES- Lame south of the border adventure film, which has something to do with the struggle of a major co-operation director Rosenlski, president of Unasco Inc., of the lamb's comrade David Ziegler who lives the life of Reilly or Ziegler in his beach house in Cancun Mexico .Having this CD, he gave to his brother James, who has three years of phone calls between Rosenlski and the US president involved in criminal deals. This CD has given David an edge over the international mobsters following him. <br /> <br /> The fact that James gets a little greedy by trying to shake Rosenlski down for 2 million in diamonds did not only cost him his life, but put David at risk of losing his too. Ropsenlski wants to negotiate with David for the CD by getting his former wife Liz to talk to him about giving up, Rosnelski has made an agreement to pay out her debt if she gets through. David is later killed by Rosenliski's Mexican hitman Tony, with the help of a large white shark who just doesn't go for all those peaceful relationships at his head. <br /> <br /> Tony had taken the CD that Liz left for his boss at a local hotel safe, and now he'll kill James, just as he did David, while keeping the CD over Rosenlski . <br /> <br /> David, who secretly hid the diamonds that James had on him at the time of his murder, is now the goal of Tony and his men closing him well. David will also take the diamonds and at the same time give his boss Rosenlski the impression that the CD David had lost is used but later use it without Rosenlski knowing who is behind it to cheat him. <br /> <br /> The movie "Sharks Night" has a number of shark attacks in it with this large one-eyed white shark ending in half a dozen of the cast members, including Tony. David, a solid believer in gun control, uses knife-high pesticides and Molotov cocktails as well as his fists to take out the entire Tony crew. Even the killer shark is completed by Tony, but with a hunting knife, not a gun. When it came to using firearms to save his friend and sidekick Paco, a boyfriend Juanita and his priest, Father Mattia, live from Tony, and his bandguns were a no-no with David; he was more of a knife and spearman than anything else. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie was about as predictable as you can with David believing he was killed by the one-eyed shark that later came out of the crowd after Rosenlski was convinced that he is dead and leaves the village. David continues his life as a free living and loving beachcomber where no one seeks to kill him and about $ 2 million richer. to David's credit, he had his friend Paco give Rosenski his CD, but under the conditions that if something happened to him, his cousin, who Rosenlski does not know who and where he is, will shoot his big mouth and let the whole world know about his dirty and criminal actions.
