Like so many media experiments, this amateur effort contains seeds of a very interesting social comment. In the 5+ years since it was released, the premise has been made less outrageous by real world events in software development, and I found it less boring than the previous commentator for that reason, I imagine ... The director is clearly a fan of Hitchcock, And it is too bad that the movie was not better done, but in reality it is almost a parody of pulp fiction, including the soundtrack that screams us when we need to be alert. You can almost see exclamation marks and capital letters on a flooring page. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I found it quite entertaining for all these reasons and more. Sometimes it has the smart less to offer us, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in deconstructing it for educational purposes. Oh yes - and although the seams showed and it creaked a lot, my heart rate rose and I was reluctant to get up and take a break.
