The movie starts with a good song Looks like a thriller where Arbaaz Khan walks around in a suspicious way, but then suddenly we are forced to a comedy With the routine stupid idiots like GOLMAAL with Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal, who act as adult children Their scenes are pretty funny first and so boring. There is a dull part of Tanushree's brother being killed. Towards the end, the film tries to get serious with the villain who kidnaps our heroes, but here it gets stupid. Then a long bashing climax straight out of HERA PHERI and wait, there is also a long hunt in Payal's house <br /> <br /> The movie is so boring that it gets you to sleep. <br/> <br /> Priyan's very poor music (Pritam) is routine except for the first song <br /> <br /> Cinematography is bad, the movie has a cheap look throughout <br /> <br / > Rajpal Yadav is good in his first scene where he goes to pay his rent and I was happy that the actor is not tall and over the top like other movies but no, he gets his usual self and gets annoying most times The Hussar shouldn't Speaking in a movie, his call is terrible Sharman is the saving grace. He is the only actor who works very well in this movie Kunal Khemmu tries hard in his first comic book as an adult, but does not impress much Tanushree is bad as always, Arbaaz Khan gets smaller scale and is usual Payal is a non-actor Murli Sharma is horrible
