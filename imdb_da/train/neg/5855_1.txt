The movie released in early 2000 alongwith MELA both disasters So sad to start a millennium with such nonsense <br /> <br /> The movie seems to fit 70, but looks like an unintentional comedy for 2000 <br /> <br /> Anyway are some classic gems from the movie: Paresh Rawal I don't understand laughing at his role or crying. Reason: He is going to seek his mother in the village. Worst part is when he discovers a secret in Anil, he keeps the secret in his stomach. who gets big and makes him pregnant, i remember in my childhood my teacher told me the same joke urrf !!!! as a child I laughed at that time, but here? The whole movie is a joke can not explain We have Anil in a dual role (One older and younger) and Rekha plays the elder's wife and Raveena the young We also reject Harish, while Shakti plays the son of Aruna Irani, both of whom are fighting who who has the worst wig. Direction is outdated Music is bad <br /> Anil tries hard looking too old in the younger role and too young in the older role, but good effort Rekha is appropriate, Raveena is also okay Harish is bad Shakti Kapoor is horrible Aruna Irani is as usual Rajnikant is okay in a cameo
