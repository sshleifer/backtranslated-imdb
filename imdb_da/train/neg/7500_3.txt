Spike lee must be one of the most over-qualified directors I've ever seen. He's the treasure of criticism because he probably makes movies with a "message" or he's just so bohemian in his approach that it makes critics who are waterproof from the Hollywood movie formula eat his stuff just to be different. <br /> <br /> Summer Of Sam doesn't even do it well. The movie and editing style is Oliver Stone, and that is also the story. The reason is much like "Do the right thing". The depiction of "Guidos" or for PC-putting Italian-Americans (which I happen to be) is straight out of Eddie Murphy's Raw. Only Eddie Murphy's impression of a macho Italian guy choosing a fight with a much higher African American is much, much more credible than the cartoonish, broad Italian caricatures shown here (John Leguizamo's character is a possible exception). <br /> Does anyone watch this movie that couldn't figure out how to end it? As soon as Richie entered the movie, I could already see fist in his face and foot in the stomach, I could already see him being accused of being the killer. This character had the most integrity in the whole movie, so of course Lee will show what happens to people who stand out in a crowd (what a white bearded click!) <br /> <br /> Give thanks to Spike Lee lifetime card for any basketball game he wants. So maybe he'll enjoy getting a movie camera for a long time, and we won't have to be exposed to his self-sufficient drive, nor should I see critics (some of whom I respect) ohhhh and ahhhh an emperor without clothes.
