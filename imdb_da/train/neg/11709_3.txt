You've heard it said to live every moment as if it's your last? Whether it's your last day or not, I ask you not to waste any part of it and see it here! Nichole Hiltz gives some good moments with eye-catcher (which unfortunately remains wrapped up) and David DeLuise shows why he should stick to the small screen or dog food advertising. A superficial, unrealistic plot with terrible dialogue means that there is no "art" in "the art of revenge". <br /> <br />
