The orders fatal errors - besides an asinine plot - are that the character simply does not resonate or even react. <br /> <br /> Two examples: A priest who goes through a cemetery late at night is suddenly attacked by ghostly spirits. After turning them off, he quietly resumes his turn when his buddy comes up. "Something wrong?" His friend asks to have seen the attack. "Just some demonic spirits - nothing I couldn't do." No reaction, no surprise, just as he had changed a tire. His friend is just as carefree ... must be standard priest training ... ["And then you put the wafer in your mouth. Any questions? Okay, continue Demon Spirit attack ...") <br /> <br /> Example Two: The priests at some point need an answer to a question, and only one demon (or something worried by now) could give it. How? Why should you ask a dying man! So the demon has some random people hanging in front of the two priests so they can ask their questions to the bursting, gasping man. "Hey, don't kill him!" or maybe "It's not nice!" would have been more realistic than their answer. They never ask them to let the man go or stop. In fact, the closest thing to reacting to is getting mild irritation. They ask their questions and go. <br /> <br /> I had to close it at the time - my brain began atrophy. <br /> <br /> Avoid <br /> <br /> * / **** (one star out of four) <br /> <br />
