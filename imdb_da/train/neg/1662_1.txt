This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This makes your run of the mill TV movie similar to Reservoir Dogs. Based on a book by one and only Britney Spears and her mother, this trash without anything bore a fair performance from Virginia Madsen (I hope you were paid well) to save it. The story of a Red Country Cup winning a scholarship in a prestigious music school is small, but a vehicle to pedal Spears bends music to the consumer and generally agrees that low forehead must be that way. There is nothing good going on here with all the battles as predictable as the night after day. Never ever again.
