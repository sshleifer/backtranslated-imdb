When a movie like "The Dukes of Hazzard" brings in over $ 75 million, it gives some incredibly incredible statements about the state of our society. Either we are collectively too stupid to stay away from the trash like this, or maybe I just understand how many people this kind of no-effort waste will appeal to. <br /> <br /> Hollywood has not had the incentive to make good movies, because if it puts out the trash, people will see it anyway, as there is nothing else on display. This is it. I went out despite getting a free movie pass. The dialogue could not be stupid. The stunter could not be more over-the-top and outrageous. Maybe this "bigger the big" picture appeals to Texans, but it didn't appeal to me or anyone in the theater. None of the "big names" were in this career ending, except Burt Reynolds, who says everything you need to hear. Jessica Simpson - Don't let me laugh. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't even recommend this movie to video even though you were desperate. It was about tricking the public into making money after opening the day to be equated or doing better than it costs through marketing. They warned, despite the public. Stupidity is great.
