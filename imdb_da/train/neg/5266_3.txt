In the beginning and throughout the film, it was fantastic. It was exciting and exciting. But in the end it did not answer what had happened. They were mysteriously transformed into zombies with a raven or crow? It did not respond to the questions we all had, and therefore it was not as good a movie as I thought it should be.
