Direct! Yes, but not kicking. <br /> <br /> True story: Some time ago, a Dutch television station announced a flight to launch a new reality show. A competition rather. The majority of this show would be a woman who was dying of something terrible and she would donate the kidneys to a lucky person with progressive kidney failure. Too real. <br /> <br /> The country and international media were all this story like flies on a turd and said it was terrible, immoral, what is it that comes to the world and the like. Somehow I agreed. <br /> <br /> As the months went by, tensions built up to the extent that the government was essentially obsessed with the question of whether to let the show go ahead or not, rather than driving the country. <br /> <br /> The exhibition closed and just until the last minute they push forward. And until the last moment, the country was in arms, the Prime Minister made speeches, every newspaper writes about it, everyone in the country holding their breaths. And the network pushed on. Against a new limit on television. And they managed quite clearly. They push the envelope. <br /> <br /> The show was sent and we saw everyone with a terminally ill woman choosing the right candidate to receive her kidneys so he or she would live while she would die shortly afterwards. <br /> <br /> And then, in the last moments of the show, it was revealed that it was a partial hoax. The woman was not sick, but all the candidates were. There was no new reaction. The whole show, that with advertising and advertising and all discussions built up for months to a great climax, was an advertising bullet that focused on the problem of major deficiencies in organ donors. The man who founded this network himself died of kidney disease. <br /> <br /> Now this TV. Leaving everyone far behind in amazement. <br /> <br /> Don't give me a badly acted, badly directed flick about a woman trying to get a Russian roulette program on American TV. <br /> <br /> As if. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * Like I would think they would get it through the FCC. As if I would believe that this would come through the US Supreme Court on the basis of free expression. As if I believe in the ridiculous ending where this woman pulled it off and has conscience problems because a guy hit himself in the air. It has all been done before. Watch running husband with Arnold instead. At least it had half a good ending. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * This is a terribly bad piece of film along with a ridiculous ending. Then she gets shot in the end, must it make us feel better when we leave the theater because there was some kind of justice? Don't take my word for it, but I'll say it here: let it be alone and see a test pattern instead, you get more quality.
