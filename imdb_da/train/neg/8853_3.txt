In the first Howling we are introduced to a world where werewolves exist and are somewhat organized. The reason for that film made something sensible; a television reporter examines this and tries to uncover the truth. She ends up having to kill many of them, including her boyfriend who becomes one. Then she shows the world that they exist by transforming on live TV. The special effects were just ridiculous in the first movie and they didn't get any better in this movie. Whether it's the transformations or the bad dolls or the cheesy computer graphics showing the superpowers. <br /> <br /> The baseline is not that bad; they must kill the heads of the werewolves for some reason. This will not destroy all werewolves and it really does not cease the threat of werewolves like it ... they just want to kill her. I think there was some cloudy reason for this, but it is really lost in the movie. After the movie "ends," we have a 10-minute montauge of the movie we've just seen, and every other scene is one where the female werewolf leader runs out of her top and exposes her big boobs while some Devo-esquire tapes play to a lots of werewolves. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes this movie appear is Christopher Lee.
