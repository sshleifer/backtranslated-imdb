It started with an interesting premise. I always like civil war products and old secret societies. The more the film evolved, the more I realized that this was a B-movie at best. In the latter half, it quickly became a C movie, then D, then F, so "I wish this was not a rental so I could put it in the microwave!" I can't say that the act was in all cases horrible, just most. Scripture, though ... I never read the book. Maybe the book is well written. The play was written by a 10-year-old. It was ridiculously superficial, diabetic and uninteresting, the characters are just as interesting as a 5 pound bag fertilizer. I really hated this movie, like my wife. I am a Christian, and I have no problem with movies that promote or support Christianity. This movie made a great disservice to the cause. Horrible, horrible, worthless. If you liked it, I highly recommend Superman 4.
