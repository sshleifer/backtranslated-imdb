I finished watching the movie 10 minutes ago. Where can I still not believe what I have seen. <br /> <br /> This is definitely the worst movie ever. If I wanted to list all the errors in the movie, this review would take me a lot of phrases. (Very funny flaws because it was so bad) <br /> <br /> You are amazed at the ability of the commands to assign the rescue of the aircraft. they didn't even know how to move. Ice-t is such a bad actor ... and what I don't understand is how the production wanted him to be like a hero, but he's zero. Of course, the biggest flaws will be the landing on a 747 that only requires 3 or 4 tips from a guy in transmission to land the plane ... great .. as well as the dead bodies that almost had no blood. <br /> <br /> But I highly recommend watching this movie as it is very interesting to see how badly anything can get
