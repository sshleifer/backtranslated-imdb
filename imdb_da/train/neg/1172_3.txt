There is so often a movie that hits me in a notch and reminds me that my taste in movies I'm looking for is not always impeccable. I would usually stay away from things like this, but I was beaten by some glowing reviews and the Rohmer pedigree. There is a novelty and exciting novelty for the production, where Rohmer essentially overlays the actors into the painted (digital) Revolution times France. This weakens quickly and becomes as interesting as watching paint dry on a paint at the speech scene. What we are back with is a dull and thin film about 18th century aristocrats. None of the signs are appealing or sympathetic. The pace is so dull, the dialogue is so fierce, and excitement is clearly a strange concept to Rohmer, that I didn't end up worrying about who the head rolled, who was the owner of who or what the devil revolution was about. The film would have greatly benefited from a feeling of emotional structure and a music score (there is a lot of fine classical music used at the end). Despite being "talky", the movie plays a lot like a silent movie, and the worst kind of movie about it, a boring and uninteresting film about infinitely interesting topics. Only the most magnificent French historians will find something to take from this movie, as it seems to paint well-known events from a new angle (Lady is English and a royalist). Otherwise, avoid this yawner at all costs unless you suffer from insomnia (I swallowed twice).
