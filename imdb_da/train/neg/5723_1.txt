Anyone who has said it is better than Hostel speaks complete crap, believe me I'm not a fan of Hostel, but that's just ridiculous. This is just another shot on the camcorder, just for DVD, low on ideas wasting your time, I can't believe how many of these movies are and I'm not yet seeing a decent one. In the 80's video nasties, gore and horror movies were made without budget, but a great story and a lot of new ideas and most importantly the director's heart and soul that had something to say. Now, they just seem to be pumped out in an attempt to trick people surfing in Blockbuster to rent a copy until people stop doing this, so I think these movies will continue to appear. This film is so low on ideas, it's just amazing how it ever was made, the play is also terrible, the location is totally unconvincing and the soundtrack is so annoying it begs faith. This waste of time has absolutely nothing to do with it unless you are striving to compile a list of the worst movies all the time. My best / worst part of the movie is when a female person points to a gun at someone and threatens to shoot them, if they do not go back, you can see that she does not even cover the trigger with her finger, just keep grip. An absolute joke.
