I thought it was a New York-based movie: wrong! It is a small British landscape setting. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a comedy: wrong! It is a drama .... Well to the last third, because history is becoming "abracadabrantesque", the symbolic word for a French presidency. That means, close to nonsense itself, the motives would like to give a sincere feeling. What have I left? Perhaps, a good actress: Yes, I know they are 3 friends, but the red-haired policeman is a little invisible to me. The high doctoral student surprises her blow, and McDowell delivers a fine as usual, all in a delicate, soft and almost dumb attitude. This gentleness puzzle me, because as other fine artists or directors repeat the same pattern over and over again. In her case it is like, regardless of the movie, it is always the same character defined by her feelings, her values ​​that live endlessly different stories. I still don't know how to set the boundary (or merger) between the artists and the works. <br /> <br /> Another positive aspect of this movie is its feminine touch and interesting points of view. The women each have their own way of life, even though they are all single. It gives much tolerance and learns to see how a similar and unique reality can be perceived in as many ways as human beings. Finally, the film is quite visible, but the big final cuts the desire for a next vision.
