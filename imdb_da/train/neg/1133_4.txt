I've seen romantic comedies, and this is one of the easiest / worst attempts at one. Many scenes work in a plug-and-play way that is rigorously applied to the romantic comedy genre. Usually it is okay, because we are dealing with a genre, but the challenge is generally to make it original, new and inventive. This movie fails. <br /> <br /> There is no point in who the characters really are, except Sylvie Moreau (who is the real star of this movie, not Isabelle Blais). They fit into this one-dimensional clich√©, and they become no more than simple dolls that serve the purpose of a very easy story. <br /> <br /> The pacing of the movie can be annoying, the rhythm is missing, and editing is filled with unnecessary close-ups. I should also mention the overly stylized decors that make some scenes devoid of anything natural, or rather, the experiment obviously seems too obvious. Of course, you have the right cue sappy music, which unfortunately often sounds inconsistent. <br /> <br /> I can't believe a movie that makes obvious Woody Allen allusions end up being this misleading. If you expect a good light heart romantic comedy, it is not. Or rather, this is a bad attempt at it. You will only leave the theater and wonder why this film has received such praise when the cinema is now more than 100 years old and there are much better Quebecois directors who do better. <br /> <br /> Les Aimants is a great movie for What is it. But it is bad if you consider cinema as art and directors as an author.
