This is hands down the worst movie I can ever see. Everything was incredibly clich√© and retarded. The action was also horrible. The camera's work wasn't bad, but it still couldn't solve it. The author / director of this movie must suffer from Down's syndrome if he believed that this movie would help his career. I want back one and a half of my life that I wasted looking at this crap. I'd rather watch a video of the grass growing than this. I can't believe IMDb makes me write 10 lines to post this, but I feel this movie is so bad that I have to continue to warn others about it. The reason I came to this movie is that my boyfriend asked for it from the local library who thought it was the Kris Kristoferson movie, which ended up being eligible for "disappearances". I don't know what error it was for this waste that ended up in my DVD player, but I feel that someone owes me at least $ 20 for my time, pain and suffering. In conclusion, the director / author of this movie hopes that I will ever recognize him on the street.
