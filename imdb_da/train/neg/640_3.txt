Chilly, alienating the adaptation of Rebecca West's book of an army captain returning from his workplace in World War II with his memory impaired (now there is an original idea!). It seems he remembers old flame Glenda Jackson, but not the current wife Julie Christie, who must be enough to set aside some emotional sparks. This extremely well-molded soap brings together the leading man Alan Bates along with director Alan Bridges and co-stars Jackson, Christie, Ann-Margret and Ian Holm, but the burners are all low-level. There are a handful of good scenes (especially when Jackson is on the screen), but Bridges' pacing is insufficiently sluggish and the film's exhausted color is enervating. For a long time, this "soldier" is best left forgotten. * 1/2 from ****
