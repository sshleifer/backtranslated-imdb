I wouldn't normally write a comment online, but it's the worst movie I've ever seen. Not only is it filmed like a soap series ("The young and the restless" are really filmed by professionals in relation to this), but it also has terrible cuts. It has no action. It is filled with useless waste. <br /> <br /> Here's an example: a guy wants to kill the protagonist when he was fired because of him. So (after many crap) here they are: the guy puts a knife in his throat and says something like "You're dead now". Then the protagonist says, "If you kill me, you're dead. I've told the police you're threatening me". So the (killer) guy goes like (just crying): "Oh no ... the police follow me !? !! Oh ... my God". <br /> <br /> Remember: this is just an example. I really can't believe this movie actually exists. So: IF you want to see the WORST movie ever ... go ahead, I recommend it :)
