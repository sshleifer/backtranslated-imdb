One of the worst movies I've ever seen. How is "worst?" I prefer to have both eye balls widespread and then be forced to dance on them than ever see this graceful dragon again. One way or another, One-Hit Wonder Zwick manages a movie that at the same time insults Elvis fans, Mary Kay sellers, Las Vegas, gays, FBI agents, and the rest of humanity with every intelligence with a whimsical, sloppy farce, so forced it deserves to be abandoned. How Elvis Presley Enterprises could allow the rights of actual Elvis songs to be used in a movie with a central premise that seems to be "The only good Elvis Presley Imitator is a death" is beyond me. The worst part of this mess - and it requires some work - is the missing script: In 1958, Elvis' words and songs that he would speak / perform in the 1970s are quoted! Worst special effect? That Oscar would go to the moron, who decided that Elvis's grave, possibly the most photographed / recognizable grave in the world, resembles a pyramid with a gold plate glued on top and located in the middle of a park somewhere. Potentially, the film's biggest audience will be Elvis fans. But the creepy stupidity (Nixon gave Elvis a DEA emblem, not FBI credentials ... and I could continue) actually undermines the conventional wisdom. Ugh. I used the word "wisdom" to describe this silly movie. This is really a horrible, horrible movie.
