Peeew it stinks! As everyone knows it is based on some geico insurance advertisements; what nobody knows is why? These advertisements were at best entertaining at first viewing; hardly foot for a series. (The talking Geico gecko - it's another story. Now it would be an exciting series!) And why on earth did ABC - as it was reported in the press - actually agree to buy the cavemen's rights from Geico for this ? After all, the idea of ​​cavalry fighting in the modern world is hardly unique to television; Phil Hartman had a recurring Saturday Night Live role as The Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer over a decade ago. And such a concept works like this best - as an occasional installment. But a regular series? Fuhgeddaboudit. (A 1960 series called "It's About Time" also used the cavemen in the modern world concept. It lasted a season.) One of the show's directors, who were also responsible for the Geico ads, was recently quoted as saying: "We were so excited when we shoot our advertisements because we felt we had something very unique and we had bigger stories to tell." Wrong. <br /> <br /> In the annals of bad television, this is supposed to take place with 1972's "Me and the Chimp" as one of the very best. The leading actor in the embarrassing chimpanzee mask actually went into shame-for-union hiding after it was abruptly interrupted. Without a doubt, our cavemen friends will follow.
