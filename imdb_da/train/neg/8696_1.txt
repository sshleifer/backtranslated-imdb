I'm Anthony Park, Glenn Park is my father. First, I want to say that the story behind this movie and the creation of the Amber Alert system is a good one. But the film itself was badly made, and the play was terrible. The big problem I had with the movie involved the second half with Nichole Timmons and Father Glenn Park. The events around that part of the story were not entirely correct. My father suffers from mental illness at that time and picked up Nichole without any intention of hurting her at all. He loved her as a daughter and was under the thought that he saved her from some form of injury or neglect, which he probably thought was coming from her mother, who had a little attention over her in the 3 plus years that my father took getting rid of her and summarizing raised her so her mother could boast about. The film depicted my father in a way that he would hurt her in some way form or form. The funny thing is that Nichole had spent many nights consecutively at my father's place while Sharon would work or do what she did. The reason my dad was originally supposed to be violent was that he had items that could be thought of as weapons on his truck. My father was a landscaper. The things they considered to be weapons were landscape tools that he kept in his truck all the time for work. My recommendation is to take this movie with a grain of salt, it's a good story and based on true events, but the details of the movie (at least Nichole Timmons - Glenn Park section) are largely inaccurate and portray the director's failure to discover the truth of tell the story. The funny thing is, if the director would have interviewed any of Sharon's friends who knew the situation, they would have said exactly what I posted here.
