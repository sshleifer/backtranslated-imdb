I don't know what the other guy was thinking. The fact that this film was made independently, makes it no less terrible. You can be as big a believer as you like ... the majority of this movie is mindless drift. I feel I have been offended by seeing the first 40 minutes of it. And it alone was not a small feat. Not only is the act horrible, but the plot is never quite developed. There are countless gaps in history, to the point where you can barely call it a story any more. I've never read the book so I can't criticize it, but it's the first review I've written here, and it's just to save all your viewers out there one and a half and half of your life. I can't remember the last time I couldn't even finish watching a movie. This one really takes the cake.
