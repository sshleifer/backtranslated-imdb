Yet another movie about a tortured, self-centered, arrogant, unpleasant, hateful, self-destructive, character that we must worry about. <br /> <br /> Do not understand me, I am very open to all kinds of off the wall films as a protagonist of a strong self-destructive character. What I protest about this is that there is so little background for this guy. Why did this guy hate himself and the world? Had the manuscript dealt with this more, they could have managed to induce some sympathy for him. As it is, he just comes out as an unpleasant hateful character, not tragic, just hateful. Having done great pain to make this guy as crazy and antosocial as possible and making his fate as dark as it is possible the author has the nerve to make a good end. <br /> <br /> This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's in there and puts a good game! Man! Do not waste your time.
