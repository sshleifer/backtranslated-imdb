Great cast. Great acting. Unpredictable storyline for the first half <br /> <br /> hour or so. I really wanted to know what would happen <br /> <br /> for each of these solution figures and how their seemingly different lives would be intertwined. But then the <br /> <br /> authors took the glue out to start connecting the players, they mistakenly used super glue and brought the movie to a quiet position. <br /> <br /> in the last two hours. I kept thinking it would get better, but it just got worse. Don't believe the reviews. This is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Think about it - Tom Cruise made ugly - why? The beautiful <br /> <br /> hunky bartender wearing hangers - why? I know it had to do with plot, but without them there would at least have been an attractive cast member to remember.
