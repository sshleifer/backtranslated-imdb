The first episode set the bar quite high, I thought. The star William Hurt as a hitman contracted to kill a toymaker. We get very little information about his character, or who pays him to kill, and the episode is actually remarkable for no dialogue at all. He returns to his modernist penthouse and delivers a package of toy soldiers. This gives him a smile, but he rejects it and goes about his business. But he is in for a hell of a night, the soldiers are alive and are waging war, driving jeeps, firearms and bazookas, and even flying helicopters! The special effects are good for a TV show, and it gets pretty exciting as he dodges around the apartment using his wits to survive, sometimes to get the upper hand and other times not. I do not want to ruin the end, but it is enough to say that it was a wise little twist. This gave me hope for the rest of the series, but I was disappointed, the other episodes were all rubbish and I lost interest in the fourth. Stephen King adaptations are always a mixed bag, and that is no exception
