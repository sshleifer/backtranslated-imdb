At the start of the film, the beautiful photography and the scene of the fox were fantastic. The story, however, was so slow and boring. And then the little girl begins to bitch the fox, which leads to tragic events. We live in the forest and often see foxes. One thing someone should know is that you leave wild animals wild and enjoy them from afar. This movie sets a terrible example of the kids who want to see it in an attempt to make a wild creature into a pet. I do not know what the point of history should be. Even after the terrible events with the main rope, the little girl would still play with the kits. Does she never learn her lesson? And there are other scenes of predators to the fox that only add to the trauma inflicted on children watching this movie. What a disappointment this movie was. And what a horrible story it tells. The final narrated dialogue was so stupid, after which my wife and I screamed at the TV! I absolutely hated this movie and would never recommend it to anyone!
