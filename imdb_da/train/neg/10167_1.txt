This TV movie shows that there are bad movies. The only reason I saw this was that it was covered by a KTMA MST3K. It's the Super Bowl at the Superdome in New Orleans. However, there is no football, and we look behind the scenes to look at virtually nothing. With the many stars in this movie, it made no difference. I really don't know why I saw this.
