There are some bad movies out there. Most of them are pretty funny. "Criminally Insane 1" was one of those flicks. So bad that it was fun and had reassessed it. "Criminally Insane 2" must be one of the worst movies ever made and coming from me, it says a lot because I'm not the kind of person to say anything, the worst. But believe me, it was just awful and running only 1 hour is 1 hour too long. <br /> <br /> The movie has a rather incoherent story, but who cares about history when all you want to see is a big fat woman driving around and killing people because she's not being fed. Now you don't see it in this movie, except for all the flashback sequences from the first one. The new story could have been really fun when Ethel was sent to a halfway house and murdered everyone in there, but nothing happens before the last 20 minutes of the movie, and at that time you are already asleep. <br /> <br /> The camera's work in this movie is just awful. This literally reminds me of something I shot with my friends when I was 15. The sound quality is different, since one cannot understand a word most characters say. To give an example of how bad it is, go into a metro station in New York and try to understand what is being said about the speakers, that's what this movie sounds like. Not that it matters anything they are talking about, anyway, because the actors are as dry as a dead tree. <br /> <br /> Now, I know it says this is the worst movie out there, is pretty tough, but words I can't describe how bad this movie is. If you don't believe me, look it yourself. 1.10
