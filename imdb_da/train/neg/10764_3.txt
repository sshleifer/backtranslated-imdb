I give author / director William Gove credit to find someone to fund this unimaginable "thriller". A good argument for not wasting money subscribing to HBO, let alone buying DVDs based on cover art and blurbs. A pedestrian Dennis Hopper and a game Richard Grieco adds nothing significant to their CVs, although the art direction is not half-bad. The dialogue will leave you angry with wonder at its concept; this is storytelling at worst. No excitement, no excitement, no fear, no fear, no empathy, no catharsis, nothing nothing. A few attractive and often naked dogs eat the boredom, but it is certainly a movie that is best seen as a trailer. I'm sorry about the guy who shone this thing. Good for sennat, only expelled. You have been warned.
