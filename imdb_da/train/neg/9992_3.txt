Ah yez, Sci Fi Channel produces Yeti another horrible movie. I was especially taken by the scenes immediately after the accident where, as the survivors desperately searched for matches, at least half a dozen fires burned? Without apparent reason? at various places in the wreck. Brand seemed to be a dominant theme throughout. They searched for lighters and fights, and finally one box was built a fire every day for apparently 12, but no one ever gathered wood. So when the vegan (hah) burned the body, what did she use for an accelerant? I think these guys were frozen ?? Well maybe not. Despite the seemingly low temperature, all that was blown ate. Maybe it's just me, but even in an incredible story (none of the survivors have ever heard of a yeti or an abominable snowman, eventually), if you take care of the little things, the bigger offers become more acceptable . Oh, what did the prologue (1972) have to do with the rest of the movie? And the revolver, warm enough to hold his hand, froze and would not fire. Gimme a break. Now we have at least Carly Pope, another extremely lovely Canadian lass. And with a little irony, Ed Marinaro as a coach. I might as well add that the rabbit they ate (despite being similar to chicken) is not a rodent, but a lagomorph. Now if it had been a squirrel (or a rat) it would have been a rodent, but it still looked like chicken. And the authors missed a real chance of having anyone noticed "It tastes like ..."
