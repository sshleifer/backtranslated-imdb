The Plot of Corpse Grinders 2 is very similar to the original Corpse Grinders, what remains that differs from the other movie, made up of strange aliens. It's my belief that this movie would be the # 1 worst movie on IMDb - if anyone actually saw it. The reason is interrupted, and in several (too many) cases it makes absolutely no sense. The real wonder here is why in the world this sequel was created for such a failed and terrible (but still better) movie. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie if you enjoy watching horrible movies for a good laugh.
