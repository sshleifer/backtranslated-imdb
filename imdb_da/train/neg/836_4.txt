A dedicated fan for the TLK movies, where the first one is a milestone, and the other probably the best sequel Disney has produced along with this movie ... Now I do not argue with animation, voice work, music, but this is no more than a Timon / Pumbaa screwloose in the TLK atmosphere. Although it's not bad, it doesn't add anything. Basically, this movie is a great joke ... and it's all about saving it. Make a real TLK3, Disney! The potential is there. <br /> <br /> 4/10
