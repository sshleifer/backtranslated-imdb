I just came from watching this movie and decided to see what others believed in it. I wonder if these people who give glowing reviews saw the same movie! This may be a very good story, but it fails to hit the mark. The script is very weak - the plot has so many holes that it would make a good dip for the fishing scenes. The characters were not well developed, and the story jumped so much that I found the question "How did we get here?" at least half a dozen times during the film. <br /> <br /> There was a lack of chemistry between the cast members. This is probably related to Lindsay Lohan's antics during the movie. It was pretty clear that everyone appeared and did their job, but did not commit to their roles. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie worth seeing ... go for a walk, play a board game, take a nice hot bath and save your money for something worth it!
