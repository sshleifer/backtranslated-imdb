Like watching a neighbor's summer camp home movie, "Indian Summer" is a sleep inducing drill. Eight alumni campers are hardly introduced when incredibly boring flashbacks begin for characters we know nothing about. Fine actors, Alan Arkin and Bill Paxton are wasted in this movie. One camper's observation that "everything seems so much less than I remember it" is repeated at least ten times, enough to make you twig. The expected pranks are neither fun nor original unless you think short plates are a real "howler". This movie was a big disappointment considering the great talent involved. "Indian Summer" didn't make me home, just sick. - NOTE
