And I mean ultra light. This movie features four giant stars, about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that. There really is not too much to say about this stink, except that although it has a few really good bits, most of it is not much fun. It also doesn't seem like a romance. What about a romantic comedy? Not on your life. Most of the dialogue is too flat to be sophisticated, much less entertaining. What is really ashame is the premise is not bad at all. This movie could have been so much more, especially with the recent focus on some of the fake ways in which movies are promoted, complete with false quotes from critics. The film reveals the unused territory of the press store - they all paid trips to journalists who almost always write good reviews. But instead of exploring what should have been a morsel of jokes, it spends about three minutes in this area and moves on in pursuit of the film's lame romance. The same with Catherine Zeta-Jones' character - the whinny, self-centered movie star. Zeta-Jones does a good job with what she gets, but she gets almost nothing. It's all homogenized junk that looks very pale to some of the things we've heard about stars over the years. Ultimately, it's hard to understand what made Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts, John Cusack and Billy Crystal sign aboard this convicted ship, sinking as an object of "The Love Boat." In fact, as the old joke goes, they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal. It would probably make a better story. So go ahead and tell us filmmakers, what do you have on these stars that made them appear in this?
