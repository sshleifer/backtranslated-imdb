The film is very long and unfortunately quite different from the novel. If you want to watch the movie, don't read the story first, as it will shock you. However, cinematography was ok and if you are someone who loves adventure genres exploring Africa, go to it. Functional notions are appropriate, but many important events that were present in the novel are omitted. In the novel, Sir Henry Curtis was looking for his missing brother rather than a lady looking for her father. Gagole was cunning and was killed in the cave, while here it turned out to be a good person who preferred to stay with the new king.
