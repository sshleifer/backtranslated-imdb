This is the biggest piece of crap ever. It seems that they spent more time, effort and money making the DVD deck than they did on the current movie. I really thought the DVD had been knocked out with someone's homemade porn until I recognized one of the front page actors. This movie looks like someone made it with a hundred dollars and a video camera, and they spent half of it on rats. The picture is clear, but along with the very unfortunate lighting, filmography, if you can call it, production, acting, if it is actually what they are doing and scripting if they had one, make this movie look worse than an old one porn. At least, the old porn has a point. This is just like that some PETA members came together and decided to make a truly disturbing, pointless PSA on animal rights and feelings. This is so not worth the money or the time. It has nothing in common with the actual BTK serial killer other than the name of the killer and of some of the victims. The people who made this movie should be happy that he is still not free or that he may have come after them just to screw this movie off so badly.
