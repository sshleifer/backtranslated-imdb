Ronald Reagan and a bunch of American soldiers in a North Korean POW camp. They are tortured ... We learn North Korean communists are bad people ... We learn the Americans beard is growing very slowly in torture times ... I tried to suppress it, but I finally blew out laughing at this movie. That was the scene when Mr Reagan comes from telling the Communists that he will be on their side. Then he asks for a bottle of brandy. Then he picks up a drunk companion, Dewey Martin, to get sulfur to cure Mr Martin's hangover. Of course, the North Korean Communist Guard is as stupid as they come. So the drunk distracts the guard while Reagan goes over to get something from a drawer next to a bunch of empty boxes. I'm sure he should have boxes; But of course, Reagan causes them to shake enough to reveal that they are empty. You must laugh! I think "Prisoner of War" will appeal mainly to family and friends of those who worked on it - otherwise it is wasted. <br /> <br /> * Prisoner of War (1954) Andrew Marton ~ Ronald Reagan, Steve Forrest, Dewey Martin
