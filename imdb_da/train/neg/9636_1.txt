This amazing waste of production money is cinematic evidence that the rich and famous can be as stupid and wasteful as politicians. From a foolish game of Tennessee Williams and directed (with a dead hand) by Joseph Losey and starring Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward - this project filmed in a spectacular cliff-top mountain island mansion in the Mediterranean must have been a safe fire winner, when it was presented to Universal in 1967. The result is so absurd and boring that it almost tolerates faith. Visually, the film is spectacular, but it is nature's power that has allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set. The screaming antics of a screaming Taylor, Burton's half-water walk, the luney dialogue, Noel Coward, laughing at himself, the ridiculous story and plot and the absurd costume, irritate the viewer. BOOM is a disgrace, a waste of money and talent and clear evidence that boasted famous people can be idiots like the rest of the planet's plebs. Not even fun. Just terrible and crazy shocking waste.
