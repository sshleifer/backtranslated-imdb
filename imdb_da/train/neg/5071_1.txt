I can't even believe this show lasted as long as it did. I think it's all part of the stupid down in America. Personally, as David Spade said, I liked this show better as it went according to its original title - "Seinfeld". What is most to me with this show, apart from the obvious, basic sense of "humor" and general smuttiness, is the pretentious way of episodes. Really good shows are still fun after many repetitive views, like "the one that Rob is being accidentally hypnotized", on the "Dick Van Dyke Show" or "the one where Lucy and Ethel work at the candy factory." In other words, it is an honor given to the viewers of large programs. The fact that the authors and producers of "Friends" would have the unmanned hubris in fact that the title episodes, even in such a way before anyone even had a chance to see it another time, speak not only mediocrity and the lack of original thinking from the said authors' side, but also of their seer's mind. <br /> <br /> You read some of these people's comments and can only come to the conclusion that they live in a Hallmark Card like Neverland, full of greeting card members. The true meaning of friendship? I want to be a friend? I want to live in Manhattan? Wake up. These people work in coffee shops and look for work as actors, but somehow they manage to live in $ 4000 / mo. apartments? Get real. All I have to say to those of us who want to move to Manhattan and live the idyllic New York life with your Rosses and Monicas, good luck with all that. That New York does not exist for anyone who makes less than a serious six-figure income. But good luck with all that, anyway. Now stop and pass Soma.
