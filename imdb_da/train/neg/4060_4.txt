CAT O'NINE TAILS (Il Gatto en Nove Code) <br /> <br /> Picture format: 2.35: 1 (Chromoscope) <br /> <br /> Audio format: Mono <br /> <br /> (35 mm and 70 mm release printer). A blind ex-journalist (Karl Malden) hears a chicory plot outside of a genetic research laboratory and later works with a fellow reporter (James Franciscus) to investigate a series of lab killings, unknowingly placing their own loved ones for the benefit of a psychopathic killer . <br /> <br /> Rushed into production following the unexpected worldwide success of his director debut THE BIRD WITH CRYSTAL PLUMAGE (1969), Dario Argento devised CAT O'NINE TAILS as a giallo thriller in the same vein as his predecessor , overwhelmingly famous Hollywood actor Karl Malden - fresh from his appearance in PATTON (1969) - and rising star Franciscus (The Valley of Gwangi). Unfortunately, the resulting movie - as the advertisements claimed, "nine times more exciting" than "Bird" - is a disappointing follow-up, impeccably photographed and stylishly done, but also plodding and aimless for general consumption. <br /> <br /> Malden and Franciscus are highly visible in sympathetic roles, and film photographer Enrico Menczer (THE DEAD ARE ALIVE) uses the broad chromoscope frame to convey the high-tech world where Argento's dark-skinned scenario unfolds, but the subplot involves Euro starlet Catherine Spaak (THE LIBERTINE) as Francis's romantic interest constitutes a little more than unnecessary padding. Highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-haired assassin in a crowded railway station (edited with slender assurance of cult film tribal Franco Fraticelli) and a nocturnal episode where Malden and Franciscus seek an important track within a rumbling grave and fall prey to the killer are incredible machinations . But in spite of these gleams of shine, the film changes silently from one scene to the next and gently sucks without ever boiling. It is not surprising that "Cat" could not imitate the rapid success of "Bird" when it was released in 1971. <br /> <br /> (English version)
