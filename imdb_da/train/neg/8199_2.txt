I'm sooo glad that I haven't spent money to go to the cinema on it :-). It's no more than compiling elements of few other classic titles like The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss, etc. Framed in some boring and meaningless scenario. I really can't figure out what was the purpose of creating this movie - it certainly has nothing new to offer in its history, which is also meaningless. In addition, there is nothing to see - the FXs look as if they were taken from a used store, you generally saw them all in other movies. But it's certainly a good lullaby.
