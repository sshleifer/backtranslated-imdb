The problem I find with this title is that I am not sure if the instructor is trying to produce a documentary or film. A mix of the two genres just doesn't work and it leaves it all in the middle of nothing. It is more like the director has chosen the most extreme of what is going to happen around our everyday life, which makes it a compelling documentary. If it is supposed to be a thriller / drama, this is too boring and monotonous. In either case, what is the moral or message that the director is trying to convey to the audience? That there are people around us who dislike others who are willing to be treated badly? That there are many crazy lunatics around us? So .......... so what?
