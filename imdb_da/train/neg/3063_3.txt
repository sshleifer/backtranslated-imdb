Images that usually glorify a hero are important. For example, Bonnie and Clyde are looking at the dynamic bank robbers and you actually felt sympathy for them despite their evil deeds. Why? They were two people caught in the depression when people were desperate to survive. <br /> <br /> This movie has absolutely no substance. The Viggo Mortensen character soon appears as a popular hero. Why? He moves along an Idaho highway on his way to the hospital, where his hit wife has taken. No one has difficulty understanding why he is trying to escape everyone. Even worse, when the realization becomes clear that he is not a red neck terrorist, nobody in the government wants to help him as they try to save their rear ends. Jason Priestley co-stars as a radio emcee based on the story in support of our hero. The end is incredible.
