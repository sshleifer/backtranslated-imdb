There is a high expectation level when you sit down to watch a comedy with a roll of Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Ray Walston and Werner Klemperer. These expectations are further raised when the film is controlled by Stanley Donen, whose comic touch was so evident in, among other things, DAMN YANKEES !, BEDAZZLED and CHARADE. For the first five minutes, it seems that these expectations can be met, and so? Nothing. What should be a light comedy, falls into the leather, heavy hand melodrama, with nary a chuckle to be had. <br /> <br /> Relative newcomer Suzy Parker has often been criticized for her performance, or lack of one, in this movie, but in a movie where even the great Cary Grant often appears flat and wood, the attack seems unfair . Not so bright could a light like Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day have changed the succeeding, tedious and completely meaningless script that pulls together for a long time and draws the viewer's interest and patience with it. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, especially Ray Walston, continues to attempt to breathe some life into the case, but the horrible script is beyond revival. The desperate, ineffective effort to draw a half-hearted laugh from the numb public at the last moments of the movie only serves to add insult to injury. <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing but a big disappointment at all levels.
