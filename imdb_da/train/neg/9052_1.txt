I respect the fact that this is a very popular show. But compared to Robert Altman's ingenious, hilarious, zany and groundbreaking 1970s movie classic, this show was probably destined to be less than mediocre ... even though it runs for 11 years, it doesn't necessarily make it good. This show was an overly integral part of my early childhood (it was going on again every night and guessing if parents looked at it and laughed it up), but it's one of the memories I don't miss. And now that I actually watched the movie, I can give this series an exact criticism. On its own, it's not nearly "2 out of 10" bad. However, the characters on this show are nothing like those in the movie. Some of them are technically the same, but they only have the same name. For example, since when is Alan Alda something like Donald Sutherland? His humor is completely different, like his characterization and outlook. The new characters are not that big; they only serve to make you miss those they replace. It's the same with the new actors (including Jamie Farr). The only thing that actually transfers to the series is Radar, which is still (although the same actor plays) just a pale imitation of the original. What else? Oh yeah. With a laugh track (it didn't matter if it was used in surgical scenes or not), it comes across as creepy because of what's happening in the other settings. And because it lasted almost four times longer than the actual Korean war, it takes viewers in this bizarre time-trial that does not work outside the comic world. I never wanted this show, and I will never.
