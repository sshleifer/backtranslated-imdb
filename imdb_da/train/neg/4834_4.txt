I was looking forward to Kathryn Bigelow's movie with great anticipation for the endless hype and 6 Oscars it was awarded. Unfortunately, it's really not a good movie. The depiction of the situation certainly seemed accurate and credible at all points, but besides that, the story was just as incomplete, and the direction of the film seemed to be uncertain and random. The actors made a good effort, but for me I didn't really get what the movie was trying to be. It's not as atmospheric and gripping as the Full Metal Jacket, not as epic as the Band of Brothers, not as action packed as ... well, anything. I certainly can't see why it was nominated for so much, nor why people "hyped it" to these epic proportions. Mind you, considering the caliber of movies in the last few years, I suppose there is not much to choose from.
