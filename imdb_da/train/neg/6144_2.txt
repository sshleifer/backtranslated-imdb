Ironically, though he can do "splits", Thomas is a completely stiff as an actor. <br /> <br /> This movie is seared in my memory as one of the most side-cutting cheeses and incompetent movies I've ever seen. As such, I actually love it. <br /> <br /> But the only reason it's more than a star is that Thomas is in good shape and it's fun to see his little muscular body performing various types of gymnastics skills on the oddly shaped rocks and poles scattered around the eastern European side (including the infamous "pommel horse" shaped well cap in the middle of a square that Thomas uses to plant his feet in the faces of various crazy villagers). But let the poor guy open his mouth and try to emote, and any illusion that he might have a movie career immediately beats. <br /> <br /> At least Thomas had the excuse that he wasn't an actor. Everyone else in the film - actors, instructors, editors, cameras, etc. Are at least as bad, or worse, and most are professionals. So Kurt doesn't quite come out as you might think. <br /> <br /> I hope poor Kurt took the money and ran. If anyone ever asks him to appear in a martial arts movie again, I bet Thomas kicks the guy in the face.
