JESSICA: A GHOST STORY is, as the name implies, a ghost story. The theme is supposed to be horror, but comes closer to comedy! <br /> <br /> A woman who was brutally murdered comes back from the dead. This is what this film is trying to pass as a plot. There really is nothing more to it. The film consists of a series of loosely connected scenes involving a guy who had an affair with this woman before her death. <br /> <br /> Immediately from the opening scene, this movie has the look of a "straight-to-DVD" action. Unlike pearls like VACANCY 2, the film has no direction for creativity and certainly gives "straight-to-DVD" movies a bad name! The direction is as bad as can be with a complete lack of tension, frightening or tension. Even the drama elements are dealt with hopelessly and represent something more boring than even the worst soap opera, you may have had the misfortune of being persistent. The action across the board is absolutely scary, without an actor involving managing to show even the smallest potential in a successful play. <br /> <br /> Many of the scenes are incredibly long, with very long breaks between dialogue exchanges. I'm not exaggerating! <br /> <br /> The only reason I give this movie a rating of 2 instead of 1 is because some of the poor trades combined with even worse dialogue made for a couple of unintentional laughs. I emphasize the word "get" in this sentence. This is not generally one of the "so bad-it's-good" films like CAMP BLOOD or THE NAIL GUN MASSACRE. If you want to laugh hysterically, watch the movies. If you want to watch a real horror movie about ghosts, see LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, CHANGE, RINGU, EYE (original Korean version), GRUDGE, ONE MISSED CALL or PHONE. <br /> <br /> I advise anyone who has been lucky enough to avoid seeing JESSICA: A GHOST STORY to stop the good work! Just forget this movie exists. Don't save a thought for it!
