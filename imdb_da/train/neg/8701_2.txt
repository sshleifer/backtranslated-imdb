This is probably one of the worst "will be low budget hit movies" to credit the dinosaur genre. The movie is so predictable that you can walk away, cook yourself dinner, answer the phone or whatever, and when you are back, you know exactly what has happened. The special effects are so bad you would have thought Lego bricks were used, and the "super fast" dinosaurs were so tame that it makes a pet dog look like a super predator. The action is overcooked. They try so hard, but there are just not enough signs behind them to get into the characters and for the researcher ... Well okay, we know exactly what to do with the blonde chick in glasses. Stereotypic was created for movies like this. If you want to watch this movie, I suggest you are not in a serious mood when the cast and crew were of course. And if you really are into dinosaurs and know everything in the world about them, don't take it, you can break the screen - the facts are so far away.
