Although I never like to be the kind of person who negates a person's personal taste; If you like something, it's fine But this movie was horrible and there is no way around it. I don't like Ani Difranco too much, but she is a great guitarist and songwriter I can admit. But I can't admit there are any redeeming qualities for this movie. Many people assume that this is a precise portrayal of problems faced by high school students. Maybe, but everything is taken too far. There seems to be an attempt at a "Naked Gun" - esque kind of comedy, but the timing is off; There is too much space between each actor line, as if they hold on to laughter (there was no one). The one who wrote the script was everywhere. They tried to collapse so many controversial issues together into a movie, almost never completely developing any of them (especially the girl being impregnated by a teacher). I didn't even laugh at all this movie. I was too offended by this attempt at humor and satire to do anything but roll my eyes on the screen.
