The direction had clearly emphasized that this film's idea and plot is completely original .... But for those who have read 'slam dunk' comics, we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even some jokes ... <br / > <br /> Another note is Jay Chow himself Don't know Kung Fu, it just won't impress anyone if he's trying to act as he can, many people today can see the differences. Fortunately, the movie does not contain much of KunG Fu's fighting and much spoiled by stunners and visual effects ... I think Jay's play is still a pain to watch, especially when almost everyone else in the movie is so much better. The only reason I think why Jay is the main actor is simply for his popularity. <br /> <br /> Despite how hard I want to stop anyone from watching this, making this "original" movie get it, it shouldn't have become one of the best budget movies in China for this year.
