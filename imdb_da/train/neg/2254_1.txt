Okay, people, honestly ... this must be one of the worst movies about show biz ever made, but I've been laughing myself stupid (which may be why I enjoyed it). Basically, it's about sex, sex and a way to get your own personal 15 minute fame. Did I mention that sex was a big problem in this movie? If you have a thing that goes for bizzzzare characters and easy entertainment, watch this movie when you get the chance (and have nothing better to do). <br /> <br /> *** Attention spoilers !!! *** The funniest thing in the movie was the guy who asked Jerry if he could marry his goat (!) On the show and flash his wallet with his love's pictures. A triple A for bad taste and fun!
