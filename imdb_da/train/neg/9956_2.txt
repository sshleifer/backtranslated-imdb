I made a special effort to watch this movie and was totally disappointed with the result. On paper, the writing seems hopeless, and the choice of actors leaves one with hope. I liked Pacino in the scent of a woman and have seen Anny Duperrey and Marthe Keller in several French and other films from the 70s / 80s. But I had forgotten how important some dialogues can play in a movie, and in this movie are the absolute ..... trash can! Filming sites were also attractive, but the hopeless, pretentious, and forced dialogues dragged the whole thing down to underneath. In addition, I'm pretty allergic to the world of motor sports and find no interest in this sport. Even the inelegant dialogues in "Love Story" were better than those in this movie (and that says something !!). I really expected better from this movie and was very disappointed to have been disappointed so much.
