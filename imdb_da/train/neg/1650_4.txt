Four best friends young male chauvinist pigs (with emphasis on pigs) meet weekly at a NYC dinner to tell their dating sexploits in this misanthropic and visceral comedy. Peet is the common denominator dating the three bachelors in the group leading to conflict and the inevitable "whipping". Although the premise of the film has potential and there are some fun moments to have, the girl generally does not work at the very end when the girls are made so they do not appear better than the boys who run counter to the core of history. One of these one-man band flixes with a dozen producers, "Whipped" is likely to be enjoyed only by the kind of young men who believe "The Man Show" is Emmy material.
