This movie is so bad it hurts. The car makes 30 mph when it has to go 100 ... the shift handle stuck (in the Park!), The nurse running for almost 2 hours with the cell phone on his shoulder ... can't take any of the 2 morons to this damn telephone? There is nothing credible in this crap. I was ashamed to be seen in a movie like this!
