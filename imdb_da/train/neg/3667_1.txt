Opening the scene 'explains' why Hurt is later 'immune' to 'contaminated man'. It's too bad, it doesn't explain anything else: How did he get what he caught? / What was it / why does it work so fast. Then we go to "Present Day Budapest". OK, was the opener in the past or in the future? It turns out to be the past, of course, but in a moment it seems just as likely to be the nd of the movie moved to the beginning. Sorry, I should have read closer attention, huh? Or maybe it's just badly done. So much confusion about the different jobs he had in related fields, and finally a mention of how he should have died from the original experiment he did on him. Aha! So when and the private industry came together to poison one of their best men to see the effects? He must have been one of the top guys he is friends with the chemical company for God's sake. Then the drug itself is: Technically a poison, but it mutates into immune "carriers" so we can have what we want; a poison, a disease, an allergic reaction, all very different things in real life. Magically it is not contagious from one dying victim to another, only from the carrier. How practical. Then there is the m a sa protocol: They jump into a situation without having any idea what is in the store or how to prepare for it. Have the producers not had enough money to show a proper dishwashing after the crew just left the scene for a deadly unknown substance? I kept thinking that Hurt was going to die from poor clean-up technology, and the open scene would turn out to be closer.
