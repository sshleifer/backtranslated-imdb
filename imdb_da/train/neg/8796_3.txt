Average viewers looking for any sense of internal coherence in a movie should probably give this a pass. It produces the same feeling as staring at a curious selection of individual images that seem to have some relationship with each other, but never gather in totality. Although this isolative approach to creating a kind of cinematic montage can appeal to a few students or critics imbued with modern cinema's inner language, it is flat annoying and discouraging to us commonplace who just fell off the pram. An obvious avoidance of accessibility may be the intentional feature of authors such as Kar-wai Wong and Tarantino, but for me it comes when Andy Warhol warms up. The only redeeming characteristic I find is in the production values ​​and those who just don't want to cut it all by themselves. <br /> <br /> This is one of the productions where you watch and listen and wait with fear and in vain for some clever development of an idea or mindset to maintain all the remarkable and beautiful individual scenes. Pardon. The calligraphic credits unexpectedly begin to roll just as your interest begins to stir. I get the same big gaping and reading reading, what I think is very knowledgeable and thorough commenting on this movie that never leads to anything really understandable. Ideas and pictures without any external context are not my idea of ​​fun. <br /> <br /> Call me a philistine roaming on the streets of Hong Kong looking for a bowl of chop suey. <br /> <br />
