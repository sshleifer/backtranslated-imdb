I have to say that there is nothing wrong with low budget films, so it was not my problem with that. My problem with that is that I felt I saw my next door neighbor's home video. IMO everything about it just seemed like a guy wrote a quick story, grabbed a camera and started shooting. I understand how difficult this is to do effectively, but when I pay to rent a movie, I expect to see a kind of professionally made movie. John Schneider has a great resume, is a great actor, and was fine in this movie. The other people in it were not. I understand how fun, and cheaper, to use friends and family members to throw, but that doesn't make it convincing to act. It seemed like it was shot, he was trying to give many of the scenes a more interesting look, but when writing, plot and acting are initially there, that type of style is not necessary and it is a distraction. <br /> <br /> Also, on a technical level, digital artifacts were everywhere. In the first scene of all these fine cars, as they did a slow scan of them, they seemed to move back and forth just a little. The problem is not in my imaging equipment (Benq PE-8700 84 "diagonal") but somewhere in the production. I have never seen that kind of artifact in a professionally made movie before. So it sounds, they didn't do any voice-overs, which can be ok unless it sounded like the track in this movie, it sounded like the built-in microphone on the camera.
