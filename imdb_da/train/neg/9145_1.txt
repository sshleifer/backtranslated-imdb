Let me first say that I enjoy watching "bad" movies. It's funny how some of these movies leave more of a lasting impression than the truly amazing ones. This movie is bad in a disturbingly harmful way. This vehicle for Sam Mraovich's misleading ego borders not only on talented incessancy, but has redefined the very meaning of the word. This should always be the barometer of bad movies. Sort of Mendoza line for movies. Mr. Mraovich writes, governs and stars as a mute object Arthur Sailes fights horrified wives and evil Christian forces as he and his partner Ben "died behind the eyes" Sheet's struggle for marital equality. As a libertarian, I think homosexuals should have the right to get married. Ben & Arthur do more damage for that reason than an army of homophobes. The depiction of all things, Christians are so ugly and ham-fisted, trademark Mraovich, that you cannot take any of them seriously. Arthur's brother Victor, the Bible who attributes Jesus freak, is so horribly over-the-top malicious / gay that you wonder how he was cast into this role. That's because Sam "multitasking" Mraovich was also the casting director. The worst of it all is Sam Mraovich himself. When you think of leading man, the words pasty, balding and cubby come to mind? Sam also delivers lines like domino pizza, cold and usually wrong. The final counter: You suck by writing, controlling, performing and casting. It is Ed Wood quadruple. Congratulations on your horrible little man.
