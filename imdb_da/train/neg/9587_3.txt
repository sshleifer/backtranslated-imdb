Recreation from the 1950s (London) Soho and the up-and-coming people. Based on a cool novel. <br /> <br /> Julian Temple is a video director. No more, no less. Give him $ 15 million and he'll make you a $ 15 million pop video. Here he forgets that two minutes of people who can't really work are one thing - but two hours? What was he thinking about? Besides who is the audience? Who cares about a book that was well-remembered road-back-when. The usual London story of the chances takes its chance. <br /> <br /> What could really pull this movie down further? Oh I know, third song songs that sound like they were made on the spot. David Bowie's crones movie title over and over a few times and that's the highlight. The soundtrack album is clay pigeon material. <br /> <br /> There is, however, a good thing. Good recreation of the Soho period. Shame they couldn't think of anything to put in front of it.
