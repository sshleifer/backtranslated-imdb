I couldn't see more than 14 minutes of it. It's a great combination of really bad acting and really bad instruction. The shots used are disgusting, the broken 180 degree angle all the time. My head hurts to see the burden of "you know what". Dirt on the "mystery machine" window makes you see light from the lights on the windows ... annoying. What's more ... it's so badly framed all the time, it's just that you want to scream at the lady who directs there. I only instructed short films, but I'm pretty sure I would be better than the one who heads a feature film .... the story is incredible, just the long French kissing scene in the beginning tells you it's going to be pretty awful. So pretty much, try to avoid this really bad movie at all costs, it will save you 5 bucks or so for the rent, and that 1h30 hours in your life you will never come back ...
