Not that I don't like children's movies, but it was a tower chopper with few redeeming qualities. MJ Fox was the perfect voice for Stuart and the rest of the talent was wasted. Hugh Laurie can be incredibly fun, but doesn't get the chance in this movie. It is sugar-coated sugar and would hardly appeal to anyone over the age of 7. See Toy Story, Monsters Inc. or Shrek instead. 3.10
