I love a good juicy love story (and I'm a guy), but when I rented "Love Story" I asked for the ending to come as fast and painlessly as possible and just opposite to Ali McGraw's character. <br /> Ali McGraw as Jenny alienated and annoyed the heel out of me within the first 15 minutes. When we learn that she has been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, I couldn't help wondering if her death would be such a terrible loss to poor Oliver, or if anyone watching this movie would even like it. If she did not die her lattice personality would probably have pushed Oliver over the edge and eventually landed them in the divorce court. People love this movie, but it's one of the worst of the 70s.
