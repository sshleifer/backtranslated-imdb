I usually check out the MTV movie prizes to see a witty, entertaining show that delivers a unique showcase program (Chewbacca wins a lifetime prize as an example). So this year it was no different. While I'm not a fan of Justin Timberlake, Seann William Scott has always been fun-albit stupid to me. I've been laughing at Stiffler in both American Pie movies, and even enjoyed him in Dude Where's My Car? But the MTV movie award was simply horrible. Nothing was coherent, humorous or entertaining. Justin Timberlake should stick to singing and dancing; He is sure that hell cannot act. <br /> <br /> I'm curious about who the authors were for this show. Last year's performance by Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar was extremely fun (the rings' parody alone was worth seeing the whole show), but this year was completely different. Did anyone understand Timberlake's comments regarding Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson ("They are staring in a movie together but have never met! Here they are ...") Where was the joke? Kate and Luke went straight into their lame dialogue without referring to "joke" by Timberlake. And Seann was completely wasted as a talent, not even making me smile, yet laughing alone. And what was the meaning of Harrison Ford's one-sided lines? Did they make any sense to anyone? Maybe MTV authors figured out that young viewers would only know the aging Ford like Han Solo, Indiania Jones or Air Force One president. I'm confused. And will anyone tell me the deal with Adrian Brody? How old is this guy and how old does he think he is? The guy looks 30 and tries to act 19 again. Give it up, show some class (as in your best actress academy prize) and be your age! <br /> <br /> I give this show 1 star out of 4, simply because of Gollam's speech for best visual performance. This was very creative, extremely well done and caused the only real laugh of the whole evening.
