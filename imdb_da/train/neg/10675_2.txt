You have to expect that when the star's name is entered incorrectly in the opening credit, you are not in good time (the credit reads "Cuba Gooding, J.R."). Some good car chases, shoot them up, blow them up, if ALL you want is action, because the relationship to that plot exists in the best way and absolutely incredible. The characters of the characters, especially Goodings are at the end, worse than incredible, they are irrational when they are not hopelessly confused. All I can think of is that Andy Cheng must be a great guy to get this many good actors to this foul a project (he can't have anything on them, can he?).
