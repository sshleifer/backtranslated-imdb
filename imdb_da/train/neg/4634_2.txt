Of course, some talent attached, Maria Bello is always fantastic. But it is just a boring waste of time that shows every character a person is being mocked and exploited to make a movie out of an "interesting" story. Well, I hope they get it out of their systems. Unfortunately for the public, there is no insight, no sensitivity, no coherence and truly no humanity. as everyone would be fine, unless it has no humor, no horror, no context and nothing constructive to say about the story it is trying to tell. bad things happen, you sit and see it, you don't care, so what? 99% of the time, the words "based on a true story" constitute an accidental warning to the audience. This means that the director and scriptwriter are lazy and fascinated by some events they heard about somewhere, so they just throw them up on the screen and expect the story's "true" character to make the audience feel something without the filmmakers who must do some work. I hope they are happy to make this movie. It stinks on ice.
