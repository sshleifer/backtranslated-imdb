Starts really well, good introduction and construction of the main characters, but after approx. 5 minutes the charm is lost. The character is in the same form as the main character from American Pie and Loser without a cast or innovative story that made the PIE films more commercial success. Let's be honest - Honor's plays were pretty bad. Keaton, Daniels and Faris did their best but had no significant plot or script to get their teeth in. The movie just goes without pace or clear logical story that justifies its length. The end is about as predictable as they come - so predictably I have crossed the spoilers box to this one line. <br /> <br /> My advice: Avoid at all costs unless you really have anything else to do / listen to or see and even so you will feel the producers just cheated you out of an hour and a half in your life.
