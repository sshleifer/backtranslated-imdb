This is a very silly and slightly watched movie about slavery in the West Indies and it stars Puddy from the "Seinfeld" show! Patrick Warburton made his film debut in this concert film, and he is noticeably slimmer here. Oliver Reed got top billing, but he is hardly in the movie at all. Warburton plays a white slave and it is fun to see all the young and cunning wives of rich old men bidding on him because they all want sex with him. Eartha Kitt plays an owner of bordello and they are so much nudity in the movie. If there are no drunk orgies on bordello then the young wives who have them are with him. So of course towards the end, the slaves lift up and there is the bloody standoff. No real political message like the movie "Burn" but just another constructed plot unit to move the story together. Amazingly they made a sequel and Warburton and the rest of the throw came back! I hope they paid a lot of dough because the first movie is pretty bad. The nudity keeps it in view and Warburton's lack of accent sometimes makes it ridiculous. Very bad movie, but I have to admit that I want to see the sequel.
