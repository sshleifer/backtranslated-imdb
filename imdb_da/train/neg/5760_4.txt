Well ... I had to wait until it came out on video to see it, and I wish I had, I actually caught scary movie 2 on cable the other day, and it made me yearn for more of the same, what I was flying plane at CRACK ... I mean, if you like airplanes or other Leslie Nielsen vehicles, then you will probably be in heaven, but if you usually use WAYANS COMEDY then you will be disappointed that was much more Eye candy in this one that will keep young hormone raged teenage boys happy, which is probably why it was a box office hit the first week it came out. I enjoyed scary movies 2 times more than this feed, and shared a 5 times as much. Strange that the better of 3 is part 2, but then again I have always seen Halloween 2 better than the original too. Maybe it's just me. The funniest part of the movie should be the way foreigners say goodbye. But it wasn't worth the $ 11 I used to catch a matinee of this with my fiance. Save yourself money and take part 2 again on cable until it is released on Video tape and then rent it, don't buy it.
