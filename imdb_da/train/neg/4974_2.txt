May the Saints preserve us because this movie does not help. <br /> <br /> Anyone with access must email Mel Gibson and tell him we need a faithful production of Beowulf. Something that actually has something in common with the epic poem, which is the foundation of all modern Western literature. <br /> <br /> The latest (since 2000) versions of Beowulf make us wonder about two things. First, why is there so much interest in history. Second, why are all these filmmakers wasted mountains with cash on this crap. The only reason it became two is that the version with Lambert in it (Beowulf 2000) was worse and needed 1. <br /> <br /> What's even worse, some people will see this and get it wrong idea of ​​the poem. How can an industry where Peter Jackson gets a literary conversion to movies so right can get it wrong. I really think the Roman Forum as a model for Heorot is too much. <br /> <br /> WHY, Horn on helmets? Save me. This is insulting. <br /> <br /> / hmm
