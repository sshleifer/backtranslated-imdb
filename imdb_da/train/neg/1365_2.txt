The concept of the legal gray area in love crimes contributes to about 10% of the film's appeal; the other 90% can be attributed to the fluttering bad-ness. To say that Sean Young's performance as a so-called district attorney is wood is a gross understatement. With her gentle suits and excess hair gel, Young does a decent job of convincing the audience of her devoted hatred of men. Why else would she ask her only friend to be a prostitute just as she can arrest the police trying to pick them up? This hatred is also the only reason she relentlessly pursues a perverted photographer who gives women a conscientious excitement and the driving force behind this crappy movie. Seeing young go from frigid to full frontal nudity does little to increase interest, but the temper tantrum she throws standing beside a fire by a lake does. Looking at her rant and rave about her self-suffering and sexual frustration makes Love Crimes worth the rent, but it's all downhill to and from. Despite her desire to bring Patrick Bergin's character to justice, her police skills completely escaped her in a row by her own tired lust and passion. Patrick Bergin does a decent enough job as a slimy sociopath; if it worked in sleeping with the enemy it probably as hell can work on this. But I can't do without, but if the noticeable lack of energy Young brings to the movie is in conflict with his slimness. I guess it does, and the result is a "thriller" with tensions that are thoroughly bad and yet comical.
