Follow the same path as most followers. First was great. The second was average, and this one, full of bad acting and a stupid dialogue, and well like a lot of suspension of disbelief, was this movie weak. <br /> <br /> For predictable, I just couldn't stand that Henry Wrinkler-like boss with that stupid eye, there was so much more they could have done with this. I liked the first lot. I wish they would have gone more in these lines than in what they did here. <br /> <br /> It was too much inexplicable to explain what time period was in and why is there an old-fashioned phone in that room? <br /> <br /> I understand there is another in the works. <br /> <br /> Blah!
