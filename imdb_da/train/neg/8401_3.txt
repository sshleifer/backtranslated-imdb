I've just seen this on TMC, it's new in my mind. It is obvious that while stooges are with stars, they do not really run the show. First, they are divided into 2 groups - Moe, as "Shorty" and Larry and Curly as a few vagrants, so there are not so many full teamwork. The love story that burns the plot is uninteresting, the two ladies are the only ones with any plays, there is another group of musical stooges that are unfunny, unless you consider their attempts to be fun to be sadly buffoonish. The music is tiring, they drive cars to the ranch and then depend on horses, the dorky western wear is stupid, and there is a horrible mass of the movie without stooges on the camera. By the way, of course, after Curley's first blow, his reduced energy level is clear. Vernon Dent appears early in an unredited role. I loved everything these guys ever did, including all the non-Curley stuff, but this little dogie is pretty miserable.
