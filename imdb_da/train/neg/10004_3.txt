"It seems that many critics find the idea of ​​a Woody Allen drama uncomfortable." And for good reason: they are tireless wood and pretentious imitations of Bergman. And let's not break ourselves: critics were mostly supportive of Allen's Bergman pretensions, Allen's mocking accusations on the contrary. What I don't get is this: Why was Allen generally applauded for his originality in the imitation of Bergman, but the contemporary Brian DePalma was ruled out to "rip off" Hitchcock in his thrill movies? In Robin Wood's view, it is a strange form of cultural snobbery. I would agree.
