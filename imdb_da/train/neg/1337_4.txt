Yes, you guessed it. Another movie where identical twins change places. I now think that Olsen twins are getting older, they should try to make the plot less predictable and less like bypasses of 'Full House'. If you plan to watch this movie, don't. See 'The Parent Trap' instead. It's more entertaining.
