I have read all the love comments. Knowing that movies cannot use all aspects of the book, but generally have at least the main point of the book. I was very disappointed with this movie. The only thing they have in this movie, which is in the book, is that Missy's father comes to visit (both books come in the book). That's all. The story line was so angry and far-fetched and yes, sorry, from the book that I just couldn't enjoy it. Although I didn't read the book, it was too sad. I know the Pioneer life was rough, but the whole movie was a downer. The assessment is to have the same family orientation of the movie that makes them great.
