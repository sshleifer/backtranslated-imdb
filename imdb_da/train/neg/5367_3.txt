I've seen every episode of this spin off. I thought the first season was a decent effort given the expectations to follow such success as Grey's Anatomy. Thus, I have continued to see. I'm afraid the second season lacks the charm, chemistry and more important drama of it's predecessor Grey's Anatomy. The conditions seem constructed and the play is uneven. Scripture lacks intelligence and comic tips in GA. It has been shown that a formal but does not feel formal and constructed, but unfortunately PP is not so. I loved Kate Walsh's presence in GA. I'm afraid Kate Walsh's life in LA is simply not interesting.
