Vovochka is your daily hooligan vs. authority movie. Vovochka, the protagonist, is felt early on as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood. With the words of wisdom from a few adults, he encounters along the way, and he finds it difficult to change his evil ways. Personally, I found an actor who played Vovochka too annoying to sympathize with, but the change of tone in the movie would make it possible to feel the emotional struggle Vovochka has when he wants to be good, but bad things happen. This fight makes the movie a little different than other movies of the same genre, it's the little taste I meant. All in all, I don't really care about this movie, even though it was most likely aimed at a younger audience.
