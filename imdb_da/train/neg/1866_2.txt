An inexpensive film about a mother is searching for her daughter who has been kidnapped by people who make snuff movies. The trail leads her mother across Europe as she searches for her child, and we in the audience are struggling to stay asleep. <br /> <br /> This is one of the myriad soft-core sleaze movies made for people who want the thrill of porn with the stigma or danger of showing up on their credit card bill. Personally, I'd rather have the stigma as the movies are more interesting and honest about what we see. This is supposed to be a sexy thriller, but it is not. Mostly, its people talk about things followed by lots of going from place to place and lead to lead. Probably through the film, different people are undressed and everything has more than one touch of S&M to the case. The violence and fetish material is of the kind provoking laughter rather than horror or even excitement, it's all so incredibly false. Worse, there is not even enough nudity to keep it interesting. (Basically the course for many of these films) You will forgive my lack of detail, but it is simply a boring boring movie that I continued to end and hoped for something externally wise to occur, but nothing was . The most interesting thing was the blonde hairy scrub with the huge overbite and nose size of a Buick. I saw her with morbid fascination and wondered what she had looked like a young girl and wondered if she had had plastic surgery, not the type of thing you should think about in a gripping thriller. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
