I was so eager to see this one of my favorite TV shows. I saw the Universal trademark followed by a recently known title and theme song that still impresses me. Computer animation on some scenes as a solid title name "The Jetsons" or a dimension view of a spaceship approaching an amusement park and more made this version beautiful and stunning. Shortly after that to the end ... I couldn't believe my eyes !!!! How lucky I was to be able to forget everything I had seen. Only songs by Tiffany and its theme song in new arrangement were in my head. Still, I want to see this family in the family (also The Flintstones and Yogi Bear) in all graphic computer design like Toy story or Bug's life.The best style for Hanna-Barbera is in my opinion.
