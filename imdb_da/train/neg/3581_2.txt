I have not been able to decide whether this film is so bad, it is good, or to quote Enid Coleslaw, "so bad it has gone well and back to bad again." No matter, I forced myself to look much the same as a pile of strange colored vomiting, and it gives up a number of scenes that you will not forget even if you want to. There is an insidious young Ray Liotta who tells a pigtailed Pia that her creative writing trophy resembles a penis. A little later, Ray again smuggles Pia, not with the appropriately shaped trophy, but a garden hose. There is a firm chinned Pia who tells her dominant mother that she wants to go to bed with Ray's geezer father, Walter. There is the actress in the cemetery scene who gives the best line ever written by Pia or anyone else: "WWWWHHHYYYYYYY!" There is this garden hose again when Walter waves the Pia face and roars "Is this more to your liking??" There is Pia and her date is then lit by close-ups of each other's masticating salad that they start tearing each other's clothes away. There is Pia shower, but forget to remove the dress. Perhaps best of all is Pia's typewriter, but instead of keys, there are the miniature talking heads of those who have tormented her the most (afterwards I was afraid to open my laptop). And finally, there is Pia at "The Awards" who exposes Hollywood to the cesspool, it spits out the second best line ever, "I think I'm not the only one who has ever had to go to the top." I see, I have already spent more time commenting on "The Lonely Lady" than I have on much better pictures so I will stop. However, be aware that as you begin to see you, you will probably not be able to take your eyes off the screen until two hours in your life have disappeared forever.
