I had the obvious misfortune to get hold of two of 2004's worst movies back to back this morning: first, the incoherent CGI-powered emptiness of The Chronicles of Riddick, and then the embarrassing vanity project known as Greendale. One costs multimillions and the other costs pennies, but they are both bad. Really, really bad. <br /> <br /> In front of me, I am not the world's largest Neil Young fan, but he has contributed his share of classic melodies: from Buffalo Springfield (whose best footage was Young Compositions) to Rust Never Sleeps, Harvest and Mirror Ball, the man has written some really good songs. Unfortunately, there are no good songs in Greendale, and precious few good ones, and the movie they are built for is really cringeworthy and simplistic political slogan. Without profit as art and unimpressive as polemic, Greendale is best left forgotten. Buy the book if you feel compelled to contribute to Young's bank account.
