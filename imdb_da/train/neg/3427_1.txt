This must have been embarrassed by every member of the African-American cast. Any derogatory, deviant stereotype of the black American society is highlighted prominently. I will not reinforce the insults by noting them here, except to mention chickens, watermelons and cube. A good song by Ethel Waters (and a few bad ones) and the amazing song and dancing talents of 8-year-old Sammy Davis brings the sum to something below 1 on the IMDb scale.
