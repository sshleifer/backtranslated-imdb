This juvenile gentle girl is strictly for teenagers in ancient human bodies, desperate to revive their hormonally challenged teenage years. How ? By burning up gas and comparing a quick, ruthless car (or plane) with freedom. The plot borrowed heavily from Mister Rogers' neighborhood (if it was my oil conglomerate) and Logans Run (if it was heavily sedated and lacked a clear state of mind). Starring Lee Majors and Burgess Meredith this movie is set in a post-gas crisis world where an almighty government doesn't want you to (* ahem *) drive your car and burn gas. Sort of opposite of today's Enron and Bush, oil-influencing, SUV pushing government. <br /> <br /> This compilation alone makes the movie ridiculous. But wait ... there's more. Although the film is set in the future, we are not showing signs of future technology, in addition to a return to bicycles, golf carts and horses. You want to believe that the future looks ... just like today. Same clothes, same suburban houses, same green lawns as today and when the film was made. There are no solar panels, no windmills, no concessions to alternative energy. The action is flat and tasteless. Even scenes that could have been gritty or moving, buddy, honor, romance, horror ... all fall flatter than a paperdoll under a briefcase. The continuity is missing - the jet-fly of Burgess Meredith's character changes colors and configuration from moment to moment, as filmmakers offend our intelligence with unmatched stock footage over and over again. The plot is as moronic and only half as exciting as a Dukes of Hazzard episode. Even deadly car movie and SF fans should avoid this movie as a monthly roadkill unless you enjoy hip Exxon leaders trying to make a movie as empty as the hero's tank.
