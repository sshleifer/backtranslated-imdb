OK I caught this movie halfway through, but.oh.dear.god.it.sounds.like.they're.all.reading.from.scripts. <br /> <br /> Especially the guy who is now in teachers and the book group, though at least he has proven that he can act if he wants to! (The part where someone has a heart attack, stands out as a bastion of bad film that does both in the form of acting, scripting and general plausibility) it clearly seems to be a deposit on human traffic, but while it is not the best movie ever, it is at least original and had actors whose delivery did not resemble that of serious but hopeless GCSE students trying to get a passing grade. Not as much as human traffic as a bit of a car accident!
