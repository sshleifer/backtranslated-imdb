Having seen only half of the movie in school back in November, I saw today that it was on the Flix channel and decided to watch it to see the rest of it and write a new review on it. <br /> <br /> The book on which the movie is based, Hatchet, is ok. This is a terrible adaptation to it. <br /> <br /> Awful (and I think horrible) acting, poor dialogue and average films make this awful adaptation of the Hatchet. <br /> <br /> The movie starts Brian, the cliché of a late 80s teenager (sporting a mullet, breaking his head to cheap 80s rock music) and his mother driving in a car for him to get on a plane to fly up to see his alienated father (his parents divorced ... now cue the dramatic break.) Now Brian is having farewell to mom and dog and flying up to see his father. The pilot is a fat, ugly, rude man (was not in the book), who after 2 minutes in the air has a heart attack and dies. In the book it becomes more detailed as the pilot has more pain, and it seemed that they were in the air much longer before the pilot had his heart attack. <br /> <br /> The aircraft (within a further two minutes) has run out of fuel (leaving us viewers, assuming he has been up there for hours, even if the sun has not changed position and the landscape looks like to be the same.) Now he's crashed landed. <br /> <br /> This is the point in the movie where everything is very different from what it was in the book. In the book, he said that his jacket was torn to pieces, but in the film it is perfectly fine without tears or cracks (looks like he just bought it), it never said he climbed on a mountain, so one wolf and fell asleep up there on the mountain it never said he was attacked by a bear (it said a moose but not a bear), it never said he eats the many bugs he does, it never mentions the other tornado or that he learned to get these sparrows to shine them and eat them or the little fish farm he does (it is destroyed by one of the tornadoes), nor does he mention that he is hurting his ribs from one of the tornadoes . <br /> <br /> I don't think you can call what was depicted in the movie, a tornado. All it was was just a windstorm that paved several of his things. My favorite part of this camp party was Brian's lame flashbacks (never mentioned in the book), especially the cliché scene of Brian waking up, going to the window and seeing his dad (with all his stuff packed, everyone can fit perfectly into the back of his truck) leaving and screaming "DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD !!!!" (Of course, his father has not heard him, even though he was just outside), and he slams his fist through the window (wtf?) The end is the only thing close to what happened in the book (I said close.) In the book I mean that one of the most important things that the rescue pilot told Brian when he landed was "you are the child they have been looking for! They stopped months ago ..." but they left that line in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is a pathetic epilogue with Brian (somehow without counseling or therapy) coming back to normal with his family. I think we should assume that they came together for Thanksgiving (because they had a turkey at the counter.) Then it shows his temporary home (for what in the movie seemed like three days, but in the book was for several months) and his hatchet, still in a tree where he left it (nor did it happen in the book), where he cut a message so perfectly executed: "HOME" (where we really should believe that he cut it is perfect with just that it hatchet?) No quote can summarize this movie better when Enid from Ghost World said "it's so bad it's gone well and back to bad again." Perfect description of this movie. I would not recommend it to anyone (who has not read the book) and is just looking to watch a movie, or would I want someone who has read the book (because they are disappointed and bored. <br /> <br /> For those who have read the book, leave what your imagination created as the movie, which is terrible and will bring your thoughts about the book. <br /> 1/10
