I sat glued to the screen, riveted, yawning, but still kept an eye on it. I was waiting for the next horrible special effect, or the next ridiculously cliched plate element to show full strength so I could learn how to make a movie. It seems that when they go out to make this movie, the crew visited every other action / science-fiction / shoot-up-up / good vs. evil movie ever made, and looked cool and said, "Hey, it can we do. " For example, the only car parked within a mile on what looks like a one-way road with a shoulder that is not intended for parking, one car protagonist, an attractive brunette born of bile, is thrown on. The car blows into pieces before she even lands on it. Special effects were definitely my biggest beef with this movie. But what really put it in my bad books was the upliftment and lack of reason for so many elements! For example, the antagonist, a flying demon with the ability to cause damage to bizarre ways, occurs on a lone military car carrying an important VIP. Nameless security guys with guns get out of the truck you know they're already dead. So the guy who protects the VIP says, "Under no circumstances do you leave this truck, do you understand me?" He comes out to find the animal that killed his 3 friends, he gets whacked into an almost comic clich√© fashion. Then, without apparent reason, logic, convention and common sense can withstand the stupid ass VIP GOES ON THE TRUCK !!! Much of what happened during the movie wasn't sensible. Transparent action removed me from the movie, as well as bad camera work, and things that just make you go: "Wow, it's incredibly cheesy." Shiri Appleby saved the movie from a 1 because she gave the movie one element that always makes viewers enjoy the experience, sex appeal.
