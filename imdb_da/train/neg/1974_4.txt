Some people have made a point of rejecting this film because they question the plausibility of black people in the Old West, Asian people in the Old West or women with guns in the old West period. Take a grip and read a book. There were very few Asians (Chinese) who were very few blacks (freedmen) and all outside the gentile class had ready access to weapons; That is the second amendment you know. And, with regard to the use of modern language, none of these Western people has grown nostalgic about actually used languages ​​that were consistent with the depicted era. The Americans had different accents, used different bends, spoke at a very different pace, and used lots of words and phrases that could not be recognized today. Don't blame historical inaccuracy for just digging it. Being honest. Maybe you're just uncomfortable with what you see.
