One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Terrible acting, ridiculous 'action' (it is clear that the cars travel slowly), scary scripts, frighteningly unsatisfactory end and incompetent direction, make a hash of a movie. We know Judge Reinhold is a fine actor, but he must be ashamed of this detritus. There is no great excitement in the car, and when the characters stumble on hope, they laugh like inane banshees for some reason, even "high fiveing" when they see the bridge lowered! <br /> <br /> Also the chain of events that lead these people to share the same car strain credibility. Apparently based on true events, even? If so, the truth is obviously alien to fiction! Unfortunately, it was portrayed in such an inappropriate manner.
