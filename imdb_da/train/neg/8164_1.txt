I watched this movie on an actual movie theater (probably $ 2.00 a) with my cousin and uncle. We were about 11 and 12, I guess, and really into scary movies. I remember being so excited to see it because my cold uncle let us choose the movie (and we probably never have to do it again!) And then disappointed afterwards !! Just boring and not scary. The only redeeming thing I can remember was Corky Pigeon from Silver Spoons, and it wasn't so good, just someone I recognized. I've seen bad movies before and this one has always stuck out in my mind as the worst. That's what I can remember, one of the most boring, not scary, wastes of our collective $ 6 and waste of movies. I've read some of the reviews that say it's worth seeing and I say "for each one's own" but I wouldn't even bother. Not so bad is it good.
