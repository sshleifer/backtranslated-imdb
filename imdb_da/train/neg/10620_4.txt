Despite having some exciting (and bold) sequences, NBTN just never gets started. There are exploding boats, hat pin murders, mass murder killings, body parts pathologists and all sorts of classic mystery / horror scenes, but they are mixed with long periods of pure show. Everyone in the movie looks bored. This is a shame because many of the sequences would be considered daring at the time it was filmed. <br /> <br /> Add to these "precious" Brit characters, and you feel like you've driven into a Sherlock Holmes movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, the cinematography is very common. There are plenty of opportunities for beautiful pictures of the landscape, or complex shots of anyone being pulled into a large bonfire, but it is all imaginative and boring. Definitely only for Lee and Cushing fans.
