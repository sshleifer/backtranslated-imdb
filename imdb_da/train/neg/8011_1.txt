I must really have caught another movie from the rest of the commentators on this site because in a screening of the movie last night the audience was so mortified by the dialogue that I (not even fun) half went out. The play as if the filmmaker believed that he was approaching a bold new territory by presenting a gay-come-of-age story, uses the movie David Lynch inspired images with Fassbinder inspired play. The performances in this movie are so boring and boring that I figured out that one of the actors would go out of the way uninspired they seemed to be from the script. What's worse is that it is colored like an episode of Miami Vice. I do not know who this director thinks he is; Perhaps he has pretensions of the surrealist like Bunuel, Jordowsky, etc. But the problem is that all of the aforementioned directors show a level of their sensitivity that is missing a lot here. I could understand the movies' meaningfulness about ten years ago, but when we have masterpieces like Bad Eduction, Mysterious Skin and Show Me Love, why bother with this cinematic turd? There is nothing new to see here.
