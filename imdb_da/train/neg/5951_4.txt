Written by the excellent McGovern and directed by Frears, this movie was a little disappointment. It seemed too short. It used too long to create the Hovis atmosphere and laugh at the Catholic demands. So very quickly you have the fascist and the socialists waiting for the family's attention and the terrible conclusion. <br /> <br /> Still my wife thought Liam was sweet.
