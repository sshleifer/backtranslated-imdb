Hi everyone ... <br /> <br /> There's really not much to say about this movie at all. The basic plot is that a guy (Brandon) takes a couple of friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods for a weekend break away from work. After getting a girl on the way there, things start to go wrong for all of them. <br /> <br /> The story alone (written by the actor playing Brandon, I think, although I could be wrong here) is unlikely and unconvincing, and acted accordingly. "Clown Killer" itself is a rather sad excuse for a psychotic killer. Far from being a dark, mysterious but most intelligent predator, we are instead offered a rather clumsy, childhood space-hungry buffoon, which seems to be through a minor life-crisis. The only thing that justified the letter of this comment was the sex scenes and no matter how it was in the movie (the quality of the movie led me to derive some pleasure from such things). In short, this movie falls under every possible set of standards. Admittedly, I shared a few beers with a close friend whom I saw this, so we managed to scrape together a relative entertainment value out of this movie, and so it is only reasonable to mention that S.I.C.K just fell wild of a two rating. But in reality (and with the benefit of overhaul), one star rating is a more than legitimate score for this movie. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of ten.
