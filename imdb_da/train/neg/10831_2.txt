My guess is that this director / writer had something to say. Let's see what it might have been ... a. Frog storms would be scary? b. Can I get someone like Tom Cruise to say "C" the word many times and looks like a bad Patrick Rafter? c. Throw my wife and make her say the "F" word every two seconds. This aside I really liked the beginning and the frog storm. The rest was a relentless, over-long (under-edited), over-indulgent failure. Happy so many of you enjoyed it! <br /> <br />
