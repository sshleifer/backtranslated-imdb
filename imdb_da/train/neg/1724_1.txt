... and that's this movie. I imagine that if there is really a negative afterlife, cursed souls are bound to a rather uncomfortable sofa and forced to watch this movie on a continuous loop for all eternity. Okay, maybe it's not that bad, but it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen next to "Manos, Hands of Fate" ... and I've seen many bad movies, believe you in me <br / > <br /> This is just a crummy B movie, poor movie production at its finest (or is it the worst?) What I really didn't like about this movie is the moronic duo they threw in for comedy relief. Now, a little comedy help is a good thing, but most of the film is focused on these two moron's adventures, rather than on the "heroes" of this movie, actually in it for less time than them! <br /> <br /> To be fair, Crown International really destroyed the movie by adding bad music and doing bad job editing. But honestly this was probably a bad movie to begin with, so Crown couldn't really have done so much to hurt it. <br /> <br /> This should really be in the bottom 100 list. I wouldn't want this on my worst enemy. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's my kind of campy B movie. It was bad, but I liked it, despite my star rating.
