What a joke. I see it on Channel 1, and I think watching paint dry is much more entertaining. What happened to Caspar Van Dien who made him shout into this nightmare. Terrible play, very boring plot and horrible direction. It's so terrible it's fun. It's supposed to be full of excitement, but it's more of a comedy. To see horrible plays, ridiculous script writing and sub-par plot, check out this movie. If I were Van Dien, I would not only ask for my 10% from my agent but fire the bastard in the process. What a turkey. It is not even suitable for being at MST 3K !! It would be a good movie to heal you insomnia. I especially love the part where Van Dien throws overboard and then makes it back in just a few minutes! I can only imagine that this is written by non-writers who take advantage of the author's strike. What a horrible movie !!!
