The movie and the play is not bad, and Jay Hernandez does a good job of playing Calito Brigante, but the film forgets that it is believed to be a prequel to a hit movie. The authors of this prequel obviously did not look at the original Carlito's Way or at least did not care about continuity. This movie is a prequel, which means that the original movie has already made some history for us, and this film must end where the original begins or at least leads to it. Not one of Carlito's close old friends from the original appears in this movie, they are not even mentioned. Luis Guzman, Pachanga in the original, is in the movie, but he plays a completely different character. The original takes place in 1975 and the prequel takes place in 1969-70. Considering this movie takes place less than 5 years earlier, wouldn't you think that one of Carlito's long friends would appear? In the original, Carlito begins to be released from prison after spending 5 years in prison. It is only a few months between the end of the prequel and the start of the original! *** Semi Spoiler *** We know from the beginning of the original, Carlito has spent 5 years in prison, so when the prequel gives us this Hollywood happy ending it is an insult with intelligence from fans of the original. What happens to Gail? It's the lack of continuity that made this movie go straight to the video release.
