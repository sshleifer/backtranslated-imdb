I love the killer insects movie, they are very funny to see I had to watch this movie as it was one of my favorite horror books by Shaun Hutson. <br /> <br /> I met him and I wish I listened to him as this movie was horrible as he said it was after he said I was still dying to see how bad it was was. <br /> <br /> The reason: People die mysteriously and cruelly, and no one has a clue as to why. Only health professionals Mike Brady have a possible solution, but his theory of killer snails is laughing at the authorities. <br /> <br /> Only when the body count begins to rise and a slug expert from England starts snooping around, it starts to look like Mike had the right idea. <br /> <br /> This movie as the most exaggerated you ever see a movie! Snails in this movie are fast (then normal), and they seem to be relaying the scenes quickly! <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing like the book at all, the book was ten times scary, ten times gory and had much more history to it! <br /> <br /> I didn't like this movie at all! As I am a great fan of Slugs book and other book called Breeders! Both books are great <br /> <br /> Read the book and watch the movie, you like more than I gave this 2 out of 10
