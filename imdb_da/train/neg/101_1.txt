Amateur, no budget film can be surprisingly good ... however, this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> Ah, another Brad Sykes cruelty. The action is horrible, except Emmy Smith, who shows some promise. The camera's direction requires serious reworking. And no more "hold the camera and run" gimmicks either; It just doesn't work. The special effects are imaginative, which is a problem when the effect can be identified in real time. If you want to tear an ear, let's not see the actors' real ear under the blood. The scenery is boring and boring (the same as Mr. Sykes other ventures), and the music is a cross between cheap motel porn and really bad guitar-driven metal (see scenario commentary). <br /> <br /> Have I mentioned the lack of any real plot or character development? Apparently the scriptwriter did not. <br /> <br /> Who is funding this guy ... please stop. I've seen some of his other "home movies" (which I don't want to join) and they are just as bad. Normally, an "instructor" will grow and learn from his past efforts ... not this guy. It's one thing to be an amateur movie, but someone can be a hack. Of course not a popcorn movie ... of course, chewing on popcorn kernels would be less painful than this effort. <Br /> <br /> Price: The worst ever military push-ups in a movie.
