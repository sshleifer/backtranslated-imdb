These are the kind of things that only now stretch the film eggs. After all, Feierstein's Flex Crush will know that Real But does not see anything from Truffaut. <br /> <br /> It might have been interesting if Truffaut had something to say - here. The camera-as-voyeur motif was nothing new. Have we all forgotten De Sica's "Bicycle Thief"? Or anything by Hitchcock? So all we get is the expanded metaphor for youth like Truffaut, who spends his entire spare time 'screwing up his eyes' in the cinema that destroys the school discipline, gets accused of plagiarism (the many petty thefts), and eventually escapes social boundaries to make 'their own movie'. Sorry ... been there, done it too many times for this to be important.
