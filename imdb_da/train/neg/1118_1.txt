I was really appalled by this scary movie. What an exceptionally dark atmosphere. And such an eerie musical score. Really promising! Yes, after ten minutes, you really start to sweat and feel uncomfortable because you start to fear the worst. This movie has the atmosphere of a real nightmare and what's worse - it all comes out. For an hour and a half I have been trying to fight complete boredom and fall asleep, but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake. Nuit Noire is a really scary image - for your eyes, your ears, your intelligence and most of all: your wallet, as the idea of ​​spending precious money on a movie for this cheap amateur video is the greatest horror of all.
