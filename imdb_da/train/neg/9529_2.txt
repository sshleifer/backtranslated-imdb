This 1977 cult movie features two crazed lesbians (Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp) who are at home at the wealthy socialite Doctor George Manning (Seymour Cassel), hoping for help finding a home they can't find. But these two have other plans in mind when they find out that George's wife is out of town, they stop taking control of the home, tie George and kill a dream of birth, while destroying everything on a night. Bizarre and disturbing movies, but the two will only reward in the same bizarre way the movie ends. Most will either not like it straight out or be caught in this ridiculous movie after approx. 30 minutes in it. No matter what some even consider this a cult classic. <br /> <br /> Larry Dodson
