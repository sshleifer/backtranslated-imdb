Okay, now I know there are millions of Americans who believe in The Rapture: the moment when all the people born again in Christ will be raptured to meet God and all the rest of mankind will be left on the ground to perish in plagues and fire and the heart rhythm of psoriasis as the antichrist fights it with Jesus (in an uncharacteristic warlike state). And I know the books were the best sellers. . .and believers, anyway. And I don't mean any respect for all that. <br /> <br /> But I have to say they filled this movie in a sack and hit it with the Suck Stick. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the books are much better. Really. The plot needs no rendering. If you have watched this movie, you have the chance to read the book. I can be one of the only people on earth who actually saw this just for the clean, bad movement experience, and I was not disappointed. Especially not by Kirk Cameron, the creepy little "Growing Pains" gremlin who grew old at that show, found Christ and decided that SHOW should reflect his Christian values. Well, Kirk, your career has gone to the dogs, but now you can be glad you spread the word of God in movies so badly that they never even make it theatrical releases. Well, that's not quite true: I think it was the only movie ever made for DVD FIRST, with a coupon for a free movie preview, as it was briefly released in theaters! I still have the coupon! How many people do you think appeared? I don't know about you, but it never came to my town. Of course, I live in NYC where we godless liberals sit around tearing pages out of the Bible and using them to roll the joints. So there you go. In fact, I bet out of three million people on Manhattan Island, not one would be raptured. <br /> <br /> Check out the additional materials on the DVD where you will learn the creepy behind the scenes details of those movies. . The caste and the creature must all be of the same religious mindset. They do not come straight out and say this, but listen carefully to what the filmmakers are saying. It's like a bunch of Pod People came together to make a Pod movie. How is creepazoid it? Honestly, this thing just preaches to the converted, doesn't it? Can you imagine anyone NOT subscribing to the whole apocalypse thing that sees this relaxing on the forehead and saying, "HOLY HOOVER DAM! I better get saved PRONTO!" In any case, I'm hooked. I have to see the rest of these Christian fiasco films, especially the one with Gary Busey, which I think is TRIBULATIONS. At least, Busey has an excuse to take part. He blew his head on some sidewalk when he crashed his motorcycle. <br /> <br /> Oh, and one thing. What about all the shots of poor, innocent dogs sneaking, their cords pulling uselessly along the ground, because their owners have been called to heaven? What happens to it? Should we feel bad for the dogs, and if we do, what should we do from God? Isn't it the IRC people that there's no room in the sky for man's best friend? Foo. <br /> <br /> This is another reason I am agnostic. Good night and good luck.
