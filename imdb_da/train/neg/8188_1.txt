The most ridiculous thing about this ridiculous movie is its perception that if you become a saint, he or she and his or her family and his or her significant others live forever. Let us forget that to become a saint, the saint must be dead, and saints do not have significant others. That for a millennium, Nick has been the Jolly Elf to Fred's Scrooge has never even been suggested! Open on Nick learn how to make toys, so on Fred learn how to run numbers; Nick gives a sick child a dolly, Fred repossessing the dolly with the family farm! After a few more such episodes, Mother Mother of the present Fred waits his spleen on siblings Anonymous as his colleagues lose in empathy. There I just wrote a more coherent story than this idiocy! This Santa Claus, a "ho, ho, ho, ho, ho" away from a massive coronary, is a neurotic wuss sitting with the Queen of the Harpies, an operation right out of the Mega Mall Hell, and answering a table (huh?) who just gave Easter bunny his pink egg. Oh, and his right hand is a ditzy blonde in a skin-tight mini-dress and go-go boots. Ho ... ho ... ho ... ho ... ho! <br /> <br /> But what really sent me over the edge was Slam named # 1 on the Naughty List. Shouldn't a naughty list be reserved for the Hitler's and Stalin's future? Children who are the true performances of evil? No to old sausage fingers, a good boy who knocks out because he is unwanted and uninformed is demon seed! <br /> <br /> The Nimrodes behind Fred Claus must be cooked in their own pudding! Bah!
