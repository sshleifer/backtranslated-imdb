I'm a big admirer of Lon Chaney, but the screenwriting of this movie just didn't work for me. The story jumps around strangely (I have since learned that the movie lacks a paragraph), and characters appear and disappear with annoying suddenness. Some of the headlines are all explanatory (eg "Why aren't you a kid anymore!" - Cut back on the picture for a long, slow beat - "you're a woman!" Yes, we got it the first time), but There are a few talking sequences that ask for explanations that never appear. (Let's hear Luigi and his blonde boyfriend argument, thank you!) The reason that involves unpleasant wishes (figuratively if not technically) disturbs the point that it was hard to see. For the author's credit, this problem was addressed as a problem and a May-December fight is not portrayed as the right and inevitable inevitability for some Mary Pickford films (eg, "Daddy Long Legs"). Chaney gives a good performance as usual, but I think he has been better guided in the past - he overdoed it a few times here, IMHO. I enjoy clown sequences and were very impressed with the stunts. Loretta Young was charming but amazingly young. The movie has its moments, but so far it's my least favorite Chaney image.
