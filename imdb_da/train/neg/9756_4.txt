In spite of the English title, this seems to have little to do with devils and much more to do with a power of hunger ruler seeking philosopher's stone and wanting gold made of lead (and virgin blood). Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre and seems to have a little problem getting people to die when he thinks they threaten his position or when he needs virgins for their blood. He is basically the egg of his lady love and an alchemist that he is employed and it is more greed and insanity that seems to be his problem than demonic possession (unfortunately). There are parts that are at least something exciting like unsteady and adult men trying to knock each other down with big sticks, and the film has at least a good look at it, but otherwise there is little to recommend. A bit in the way of gore and nothing to be afraid of at all, and most unusual, for a Molina / Naschy movie, not really any accidental humor. That's why 4 out of 10.
