... or an audience. A quick lap .... So you have this doctor who has experimented with stolen body parts for some vague reason. He wants perfect transplants, but feels he has to do it in his basement. WTF ??? And then suddenly his fiancé and his wife cut off her head in a traffic accident for which he is responsible. Agonized with grief, he maintains her head in a lasagne pan (or is it strudel?) And pumps it full of "adrenoum" (sic) to keep it alive. And then she wakes up and speaks her head (so to speak) even though her neck is clearly separated by the vocal cords and she has no lungs so she couldn't speak even though she had them. Seems the ungrateful b * t doesn't appreciate everything her fiancé has done for her. Like a woman ..... Then his grief becomes sad when he sees the possibility of digging his beloved head on the body of the first sleazy bimbo he can get from the street. Meanwhile, the medical assistant, a kind of dime store Igor, comes into philosophical arguments with the head that has struck a telekinetic friendship with the "monster in the closet" (any mad scientist has one). Finally, one understands that he cannot continue to pursue his misogyny and fear of intimacy problems on the audience ad infinitely, so he kills everyone, so presumably goes to the bank to get cash to check before the film's financial beneficiaries have the opportunity to Stop paying for it. <br /> <br /> Have I mentioned that I think it's a bad movie? <br /> <br /> Someone should tell Turner Classic Movies to stop showing the edited version without the evil stuff. The sight of the assistant with his arm ripped out, pirouetting around the house without leaving much blood everywhere is just too expensive.
