1 is quite generous here. I really enjoyed the BOOGEYMAN, even though it is not the BOOGEYMAN promoted on the DVD cover and we know it all! It crept me out. But this movie is something else. To be directed by a guy who has been for a long time and directed many movies, it seems that it was shot on a VHS camcorder by a 10-year-old! The story and the action are horrible! David Hess, you've also relieved me. After playing one of the most threatening villains in movie history, have you addressed this? The story and the action may have been forgiven, but if someone had taken the time to get the video to look professional. There are a lot of shots on video footage out there that don't look like it, or at least not so obvious that it detracts from your attention from the movie. I can't say it's the worst movie ever because I couldn't handle it all over the movie, but it's definitely close.
