Can only be described as terrible. It is bad to start with and then becomes even worse. When you start, you really have to look through it because it's impossible to believe that it can get worse - but don't worry because it does. Another badly written script for an escort for no talented offspring from previous movie stars. It's hard to decide if the script is worse than the actor, or if the control is worse than both. With regard to the hero - well, he bends everyone with a scene where he beats the living daylight out of the hard by swinging, opening the wardrobe door and smashing him against the window with it. And in another scene he is thrown through a window and crashes 20 meters on concrete - does not even flash - then he rises up immediately and gets stuck in the evil. This is a really ridiculous movie. Lucky it only cost me $ 1 to hire.
