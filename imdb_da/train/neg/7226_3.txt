I love the comics. Although I have trouble understanding the stories fully ?? The visual style is unique with all its dirt, dust and decay. So I thought I knew what I was up to. Surprisingly, I understood the main plot ?? But some very bad decisions were made for their visual style. <br /> <br /> I mean - really bad-looking "CG human actors" - in close-ups? ??Why?! It didn't work at all !! Horus - and the other Egyptian gods - were successfully made in CG and very close to the comic. <br /> <br /> With real actors, I think this movie could have been a cult movie. <br /> <br /> What a shame.
