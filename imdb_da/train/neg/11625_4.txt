Apart from the Brady Variety Hour, this was some of the hokiest TVs I've seen in a while. The video production qualities were not so bad, but the overall appearance was unmistakably early in the 80s. And Marie Osmond looks as if she beat the fight with Avon Lady .. and lost a lot of time. Way too much eyeliner. <br /> <br /> Watching veterans Danny Kaye and Eric Severeid participate in this was a bit embarrassing. Even more interesting was seeing Alex Haley talking about the African pavilion in the World Showcase, which would open in a year. As of this writing, it is 17 years later, and it's not opened yet (Unless you count Disney's Animal Kingdom.) All in all, however, for all the shortcomings, it's still an interesting visual piece of Disney history.
