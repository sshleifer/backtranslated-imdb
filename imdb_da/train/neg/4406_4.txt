This budget-hungry Italian action / sci-fi hybrid has David Warbeck as a Miami reporter, chosen by the ghosts of the Atlantis population (!) To stop an evil businessman (Academy Award nominee John Ireland) from using a telepathic The fetus grown uses spores from an asteroid to control the world. Do you have all that? In spite of such a loopy plot, this is actually a bore, and the ATLANTIS rails snort it with contempt. In fact, the most (intentionally) creative thing about this flick is the easy reworking of Herbie Hancock's BEVERLY HILLS COP theme for the opening titles. The most unintentional creative piece involves a scene in a laboratory that inexplicably appears twice backwards. Perhaps director Alberto De Martino wanted to get every avant-garde on us in the twilight of his career? I was going to declare this Ireland's worst movie on his resume, but then I saw that SATAN'S CHEERLEADERS were listed there. I would also like to explain with certainty that I am probably the only person in the world history to make a double feature of this and Hitchcock's VERTIGO.
