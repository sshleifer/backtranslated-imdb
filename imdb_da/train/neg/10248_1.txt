The end of the world looks like a good movie on the box cover, but be warned of its bad. A big fan of mega-star actor Christopher Lee, I was fooled. as tentacles (77) it does not mean a good movie, it will be a good movie. The concept looks promising so it becomes tedium, many parts of the movie are too dark to see what's going on. The rest of the cast is shown briefly as: Lew ayres, dean Jagger and MacDonald Carey as security guard. I would expect better from Charles's band who made fun movies like re-animates and dolls. I heard Christopher Lee was fooled into making this movie. told his co stars were Jose Ferrer, John Carridine and Dean Jagger. Well Dean Jagger is there, but the other two have never done it (lucky ones) if you are making a film about the end of the world, using a bigger budget and better storyline. One Jagger continued to make two good films afterwards; Alligator (80) and Death Game (79) Applicant Lyon (Lolita) is also in the film minus her lollipop. if you are a glutton for punishment, then see the end of the world i dare to say awake throughout the movie.1 out of 10.
