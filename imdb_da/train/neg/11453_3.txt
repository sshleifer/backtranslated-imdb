This movie is one of the worst comedy movies I've ever seen. I hate these Napoleon Dynamite rip-offs. Just face the people the stupid sense of humor has already mastered. Do something new for once. All these new comedies are just awful. And coming out of SNL Andy Samberg is not ready for a major role yet. I hope he can jump back from this horrible movie. And Arnett's character will simply be bad. Hey Will, you read the script. The reason is really the worst ever written. Now you tell me if it's strange. (This is the movie) Rod Kimble's father's father Frank dies, and the family needs $ 50,000 to pay for heart surgery, so Rod plans this big leap to raise money for Frank. Only because Rod can beat Frank in a fight and prove his masculinity. Yes, it's the movie you tell me you would spend $ 7.00 to see that piece of crap! <br /> <br /> 3/10 just awful <br /> <br /> dam
