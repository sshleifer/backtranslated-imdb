The brides die at the altar and their bodies disappear. Everyone is worried, but no one seems to be able to figure out why and how this happens, nor can they prevent it from happening. Carry over with me. Bela Lugosi is responsible for this, as he extracts spinach fluid from these young women to transfect his old wife and keep her alive. Continue to carry with me. Finally, the authorities expect that there should be engineers with deaths and disappearances, but of course they cannot find out the unlikely motive. Let's just ignore the ridiculous pseudoscience and continue ... If you can get through the first twenty minutes of this mess, you'll be treated to Lugosi, whipping his laboratory assistant for disrespecting one of the brides he has murdered. and explains that he finds sleeping in a coffin much more comfortable than a bed and other vague parodies of real horror movies (such as with budgets and plots). Anyhoo - a female journalist follows her nose to the culprit (and remarkably, the inappropriate police are nowhere to be seen!), And then the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The camera and acting are ok. There are many well-dressed, very nice people in this movie. The management is fair and the script is slightly better than the deserved material. Nevertheless, this movie fails to maintain the interest of all but the most hardened b movie fan. The best thing about it .... It eventually ends, but not fast enough.
