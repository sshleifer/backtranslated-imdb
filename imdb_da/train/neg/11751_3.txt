When HEY ARNOLD! First came in the air in 1996, I saw it. It was one of my favorite shows. Then the same episodes began to appear again and again, so I got tired of waiting for new episodes and stopped seeing it. I was kind of surprised when I heard about HEY ARNOLD! THE MOVIE, as it doesn't seem to be as popular as some of the other Nickelodeon comics like SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. Nevertheless, I have nothing better to do, I went anyway to watch the movie. Going into the theater, I didn't expect much. I was just expecting to be a silly movie version of a children's cartoon that the RECESS movie was. I think I got what I expected. It was a stupid kiddie movie and nothing more. There were some good parts here and there, but for the most part the film was a stinker. Just for kids.
