There is a good thing in this movie: Lola Glaudini's ass! Sorry to be so blunt, but that's the truth. Too bad she did not make a naked one. At least it would have made this mess tolerable. We see another chick's boobs, but she's not near Lola. And man, is Armand Assante old or what? The man looks like crap! "Consequence" is the usual B movie you would expect. History had potential. It's as if they had good ideas, but didn't know how to do it. The cinematography is just plain horrible. Ugly! The management is uninspired and the end result is a bland thriller with lame twists and washed up actors. Lola Gaudini is great as a vixen in a cheap, dull way, but not even saves her "Consistency" to be a garbage bin and not a fun waste, just old stinky garbage bin.
