I watched this movie twice. I can't believe Pintilie made such a fantasy movie. I'm also a film / theater director, and I know what I'm talking about. This is not Romania anymore, but I see the events happening in the same period with the incident from September 11. No story, no plot, nothing. No conclusion, no message, nothing deep, nothing hidden. Just empty pictures. <br /> <br /> What most Romans don't know, this movie is for the French viewers, not for us. They really believe that is the reality in Romania. Also for teenagers. Pintilie should stop making movies. I don't really know if we can call this a movie, maybe a horror :) And we wonder why we have such a picture in Europe. This was a reality, but is no longer. A good friend from me from the British Embassy said, "You have no idea what a long Romanian people went from Ceausescu".
