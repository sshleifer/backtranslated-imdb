There's no more I can say to say that this movie was horrible. The whole of Chineseness is awakened in your being because of the ancestors was a hard sell. But the audience tells that every Chinese knows Chinese history without even studying it just ridiculously. It's like saying that every American knows American history without studying or every Filipino etc. It's just not credible. The story is flat out hidden. It talked about Shin being from a monastery in China - later identifying it from Bejing. But the early sequences of the film show the map focusing on Mongolia. I know that the current Chinese regime wants to invoke areas such as Mongolia itself. But it is a separate nation, and there are even labels "Mongolia" on the map. Does Disney Studios Fail 5th Grade Geography? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Wendy and Shin is, at best, superficial, yet she feels in any way associated with him. Her workout is just cheesy. And let's cut for the hunt: Everything about this movie is bad. It's bad enough to laugh and cry over. The Taekwondo action was over the game and unrealistic in many cases. <br /> <br /> The evil eye thing was cheesy. But the left exit would have been the only descent thing about it. They should have left the evil eyes ending in it. But somehow, evil is defeated. Yey! <br /> <br /> Overall, the dog's time is not worth the film. Brenda Song should continue with another study. "F"
