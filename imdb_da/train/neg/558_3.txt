It has been about 14 years since Sharon Stone awarded viewers an intersection that twisted many people's minds. And now God knows why she's in the game again. "Basic Instinct 2" is the sequel to the smash-hit erotica "Basic Instinct" with a sexy stone and a vulnerable Michael Douglas. However, fans of the original do not even come close to this, as "Instinct 2" is a painful film production when mediocre director Michael Caton-Jones kills the legacy of the first film. <br /> <br /> The movie of the movie starts when a car explosion breaks into the beginning. Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone, who tries to look sexy) is a suspect and appears to be involved in the murder. A psychiatrist (a horrible David Morrisey) is appointed to investigate her, but eventually falls for an intimate seduction game. <br /> <br /> And without the basics, there is the basic force that moves this "instinct". Nothing much is explained and we have to sit through a sleazy, C-class erotic movie. Sharon Stone stars in her first role, where most of the time she is a turn-off. Part of it because of the amateur writing, the careless direction, and the scary low chemistry. The film is full of vulgar dialogues and even more sexuality (a menage a trois scene was cut off so this would not be rated NC-17) than the first entry in the series. "Instinct" is a convincing torture. <br /> <br /> First, all that made the original movie a guilty pleasure was not found anywhere in the movie. The action here is really bad. Sharon Stone has some highlights, but here she becomes extremely uncomfortable. David Morrisey stars in the worst role of his life, and never seems to make more than two expressions in the movie - confused and awakened. "Instinct 2" is a terrible way to continue an otherwise original series that managed to put thriller with eroticism extremely well. Paul Verhoeven, how I miss you .... <br /> <br /> "Basic Instinct 2" never sounds like a good movie, and actually it's not. Some movies should never get out of paper, and that is the feeling you get after seeing this. Now it is much easier to understand why Douglas and David Cronenberg fell out and why Sharon Stone expected a huge paycheck for this ......----- 3/10
