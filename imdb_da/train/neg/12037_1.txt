This series is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. Terrible actions, horrible effects, terrible writing, you get my drift. The stories are so far from the legend of Robin Hood, it's amazing. Looks like they would just use the name Robin Hood to attract an audience. It might as well have been called New Adventures of Mr. Among Acting. <br /> <br /> Someone commented to me that if you had imagination, you would love this show. It's a horrible approach to a television series. A visual medium like this should rub your imagination, don't force your imagination to do it well. It would be like the Simpsons episode where they are trying to brainwash Homer with a religious propaganda film, and he is beginning to talk about who killed anyone or anything. "If a movie is boring, I just make my own story." Conclusion: Absolute human waste.
