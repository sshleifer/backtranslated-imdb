I thought I should see a scary movie and ended up laughing all the way through the whole movie. In the scene where man turned into a werewolf, I thought they were fun. Today's computer games have ten times better animations. Low budget is an appropriate comment. I would recommend Wolf (1994) with Jack Nicholson for a good werewolf movie. It has good special effects as they should be (human transformation into werewolf). Unless you want good laughter, I don't recommend watching this movie. This movie is a joke.
