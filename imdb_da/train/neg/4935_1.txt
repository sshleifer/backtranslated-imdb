"Cavemen" exceeded my expectations and not in a good way. It was even worse than I thought it would be. Basically here is the show: Cavemen is an alternative race, they face prejudice, etc. It may be the stupidest idea ever created; Almost appreciated the prison time for writers. A show highlighted cavemen going into a club, trying to pick up girls, and then nothing else happened. It resembles listening to a 22-minute Andy Rooney dialogue, followed by the death of steakknive through midget cannibals. For those who haven't seen this show, here is an example of the dialogue: "You're sure you're okay with going out with a hollow man." "Yes, that's fine. I've had that 10 thousand!" Hilarious ... Maybe the best script I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 22 minutes of hollow men with horrible makeup, tackling tough social problems ... sounds like an entertaining evening. I also love how bad the recent ideas are, they are resorting to making a sitcom out of car insurance advertising. I wonder if they will do Gecko next, so I can get a new title for the worst show I've ever seen. I would even say this is worse than "Viva Laughlin." At least "Viva Laughlin" was ripped off by something that was something inspired. <br /> <br /> Shows like this make me hope there is a comet up there somewhere on the ground. <br /> <br /> Honestly honest ...)
