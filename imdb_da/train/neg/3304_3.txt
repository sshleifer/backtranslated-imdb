Greenthumb Grace is left penniless after her husband's death, so she turns to ganja-growing to pay the bills. It sounds promising, and the always reliable Brenda Blethyn does not disappoint, but the material is sitcom thin. In fact, there is a scene where Grace asks her young gardener to "Give me one" and he thinks she is asking for sex and seems awkward. Yes, it's humor, so one would be bored. Saving Grace doesn't seem to know what it will be: the amazing filmography and static pace evokes memories of Ryan's Daughter, while the cheerful whimsy of the nation's citizens could be lifted from any episode of antique road show. It speeds up after the first hour, but it is too clich√©d to worry about. The climate is only unpredictable by introducing the most shameless Deux ex Machina I've ever seen.
