If movies like Ghoulies rip off Gremlins, then Hobgoblins sink to the new layer of ripping rubbish like Ghoulies. These button-animated furbies have some kind of fulfillment of fantasies (involving basically character dreams - oh joy), but what has to do with something is someone guessing, except letting the director pamper his kinky love for eroticism. They show this down in the 8th circle of Hell, a suspicion. There is no real plot - just "goblins - kill!" and weak attempts at humor and a mild attempt to awaken the viewers.
