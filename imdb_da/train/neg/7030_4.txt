One of the cornerstones of the low-budget cinema is to take a well-known, classic story and make a complete bastardization out of it. Phantom of the Mall is no exception to this rule. Screenwriter takes the enduring phantom of opera history and moves it into a late 80's shopping mall. But "Phantom's" goal is now simply to avenge those who are responsible for desfiguring his face and murdering his family. The special effects give a good chuckle, especially when body parts begin to be seen in dishes from the yogurt stand. Pauly Shore has a small role which does not allow him to be as completely unpleasant as one would expect, mainly due to the fact that his fifteen minute MTV fame had not yet arrived. If you're looking for a couple of good laughs at the expense of the actors and special effects crew, check this flick out. Otherwise, continue to look for something else.
