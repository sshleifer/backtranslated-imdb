Back in the day I remembered seeing stupid Nintendo Power comics that had the same work of art as this show ... and then word came up that this show came on TV near me! I was not Estonian but curious ... I was curious about how bad this show was going to suck. My friends all said that this show had no real meanings and was too stupid for people like me to enjoy (I'm actually gay) so I decided to see the show with low expectations. WHAT A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE !!!!!!!!!!! First, I hate the new characters. Tiff and Tuff are so stupid and I hate how so many fanboys throw over Tiff, it's sad. I also hate how they did the chef Kalasaki (or whatever his name was) was a good guy who owned a restaurant. Bad Movement, 4Kids TV! Escargoon is nothing but a loser adviser to King Dedede (who sucks much time in this show) and I hate one company's face that continues to supply Dedede with the terrible weapons to destroy Kirby. So stupid, I hate this show. <br /> <br /> I began to hate Kirby even more, as it was clear Nintendo was just painful to gain Kirby some popularity. Kirby will never beat Mario in the fight for coolness, and Kirby will always be anything but a little tiny cream puff of homosexuality. NUF SIG !!!
