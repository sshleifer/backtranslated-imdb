Lipstick is another glossy film error. I'm trying to think of a good thing I could say about the movie and I'm having trouble getting up with something. I think the red dress that Margaux Hemingway had at the end of the movie was the best. The script and script were not the worst I have ever encountered, but it could have been much better. Lipstick was very pleasing to the eye to see. The sets were very shiny and nice to look at. Cast was okay. I felt that Anne Bancroft's character was the only possible character throughout the film. It was sad to see that Chris Sarandon wasted his time on this one.
