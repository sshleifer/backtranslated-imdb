Stupid, mindless drive over a jet mounted within hours of mechanics who have never worked on airplanes (ruled by Burgess Meredith) chasing a Porsche race car that runs on decades of old gasoline sludge, powered by Lee Majors, with Chris Makepeace as runaway techno-wiz who can McGyver spare parts for a radio receiver that can pick up all frequencies at once and which somehow learned to acquire and use chemicals to make high explosives in a perfectly peaceful community. As moronic as it sounds. Terrible wastage of Burgess Meredith, but Chris Makepeace may at least be forgiven on the grounds that this was only his second movie.
