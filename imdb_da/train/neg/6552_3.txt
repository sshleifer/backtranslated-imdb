Cash (now played by Khrystyne Haje in for Angelina Jolie) has walked to a post-apocalypse wasteland (after the patron died from old age, said the patron was played by Elias Koteas, an actual decent actor) and now she finds people wandering Through the windows, cyborgs are looking for trade for scrap and cash. She leads a group of burned-out cyborgs (including William Katt, Evan Lurie and a human researcher who Zach Galligan played) against bounty hunter Richard Lynch. Malcolm McDowell has two minutes of screen time as Lynch's employer. Cyborg 3 is doing better than the other two items, but it's still a pretty boring feature. The problem this time is that ideas with potential are never used well, the action sequences are routine, and the name cast like McDowell, Katt and Galligan get a little to do. Shark is actually a whiny heroine and Lynch is also over the top (as usual) and the film lacks inspiration or ambition to be as fun as it is hilarious predecessor. (The one with Van Damme, the other is just boring.) Also disappointing is the science fiction angle, which almost aggressively opposes any good idea it has. As an action girl, this is routinely and by the number B movie stuff and it is competitively made, that is the only positive thing I can say about it. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of 4- (Bad)
