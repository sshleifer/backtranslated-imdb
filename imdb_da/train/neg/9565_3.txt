I can't say that Wargames: The Dead Code is the worst movie I've ever seen since it had one or two decent moments, but I can easily say it's the most transparent movie I've ever seen. Not even presented a plot unit itself without guessing it 10+ minutes in advance. There was no subtlety for anything the movie did, no intelligence at all behind the scenes. Each of the spoken or written lines made it so obvious that it was impossible to "get into" the movie. <br /> <br /> I found myself laughing at the horrible mindset line and the bumbled attempts to reclaim the audience, much more often than I thought to enjoy the movie.
