I was shocked by Tigerland's ridiculously incredible plot. It was a liberal's imagination of how the military should be. The dialogue was difficult to swallow with the silly things that Colin Farrell's character was allowed to get away with by his superior officers. <br /> <br /> I continued to think, "Hey, there is a reason why the boot camps are tough. Wake up soldiers to fight and make them a cohesive unit. There is no room for cocky attitudes and men who didn't follow orders. "I angry for Bozz to get his ass kicked because he was such a danger to his soldiers. I would not fight with anyone like him in war because he was more concerned about people's feelings than doing what was necessary to protect his unity. <br /> <br /> <br />
