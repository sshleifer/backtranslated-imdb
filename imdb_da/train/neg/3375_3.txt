Hey, everyone, if you saw "sing in the rain", you remember the genealogy scene in the rain. You can also remember the dance song by Donald O'Connor, "Make'em Laugh." If you saw "Royal Wedding", you will remember Fred Astaire dancing in the attic. If you saw "Jailhouse Rock", you will even remember the title dance choreographed by the King himself. <br /> <br /> That's what is missing here. There could have been some blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation. The closest was Chuck McGowan's "I Can Do It." The mere fact that you have some talented people on the stage moving together does not make a good dance movie. Richard Attenborough was responsible for this failure. He pointed to the camera on stage and thought it would be good. <br /> <br /> Yelling with people auditioning for a part in a Broadway production is not entertainment. Michael Douglas would be just as badly cast if he was in a Western or a comedy. He is ok when he is in a Michael Douglas movie where we see him shouting at someone we would like to shout at. It doesn't work here. <br /> <br /> The cast was good except Michael, of course. A good movie could have been made by using the songs that were in the stage production, but someone should have thought about how to film it. <br /> <br /> The next time they do one of them, they hope to call me first. <br /> <br /> Tom Willett
