What should be a simple generic mystery plot involving a dead philanthropist is actually a headache provoking tale of a bunch of characters (the only major actor is Ginger Rogers in a very early role), who all seek to find killer among one small cast of residents in a nice apartment complex. These characters range from completely silly to downright. As an inexpensive, low-budget production, most of the action revolves around Rogers and her senior man (a guy I don't care who he is because he really sucked) talking about their various options for solving the crime while they are constantly is cut off by an absurdly detective with his head in his buttocks. Honestly, I've never had a worse time watching an old b-rate movie of this type and I've seen some real head-slackers. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the butler didn't, because there wasn't a butler. But be aware of the guy closest to a butler. There you go. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
