I love the book, "Jane Eyre" and have seen many versions of it. Everyone has their strong points and their mistakes. However, this was one of the worst I've seen. I didn't care about Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane) was almost tolerable and probably looked at the plain part, but she had no feelings in any of her lines. I couldn't imagine what Mr. Rochester looked at her. <br /> <br /> It brings us to Mr. Rochester. William Hurt had even less feelings than Jane, if possible. How two such harmless people could fall in love is a mystery, but it was certainly not my attention. Perhaps the instructor (Zeffrelli) fell during production. <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton (too beautiful for Mr Rochester!) Version is far more true to the book, but Ciaran Hinds plays the perfect Mr. Rochester in the 1997 A / E version (which is not all right for the book). <br /> <br /> Trying to find something positive about this movie: Geraldine Chaplain was perfect in her role.
