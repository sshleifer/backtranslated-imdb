Anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away, felt it was a good movie, does not appreciate quality film. This movie was an insult to see, the direction was high school movie grade quality as well as cinematography. The Blair Witch Project had better filmography and I hate this movement with a passion! The story had the potential to be a very intense very good movie, but it fell flat from the first 10 minutes through the rest of the movie. Someone mentioned that this movie was about a child's imagination, okay it's all good and fine. But they could still have done better things with this script than they did. I mean, get into the store. Has the child looked at that little idol and suddenly depicts the Indian and the whole story of an Indian spirit called Wendigo? As they mention to the shop assistant and she randomly says that there is no one, but I, who work here so you think okay scary ghost scenario, but then she just changes for the crowd on the idol and we forget the little child who sees this guy . It was so lame it goes beyond pathetic. The end left you wondering not only what happened to Otis in the hospital, but also with the feeling of OMG !!! Why the hell I just wasted my time watching this !! This is a feature I recommend not to see, there is definitely better quality movie out there that will not offend your intelligence! Thank goodness, I never had to pay to watch this movie, I would have demanded my money back! For those who were easily entertained by this movie .... it is very sad that you lowered your standards to this level of film making to actually say it was a good movie.
