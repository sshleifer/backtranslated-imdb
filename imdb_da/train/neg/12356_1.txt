Watching this movie was a waste of time. I was tempted to leave in the middle of the movie, but I resisted. I don't know what Ridley Scott intended, but I learned that in the army, women become as stupid as men. They learn to spit, to insult and to fight in battle, and that is also a waste of time (in my opinion). And what was ultimately the last scene in Lybia? Are they still fighting Gadafi or is it easy for everyone to believe that Islamic people are always a danger?
