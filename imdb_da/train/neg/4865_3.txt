I just don't enjoy this movie. But then I loved Babe, a pig in town and have been pampered by talking animal movies that are exceptionally well done in every way. The animals were not sympathetic. They were all annoying especially Chris Rock's guinea pigs, but what could I expect it's Chris Rock. I think I smiled once or twice on a couple of cute lines, but that's it.
