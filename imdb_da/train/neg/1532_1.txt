Although properly warned, I actually sat down to watch this movie. Partly because I usually give each movie a smooth break, and because I thought that a single movie couldn't be that bad. I am corrected. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could save this turkey from sinking like a ton of bricks. Only once during this humor travesty of a spoof disappeared I sounded. For under Simon says scene. The other jokes are either poorly done or simply plain unfunny. And some of them you actually see a mile away. This movie just hasn't got what it takes to be a good parody like Airplane! (I + II), Naked Gun (I + II + III) or Scary Movie. They all had A. fun gags, B. good dialogue and most importantly C. unforgettable quotes. Men in white have D. none of the above. To call this movie bad would be a gross understatement. AVOID THIS MOVIE, No matter what you can! Consider yourself WARNING!
