A cast of 1980s television films and TV series guest stars (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley, Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel among others) in the story of a photographer who has dreams of killing his models. Of course, the models and other people begin to die, causing all sorts of complications. Over finished not very good thriller has enough nudity and violence to get an R-rating, but not enough good material to create any real interest. This is best described as the kind of film that gave the cable channel Cinemax the alternative name of Skinamax. I really can't see the point to see this unless you have to see every cunning thriller out there. (I also have to comment that this movie is filled with smoking, to the point that it gets ridiculous when someone shines)
