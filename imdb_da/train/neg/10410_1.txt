This is a confused and incoherent mess of endless scenes of boring dialogues and monologues. It's not exaggeration: you have to make a lot of effort to try to get involved in it yourself. <br /> <br /> I sincerely thought that Fassbinder would do something interesting to tell why does Erwin / Elvira suicide at the end, but instead, someone tries to explain in some way: "When he was young, it ... "and" he just came back from Casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there ... "etc. << br /> <br /> Soon in the movie is Erwin / Elvira in a slaughterhouse talking to a friendship amplifier (certainly a slaughterhouse is the best place for a pleasant little chat), and while she tells the story of Elvira's life Fassbinder shows the killing of a cow after another. It's hard to choose between taking into account the disturbing images or what the transvestite says. Of course, we come to the very forced and coarse symbolism of "I have suffered a lot in my life and are dying". In one of the scant moments where something actually happens, Erwin / Elvira encounters a former lover that only after performing an extremely homosexual choreography with two other guys (as if it goes to the necessary homosexuality level) is that he recognizes Elvira. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting shots and ideas I have to admit (for example, when the nun tells the story of young Erwin), but everything on the film is wasted due to Fassbinder's complacency.
