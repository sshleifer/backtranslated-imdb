Okay, I've seen this movie twice now, I've been studying it heavily online, I've asked more people for opinions. I have even been in the length of reading the original Sheridan Lafanu Classic 'Carmilla', a book on which this film is supposed to be based. I feel the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play while you watch it. Since the plot of the movie doesn't seem to make sense, here's the plot's book. <br /> <br /> Laura lives in a castle in Syberia with her father, Mr De Lafontaine. They continue happily and peacefully with their lives. One day, they receive a letter from the 'General, a man who made it his mission in life to avenge the death of his dead. He claims supernatural forces at work, and explains that he will soon visit them. Meanwhile, a chance meeting with a strange woman in Lafontaines, looking after her daughter, Carmilla, results for months. Soon, Laura begins to be overwhelmed by strange dreams, and begins to come down with a strange disease. Who is this mysterious Carmilla? And what does she have with Laura's condition and General? <br /> <br /> I have invented this game and want as many as possible to play it and let me know what their results are. I even have a catchy name and would also have a jingle, but I can't be bothered by it. It's called "this movie makes no sense" game. All you have to do is, while watching the movie, try to come up with a complete plot explaining what's happening. I mean completely, all questions are answered, everything is sensible, completely complete. It should answer such questions as ... <br /> <br /> * Why can vampires walk around daylight? <br /> <br /> * Why are they all lesbians? <br /> <br /> * Why is a girl named Bob? And why does she shoot herself? <br /> <br /> * When is the movie a dream and when is it right? Why does it look like killing zombies is an accepted part of life that Why does Travis Fontaine run and drive down a zombie without slowing down while driving his car, but when faced with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car, accept the excuse that she is a zombie too? <br /> <br /> Why did he let a girl he later openly reveal that he knows is the main vampire running with him in his car? <br /> <br /> * And let her ride alone with her daughter in a stolen car? <br /> <br /> What in hell is the asylum scene about? <br /> <br /> What the hell is the green thing about? <br /> <br /> * Why does the head vampire suddenly start to dress like a nurse? Why are there never any vampires fighting Zombies? <br /> <br /> * What is the meaning of the necklace? what is it made of? Why kill vampires? and how does Jenna know? <br /> <br /> It's as much fun as trying to get so many questions about this movie as well. <br /> <br /> I have my plot and I have to admit it is not quite there, but it is quite a good bet. In conclusion <br /> <br /> 'Vampires vs. Zombies' has no moment in what is actually vampires fighting zombies. Everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what is happening, but they seem very reluctant to let the audience get into this. And somehow it is based on a classic 19th century screaming story. How? Why? What the hell is going on there?
