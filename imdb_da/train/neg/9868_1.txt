I almost never comment on movies, but I saw the 5 glowing reviews of this "movie" and decided that I should weigh in with my own review. My instructor received this movie in the mail, mixed with his academic screeners (AMPAS, also the guys who voted for the Oscar) and was then the floor with how terribly constructed this movie was that he brought it into our class to demonstrate to us how not to put together a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie has no plot, the scenes are terrible, terribly edited (often using faux "24" style picture-in-picture techniques), and performances (especially the management, which even fail to act as a bad actress) is mostly unpleasant. Someone really could not understand the point of an introduction, namely the layout of the plot. There is no setup! Halfway through the film neither myself nor the rest of the class knew what this film was about. The opening cradle, which puts a kind of murder, is never treated, and now I think about it, possibly being a flash-forward, while the rest of the movie is a flashback, but it cuts from that scene directly to the next without any indication as such. <br /> <br /> Bah, I could really go on and on again. At least this film gives me renewed confidence in my own film-making ability.
