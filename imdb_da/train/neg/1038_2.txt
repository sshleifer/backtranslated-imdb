Raising Victor Vargas is just a bad movie. No amount of denial or ad-dollar supported advertising change this sad fact. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Peter Sollett saw that he didn't have the money to make the movie he wanted to make, and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad movie that cynically apes the principles of it. current "edgy film-making". Maybe he just doesn't know anything better. It's hard to tell. <br /> <br /> It's not hard to tell is the result. Apart from a few viewers who want to intellectualize the bad film making for an attempt at pseudo-realism, it will benefit. <br /> <br /> I know I didn't. <br /> <br /> yourself a service and pass this movie.
