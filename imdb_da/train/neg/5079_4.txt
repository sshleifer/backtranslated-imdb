What a great actor has in such a horrible story ... The film and its production, however, is quite good, although it is located in London but with exteriors in Bristol. Does not matter ?? See a cathedral, you've seen them all. The story, however, is about a man born with the power to perform death and destruction over someone and something if he so desires. With just a transient reference to true life forms of telekinesis, the narrative builds a picture of a man abused and mistakenly as a boy, a teenager and finally as a man; So much, in fact, that he clarifies revenge on will, literally. Over time, he comes to the conclusion that the whole world is heading in the wrong way and thus sets out to destroy the party ?? just thinking about it! The problem with the story, however, is that it tries to mix real scientific data on strange mental forces and merge it all with quasi-religious claptrap to produce a hodge-podge theory of everything. Mix of facts and imagination in this way rarely seems ?? and I'm afraid Richard Burton would have to work terribly sometimes when trying to sound convincing. His very best scene, however, is when he gave his wife and her lover an oral paste when they left their home: sharp, witty and deadly dialogue, delivered as only Burton could. <br /> <br /> Good support helps make things look and sound much better, but begin with Lino Ventura, whom I last saw in Garde A Vu (1981) as Brunel's Inspector; Harry Andrews as Assistant Commissioner, the very underrated Lee Remick as Dr. Zonfeld; Derek Jacobi as publisher, Towney, and a few other well-known character actors. <br /> <br /> I liked the way the story was presented as flashback in flashback to fill the back, thus solving the immediate mystery of the murder of Morlar (Richard Burton), the author with the killer disposition. Until that time, it was a good piece of visual detective work by Brunel and his English sidekick. Yet it was very predictable, as it quickly became very clear to me about the wild murderer. <br /> <br /> Then they went and pampered it all for the last fifteen minutes. If you want a clue what it is, think Samson and Delilah (1949), from the famous Cecil B. de Mille, and how Samson ultimately got the evil ones. And the very first scene is simply stupid. Why? Because there are at least a hundred ways that Morlar's rampaging could have been stopped, absolutely. <br /> <br /> Shame actually because it could have been a much better story and movie. I think Burton really needed the money. <br /> <br /> If you're a Burton fan, take the time to see the scene I mentioned above. Otherwise, don't bother.
