There is little to be excited about "Dan in Real Life". First, the entire setup is incredibly designed. Do you really think that Marie hadn't told Dan where she was going during the very long first meeting conversation in the restaurant? And when Dan did all that spoke during this conversation, why should she be attracted to him? For that matter, I have never found out why Marie was so attracted to Dan throughout the film. He is very narcissistic and does little to convince us that he is really a good guy (for example, he lies with Marie in the bookstore, ridiculing his brother about his former boyfriends and trying to make Marie jealous of a blind date). There is more resistance as the ridiculous scene on the bowling alley, where Dan and Marie are caught out of the whole family. Yes this can really happen. Dan in real life is slow, juicy and manipulative. Even chickens like The Jane Austen Book Club get higher marks than this predictable "tearjerker".
