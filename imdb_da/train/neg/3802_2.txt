I know actors and actors like to try different kinds of movies - hi, no one wants to get typecast - but Danny Glover, Brenda Fricker (happy birthday, Brenda!) And Christopher Lloyd should have known better than this. "Angels in the Outfield" is another movie where everything seems lost until someone or something comes magically and saves the day. May I even tell you how it ends? The film is simply pure, low escapism (examples of high escapism are the various sci-fi films from the 50s). If these films had some political undertones - or at least offered a new look to life - then they would be OK; This one is just meaningless. Far closer to diabolical than English. Also starring Tony Danza, Adrien Brody and Matthew McConaughey, and I suppose they don't want to emphasize this in their CVs.
