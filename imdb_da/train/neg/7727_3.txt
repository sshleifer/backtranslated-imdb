I comment on these miniseries from the perspective of someone who first read the short story. And from that perspective, I can honestly say that while it's fun, I can see why it hasn't been reused at any time recently. More specifically, this mini has some serious problems, such as: <br /> <br /> 1) It's terribly disappointed. The actors who played the younger generation were all 15 to 20 years older than the characters. Ali McGraw (45 at the time) played Natalie Jastrow, who was to be around 26. Jan-Michael Vincent (39 at the time) played Byron Henry, who was about 22. The other Henry children and Pamela Tudsbury were also played by actors all too old for characters to be in their 20s. <br /> <br /> 2) Some of the actors were horrible. Ali McGraw at times made almost this mini unwatchable. I've seen more convincing performances in high school. <br /> <br /> 3) The management was poor. To be fair to Ali McGraw, the bad play and character development were probably leading. The exhibition of Hitler was very overdone. His character came out and looked more like a cartoon villain than the charismatic, sometimes charming, but always diabolical genius Herman Wouk painted him as in the novel. Some of the other characters are done so stereotypically (Berel Jastrow), they do not get the depth that Wouk created for them. <br /> <br /> 4) This mini is very dated. The Hokey music, the pretentious narrative (it sounded like a junior high school story movie tale), and the entire primary soap opera sense of mini made it almost comical at times. Also too often Byron and Natalie are costumed and made up to look like them in 1979 instead of 1939. Anyone who sees this without the benefit of reading the short story will probably not sit through it all because it will come out more like in The late 70s / early 80s "take myself too seriously" first-class soap drama, rather than the television version of what is certainly a modern American classic. Remakes of older films and the like are sometimes poorly finished, but it is probably a case where a creative and inspired director could make a very fantastic, memorable and critically recognized production. I never see it as a remake should be as long (15 hours) or longer to do it right, and given the greatest attention of most American audiences, it wouldn't fly.
