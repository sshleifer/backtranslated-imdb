What was Franco Zeffirelli thinking? Was Hollywood responsible for this travesty, or can I comfort in the idea that someone who didn't speak English as their first language just missed the point of Charlotte Bronte's classic? I don't think I can improve on a comment I read below, so I just want to rewrite it: "Jane Eyre is a great book, you should write it once." It is true that the film's two leaders were unfortunately miscast. But shame the actors, because the screenwriter omits all the best scenes. The dialogue, which enables you to understand Jane and Rochester, has a meeting with mind and a common sense of fun ... deleted from the script. Marriage proposal, fortune counts ... away. The allusions, half fun, half sincerely felt, to Jane as an adventure from Olde England, came to save Rochester in his despair ... eliminated. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that Zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and ion's interactions with the rivers family. But it is unforgivable that he surgically removed love from one of the best love stories ever written. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and take the 1983 (?) mini series with Timothy Dalton.
