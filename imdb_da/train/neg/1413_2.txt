I love Morgan Freeman. Paz Vega is an attractive, attractive and talented actress. I'm sure this would have been a good movie if something had happened to it. Nothing does. It's short (less than 90 minutes). It was 75 minutes too far. After an hour of frustration, I scanned the remaining 20 weeks. Freruciating. <br /> <br /> Freeman plays an actor - who hasn't been working for a while - examines a part that he can play as cashiers in a supermarket. He visits the supermarket where she works. Nothing happens. She decides to give him a ride home and they go to an Arby's, a Target, a car wash. Nothing happens. They talk about their lives. Nothing happens. Ever. <br /> <br /> I don't understand. But I also don't get the Bill Murray flicks "Lost In Translation" and "Broken Flowers". If you like these movies, you might like it here. Lots of people find movies like this capricious, charming, or - for reasons of escaping me - find the dialogue fascinating. A common unit in the film of this ilk is to have a long silence / silence after an actor delivers a line that should be meaningful. We know that it is meaningful because it is followed by two minutes of nothing on the screen. Sorry, I have to be a philistine. I do not understand it. For me, these kinds of movies are not fun, or charming or thought-provoking. They're just boring. Why? Because there is no comedy. No drama. No excitement. No laughs. No excitement. No action. Nothing to see. In short, none of the things I go to in the cinema. I can be bored for free. I see oddball / quirky characters in reality. I go to Target and fast food restaurants and car wash. These items do not make a movie, even if stars do these things. I pay to be entertained. <br /> <br /> If you're crazy about Morgan Freeman, and like hearing him go over to nothing, then fun. If you want to throw yourself over Paz Vega, you can see and listen to her. But nothing happens that I promise. A total snooze test.
