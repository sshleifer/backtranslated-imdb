Why Hollywood feels the need to remake movies so brilliant their prime (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes), but is it significantly worse why Hollywood feels the need to restore the horror movies that were not brilliant to Begin with (Prom Night, The Amityville Horror) Like their originals, these remakers fail to create atmosphere, character, or real frightening at all. Prom night is so flat and uninteresting, it's hard to see, but for all the wrong reasons. It is a badly acted, massively uninteresting and ultimately boring excursion that fails in everything it is designed to do. Clearly, Hollywood Horror is dead. Even those Hills have Eyes and Texas Chainsaw Massacre managed to destroy their franchise in the style of blood pants and a decent plot. Prom night is almost bloodless and I won't even mention how bad the plot is. Its inability to seal the killers identifies makes this the least thrilling horror movie since the erm ... original. One of the most infamous slasher films from the 1980s returns to terrorize movie gamers with this remake that shows how terrible high school dances can really be. Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow) has survived a terrible tragedy, but now is the time to leave the past and celebrate her senior prom in style. <br /> <br /> When the big night finally comes, Donna and her best friends are preparing to enjoy their last great high school blowout by living it up and partying for dawn. But while Donna is willing to look past her nightmare and into a brighter future, she thought she had fled forever, coming back to a last dance. An obsessed killer is loose, and he will kill anyone trying to prevent him from reaching his only Donna. <br /> <br /> Who will survive to see exam time and what will Donna do when forced to confront her greatest fear? Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis co-star in the slasher remake who will have tuxedo-clad teens everywhere nervously looking over their shoulders as they are filming on the dance floor. A plot that will probably get you started to see this. The witch, if you ask me, is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Without much work, McCormick tries to gamely tensions out of the most banal situations. At one point, a girl tries in a floor lamp (a lamp!), And McCormick tries to pump it up in a jump-scary moment. Desperate times really require desperate action. There have not been so many shots of cupboards since the last IKEA catalog. <br /> <br /> In the era of The Hills, My Super Sweet 16 and Catch a Predator, there is another freaky, scary movie to be mined from commoditisation of glamor and society's eerie obsession with youthful beauty. This is not the movie. <br /> <br /> My final judgment? Avoid at all costs. Nobody will like Prom Night, it's even a disappointment for thoses who usually enjoy hack-job remakes. Considering its absolute lack of blood or fear. One night you will be busy forgetting.
