Forbidden as a "Video Nasty" in the United Kingdom, Unhinged has obviously been given a lot of notoriety. But the most shocking thing I found about the movie was its amateurity in all departments. The bloodshed I could handle: The horrible spectacle, creepy editing, horrible direction, miserable script and scary soundtrack were much harder to take. <br /> <br /> Three girls on their way to a music festival collide in a gorge during a storm. They are rescued by a friendly stranger who takes them to a nearby house. The house owner, a beautiful old lady and her spider daughter, is looking forward to the girls so they can stay for a few days to get started. But someone does not want the girls to leave ?? ever! One by one they become victims of an invisible attacker. <br /> <br /> With a long time to get started and with some of the worst performances ever in a horror movie (and it requires something), Unhinged is a really horrible movie. The music is a total mess (it sounds like a three-year-old has been detached on a synthesizer) and as such it complements the film perfectly. Only a few bloody scenes towards the end and a little free nudity red Unhinged from getting the lowest possible score. <br /> <br /> If you are a horror completist (and unfortunately I am), you would like to see this to cross it from the Video Nasty Watch list. But be warned? It's really, really bad.
