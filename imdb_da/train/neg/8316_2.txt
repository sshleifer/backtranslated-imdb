Cedric Kahn's films have been character-based, rather than action-based (I'm thinking of L'Ennui and Feux rouges), so it's struggling to see this series of really expert car chases tied up with some plodding attempts to score Succo. I can't find Stefano Cassetti as an interesting actor; He reminds me of pro athletes who are coaxed into movies, like Bret Favre. The mere stare looks like a really evil deer caught in the headlights. A real actor would have forced us to reflect more on Succo's personality, rather than admiring his carjacking skill. <br /> <br /> The little play that comes comes mainly from Isild le Besco, which the needy schoolgirl Succo takes by storm. The interview at the police service is a marvel of bland obstinacy with a little fear of the future mixed in. Le Besco apart there is not much to recommend this movie.
