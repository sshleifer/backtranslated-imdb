This movie is not based on the Bible. It leaves Christ completely out of the movie. They do not show cleanup or the second coming of Christ. Don't talk about it. It does not quote from the scriptures. The end times are called the great tribulation. The movie doesn't even show bad times. The seven bowls, seven villas and seven trumpets of judgments are cooked down to a 15 second news list of the ocean that changes its structure. The antichrist was killed 3 1/2 years in the tribulation, and that's how the film ended. The only part they got was that there were two prophets. They didn't use names of course, because it would be too close to the truth of the scriptures. The worst part of it was I really wanted it to be a good movie. I wanted to take unwritten people to it. I feel the movie is malicious. It's a fake like everything the devil does. I just hope it doesn't take away from the upcoming movie based on the left behind books. The other problem with the movie is that it was just bad. Poor acting, bad special effects, poor plot and poor character development. I've seen better episodes of Miami vice.
