The secret is ... this movie is blowing. Sorry, but it just did. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILER **** <br /> <br /> In this bad riff, I know what you did last summer and jerk, Beth, the game admirable by Dorie Barton, joined several friends on a spring break trip. The group rents a fancy house and tries to enjoy a fun holiday. Then the deaths begin. The first one then another, then another of the friends is murdered, leading to a sad and tired climax with predictable results. <br /> <br /> One note, Dorie Barton is the poor man Reese Witherspoon? She resembles Reese, acts as Reese and could pass to Reese in a police state. Maybe that's how they threw her? Anyhoo, decent filmography and fair acting couldn't quite make up for bad dialogue and horrible writing.
