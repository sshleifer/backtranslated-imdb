I was fascinated by how badly this movie was. Should the viewer learn something or reflect on something here? What was there with pumpkins? Do I have to be impressed with the counterfeits? Doesn't it matter that there are some trash can on a roof across the street of a hotel? Why does the narrator successfully speak the people he interviews (it is so obvious that he edited the really informative parts of his interviews to gain mockery). The best part of the film was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it's finished. <br /> <br /> I'm really amazed. I think the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or trying to impress the intellectual community.
