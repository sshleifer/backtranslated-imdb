... but it will make you wonder if we had anyone in the first place! This movie is as bad as any of today's terrible horror. A man walks around ogling half-clad ladies, trying to decide which one to kill so that he can give his girlfriend a new body. A scene involves a man who shifts around and spits across the set for three minutes, plotting everything to be well over ten gallons of "blood". The film also tries to create a feeling that what the man does with his girlfriend is wrong and against nature, but the film is so poorly finished that it is impossible for the audience to deepen any sense of shock or indignation. Immediately dark and unimpressively eerie, this movie may not even get its own title right - in the beginning credits say "The Brain who wouldn't die" but in the end credits listed it as "the head that wouldn't die."
