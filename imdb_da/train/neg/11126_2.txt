Of all the movies I've seen, this one is almost at the bottom (Haunted Mansion, Nothing but Trouble, and a few others keep it from reaching the bottom.) It's hasty, the story shaken, and the events depicted are badly acted. Of course, we have to put some of this on the book's author's door. The book movie was filmed after is outrageously ponderous and illogical. Oprah gives a beautiful look as "Bigger's" mother, but is not close to her potential. Other well-known artists also seem to be their worst. The reason that centers around an African American who decided to take a job as a driver. When he drives the family daughter to a communist dinner, he becomes acquainted. One thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk. Now the family he works for is not against black, but he thinks they are. So when he comes home, he puts her in bed, but she starts to sleep. The blind mother (yes) hears this, so Bigger tries to silence her, but instead forges her. Now he really fears having trouble killing a white girl, he does what any logical thinking man would do - he pushes her into the coal oven. So the investigators perform a missing person case and let them control the stove (the idiot does not have the foresight to get rid of ashes. He is then arrested and the last hour or so are unpleasant segments from the courtroom. Desperate for a bad movie this could do the job But if you seriously want to learn about cultural issues in the 40s and 50s or see a good drama, there are many better options. Avoid this.
