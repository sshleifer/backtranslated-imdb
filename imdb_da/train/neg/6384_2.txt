I was recently online to look at a site that contains public domain movies. In their long list of movies, this movie was, and I thought I was going to hallucinate on such an offensive title and premise. But no, it's really what it was. And since the film was only about 27 minutes long, I decided to try. If it had turned out to be a porn movie, I would have stopped watching. Instead, it turned out to be the most bizarre movie I've ever seen. The Danish production crew member, with a budget of about $ 49, tried to make a Star Trek movie about a herd of very gay men traveling around the galaxy that eradicates women's repression by killing all the women - as they continued to do on Earth! And in each case they were met with bowl and thanks from the now homosexual men on the planet. Subtle, this is not. With some of the most indecent and juvenile names of characters I've ever heard, I don't even think I can write them on IMDb without having removed my review! But in spite of the complete crappiness of it all, it was strangely tough and worth looking at. But as I already mentioned, because of the raw names and the odd subject (though not nudity), it is only a movie for adults. <br /> <br /> That way, this movie left me with 1001 questions about WHO doing this, why does it and who was the intended audience? It may not be the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's probably the strangest and possibly the most offensive!
