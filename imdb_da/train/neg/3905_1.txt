Forget Plan 9, this is the ultimate failure, a costume drama, ineptly directed, scripted, acted, etc. This movie is based on Isabel Allende's not-so-much better novel. I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in non-Spanish films), and the other actors, including Winona, my favorite actress and Jeremy Irons are trying hard to get over such a terrible script. Lots of mistakes (like when snow lasts in Chile?) And very cruel, with tons of evil called "magic realism," stands out as the worst movie all the time. It sucks completely !!!
