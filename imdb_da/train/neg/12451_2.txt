This movie is fun, not good. The battles are terribly bad, while sometimes trying to shock you by breaking some bones, and even this happens only two or three times, definitely not enough to call it a shockmove. A shot means that a hero can enter an open field with 10 people shooting at him with uzi's, picking up a gun, starting shooting back and not being hurt. <br /> <br /> The story empty, the guy wakes up, lost his memory, starts fighting because that's what he's good at. Five years later the memories come back, take revenge blablabla. <br /> <br /> Not worth the money, not really worth your time unless you're full and bored.
