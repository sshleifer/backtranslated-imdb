I'm a big fan of warrior movies. Some of my favorites are Braveheart, Troy, The Last Samurai and Gladiator. And having seen Mongol, which is amazing, and which I highly recommend, I had high expectations from a Sergei Bodrov movie. But it was terrible, terrible, even pathetic is not a strong word in this case. The whole movie I waited for something exciting to happen, but it didn't, then at least I expected a big epic battle at the end, but even that was a huge disappointment, just some random running around and waving with the swords ... There are so many good warrior films, this one is not one of them.
