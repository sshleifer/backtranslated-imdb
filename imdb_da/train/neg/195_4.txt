Slow and riddled with inaccuracy. Over-looking his mistakes, this is still an interesting account of Alamo's famous and heroic siege during the Texas fight for independence from Mexico. James Arness as Jim Bowie. Brian Keith as Davy Crockett. Alec Baldwin as colleague Travis. Raul Julia as General Santa Anna. This TV project also has stars David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York and Jim Metzler. Very good original music by Peter Bernstein.
