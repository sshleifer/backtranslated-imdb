What the hell was all that knows? I saw The Matrix and was amazed. It was the most spectacular movie ever made. What ever the Wachowski brothers did to make this movie is beyond me. There is no plot, you can't argue with it. Basically, this whole movie was a lot of speeches and didn't get me wrong, I have no problem with talky movies, but all the speakers in The Matrix Reloaded were a meaningless load of driftwood. Then there would be a battle sequence that lasted too long, so more meaningless driftwood, then another battle scene that lasts too long, and it all builds on the greatest anti-climax ever. A little beard talks a lot of inexplicable bulls for 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Also, Keanu Reeves still offers its worst performance. I knew he wasn't a good actor, but it was beyond a joke. If you see his film in the order he was in them, it seems that he was gradually getting worse as they walked together. God knows what his performance is like something that must give! Keanu Reeves: The only forest of wood ever to become an actor. <br /> <br /> After the splendor of the first movie, it came as a massive disappointment. If you haven't already seen the first movie, I suggest you see it, but don't waste your time with this full pile of turd. <br /> <br />
