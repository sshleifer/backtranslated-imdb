This is probably the worst Christmas movie ever. The reason is largely non-existent, it appears (especially Affleck) is poor at best. Ben Affleck fans will probably defend this movie, but deep down they have to agree. As far as I could gather, the plot consisting of Ben Affleck, a millionaire dealer, was told by a shrink to get to a place that reminds him of his childhood and burn a list of things he wanted to forget from his childhood. By doing so, he ends up paying the family who currently live in the house to be his family for Christmas ... and that's it. The film continues and finally he comes with the family daughter .... blah blah blah.
