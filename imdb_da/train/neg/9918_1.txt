Another British cinema. Really rubbish on offer here again. I can't understand (and I'm British) why this was ever made over the top patriotic nonsense. Eight years mark you, from when the Second World War was actually completed! The second commentator is noted here for editing and seemingly seamless use of archive films. This is very poorly observed. The archive films are in abundance. Model air swing from wires in 'action scenes' as so many children's dragons in the wind. The usual card room sequences tattoo the movie to get us pulled into the whole of the Malta event. Guinness must have its worst-performing performance ever. The shocking retreat scenes are ridiculous. Hawkins drills us all to death in the card room area. Ealing made many good films. This is clearly not one of them. They should have stayed away from such a convincing advice!
