Personally, I would recommend people to stay clear of this movie. It's a drill to see, and the battles are poorly choreographed. Slow and not very convincing. If you buy the Hong Kong Legends DVD release of this movie, the only thing worth listening to is Bey Logan's audio commentary. <br /> <br /> But at least since then there has been a ninjas movie worth seeing. I can't think of one and honestly don't want to. <br /> <br /> Generally, when it comes to movies, I have a golden rule: Avoid movies that contain the word 'ninja'.
