Kill Me Later "has an interesting prerequisite: A suicide lady (Selma Blair) on the border to jump from the top of an office building protects a bank robber (Max Beesley), who promises to" kill her later ". However, actual execution of this premise falls flat, as almost all acts serve as a single entity to move the plot towards its predictable conclusion, sharply written characters that have no motive for their behavior compromise the quality of acting all around. Lack of character depth, in particular, reduces Selma Blair's performance, whose character Shawn vacillates from being morose to acting "cool" and ultimately crossing like a confused concealment. Composite conditions worse is Director Dana Lustig's requirement to use rapid cuts, inconsistent special effects (eg look for an unintentional fun in nfrared motorcycle hunt in the end), and a hip soundtrack hoping to attract the short attention span of the MTV crowd. Certainly, Mrs Lustig proves that she is capable of mastering the technical side of direction, but by no means helps her skills overcome the inherent problems of the movie and thus draws the film to the end. Lustig obviously has a clear visual style; but it may be better suited to music videos than to movies. <br /> <br /> The producers (Ram Bergman & Lustig) can be praised for their ability to realize this movie: they were able to scare up $ 1.5 million to fund the movie, secure a good cast, and get domestic and foreign distribution. This is not a small feat for an independent movie. But given the quality of the product, the result is a mixed bag.
