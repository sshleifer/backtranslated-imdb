This movie was definitely ... ugh I can't find the word, oh wait ... shit! I mean, when it started, I was like yes it looks good and then it was so boring. I almost fell asleep and it had nothing to do with the fact that I got a late view because it was completely bad. Ram Gopal Varma has tried her best, but the cast could never live up to the original Sholay's cast, I mean what he thought to do a remake. What did he try to do? Be like Sanjay Leeli Bhansani and win all the awards next year as he did for Black? Ajay and the other guy were good, especially the other guy who played raj, because out of them all he was the one to look at. What is Amitabh doing? He destroys his own dignity by making all these silly movies. First Nishabd then Cheeni Kum then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom and now this means that he has to collect some of his money and move as far away from Bollywood as possible before he loses all his respect and I tell you he is already over halfway. I think all of this is really good for the other actors like Shah Rukh Khan, who get a really good name now because of Amitabh's recent downturn. I never really liked him because he thinks he's God, and I just knew Abhishek was going to be in that movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to save your Â£ 17.75 and spend it on something good, see Heyy Babyy because it's just the funniest movie ever and it's number one in the charts!
