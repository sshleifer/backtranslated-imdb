This is a movie that sticks to the 50s. It is very surprising that the American Film Institute has chosen this one for the best 100 American films from all the time. I've seen almost all the movies on that list and this is by far the most disappointing one of them. Music tracks (and many, many of them) are very long and boring and have absolutely no connection with history. The end of the movie has horribly overlaid ballet sequences which, of course, have no real relation to the film's history. It must be admitted that it is very well made, the music is ok, and the dance is made with the highest professional standard - but there is no real reason why the sequence is included in the film. <br /> <br /> The main character of the movie is extremely childish and inflexible and behaves in an unpolitical way. His mental age is approx. 14. If you want to see a good musical made at the "golden age" of musicals, go and see "Song in the Rain".
