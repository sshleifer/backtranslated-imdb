Until this new season I have been a great 'Little Mosque' fan. However, the new season had completely RUINED it. <br /> <br /> The new Christian priest has destroyed the whole purpose of the show. It has always been to live together to overcome prejudice. The new mayor destroys this premise and shows Christians in a very bad light. I am neither a Christian nor a Muslim, but loved to watch the show and see the friendship between Amar and Reverend. Not anymore. <br /> <br /> Just cancel it and do it with it. It's not worth seeing anymore. <br /> <br /> It can still be saved, but much change has to be done. <br /> <br /> Take the old format back.
