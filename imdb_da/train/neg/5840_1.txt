Okay then. I just watched a crap-load of movies - all in varying degrees of quality. I wasn't so sure which one I wanted to review first. Then it hit me like a sack-a-rats: Rodentz. Warn people about Rodentz. This monstrosity star no one and is painfully boring to sit through. And it's about mutant rats that kill humans. Yes ... really freaking 'original. "Food of God" or "Willard" anyone? It was better than this, and it doesn't say much ... <br /> ** POSSIBLE SPOILS ** Okay here is the story: The Inna laboratory is experimenting and his handsome assistant is experimenting with rats and their lab is in a Quirky neighborhood and brittle building, and the boring assistant's moronic friends turn out full and everyone gets food for the crazy rats, and almost everyone dies, and yes, there is a huge rat that looks crazy, but it gets killed, the end. There is everything in one sentence! Spoiler, you say? Ppfff !! I ask to depart! The second thing we all realize is a huge rat, we all know it's going to die eventually !! ** END SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Here's the split: <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> - Well, I saw it for free, but for everyone else. .. hmmm, no. There is nothing good here. <br /> <br /> Don't hurt it, didn't help: <br /> <br /> - Well ... well. Gore was decent. - Very average filmography. <br /> <br /> - CG rats are not as bad as they could have been in some shots ... <br /> <br /> The bad: <br /> <br /> - ... and in other shots were the CG rats pathetically cheap. See if your movie has a low budget, you might not trust CG. Lesson to take to heart. <br /> <br /> - The action is extremely poor. <br /> <br /> - The characters are beyond interest - we have a mish-mash of clich√©s, and none of them are even done so well. <br /> <br /> - Booooooooooooring. <br /> <br /> - Just done before - lots of times. <br /> <br /> - Stupid story, just stupid. <br /> <br /> - The Red Rat looks like a fat man in poorly thought-out carrying costume - it was fun - but not fun enough to give this movie something worthwhile. <br /> <br /> - Fair, unrealistic and boring dialogue. <br /> <br /> - All college student root tech people drink Tequila from large plastic milk jugs - and yet they don't seem to be full in anything longer than a few seconds. Way to hold on to continuity, guys. <br /> <br /> The ugly: <br /> <br /> - this movie is bad. Simply awful. Worse than you might imagine. It is not even ridiculously bad, for example. "Scarecrow" (2002) or "House of the Dead." Now these movie crap you can enjoy. Even if they make you stupid. Memorable Scene: <br /> <br /> - The lame action movie ends, complete with effortless heroes and explosion. Because it didn't feel like the rest of this monster - but still sucked. <br/> <br /> Trades: 2/10 History: 1/10 Atmosphere: 2/10 Camera: 4/10 Grade Development: 0/10 Special Effects / Makeup: 4/10 Emergency / Sexuality: 1/10 (I was occasionally in my son under the film, so I may have missed it but was apparently in there) Violence / Gore: 4/10 Dialogue: 2/10 Music: 1/10 (average currently) Writing: 1/10 Direction: 2 / 10 Cheesiness: 7/10 Crappiness: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Overall: 1/10 <br /> Just watch if you love rat and pest horror movies. Wait ... Check it. Don't look at it. It's bad. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
