First thing first. In this genre movie, the first thing you need is a good music, and this is where Mr. Shankar and his party fail. <br /> <br /> Music is completely pale and ineffective. On the other hand, AJAY DEVGAN, who has removed a letter 'A' from his spelling, has done good work but was not needed for a bad casted movie like this. <br /> <br /> ASIN is like a doll used to entertaining the public, even though she is good at watching, but she plays a role in movies, actually dances, she is a dancing member of a rock band, and I do not think a rock band has dances as a band member. <br /> <br /> In nutshell this movie is a piece of shit a piece of *** t see if you want to fool.
