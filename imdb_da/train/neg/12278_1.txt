When you see this show, you are not quite sure whether it is the story or the play that is more annoying. First of all, the story of each episode is very predictable, the authors must have used all the clich√©s, you can guess not only the general plot, but the arrangement of the scenes and also the lines of each character, making the show a kind of a collage of each police series out there. On top of it all, the fair's "message" comes that good is good and the bad is bad and that good must prevail in good, and that we all must love each other, be better man and better citizens, all done in the most apparent way. The actors, like vehicles in this message and nothing more than that, will use a limited set of merchant skills: "I am a good bearer" smile, the concerned eye and "victory is our" posture, while bad has it "I am a bad "frowning and" you caught me "look followed by" i am good for nothing and i need to be removed from society "headband (this kind of also summarizes general development of each show). True story or not, the show is garbage, yet another proof that the producers don't care about the viewers that we are all supposed to be idiots. Well this series makes every attempt to idiotise the living brains out of you.
