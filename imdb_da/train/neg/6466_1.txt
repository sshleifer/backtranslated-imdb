Marlon Brando had long since lost interest in acting when making this film. His performance as the "Swede" is the worst of his career, and that is exactly what he intended to be. He doesn't override. Instead, he simply works in a bizarre way and pokes fun on his embarrassingly gigantic circumference. The scene where Brando climbs over the toilet is probably the worst, funniest moment in the history of the cinema. As we see him falling head first on a toilet, it's hard to believe we see the same actor starring in A Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront and The Godfather. <br /> <br /> I guess the real question is why Marlon behaved like this in his later years. Was he ill for the film industry? Did he just seem to make a complete and complete fool of himself? I think we never know. But this film serves as a fascinating study of what is about a bad act. <br /> <br /> On that note, you will see starring veteran Donald Sutherland as he struggles to deliver his lines, embarrassed by himself to agree to join this travesty.
