My title is just about the sum of this sharp crap-up. I should have gotten a tip when I saw that it was a Fred Olen Ray movie - but I thought, "Hey, it might be better than his unusual villain" boy, was I wrong! This should be the worst movie still targeting children. The action was horrible, humor was non-existent, The Direction was the worst I have ever seen & the special effects would not work out on a 1950s Disney movie. WHAT IS THE HOPE FOR DEE-WALLACE STONE! Who once had such a promising career in the 80s. Movie veteran and former children's actor Russ Tamblyn was a horrible bad guy & the budget was so low, it was an amazing self like a kiddie movie. I haven't seen the sequel made in 1999 nor do I intend to <br /> <br /> If you want a good kid movie Watch 'HONEY IN SHRUNK / BLEW UP THE CHILDREN / KID' OR DISNEY MOVIE < br /> <br /> MY RATING AS A 19 YO: - 2/10 <br /> RATING AS A KID MOVIE: - 3/10 FOR THE BEST!
