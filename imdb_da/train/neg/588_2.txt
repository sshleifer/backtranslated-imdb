I am forced to write a review of this IMAX feature as a means of alerting others to SAVE your money. Almost every episode of Desmond Morris' "The Human Animal" or David Suzuki's "Things of Things" could have passed the material presented. Not only does the instructor make insufficient use of the IMAX's incredible 65-70 mm film storage and giant presentation screen, everything on the screen is extremely impenetrable considering the availability of such programming previously mentioned. Viewers are introduced to a pregnant Heather, her husband Buster, and their niece and nephew. We follow them for an infinite fifty minute as they eat, sweat, listen to music, etc. Although we access scenes inside the human digestive tract and learn about babies' natural dive reflexes, do we really learn more than most school school graduates? Are we even remotely entertained by the transatlantic heather? Do we break? Avoid this movie at all costs. If you want to see an IMAX feature, I suggest the beautifully photographed "India: Kingdom of the Tiger" or the technically exciting "Space Station 3D". Trust me.
