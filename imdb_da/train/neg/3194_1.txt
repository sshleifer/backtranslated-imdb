I can't believe this movie was made recently as 1984. It has some ridiculous plays, not to mention one of the stupid plots ever. Who would ever ask fat Texas sheriff Joe Don Baker to escort an Italian, he was illegally arrested in Mexico back to Italy? Not to mention that the movie's title tells you virtually nothing about it - in fact, it's about as generic a title for a wannabe action / police environment that I can think of. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I only saw this on MST3K with Mike and bots like a shield. They note the woman leader's resemblance to Elaine from Seinfeld ("None of them are spongeworthy") and riff non-stop on Baker's weight. This movie is probably no worse than "Mitchell", but Baker's reputation certainly precedes him here: When the title comes up at the start of the movie, Tom says, "I wish I was illiterate so I wouldn't have that read it ."
