I give this movie it is props that it is very well made and reasonably well acted. BUt I couldn't get past all the horror of it all. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, a game built on the concept of "Russian roulette" that has to fill in the hour. The big problem is that if you make a live show, you run the possibility that your first participant will be the unfortunate one to draw the "real" ball. So what are you doing? You have a 50 minute show to complete and nothing to show. It follows that Okay, you come to the end and the first five participants survive, meaning that number six has the ball and can't get the payout. He won't shoot himself at that time, so it's a little anti-climatic. <br /> <br /> Another problem, just as big. Human nature. People are going to do good, panic, land their underwear and do things that would not do very good television. Too much coincidence. That's why "real" Reality television is the density script and even more so. <br /> <br /> (The only random thing is "performance artist" ranting on female victims who were actually rare historically predictable when she went through shooting without effect.) <br /> <br / > We are led to believe that the degrees of visa would increase while at 1 am (unlikely) with the symbol Asian girl announcing every boost in ratings. <br /> <br /> A point on race and sex. The great surprise of the two minorities (one gay) and two female participants are the survivors. So we are back with the two white men, and of course it is a little less likely to be the one who buys it. The purpose of such a show is that it is random, but the guy you are the smallest is the guy who dies. Climax is that after two hours fighting for television suicide, Eva Mendes character Mendes is produced and starred in this thing, so she has no one to blame but herself) actually grows a conscience when someone dies. What did she think would happen? She is immediately shot by a bystander angry at it all (motives never explained), and the show continued to be a big hit. Really? <br /> <br /> The problem with media satire is that it must either be grounded in reality or it must be so over the top to be ridiculous (like Network). Nor is this.
