Watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and 2 bucks for rent in my life. If nothing catastrophic happens before I die, this will be the biggest regret in my life. Who ever thought of this movie, or funded, deserves a kick between their legs because it was here they thought when making this movie. It's about an overweight guy who is a hopeless romantic, and writes pretentious drive that tries to pass through as poetry. He joins his amorous friend in a trip to the coast. Where they meet girls and such. Only the fat guy doesn't get a girl. Skin flicks don't irritate me, I take them at face value. But this movie is trying to be more than a skin girl. It's about Fat guy looking for love in a girl, but then meets another bikini silicone girl who enjoys her poetry. He finds his talent for volleyball, which makes money for his family and impresses the ladies, only he has his lady anyway. The dialogue is super horrible for even a C movie. It supports a ton of black stereotypes, no character development, it's a glorified porn movie without porn in it. Never watch this movie.
