I started watching this movie expecting a barely tolerable Hammer horror movie wannabe ... and I wasn't far away. There are quite a few flashes of gore, and they cast lots of nudity, but the last half of the film presents a few ironic twists. Holy cow, they put a little thought into the story and did not quite fall into the predictable things that were expected in the beginning. And dare I say that, some of the "gratuitous" nudity was not so free because it fits in with the story and the setting. Don't miss me, it's still overall a bad movie, but as bad movies go, it's a shadow more intelligent than the really terrible tripe like Mesa of Lost Women and Robot Monster.
