Wow. It's about as much as I can say right now. Who writes these things? Who produces these things? Which self-respecting actor would agree to "act" on these things? Oh God! I don't know how I made it through this movie, but I guess I had had 8 cups of coffee that day was the most important element of keeping me awake. Good God! It was one of the most drunk and predictable movies I've ever witnessed ... and for the record, I never plan to witness it again. <br /> <br /> I first saw the movie when I bought the DVD (MISTAKE # 1). I mean ... I figured, hi! Julia Stiles. I like her. She is cool. I see it as soon as I get home (MISTAKE # 2). I tried to see it without moaning every five minutes and wondering when this bunch of shit would end, I really did. But I failed. It was one of the worst things I had ever seen. I mean ... What about the thing he imagines what would happen, then click it back to real life? It was annoying enough when his father used it in 'custody' as ten years ago. "The Knowledge" - and believe me it takes a lot of me to call it it - is stupid, the characters are trite and forgettable, the story is completely predictable ... all of it creates a movie to be deleted HISTORY RECORDS! I should have found something wrong when I realized I had never heard of this movie. It was probably a straight-to-DVD. <br /> <br /> For anyone who may be thinking of seeing this, I have a council. DOES NOT! For God's love ... NOT !!! I'm ashamed to have it in my DVD collection and I can't get rid of it ... No one and I think nobody wants to buy it from me! And I speak used and third thrift stores that would buy sludge from your shoes and keep it in the shop window. It should tell you how CRAP it is.
