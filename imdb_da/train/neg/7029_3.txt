Phantom of the Mall is a movie that fits best in the "easily forgotten" category. It is a rather miserable variation on the famous story of Gaston Leroux, the Opera's Phantom. Not a bad idea for itself, but the plot and production of this movie is too weak to give a decent greeting to that story. On the bright side, Gaston Leroux doesn't have to turn around in his grave just yet. It could have been much worse. <br /> <br /> Phantom of the Mall has too many useless flashbacks in it and too many boring sequences to make it memorable. Also scriptwriters wanted to give too much draft history than necessary. And even though there is a lot of mystery about building up Eric's character ... the basic plot is plain and déjà-vu. *** SPOILERS *** It's about a young couple who are brutally torn apart because the boy is killed in a fire. This fire was put to his house because he and his parents refused to sell their home to make room for a large shopping mall to be built. The boy survived the fire, and he hid himself in the mall to avenge himself. Meanwhile, he monitors his girl who is now working in the mall and trying to forget her loss **** END SPOILERS *** This rather simple - but rather effective - plot is thickened by lots of pointless elements and annoying conspiracy theories. While it should just be an entertaining horror movie, it desperately tries to be an intelligent thriller ... and that's not what fans are looking for. There are a few innovative killings, but they are not satisfactory enough for people who want to see a relaxing horror movie. And besides, Phantom of the Mall could have used at least some humor !! This whole production - the accompanying molding - takes way too seriously. <br /> <br /> I will try to finish with a few positive aspects ... For example, it is the stars Ken Foree !! Die-hard horror fans will surely recognize him as Peter for Dawn of the Dead! It is like the terrible milestone that has yet to find an equal. Although his role in this movie is limited and even completely unnecessary ... it was good to see him again. TV movie fans will also recognize Morgan Fairchild as mayor, she is a fine actress and an elegant lady. Pauly Shore is also in this, but I can't stand him ... so my opinion of him may be a little biased. And finally, a little praise for the leading actress named Kari Whitman. She is an extremely beautiful girl, and she has a little talent ... too bad she has never made it to the top. In fact, this movie is her greatest achievement, and it says enough about her career ...
