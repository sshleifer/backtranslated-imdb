I agree that even though this story of Melville may just be infamous, this is not even a credible attempt. In order to move the story into the 20th century, the original story intentionally scares and destroys. Maybe you might have been able to move it over to England, but it should be a while. Even our story tells - the proprietor - tells it in a feedback, goes back again around 1800. By the end of the 19th century, a strange disobedient worker would be discarded without a thought. And the 20th century? Come on! Give me an explosive deleted break !!! Even around 1800, such behavior did not work very well for the end. And the film's ending? I don't know what it was because I didn't see the whole travesty - I had to stop. This was like setting "Streetcar Named Desire" in Elizabethan England.
