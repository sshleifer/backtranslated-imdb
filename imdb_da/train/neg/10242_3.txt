This film was made by a bunch of white guys who joined school. Well, there is nothing wrong with it, unless it looks like it was made by a bunch of white guys who went to school. 90 percent of cast are white men of the same age. It's almost like seeing a bunch of guys in a boy's camp who turned the camera to himself. The movie has no plot. It simply repeats the same effect of carnage after carnage. There are some fun scenes and comedic bits. But they do not solve the flat monotony. The graphic comics are used to cover the things that were clearly out of their budget or resources to do and didn't do it very well. Everything that can't be done with white guys running around the beach covered with blood is made with cheap animation. <br /> <br /> I went to watch this movie after watching the trailer, making it look like a Tarrentino piece. Now the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get. All the rest of it just repeats the same kind of everyday, scary comedy. It works sometimes, but it gets boring after the same things come to you over and over again. It's more like a string of Satuday Night Live sketches than a movie. It's a hit-over-the-head-with-the-kind comedy. I can see where the story is exciting. But in this movie after apocalyptic America is much like Medevil England. In fact, Wheatlry says the story, ideas came from the era. He plans to do a part 2. I think he thinks he's Tarrentino or maybe a parody thing. <br /> <br /> At the opening in LA, Wheatley mentioned, he'll bring back pretty much the same throw in part 2. He was asked if he could consider a more different cast in the next one he replied, yes yes .
