I watched this movie in its own time, when I had a baby out of wedlock, not only ruined your life, but stamped your child as a bastard. In those days of 'single mothers' who might seem very removed, but it was very true. And I'm not crazy about laughing at anyone who's stuttering either. Between these two problems I had difficulty finding this movie fun. At that time I didn't know who had directed it or what a wonderful reputation he had. I knew who Betty Hutton was, and she made me nervous because she was so frantic. I loved "Bringing Up Baby" but I find this movie just embarrassing. I'm sure the stamp of some church functions was probably spiked, but I was the one who needed a drink after seeing it again. The idea that the girl should be full to "get married" and get pregnant, just added to the misery. An entire city could turn you on in these circumstances, so the result of this movie is really the fun part. Of course, shoot me, I don't like "It's a wonderful life" either.
