Just torture. <br /> <br /> I'd rather see 90 minutes on my computer through 5400 blue screens of death than see this scary drive again - ever. Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. <br /> <br /> You know, the good thing about Swiss cheese is that with the holes you get some cheese: here are the only holes - and the voltage factor? Well, it turns out to be dry in an adrenaline rush and an Olympic sports sport. <br /> <br /> My brain hurts trying to figure out who was ok, they thought about the premise? (I hope not, otherwise there is no redemption) The only consolation is that they had the pleasure of sitting through the rushes. Made for television should not be a synonym for: "Sure, let the horse's inside run loose over the living rooms! Our audience is idiots!" <br /> <br /> I was hooked just to know how it could get worse. This is not a good sign, folks. <br /> <br /> Hallmark was ashamed to release it. <br /> <br /> I was ashamed to see it. <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed. I'm out for a long shower.
