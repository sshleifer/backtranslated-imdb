If you enjoy watching what is to be started as a 2-hour movie in unfinished ambiguities, you will love this movie. Otherwise you will just wonder how they could have made such a movie from something so easy to translate into the big screen as the Inspector Gadget. In the previews of the movie, many scenes were shown which were not in the movie, and within the movie some scenes just aren't sensible. While the movie is a little less than 1 hour and a half, I can only think of a truly memorable moment, and it is just before or during the credits! <br /> <br />
