Sure it's going to be in the west, but the title makes it seem like it's a conventional western. Instead, it's a movie of a woman sheriff. Don't make a mistake, though this is a bad movie about a woman sheriff. She becomes a sheriff when her husband is slain; She is a little bit sorry for this. Her main goal is to go after the villain, who is also a woman, but the villain hires a guy to kill her. So this is what happens, the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa. Quite silly, as someone killed in this movie, the new sheriff has to thank. She had more than a few chances to put the killer behind bars, but I think because she liked him she wouldn't. The killer is also after the mayor for personal reasons, which is also quite stupid. This movie is very boring and not really worth seeing ... it's not one of the better episodes of the MST3000 they made. I can't imagine anyone seeing this without them because it would make it so much more painful. Corman is a low budget director but even he should know better than having people go somewhere and get out another.
