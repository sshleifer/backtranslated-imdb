I had never seen a Tarzan movie before, so when I looked at it, I thought I'd give it a shot. Unfortunately I have to say I was disappointed. Tarzan was over 40 years old and a little overweight. Not how I thought Tarzan would look. And unless I missed it while making a cup of tea, Tarzan never gave his traditional curly scream. In addition, Tarzan lacked swinging through the trees - jumping from wine to wine. <br /> <br /> Oh yes so much for the expectations. Anyway, Jane was there - Monkey Cheeta was there. There was a guy with a guitar there. There were villains and good guys and a romance ... all very harmless and predictable. Nothing bad you understand, but just as well. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best movie to introduce Tarzan: 4/10
