My wife and I both thought this movie a water down, made for television (BBC) version of Manhattan Murder Mystery ... which is even good but not amazing. The story has little interpersonal excitement or chemistry, and not much of a plot. Woody Allen's character is just the kind of water boots that run around the mouth, and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johannsson don't have much more to do. It is quite disappointing to say. Ian McShane's role is just an extended cameo look. <br /> <br /> The first thing that happened to me was "I wonder how much the BBC should pay Woody Allen to remove him from Manhatttan?" He needs the money, and they must have had the appeal to expand their audience beyond the youth market drawn to the two stars. I give this movie 4 stars instead of 3 because it is unnoticed background noise. If you ever want something to wear while knitting or sorting your stamp collection, it will do the job. I wouldn't pay to rent it again.
