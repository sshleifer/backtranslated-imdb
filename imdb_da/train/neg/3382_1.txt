This is one of the worst movie adaptations of a musical ever made. The scene version of A Chorus Line is wonderful. This movie misses the mark in almost every way. Even the casting is amazing. Take Audrey Landers as Val. "Dance 10 Looks 3" is Val song. Walt's story is that she is a fantastic dancer, but a 3 in the look. Yes, she finds a solution, but in the end she is a fantastic dancer. What do they do brilliant filmmakers? They hire an actress who can't dance and is famous for looking good. Way to miss the boat. <br /> <br /> There is choreography. I'm sure Michael Bennett turned in his grave. Why didn't they use their choreography? It really can't be improved.
