Me and my friend rented this movie for $ 2.50. And we both agree on one thing: <br /> <br /> IT'S THE WORST MOVIE ANYTHING GOOD! <br /> <br /> Me and my friend also counted 475 face pictures. (Which represents 95% of the film). In other words: SEE THIS MOVIE, CUSTOMER, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO RECOMMEND WASTE! And I do it! <br /> <br />
