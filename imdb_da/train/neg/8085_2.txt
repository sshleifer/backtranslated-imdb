Oh hilarity! Oh the joy! Another movie that's so bad, it's good! Or I thought. In fact, this misses the "so bad its good" phase and unfortunately goes straight to "could have been so bad, it's good, but they screwed it up and made it badly". <br /> <br /> For a start is too long. Cut half an hour and it could have been more durable. Then set such ridiculous plots as "the man who sabotages the mission to save the earth because he has all the food stored and he gets rich if the mission fails!". You h !. Or the "talking bomb" plot unit last seen in Dark Star. Guess what .... like in Dark Star, the bomb has a malfunction ..... hmmmm. Add in a touch of "we can't act out of a kindergarten game" and you have the sun crisis in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> Light relief must be in the form of Jack Palance (or Jack Pants as we called him in this flick) whose sole purpose in the movie is to drive a child around the desert and phone the baby's father to come Get him ... in the end. Between driving and calling, Jack delivers a meaningless drive and teacher and tile much, but contributes little to the story as it is. In short, he is the best bit of the movie. My award for "The most linear line-delivered straight-faced" goes to Charlton Heston, who, when he meets his eldest son for the first time in ages, notes that his son looks a little "out of shape" while standing there himself with his gut bulging over his waist and in dire need of a captain Kirk Cross. <br /> <br /> Also funny is the bad guy top henchman who has a bright white hairstyle that kept me thinking of Andy Warhol, for some reason. <br /> <br /> Apart from these hilarity, there is little to recommend this movie. The end is a sequence copied from (but mercifully shorter than) the ending sequence from 2001. Tips for enjoying this movie more if you are stupid enough to see it as I did: <br /> <br /> 1. Every time the bomb speaks, imagine it's called Tarquin (Trust me, it works!) <br /> <br /> 2. When Chuck Heston is on the screen and is talking, he must anticipate him by reciting a line from the Apes The planet, like "Get your dirty paws away from me!" or similar. <br /> <br /> 3. When the female leader looks stressed out (this is most of the time), you hope she hopes to have an aneurysm and will die soon. <br /> <br /> 4. During the interminable "broken ship" scenes, we hope that the technical / engineering fans will spray a Scotty ism as "You cannae change the laws of physics!" or any such crap. <br /> <br /> Other than that, do whatever is required to get you through this. I turned off halfway and woke up to realize that I hadn't missed anything, nor had the plot (ridiculous, though it is) advanced anyone. So don't worry about tuning out for a couple, you won't miss anything.
