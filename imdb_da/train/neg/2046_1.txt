I can't believe this movie even made it to video and that video rental stores are willing to put it on their shelves. I asked literary for a refund. Remove the fact that the film has no historical truth and it is still the worse movie ever found in a video store. It's not even good enough to be called a B-rated movie. Don't waste your money or your time on this movie. Just listing on the voice over and the terrible music got me sick. Anyone involved in this movie must be withdrawn from the trade union, give the industry a black mark, but after seeing most of this film, I really do not think anyone involved is a member of the Union.
