I read the book and the book was fascinating. <br /> <br /> This movie, the direction, the manuscript and the play, was completely inadequate. I cringed on the lack of a script that could not follow the novel, a novel that has all the actions, simplicity and courage to illustrate a temerity of a great eventual fact-based story. <br /> <br /> I can see why this movie was not released to the public in most cities. Would never recommend this movie to anyone I know. <br /> <br /> Simply, one of his worst adjustments I've seen turned into a plot less exploring the sky on earth. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was actually the only highlight. But how could it fail when filmed in a beautiful country like Peru. <br /> <br /> For potential viewers, don't waste your time or energy on this flop.
