I actually went back from Asian horror movies some time ago after being completely ill to see the same ghost story. However, I recently got more and more to exploit flicks and it decided to give them another chance. My first port of call was highly rated Director Takashi Miike's highly rated 'Visitor Q'. I had already seen Audition, and while I didn't like it much, I consider it one of the better modern Asian horror movies. So I went into this with reasonable expectations; and unfortunately, only boredom was found. I suppose this movie is actually really clever and it just went over my head, but it was simply a collection of violent and unpleasant scenes with little or no connection between them. Any comparison with the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch is blasphemous as far as I'm concerned; all that Miike has done here is to make a movie; Any intelligence around it has been implemented by pretentious fans, desperate to find some kind of meaning. My headache sat down for about 10 minutes (after a father had sex with her daughter for some reason) and it was not shortened until the movie finally ended. at least twenty-four hours later, or so it seems. Don't make me wrong, I'm not against violence in movies and actually are actively seeking the most infamous movies around; But even though it can be violent, it is meaningless and boring, and I didn't get an ounce of pleasure out of it. Takashi Miike may have many fans, but I'm certainly not one of them; And I certainly hope this is the last time I come in contact with one of his films.
