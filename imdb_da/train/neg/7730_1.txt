Despite much style, flash and glitter, this French musical fails to speak. The voices are repetitive, predictable and boring. The story is uninteresting, like the many characters. <br /> <br /> People break into song and dance, without motivation or reason. Most of the castings carry false wigs and hairpieces, and the sets look hopelessly studio bound. To be honest, this video of the restored version was stopped before the end, so negative an effect it had on me. Certainly a shame to have such a multi-talented cast in so weak a last effort. <br /> <br /> I can see where follow-ups (in this case, the big classic "Umbrellas") often go wrong. One cannot resume, only recreate.
