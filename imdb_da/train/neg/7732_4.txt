Before I wrote this review, I went back and read reviews from others. This movie was a particular disappointment to me as it contains two of my favorite dancers, Gene Kelly and George Chakiris, boasting the often wonderful Michel LeGrand ("Wuthering Heights", "Ice Station Zebra", "The Thomas Crowne Affair") . The dance was stolen, unmotivated and unoriginal, the songs forgotten, the story a joke. Even costuming was not very flattering. Only the photography really got the right mood and spirit. I'm glad other people enjoy "The Young Girls of Rochefort," though I certainly didn't.
