I bought this DVD for Â£ 1 and now I understand why. The action was the worst I have seen in a long time. The lighting and sound are at best foamed. The reason makes little sense even when it is lovely (WARNING: I do not recommend watching this movie when it is sober.) This movie feels like you are watching the home movie of someone who doesn't come out much. It's really a shame that all the very little money spent on this project went to such waste, I look forward to seeing if any of the envoled still has a career, except Eva Longoria, who is the only "star" in this movie It did not seem to be affected by the bad play. I'm sorry that none of this criticism seems constructive, but I want to say one thing to James Cahill, don't try it again. In the words with squirlyem "It is seriously lacking in the good department".
