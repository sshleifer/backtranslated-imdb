Oh, the six-and-gore movie. It's too bad they don't do these more (unless you live in Japan). But if they all appeared like this, it's not a bad thing. The film basically consists of the two lovely vampires who gather johns along a highway and take them home to their castle, have crazy sex with them and then eat them (except the first victim whom they care about for no particular reason). Things are complicated when a woman camping with her husband becomes too curious about these mysterious women she likes to see. It gets really ugly from here. In the end, the two vamps in such a blood clot that they eat all in sight and manage to escape their captured victim. Oops, so much for the secret life. <br /> <br /> The fact that the two vampires don't mind taking off their clothes and fooling each other is the only thing that this movie goes for. Otherwise, it's a bloody, confusing mess (why is their grave so far away from their castle?) That can only be seen for the scarce few minutes of vampire playing time. The only thing I got out of this movie was these two valuable tips: Shooting lesbians won't kill them; it will only make them vampires and not pick up hookers along a road; They are probably vampires. Other than that, it really wasn't worth my time.
