This movie makes no sense there are plot holes that are large enough to drive huge NYPD vehicles through. The signs do not work in any likely way. I want to put my comments on the board, but save your time and money, it's stupid. I can't stand when Hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash bang equipment and uses fancy editing and cool music, and doesn't bother having a plot that is even at the most basic level. But it is great to see Denzel W. wins over the Man, who comes in 3 variants, Jodi Foster, Mayor Bloomberg and Capt. Von Trapp. There is even a cute little child with a video game that is nice.
