Very unnecessary movie with characters that seem so invisible that I really don't care who would do the best (or was it the purpose of the movie to portray some smooth, cold hearted New York City people?) No romance here, no comedy either. Acting is very flat and a very predictable plot. What irritated me most was this constant fun with quotes from classic movies. Man, can you not see that the more you quote, the less significant your own movie becomes? Try to be original yourself! A small budget is no excuse whatsoever, first-time director neither. Crappy, crappy, crappy. No wonder it only cost me a bucks ...
