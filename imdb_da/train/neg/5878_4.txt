As the front cover says "Our time for our time". <br /> <br /> I had to study this filmed version of Hamlet directly after viewing Keneth Branagh's version and it was truly a disappointing experience. <Br /> <br /> This version takes a different approach to several aspects of the game, including sexuality; a very very gay osric and an interesting interaction between hamlet and ophelia. I think for the time being (the 60s) this was a very well executed version of Hamlet, but cannot be compared to Branagh's complete version. <br /> <br /> Just a note ... I found the video on my local video store (in Australia) and I'm actually looking for a Keneth Branagh DVD to buy if such a thing even exists. If anyone knows about one, tell me.
