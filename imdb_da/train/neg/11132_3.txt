A documentary, like any filmmaker, must convey a compelling story. Will Pascoe fail completely in this effort, collapsing uninspired excerpts from Chomsky's wisdom from a visit to McMaster University in Hamilton. The footage has been shot amateurishly and in video. Pasco's only effort to connect the fragments in one whole is by regularly throwing a vague title on the screen: "9-11", "Activism", "Truth." <br /> <br /> Lame. <br /> <br /> Compare this with documentaries such as "The Corporation" or "The Fog of War", which creates narrative drawing material from interviews, stock footage and movie footage. In the end, each one delivers an exciting and insightful message gently and intelligently. <br /> <br /> The only hidden graces of the movie is Chomsky's nonchalantly delivered mission of historic dogma and the fact that time is only 74 minutes. <br /> <br /> One of the more interesting passages was Chomsky's tale of his experience with National Public Radio. He describes the conservative media as more accommodating to divergent views, while NPR's liberal dogma combat jackets are interviewees and dramatically limit their allowed messages. Another media outlet to be skeptical about. <br /> <br /> This documentary is for Noam Chomsky finishers only.
