This movie had such a promise !! What a good idea, an underdog paintball team is fighting for recognition and personal glory, to lose only that speed due to poor dialogue, poor editing and half-written history. The signs in the beginning were interesting, only losing steam halfway to becoming one-dimensional people spitting out tired lines. Perhaps if they spent a little more time on the story and the dialogue, it would have been a good movie, rather than an almost thoughtful effort.
