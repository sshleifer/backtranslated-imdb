Although I had some hopes for this movie, especially because I enjoy the reality of Jason Segel (Freaks & Geeks, Undeclared) so much, I have to say that it was one of the worst movies I've seen in recent memory ( Loser and Dr T and the women are also on that list). Yes, there were a few laughs loud, though the movie could have been so much better. The prerequisite was not bad - scam artists cheating through college meet their fight when they are discovered by someone with a suggestion to them. The problem is that the characters were all so unlikely that I didn't care about any of them. The blackmailer (played by talented Jason Schwartzman) was such a psychopath that it was not fun to see him - he was not shuffled in a particularly funny or charming way, he was just a crazy loser who was actually quite dangerous and not funny see. Editing the movie was difficult to follow - it was cutting between imagination and reality, and it was often unclear, which was what. Only two or three of the gang's scams were really shown, you had to take the belief that they were actually scam artists - showing their schemes would have made for a better movie. The so-called love story was absurd and incredible, in fact it was stupid and poorly written and directed through. I could continue the film's shortcomings, but you get the idea. Not worth the $ 4 rental or the gas it takes to drive to and from the movie store to rent!
