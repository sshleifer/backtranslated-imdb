I love bad shark movies. I really do. I laugh at them hysterically. and the scifi channel had a marathon of those culminating in the premiere of their new original image, hammerhead: shark frenzy. Based on the previews, it looked like it was very entertaining. in fact, a remake of benchley's creature. It was prefaced by a show of shark attack 3: megalodon, which is shark filmhilarity at its best. I was in the mood; I was ready to go. bring it to the hammerhead-mad-scientist man! Oh, god, that movie was wrong. <br /> <br /> wrong, wrong, wrong. <br /> <br /> sick. twisted. MESSED UP. <br /> <br /> This is theoretical reproduction in the worst, my friends. when a skilled girl is brought out of a suspended animation and attached to a table screaming upside down because the shark-human hybrid fostus, the completely crazy "scientist" intentionally implanted in his uterus, desires ... Jesus monkeys. That's what I call worrying. <br /> <br /> It's really how the plot works: Hmmm, thought the evil scientist. my son died of cancer, but I brought him back to life by combining his DNA with a hammerhead shark because sharks do not undermine cancer and further hammerheads reproduce via the placenta. Oh, look! a perfect amphibious creature! I have created the next development of humanity! I KNOW! Let's get him to reproduce! but darned if all these shark genes have made my son bloodthirsty; Instead of raping the hot babes, I continue to send in his little jungle paradise, he still eats him. But check this out! Among the random people who ended up on my research island with the help of a negligible plot twist, is the woman to whom my son was engaged before he died! I bet he'll do HERE! all this leads to an extremely touching and heartfelt reunion: woman: you want to impregnate me? mad scientist: no. he is. (indicates thrashing shark-person in tank) how sweet. <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. ever.
