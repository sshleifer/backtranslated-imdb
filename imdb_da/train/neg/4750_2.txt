I would give it a 2/10. I was really really disappointed. History was poorly developed, for example, the events were short and short, therefore the morality was not clearly brought out. I thought Brenda Song did a good job, but Shin Koyamada seemed to have a hard time dealing with her role. I could see the need to put in Western items in the show, but there are some parts where Chinese items were also needed! The villain, for example. His physical appearance resembled a robot, rather than something out of Chinese culture. The final and the worst mistake was the wrong and distorted facts placed in the show. Others may point out that this is a 'Kid's show' and therefore there is no need for such high standards. However, there are other Disney shows, such as. Mu Lan, who has been much better in terms of history development and presentation. In conclusion, I believe that Disney movies should be investigated better and better planned. A good show is not enough with only a number of martial arts relocations that depend on.
