It's such a weird movie you can call it awful, or if you're sitting with friends, it can give you a murder grin-athon. Strange coming again and again. Shot amateurishly, acting even worse and the directions, maybe none. The special effects are fun, but the music accompanying a flying demon baby will surely be the biggest hit. See if you have time to kill. But don't try to take it seriously. Supposed to be a tribute to the 'Porn Holocaust'. Since I haven't seen it, I can assume from the tribute that it's so bad. Would have given it 1/10, but it gave me a good laugh or two, so it becomes a 3. Excessive gore, the only thing that someone worked on. Stay away if you are squeamish, more fun than laughing. Wonder if the decision makers had a laugh at doing so?
