Thanks to a dull, dimensional manuscript by Neil Simon and the lack of direction from Robert Moore, Chapter 2 becomes a sharp showcase for Marsha Mason, who received his third of four Oscar keys to Chapter 2, giving the same performance here as she gave in Cinnderella Liberty 73), The Goodbye Girl (77), Audrey Rose (78) and Only When I Laugh (81), only this time she does not have a child to pull around. Chapter Two is the third and final feature film for Moore who has previously directed Neil Simon's The Cheap Detective (78) and Murder By Death (76). Caan is miscast, the characters are monodimensional, the dialogue is too analytical, and there are almost no entry details. The first half is a less than captivating, met sweet, sweet romance between a flashing Caan and a chipper Mason, and the sad second half longs for the first half. NYC sites as well as Joe Bologna, and a painfully thin Valerie Harper are irrelevant, but at least they give some welcome distraction. And last and at least there is a horrible song played under the credits.
