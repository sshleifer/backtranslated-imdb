This is the most modest post on IMDb that I have yet to stumble upon. All the previous reviewers work like this is the movie. This is NOT the movie. Rather, it's just a featurette that is an extra on the DVD of the movie "The One". It is also not close to being the 90 minutes it is listed here as. In fact, it is barely over 13 minutes of how cool Jet Li can do martial arts. and his reflections on the film. So yes, this IMDb post is a bit fubar. Don't listen to any of the other reviews as they are ALL wrong. You can trust me because I never feed you, dear reader, BS. <br /> <br /> And that's the truth. I think you can say I'm "the one" reviewer that matters.
