This is the worst brain-damaged, ultra-cheap, super stupid, silly, meaningless piece of garbage I've ever seen, an incredible garbage of instant cult status among fans of the bizarre. If you think Ed Wood's "Plan 9" is bad, well ... let me tell you, "Citizen Kane" looks like one. ¿Special effects? ... again, "Plan 9" is "Star Wars". ¿Acting? ... Thor Johnson is Al Pacino ... so it's beyond bad, really. But if you're looking for that kind of incredible movie, it's for you! I'm a fan of American International for so many glorious horror movies, the Price-Corman-Poe saga and some amazing blaxploitation stuff, but with "Star Creatures" they come right down to the Z level. Of course my 1 out of 10 works in reverse if you like to watch bad movies for fun (the guy playing an Indian boss is amazing) so fun and enjoy ... if you can.
