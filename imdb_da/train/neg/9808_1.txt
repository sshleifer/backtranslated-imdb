Worst show I've ever seen. The story is about a group of teenagers who, for an inexplicable reason, have superpowers, and when they use a special unit, they assume in strange, poorly designed suits. It is when they are not in retarded suits that they are decent. Absolutely not good, but not the worst play I've ever seen. But when they wear their suits, the actors' behavior goes from bad to worse; much much worse. The hyper-animated idiots have a myriad of unnecessary movements they do. Even when they speak, they look like they have seizures. The bad guys are worse than Rangers. Every episode, some weak, idiotic villains, comes up with a plan to destroy Rangers. He then sends a force of hyper-animated aliens to attack Rangers. The Rangers then initialize their 10-hour transformation animation to wipe out aliens. Then, the poorly crafted villain, who can either be an armored villain who actually looks and acts evil, can turn a humanoid killer-like creature with trumpets attached to the back, showing clear signs of mental retardation. Power Rangers fight out the villain, then become the villain of Godzilla, whether by rain or nuclear (yes, they fire the creatures, and the creatures become giants). The Power Rangers spend 5 minutes performing hyper-animated and calling their Zords, which are, of course, toys that the show's manufacturers used special effects to make them look real. The Power Rangers win, the villain gets angry, they all learn a "valuable" lesson, and the show ends. That is it. Twenty-five minutes brainwashing, fake Kung Fu matches.
