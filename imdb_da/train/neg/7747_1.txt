Just the fact that the cover is a drawing, like the old B movies, should give you a warning about the quality of this movie. However, this is not a B-movie. It's a D movie! <br /> <br /> There are no known actors and animals - WOW - it's the worst data animation ever made in the last two decades. <br /> <br /> You almost never see the SCAAARY sabretooth shown on the front. You just hear people screaming, bleeding and dying and you occasionally see a tooth or a tiger paw. It's so amateur! Maybee worth seeing just because it's so bad. Give it to a friend and say, "This is the best movie I've ever seen, and wait for their reaction" He, he. <br /> <br /> The movie is too weak to give it a Spoiler Alert! THIS IS A SPOILER.
