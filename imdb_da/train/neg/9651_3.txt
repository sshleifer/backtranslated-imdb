The movie is a total crap. We have two good actors who are miscast and a head of an actor Salman Khan just to attract the female audience. The story is a boy. The signs are a bit outlined. Non-existent storytelling. No editing to talk about. Ajay Devgan as a Rock Star .. it's a dream in itself. The film contracts to the point of the decadence. The whole charade of Arjun, bringing his Manna to London, let him catch his girlfriend and not let him play at Wembley (Vimbley in the dub process) is absurd. Salman Khan is over the top acting or faking is too painful to watch. I remember seeing some great movies from this producer Vipul Shah, but this is not one of them. It seems that all the good directors fall in exchange for Box Office Mania .. that Mumbai Media Morons has created. This is yet another crap movie in the "Wanted" lines with idiot actor like Salman Khan who doesn't have room in a Good Hindi Cinema. He is good at the Indian cinema when Titanic was for the Winter Cruise Business. On a positive note - I like Asin character dance Bharatnatyam when she switches to Western style dancing when the teacher does not see.
