Oh God! Please, for the love of all that is holy, do not see this movie! That the 82 minutes of my life, I will never come back. Sure, I could have stopped looking halfway through. But I thought it could get better. It didn't. Anyone who actually enjoyed this movie is a seriously ill and twisted person. No wonder we Australians / New Zealanders have a terrible reputation when it comes to making movies. Everything about this movie is horrible, from acting to editing. I don't even usually write reviews here, but in this case I will make an exception. I only wish someone had warned me before I hired this disaster
