I found Horrorvision almost unattainable. In just 70 minutes I found myself pressing the fast-forward button again and again. The action was of 'if I scream and say *** k much I'm intense' school. And the story was, at best, a scenario that wasn't yet full. <br /> <br /> Whilst I never go full moon to big movie production, I've never seen them as bad a piece of junk like this.
