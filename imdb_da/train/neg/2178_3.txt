I would have enjoyed this movie a little more hadn't been to Jason (Herb) Evers constantly harping on experiment. Many early reviewers of The Seven Samurai accused Toshiro Mifune of overactive. But as more and more critics considered the film, they saw it as targeted. Of course, Jason Evers is not Toshiro Mifune, and his overactive is exactly that. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors in this B-classic were pretty good actors, minus Evers and showgirls. If you see this movie, you would have noticed Evers shouting almost every line, that is, until he smokes and blows the smoke cool out of his nose. <br /> <br /> The special effects were par for the course in a B movie like this. In retrospect, there is not much that stands out in my mind as fantastic good or bad for this movie.
