Sondra Locke stinks in this movie, but then she was still a terrible actress. Unfortunately, she pulls everyone else (including = real girlfriend Clint Eastwood down the drain with her. But what did Clint Eastwood think of him starring in this? A reading of the script should have told him that this was about to be a real string.It is an unusually weak story, basically no story or plot at all Add in bored, bad action, even from the normally good Eastwood.There is absolutely no action except a few arguments and as far as I was concerned For, this movie is at the top of the pile of natural sleep enhancers Wow! Can a movie be more boring? I seem to see paint dry or the grass may grow more fun. A real stink. this .
