Having seen men behind the sun, I think I was hoping for a style and technique development to match the large scale of this movie. I was also quite interested in seeing someone make a hard-hitting fact-based fictitious statement of what happened during this most infamous Japanese atrocities, but it is not. This plays as a bottom-to-mid-tier European Nazi exploitation movie from the 70s - eg. SS Experiment Camp etc (maybe more like Deported Women of the Special Section actually). Admittedly, it has a larger scale and more people are running around, but it changes to the same cheap and eerie unit of lots of unhappy non-actors who even fall to the sound of ridiculously fake shots, spiced up with occasionally bad executed "shock" sequence. The rather horrible documentary film is roughly spliced ​​between scenes so chopped that even these real pictures are robbed by much of their power. Watch Channel 4's 'The Holocaust' (recently released (still running?), From 1 No 2006) to a truly disruptive documentary on the wickedness of the war (with excellent in-context use of actual recordings). This is the type of treatment that Nanjing's horror deserves, not this hackneyed exploitation waste (a better-made movie minus the disrespectful use of stock footage would have been fine, but again it's not even a very good movie). Rating: 3 (5 as exploitation, 1 as treatment of the subject).
