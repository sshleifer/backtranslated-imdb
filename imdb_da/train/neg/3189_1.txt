I think it goes to prove that Joe Don Baker will do everything for a buck. The concept with the film was not very good to start with. This movie has so many bad things about it, I don't know where to start. The action is horrible. The kinematics are at best marginal. The soundtrack was pretty bad. The result is terrible. There is a reason why this movie ended up at the Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before I wrote this, and I can't believe that 9 people actually thought this "movie" was excellent. They must have wanted the two go-go dancers. Finally justice would be if they locked this stink in the film vault outside Wichita and never let anyone see it again! A 1 out of 10 rating is far better than it deserves.
