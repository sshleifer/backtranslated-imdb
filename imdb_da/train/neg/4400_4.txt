One of Frances Farmers earliest films; At 22 o'clock she is absolutely beautiful. Bing Crosby has a big voice, but the songs are not his best. Martha Raye and Bob Burns are interesting, but their comedy, probably amazing in its time, is truly corny today. Roy Rogers also seems in a singing role. In my opinion, it is only worth seeing if you are a Frances Farmer fan, and possibly a Bing Crosby fan.
