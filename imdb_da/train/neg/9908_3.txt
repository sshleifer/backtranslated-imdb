I gave this 3 stars out of a possible 10 - because the stories are open and inexplicable, and because of the nauseating scenes that someone eats in an extremely obnoxious way, plus scenes of a decaying corpse. <br /> <br /> None of the above should be displayed in such a graphical manner. <br /> <br /> The movie's plot, as it is, relates to three loosely coherent stories, none of which conclude satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> Bounty Hunter, played by Bruce Dern, is the sign that connects all three vignettes. First we have Dylan McDermott, look darn fine, like a wanted criminal flying to Mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter as he drives through a border city and spots a sad shape saloon girl played by Helen Hunt. <br /> <br /> Then we have one of the Hemingway girls, not sure which one plays a western woman on the lonely border that goes over to look for a neighbor, an attractive redhead as we soon realize, has been out in the badlands a little too long. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie returns to the bounty hunter and what happens to him, with the final scene in the film completely beyond rational understanding.
