This is what happens when you live in China and the local video store runs thinly on English-language titles? You are blessed with this work of what seems to be, yes, Romanian film. Nevertheless, I think it has a real comic potential. <br /> <br /> Spoilers follow technically: <br /> <br /> Although I don't think it would actually ruin anyone's point of view asking why a movie set in a casino has a scene of beach archery, even in flashback. This mystery and many other violence continue to be exploited by desperate comedians, perhaps when they are stuck in Bucharest. Let me also wonder why perfect people are able to abuse movies like this. That's sad.
