After reading some good reviews about this movie, I thought it was time I went to see it. Well, I don't know why I bothered me. Basically, this family is left with a clue that leads to a great stash of old treasure hidden by the knight of the temple during the War of Independence. Apparently it had to be kept out of British hands at all costs. Firstly, why did knights say move the tax from Europe to America? How did Nic Cage's character find that 'Charlotte' was actually a ship? How can they figure out all the traces and puzzles in a minute? And how could two people suddenly become master thieves and steal what is probably the best guarded piece of paper in the world? These are just some of the plot holes in this inane piece of Hollywood action gone wrong. Cage has been in some amazing action movies - 'Face-Off' and 'The Rock' - so why did he lower himself to this? Will he be too old? His character is really annoying really. In a way, this "ordinary" guy steals the Declaration of Independence, overrides thieves with weapons, escapes from the FBI, and generally seems invincible. The whole movie makes no sense, and all in all, it was a disappointment.
