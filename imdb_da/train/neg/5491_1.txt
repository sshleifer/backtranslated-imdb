We should have been suspicious of discovering that, with only two minutes to light, they were the only ones there. Only five others were enrolled before the movie began. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to redeem this movie at all. The action is horrible (especially Ms Hurley). Scripture is banal. The effects we have seen a million times. The movie is the worst we've seen. Meandering and disjointed. No one also laughed at the children. <br /> <br /> We left after 25 minutes. It would have been before if my wife hadn't gone to a hot dog !!! <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money on this movie. If there is nothing else to look at your cinema, buy some drinks, popcorn and hot dogs and watch some people. You will have a much more enjoyable time !!! <br /> <br />
