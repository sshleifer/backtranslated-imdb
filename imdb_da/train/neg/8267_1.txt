I start to see a pattern in the movies I give a 1 to. They are almost all movies that my wife made me see. Maybe I should stop trusting her taste in movies. Anyway, this is typically drivel aimed at pre-teen girls, but made even worse than usual. Again, the author broke the cardinal rule of any movie. He made the protagonist unlikely. She starts by being a complete b * tch to her friend at the beginning, and then finds out when she gets 30, that she is basically a sharp person (has affairs, etc.). Why F would we feel for this person? Okay, let's say we can get past it. Jennifer Garner is as far from attractive as you can get without having any kind of deformity. I don't know if it's her or the author's fault, but her character goes far beyond my threshold for irritation. Here's a tip for future filmmakers: 13 year olds are not entertaining, they are annoying. Far away was the most embarrassing moment in the movie as they danced to "Thriller". Sacred crap that was painful. It showed her to practice the dance in the beginning. It explains why she knows it, but a whole club full of people?!? Argh !!! The Macarena would be more credible! Suddenly she is completely incompetent and has no idea how to do her job and nobody knows it? At least Tom Hanks' character of "Big" had a job that made sense to a child. These body-switching / child grown-up overnight movies are really getting out of hand and this is by far the worst one yet.
