To see how horrible The Shield is, write pages and pages so it is enough to say that it is a monument to poor conducting. <br /> <br /> "When directors go away" should have been the title of this production. In fact, the directors must immerse their work with a sense of visual style and storytelling that brings the story forward. <br /> <br /> How does the camera constantly change and play with the zoom lens a "style"? How does history advance? Of course, there are also "editing by random numbers" nonsense. It seems to be hip to cut randomly. <br /> <br /> Doing good editing is too much work. It did too much work for most to see The Shield, which turned out to be one of the most overheated and undiscovered shows of all time.
