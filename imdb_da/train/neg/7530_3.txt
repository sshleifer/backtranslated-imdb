I found this movie boring, monotonous and quite unattractive with a hurry, shallow "optimistic" ending that didn't ring properly to the overall story. The following signs through a weekend of horrible events, unfriendly attitudes and bad news are just not my idea of ​​a clear and interesting movie, and I got very tired of its "one note" theme and couldn't wait for it to end - actually I stopped almost halfway through. The whole movie just seemed meaningless and wandering, and the characters were mostly depressing and uncomfortable, even though the play was good. A little movie with little ambition and little appeal - sorry, but it just didn't do with me, and I love good little movies! This did not scare even though I watched it and hoped and trusted it would. I was disappointed, especially after two local reviewers put it on their "Best 10 of the Year" list. I strongly recommend seeing "The House of Sand" instead - now there is a good little movie!
