*** Possible Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> When I saw this today, I had some expectation of how it would be, not too high, but not too low. It was not something I had expected at all, but it seems that the filmmakers could not think of what kind of film to make. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie, it is somewhat mysterious and a little bit exciting, but it will soon change to some ridiculous scenes - very obvious scenes ... . The end is the most ridiculous of all though almost splatter / comedy ... <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it doesn't have good scenes, it's just that the movie never gets "hell". <br /> <br /> Movie-Man
