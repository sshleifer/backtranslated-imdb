I saw this movie a few days ago ... what the hell was that? <br /> <br /> I like movies with Brian O'Halloran, they are fun and fun. When I saw a name for this title and genre, I thought well, this could be really good ... a parody for slashers or another gorefilm ... but ... then I read an example and thought it might be good anyway. .. but it wasn't ... my opinion: if they like movies, they look a bit like documentaries, with a little comedy trying some Moore's movies or Alien autopsy, they are really about something. this one was empty. <br /> <br /> Put a comedy to the title ... no comment ... really bad joke
