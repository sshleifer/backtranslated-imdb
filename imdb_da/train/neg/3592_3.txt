For a fan series I have to admit that Hidden Frontier is not that bad at all. But reviewing this series cannot be based on whether it is a fan series or not. The initiative itself is commendable. Also creativity. I expect they are people with ordinary jobs and a big enthusiastic heart for Star Trek. But do all this work. Drag all these resources. Take all the time and still all the mistakes. <br /> <br /> First of all, the play and the lines are terrible. For most people. The dialogues belong in a 70's military show, not in Star Trek. The captain (Mr Squinty) looks like he's breaking in laughter at any time. And most characters just read their lines. The directors should be aware that "retake" is not just a word in the dictionary. But I also guess that the series is made as "Two Takes Frakes", which instructed many of the TNG episodes and movies. I couldn't help thinking that most of the actors are typical Trekkies. Without going deeper into that assumption. <br /> <br /> My main concern about the whole project is the quality of the releases. When they first decided to spend so much time and resources on this series - why didn't they make them available in decent quality? Using fast time format, with low low resolution is a waste of talent. Even the episodes "higres" are considered poor quality compared to the standard quality series released in. Using the Xvid codec, with a larger resolution and file size would have improved the experience massively. If there was a problem with the problem, creating a torrent tracker would be resolved. <br /> <br /> Let us hope that the crew will decide to brush up the series and perhaps release it on DVD, giving it the quality of the project deserves.
