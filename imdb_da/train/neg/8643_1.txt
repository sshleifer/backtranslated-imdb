A Blair Witch-War Movie that's as much of a downdown as Bwitch was! The title says it all, save your money and your time and spend it on a good movie like "Once Upon a Time in America", "The Shawshank Redemption" or "Enemy at the Gates" (if you want to see a big "war" -film) etc. This movie, if it was a baseball team and the big leagues were high and Single A was rookies, then this movie was High School ball. It was recorded as if it were a gymnasium's drama club that filmed with their father's old camera. Sure they went into a hostile area (to make a movie), but I don't call that brave, here we call the stupid stupid! This is a past all the way! Now you have to see it and then tell me what you think.
