This is one of the most annoying, nonsense films I have ever had through the accident. Every time it started to look, it could be good, more sepia tone flashbacks came out, followed by paranoid idiocy masquerading as social commentary. The protagonist, Maddox, is a manipulative, would be rebel who lives in a mansion apparently without parents or responsibilities. The support is much more sympathetic and interesting, but unfortunately never developed. Nor do we really understand the John Stanton character, who apparently affects Maddox to commit rebel acts. At one point I thought "Aha! Maddox is just nuts and secretly make up all those messages from escaped psychic patient Stanton! Now we come somewhere!" But of course this is not the case, and the whole film turns out to be meaningless, both from Maddox's perspective and from the viewer. Where is Ferris Bueller when we need him?
