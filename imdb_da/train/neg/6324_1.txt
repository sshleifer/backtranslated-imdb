I spent eight years running cinemas in the 80s and 90s. This was by far the worst movie I ever showed to the public. One thing that made it so bad was that it set off trying to be a fantastic and inspiring movie. Even the great Gregory Peck couldn't save this horrible piece from being far less than mediocre. Jamie Lee Curtis showed in an early non-horror movie that she had not yet learned to act (she is still trying, but it doesn't get much better). <br /> <br /> I'm sorry and here's the spoiler, the international nuclear weapon will never happen just because it makes kids afraid to play little league baseball! Even the shows on Nick and The Disney Channel are not stupid enough to try to make us believe it. <br /> <br /> It's not worth you wasting it to watch it on cable TV. It is not worth the price of a movie rental; Your dollar would be better spent on an extra package of microwave popcorn to go with the other movie you chose (because it can only be better than this).
