Michael Callan plays a smarmy photographer who nevertheless seems to be considered a perfect "catch" by any woman who runs over him; Could this have anything to do with the fact that he also co-produced the movie? He is a "hero" as it is very difficult to empathize with, so the movie is in trouble right from the start. But there are problems that do not end there. It has the production values ​​of a TV movie (check out the head made of clay or something near the end), and the final cheat in a way that I can't reveal if anyone wants to watch the movie (extremely unlikely). Let's just say the killer knows more than we were told he knows. (* 1/2)
