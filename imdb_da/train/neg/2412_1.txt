This movie is yet another in the long line with no budget, no effort, no talent movie recorded on video and got a beautiful cover to force unsuspecting tenants into the video store. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what watching this movie is like, take a video camera and some red food coloring and film yourself and your friends walking around the neighborhood at night, cruel and "attacking" people. Congratulations, you just made "Hood of the Living Dead"! Now see if a distribution company will buy it from you. <br /> <br /> I've seen a low budget, shot at videos showing talent from the filmmakers and actors or at least the effort, but it has neither. Avoid unless you are a true masochist or amused by badly made horror movies.
