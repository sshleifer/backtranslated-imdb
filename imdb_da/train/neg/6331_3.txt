Mr. Mike was probably the most misanthropic comedian all the time, so I was interested in seeing what he would do with total creative control over a movie. Unfortunately, it is unpacked, but not because the jokes aren't fun - some (I don't want to say most) of them are and actually did Mr. Mike did a good job translating his mentally unbalanced records into visual gags. The problem is that the technical quality (set, lighting, sound, editing, you name it) is so daunting that the movie is unacceptable. Some outfit called "PKO Productions" gets the producing credit, but it doesn't seem to be produced at all; It looks more like Mike stole one of the cameras from the SNL set and made it all in one afternoon. I am aware that Mike's goal was to torture the audience, but even it deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to actually see, hear, or understand whatever it is that should be shocking. Nevertheless, the DVD is not a complete waste: it contains an eulogy for O'Donoghue by Bill Murray and three "Mr. Mike's Most Lovedly Beloved Bedtime Stories" from SNL. Plus, the "cat swimming" section of the movie is a great scene to be caught watching if you want to freak someone out. 3.10
