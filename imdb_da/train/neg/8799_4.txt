Kudos for the patience of Paul Muni who spent hours and hours in the makeup room every day to see that part of Zola. Muni was one of the biggest stars in the 1930s, and I wonder how many people today - other than classic movie buffs - know something about it. He was a giant in the company for at least a decade. He could have won the Academy Award for this achievement, which would have given him two on each other when he won it to play Louis Pasteur the year before. My own opinion is that although he used to exaggerate a bit, I still think he was one of the great actors of the "Golden Age". Whatever he played; You got riveted on the screen and looked at him. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the Pasteur role, I thought this story tasted a bit too much of what we've seen in the last 60 years: go overboard to make a liberal whole. Even in 1937, Hollywood could not repress its contempt for police or military. Here is a point to tell us how "corrupt" these organizations are. Filmmakers just love it when authority is challenged and defeated. In this respect, this film is far ahead of its day since we have seen this great time since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> It should be noted, however, that facts support this story. It in no way diminishes Zola's performance as a social reformer, to get rid of certain evil. Good for him! I wish they had spent more time showing it than concentrating on an experiment.
