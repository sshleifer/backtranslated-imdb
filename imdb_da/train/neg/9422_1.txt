This film describes the experiences of a couple of hit men (one of them Burt Reynolds), a prostitute and two dragons in a couple of hours on a night in Miami. The converging stories eventually bring all people together at a place and time. The movie was mildly entertaining, but the big problem was that everything was happening at night, and many scenes were literally undervalued to the point that it was impossible to see what happened. In a few scenes, you can actually see where they were trying to "stretch" the development process to save the images. Someone didn't know how to operate a movie camera. Great that this movie was even released!
