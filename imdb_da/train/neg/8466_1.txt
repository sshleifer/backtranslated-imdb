Words fail me. <br /> <br /> And that's not common. Performed properly, it could have been great, fun spoof B movie sci-fi, but unfortunately it wasn't. Rarely in the drama area, so many competent players have fought so in vain with such a dog-breakfast of a script. I can only endorse the previous reviewer's comments - go clean in the bathroom. In fact, do something except watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Positives: Lucy Beeman's nose. Negatives: Everything else. <br /> <br /> Most used line: "This is not everywhere". <br /> <br /> If only any plastic surgeon could face such a fate.
