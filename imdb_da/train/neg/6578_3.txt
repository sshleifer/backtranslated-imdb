Unentertaining, uninvolving the hybrid of "Cruel Intentions" and "Wild Things", but it is not as good as any of these cute minigames. It's about the acting sheriff, Artie (Taye Diggs), who is called to investigate a near-overdose of drugs on a full-bodied high-end university but to keep it on the low. As he digs deeper, he thinks it's much more than it seems at first sight. We follow Alicia, the girl who also handed flashbacks. About 90 minutes if this movie was welcomed initially, it would have worn it out. This movie brings absolutely nothing new to the table. But that's the only movie so far that has Miss Swain topless, so the quality is higher just for that. <br /> <br /> My character: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Dominique Swain becomes the topless fix of a "Happy Campers" bug); another girl is topless <br /> <br /> Anti-eye candy: more men ass than girl often
