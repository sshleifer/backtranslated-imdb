You can't imagine how I was looking forward to King of the Ants. As a massive Gordon fan, I await the European premiere with evil expectation. Especially since I loved Dagon - Gordon's last performance - so much. King of the Ants performed here in my country, and it was Gordon himself who came to present it. Unfortunately I couldn't go and congratulate him for that afterwards. King of the Ants is his most uninspired and mediocre movie to date. In fact, the quality level never exceeded standard television thriller standards. The plot overview is terribly routine and with the exception of a few poor scenes, the typical Gordon touch is never recognized. On top of that, it already has weak scripts more holes than a Swiss bowl of cheese! It involves a young wannabe crook who is hired to commit a murder. Of course he does. And of course they don't pay him. And of course he falls in love with the victim's wife. And of course he takes care of. Only the sequences where the guy comes down to a madman's spiral are worth mentioning, and they are the only ones to remind you that you still see a Stuart Gordon movie. The performances are below average with McCenna as the heroic lowlife, George `Norm Peterson 'Wendt as the shabby bastard and Kari Wuhrer as the good-hearted sex bomb. Extremely illogical things are constantly happening, and the dullness of history gets annoying very quickly, while the makeup effects are not enough to satisfy amateur horror fans themselves. I read a few other comments to King of the Ants and claim that it is Gordon's best since it is finally a thought-provoking and mature movie. Well, if that's the case. I remain more immature and give Re-Animator another view, thank you very much. Oh well, I think all good instructors run out of steam and inspiration in the end. Just bad it also overcame Stuart Gordon.
