I should never have seen this movie. The movie's style can be considered artistic for some, but it is considered to be migraine-inducing for me. I think it might have had an interesting plot, but since I couldn't see it for long stretches of time, I missed a lot. The flickering images and stop motion filming marked my brain. I stopped looking midway through and won't be back for another attempt. I suppose if I was home alone in my own guy some dark and stormy evenings, it could only be the ticket ... PS Not sure if the lighthouse / movie style can be considered a spoiler, but I will not be blacklisted on my first review;)
