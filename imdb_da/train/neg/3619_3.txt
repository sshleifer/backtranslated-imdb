Basically, there is a family where a little boy (Jake) believes there is a zombie in his closet and his parents are struggling all the time. <br /> <br /> This movie is slower than a soap opera ... and suddenly Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, when making a movie, decide if it's a thriller or a drama! As a drama, the film can be seen. Parents are divorce and argue as in real life. And then we have Jake with his closet, which completely destroys the whole movie! I expected to see a BOOGEYMAN-like movie, and instead I looked at a drama with some pointless thriller spots. 3 out of 10 just for the well-played parents and descent dialogs. As for the shot with Jake: just ignore them.
