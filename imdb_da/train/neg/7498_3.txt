Spike Lee has been declining since his early successes, and this mess does nothing to help. I looked at my watch often hoping the movie would end or come to that point. Lee's first movie with an all-white cast is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> What's the point? That Italians swear and like funky sex, but not with their wives? If I wanted to see Scorsese, I would go to a scorsese movie. The incredibly lame Godfather character only adds to the stereotype. <br /> <br /> I have admired several of Lee's films, especially "Do the Right Thing". This movie is a waste of time.
