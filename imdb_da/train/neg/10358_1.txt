I have read the whole 'Wrinkle in Time' book and saw the movie. The film contained all the elements in the book, but since the book was 190 pages and the film was 2 hours, it felt really spoiled with too many effects and bad plays. <br /> <br /> A wrinkle of time is about a girl named Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin will gather to find Meg's father and get out of Camazotz Island. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the movie is really a stinker. The action is horrible, the direction is ridiculous, and so far, the situations are not necessary. I was really crushed to see the same person Madeleine Engle, who wrote the book and made the movie, made a great book and a horrible movie. The action is worse than any straight-to-video play. Yes, I must admit that there were cool effects. But seriously, they were all done terribly and not in any way possible in any way. If you read the book, you will be crushed by the movie. I wish I could give it a 0 but unfortunately I can only give it 1. A half could have been useful.
