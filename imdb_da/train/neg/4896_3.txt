I start with what I liked. <br /> <br /> I really liked the songs, everything about them was great, costumes, music, lyrics (as long as the translation was good :)), choreography, everything. <br /> <br /> I loved the crab scene and the cooking scene. <br /> <br /> But it's about it. <br /> <br /> I get it, arty cinema, blablabla but too much is too much. Too much silence (it was interesting for an hour, but two hours of hearing and moaning from time to time, really ...), too much boredom (no movies should ever be boring, no matter how deep it was!), For very pornographic scenes (I really understand, I understand they filmed a porn movie there, but really it really is too much) I really think the cinema should be to watch and this is definitely not reliable in any way. <br /> <br /> 3 stars for the songs.
