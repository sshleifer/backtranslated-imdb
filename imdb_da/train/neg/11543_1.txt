Although I use this site quite often to see how other people rated what I think is challenging or just easier movie, after watching this movie on film four last night, I felt compelled to write something down, though It just helps clean me once again. The movie was possibly the most thorough experience I've ever had - the main characters played by Danny Dyer (23? Or?) And Gillian Anderson (who will always be Scully as Leonard Nimoy will always be Spock) had no real substance about them - I am not sure if the film's first half hour did not make the final cut, but surely in a revenge movie, you would like some empathy with the victims ... here I could not break less. In fact, the only sign I was worried about was the dog, where the deer came in near second. And both animals worked out Dire (sic) and Scully, who were frankly horrible. I guess you are only as good as the script you get and I would like to thank the authors, producers, the director and all the casting that lasted to waste 90 minutes of my life and some very good electricity.
