It's fun and fast. <br /> <br /> There is no way on Earth that the actor playing Mat could be eighteen. But the most important thing is that he acts eighteen very convincingly. It must be a credit for his audition that he convinced them to throw him. I soon accepted him as a naive young national. <br /> <br /> While his was the best performance, most of the others were also very engaging. In particular, the interaction between police officers was natural and balanced and worked very well. <br /> <br /> It's only about 45 minutes long, so the plot is not complex. More key is the style of it all. It is very smooth and vibrant, and the scenes are atmospheric, especially from the fact that all the colors are very rich. The gangland is identified for foreign audiences, but still manages to be clearly Australian.
