Well, I hate Hollywood, but love the cinema so I'll see these cruddy movies in theaters. And I hoped Vanilla Sky would be good. I hoped they would either keep the original "Open your eyes" exactly the same or they would make it their own. Well, it happened to be a little bit of both and it sucked. <br /> <br /> It started well. I love Radiohead. I wish there was more of it. But in the end we listen to Good Vibrations by The Beach Boys. Talk about a wide range of suction between. They had one or two good songs in the club and maybe a few others, but why oh why would they bladder GV under climax. It was more annoying than confusing or overt. Especially when it has nothing to do with the plot. At least put some sense behind the songs. Kid A = primary. Whatever he did. <br /> <br /> He also did a bang up job with the club scene. That was cool. Otherwise, the movie was a big ball of arrogance. As if the audience would get the movie. Those who would make it read subtitles and the rest will not. It's as simple as that. The motivation was completely turned up. I didn't understand the Diaz motivations (had they not done chicken soup the night before?) And some of the others. And I hate Kurt Russell. Get overboard. Tom Cruise can't act (especially in these types of movies [ie Eyes Wide Shut]). And the elevator. I understand it. In any case, they tried to improve the original with a crappy American rock soundtrack and crappy angles and good screenplay and glossy processing, and it would have helped if the crowe hadn't turned it up. <br /> <br /> Major disappointment.
