This movie is called "Plan 9 from Joseph Smith." I think its inferiority is underappreciated. The playwright seems to have read Paul Ehrlich's "Population Bomb (1968)" and designed a musical response made specifically for Mormons. The whole game is to have as many children as you can, is part of the "Heavenly Father's" (God's) plan. And all that stands in the way of having more babies is very bad. get it? <br /> <br /> This version was filmed in 1989, which is confusing. it is utah, so it looks and feels like 1983, the game was actually written in 1973, and of course, the theology is part 1840, part battlestar galactica. some of the actions take place on the ground and some in the "pre-existence, a purposeless space where annoying children are waiting to get their bodies so they can come down, try not to slam the door of the missionaries, lose their shots in heavenly glory. > <br /> It's so stadiumy as they come, but don't let the poor theater pamper your appreciation for this demented Mormon universe, where the 'cool kids' are all in population control (presumably) advising their parents not to have more kids! With large families, at that time, the play was written, the cultural norm of the LDS community, and more importantly, considered part of God's plan, the Church has since made a 180, and has made family planning a choice of parents, and large families are far less the cultural norm now.The whole film's doctrinal premise for a modern-day mormon! <br /> <br /> ahhh but it's really just as good as the music. is that just won't let this movie die of the 1970s death it was pre-determined for. Brother and Sister sing some love songs to each other that make you wonder if maybe something else was going on there - hint. And the tough, cool kids make new kids on the block look like metallica. so bowl for all that! Collect the family around, make some jell-o shooters and enjoy the show! <br /> <br />
