The only real highlight of the movie is the sneaking guy's death and the reaction of the surviving figures to it. <br /> <br /> In any other way, this movie is a very lame rip-off of Jaws, Lake Placid and Alligator, with a little bit of Godzilla (1998) thrown in. <br /> <br /> As is standard for a 1990-style horror movie, the two non-star women each take their clothes at least once. The female management does not, as she obviously has a better agent. <br /> <br /> The entire film surrounds the shooting of a really stupid extreme sport called blood surfing, where surfers cut and surf in haunted waters. In this film, there is also a huge saltwater crocodile in the area. People are eaten. The movie ends. <br /> <br /> I don't mind a bad horror movie, but I really hate a boring bad horror movie, which it certainly is.
