I can't recommend this movie as a data movie. Gary Oldman's semi-autobiographical account of life on a South East London property is a fierce, Beckettian account of one of Dante's squares of hell, honestly. In the middle of it, Ray Winstone has done this kind of character before, but never so well. The movie opens with him and orders drinks at a pub - that's all - and you're already gripped by a feeling of frustration, self-confusion and barbarism that he exhibits in many different ways during the film. There is an actress master class. Of course, it has stymied and disposed of the need for a film in a drama like this, and Winstone is matched by Kathy Burke as her long-suffering wife who absorbs and ultimately rejects her unbearable behavior. Charlie Creed-Miles makes a stand to be like fusing dream son Billy, though he may have wondered sometimes exactly what he was doing. Gary Oldman leads close to the actors and maximizes claustrophobia in their council's flat shell. 4.10
