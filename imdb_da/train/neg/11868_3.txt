At first glance, this movie has everything a psycho needs: a vampire story with a "not under 18" restriction, full of hypervold, drugs, gore, sex (including lesbian sex), some fanatical zealots, and even a gay necrophilic cop! But then this movie is a sequel to bad story (so thin), bad acting - with a ridiculous English accent, which makes you think you see a bad Monty Python - bad music (the 80's hard rock), the video tape is terrible the end is a real shame ... Plus scenes of sex are ridiculous, do not make very impressive. And those vampires reflect in a mirror and don't even fear daylight! You will be very disappointed unless you see it as a "Space Mutiny" or "Troll 2". I hope Bloodlust one day comes to the bottom 100 because it's its right place. <br /> <br /> If you have friends and enough beer, it can still be fun to watch. <br /> 3/10
