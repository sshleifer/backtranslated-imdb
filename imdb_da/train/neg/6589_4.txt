I'm afraid I didn't like this movie very much. Apart from a few sparse graces, it's not something to write home about. <br /> <br /> J-horror has been boomed for the past five and six years, but the movies themselves have been repeated in more than one account and carbon copies of an earlier success. This is one of them. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is a supernatural slasher movie. The beginning is promising with chilling scenes from a gazebo, where a dead girl has her eyes graphically sewn together, but shortly after they open. But after that it is quickly downhill for this flick. <br /> <br /> To be kind I start with the things I like about "Gawi". On the plus side, the visuals of the picture are, and the film looks good for its type. For those who like their horror movies, there are a couple of nicely performed (no puns) murder scenes. We also get a couple of good voltage sequences / set-pieces. <br /> <br /> However, there are also a number of drawbacks ... First of all, and my big complaint about this movie is that the plot jumps and jumps back and forth in time with an alarming intensity. Usually, this is not a problem for me, but here, when the students look exactly the same, no matter what age they are, I was confused for more than one occasion. The performance is okay I guess (a little hard to tell when you can't speak), but seems a bit stiff. And for a horror movie I don't think it was scary enough. For a while I was quite boring indeed. <br /> <br /> Being a fan of giallo movies, I expected quite a lot from "Nightmare", but unfortunately I was quite disappointed.
