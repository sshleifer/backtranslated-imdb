Now isn't it? Considering all the good work done by danzel, clive and jodie, the film never grew to anything more than a horrible die-hard / hoist movie copycat. Yes, a few jokes, no absolutely unpredictable terms, to be honest are the only unpredictable moments there, because both the instructor and the editor made some stupid mistakes, it's a shame to them and a waste of time for us. If anyone can tell me why in the ground they dug a hole in the safe, who the hell is Rebe and how in the world did they know that the diamonds were in that cell, it could just make my day, but it seems Spike asks us to take too many things into this for granted and not raise our eyebrows when something looks stupid. It's just another study movie, relax and enjoy ...
