This movie has all the eartags of too many chefs that destroy the pot. Based on Shielah Graham's autobiography, it seems that the powers are not enough to leave. They could not decide whether this was Graham's story or Fitzgerald's history, and also how much they should soft pedals whose history it turned out to be. So a movie that could have been a story of two fascinating (Fitzgerald) and infamous (Mrs. Graham) personalities becomes a dull, uninhibited soap opera that tells us a little bit either. Added to this, there is absolutely no period feeling other than in 1959. The bloody scene follows the clumsy scene and we have no idea where we are in history or how much time goes on. But - and this saved the movie for me - Kerr has never seen lovelier, and Peck is always a very nice man. They really make a beautiful, mature couple, and I only want them to have better material to work with. There is a scene that works - Scott goes after Shielah in a drunken state, and to see these two normally refined stars knocking each other around is very disturbing and giving some fleeting ideas of what's going on in a relationship like theirs. Apart from that, the film is a wasted opportunity and nowhere near the classic building of other Wald produced soaps from 1950 (PEYTON PLACE, THE BEST OF EVERYTHING).
