I heard this movie was much more stylistic than movie director Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch) had addressed before, the problem is, it may be too stylistic. Basically, Jake Green (Jason Statham) is released from prison after seven years in solitude, and within two years he plays lots of money. He is ready to seek revenge on the rapacious casino owner who got Jake sent to jail, Dorothy 'Mr. D 'Macha (Ray Liotta). In the process, doctors tell Jake that he has three days left to live when he is dying of a rare blood disease, and Macha puts men on him. Loan sharks Zach (Vincent Pastore) and Avi (Andr√© Benjamin) demand Jake pay their money back and do some odd jobs for them. The movie is filled with Jake telling through some flashbacks, and over the last three days before coming to the great revelation of Zach and Avi and Macha, I assume that is what it was. Also starts with Terence Maynard as French Paul, Andrew Howard as Billy, Mark Strong as a Sorter, Francesca Annis as Lily Walker, Anjela Lauren Smith as Doreen and Elana Binysh as Rachel. These are sequences that involve a little bit of animation, repetitive lines twice in different perspectives, and changing speeds for moments, and all these are annoying for confusion and boredom, making it a stupid crime drama. Very poor!
