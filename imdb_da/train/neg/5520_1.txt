This film was portrayed in trailer as a comedy. It's an extreme tragedy. It left me sick in my stomach. I hated it. I think if they want to make a movie like this, they must be enough to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the trailer. I wouldn't have seen this movie if I would have known. I think the trailer should reflect the film's theme and intentions. I'm tired of it. I really wanted a fun comedy and I'm very disappointed. It has been several days now and I still have a bad taste in my mouth from this movie. I have never been more disappointed with a movie, nor have I commented on a bad movie. I really believe that true deception was involved in this trailer because if they showed the true intention of the movie, no one would have seen it.
