As the film begins, a narrator tells us the scream is so scary that you might die of scare - and if that happens, a free funeral is guaranteed. Well, I don't think anyone's dead of fright from watching this movie, but a couple may be dead of boredom. SCREAMING SKULL is the kind of movie that makes Ed Wood a good look. <br /> <br /> Very loosely based on the famous Francis Marion Crawford story, SKULL revolves around a wealthy but nervous woman who marries an eerie man whose first wife died under mysterious circumstances. Once installed in her home, she is plagued by a half-man's gardener, a poorly executed portrait, peacocks and, ultimately, a skull that rolls around the room and screams her a lot. And for her credit, the actor Peggy Webber screams quite well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, her ability to do so is the movie's highest point. The plot is quite transparent, at least, and while it's okay, the script is awful and the movie is so uninspired, you will be ready to scream yourself. True, it only goes about thirty-six minutes, but it all feels much longer. Add to this a really terrible print quality and there you are. <br /> <br /> There are movies that are so bad they are fun to see. It is true that SCREAMING SKULL has a couple of howlers - but the film draws so much that I couldn't work more than an occasional giggle, and since it's all over your head will roll from ennui. If it wasn't for Peggy Webber's way of screaming, it would be the surefire cure for insomnia. Give it a miss. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
