Believe it or not, this movie is worse than number three. It's slower, the play is worse, and the story is very weak. It is not very good to say about this movie. since the battle scenes are more boring than number three, and I would have thought it impossible. It's a very slow 90 minutes. Actually. I put it through and hoped it would get better. If you really want to watch this movie, try to find a cheap it.it rental is hard to find (for purchase it is) and probably for good reason. As number three, this film has nothing to do with the first two. It is the same only in name. I can give the best of the best: without warning is 2/10
