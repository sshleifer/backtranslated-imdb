Crater Lake Monster is easily one of the most horrible, amateur movies I've ever seen - ranking right up there with Manos, Hands of Fate in the form of malfunctioning, unusable direction, and infant production values. In this movie, a stupidly expanded claymation / stop-motion animated dinosaur awakens to a meteor hitting a lake in Bumblebum, CA, and begins eating on the local haystacks. In the exciting climax, the creature described by a local as "a giant alligator with flippers" draws a tremendous amount of ground to hunt it would be lunch before a bulldozer hits it a couple of times and it dies of boredom. Every character in this moovie is a complete moron. A meaningless subplot shows a hick going into a wine shop to buy a 4.75 pint Ripple; Instead of just buying the bottle, the idiot shoots a cashier and another spectator, shoots at a policeman, gets hunted for the lake, so he can be eaten by the monster. Unfortunate close-ups of the monster show that it is no more than a piece of styrofoam. There is a fake magician struggling with a fake British accent (to make him seem more legitimate), two overblown redneck boat camps, a bit of cheesy "prehistoric hole art" made in crayon and annoying banjo-pickin 'background music. In a painful scene, the false magician and his dopey wife / boyfriend / accomplice cut the film for an extra 4 minutes by jawing how can stars they can see in the night sky, even though it is clear daytime still. Even in constant fast forward, this moovie hurts and hurts. MooCow says the fumigators call because this cow really stinks! : = 8P
