If Bob Ludlum were to see this mini-series, he would have cried. This was a complete waste of time and money. I have read the book and although movies are not exactly what the book can be, CBS wasted time and money on this and it is embarrassing to claim that this was Ludlum's work. <br /> <br /> Must be the creator should check out Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good the TV series was. <br /> <br /> Poor Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, why did they write to stop this low? <br /> <br /> Horrible !!
