Like all Carnosaur movies, this is a joke. The way the dinosaurs move on reminds me when my sister plays with her dolls because they can't be stiffer or more fake than them. <br /> <br /> The reason had no meaning at all. I mean first that they are on a bus, so in a warehouse so suddenly they are on a boat. And let's be serious, does it make sense that a couple of dinosaurs can stay together on a van or on a ship? I thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals, and now they can take care of a moving trolley. It sounds silly even when you think about it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave this a 3 is because it is still entertaining. I found it better than the first one (haven't seen the other yet). Just don't rent it. I saw it on television and that's a good thing I did because I wouldn't have wanted to waste money renting it.
