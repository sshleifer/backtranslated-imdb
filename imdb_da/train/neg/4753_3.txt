Director F.W. Murnau wise with the silent film medium he knew so well, to cover this story about the native island life in the South Sea. The documentary style works very well in the first half of the film. The landscape is beautiful and the islanders' daily activities are interesting to see. The film, however, loses momentum when it begins to concentrate more on the narrative story of two convicted lovers. The story just never gets that interesting, even though it is handled well by Murnau. Won an Oscar for Best Movie, although the price probably should have been for the best scenery. You can't really credit DP for shooting at such a beautiful location.
