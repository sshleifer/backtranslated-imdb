After watching the movie, I was really shocked to see such a high rating on IMDb. <br /> <br /> 'The Fantastic Mr. Fox 'is an adaptation of a beloved child's classic, showing the story of the smooth, smooth main character Mr. Fox (or 'Foxy') when he tries a 'last' heist to steal from the dreaded Boggins, Bunce and Bean. That's right, a card, a fat, a lean or it goes. <br /> <br /> I don't quite know where to start with my criticism. <br /> <br /> Well, I'm in my late teens and never a fan of Roald Dahl, but I like his material well enough after reading a couple of his books as a child and seen Matilda and Charlie and Chocolate Factory again and again. However, this movie is fighting for an audience. Is it aimed at children? Adults? I'm still uncertain! Many of the "jokes" would carry a child, especially when Mr. Fox visits a lawyer for example or complains about being poor. An audience of (I suppose) children is also expected to sympathize with a sign that steals and kills hens. I'm all for the food chain, but you can almost see Mr. Fox bite down on their throat! Surely it is a little much? And also the plot ... yes it is a little boring. I was only hoping to get better, but instead I became more and more annoyed by Mr Fox and his son Ash for making stupid decisions. In the meantime, the humor falls flat. I only laughed once or twice, even though I specifically recognized attempts at jokes. I think part of it is that the voice action is so incredibly flat and monotonous. The voice actors have no sense of comic timing, but focus on the subtlety of humor that only works with certain media. George Clooney aims to portray Mr. Fox as charming and slim, but his voice has no character. Meryl Streep shows no emotion, I didn't even understand that Bill Murray had a role until the final credit, and Ask, twelve years old in fox, sounds like he's about 30. <br /> <br /> I love animation, especially stop exercise, but the visual style actually scared me a little. Characters are tall, spindly and lack any heat of design. They move with very little fluidity and often the animation is shaken and strange. There is also a characteristic 'mixed medium' feel, as 2D components are added sporadically and without success. Characters look right on the camera and talked; It was very awkward. There were one or two moments when Kylie looked straight at the camera, did not move and had swirls on his eyeballs. It actually freaked me out. <br /> <br /> Fantastic Mr. Fox had so much potential. Lots of people still seem to like it - look at the reviews. Maybe it just wasn't for me.
