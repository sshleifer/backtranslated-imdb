This movie limps from self-reliance moment to self-indulgent moment, promising to evolve into something worth hanging for. But it doesn't. It is flat, self-conscious, imaginative and boring. <br /> <br /> A set of pictures and scenery does not make a movie they make a calendar. This kind of pitiful socialist pseudo-drama documentary ("It's true it really happened") not just suppresses, it fails to convince, so it doesn't even work as a social story. Clich√©s mixed with bad plays make this a movie very difficult to finish, the fun factor carries off quite quickly. The characters are one-dimensional and never develop to the extent you feel about them. The director's ego is the greatest character in this movie.
