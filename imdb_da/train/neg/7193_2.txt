I had absolutely nothing to do during the past weekend and tagged with my friends to check out a movie ... any movie. And since the only movie we hadn't seen was Inspector Gadget, we decided to support it. <br /> <br /> BIG MISTAKE. This is a movie that can only appeal to children. Oh, and it's not like I don't enjoy movies aimed at the younger audience. But this movie had absolutely nothing to keep my attention. If you have nothing to do at home, sleep. Better than wasting hard earned money on this. Go check out movies if you are a child or if you are a parent with a child :)
