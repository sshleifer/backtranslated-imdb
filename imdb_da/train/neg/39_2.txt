An actress making a movie in Africa is kidnapped and taken in the jungle, where she is held for ransom. The manufacturer hires some to go and bring her back. Complicating everything is the cannibals in the jungle, worshiping a really ugly-looking "god" who likes to eat naked women. <br /> <br /> This is a thrilling, blunt movie. There are abundant amounts of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against naked people. It's an exploitation movie designed to appeal to the deepest darkest parts of our being, and if the movie wasn't so boring, this movie would be a classic. Let's see it despite gore, the unpleasant sex and abuse, and the ugly monster is this movie a snoozer. The pacing is completely out and it puts you out. There are several plot lines that all seem to happen separately from each other, although it is ultimately a single story. Worst of all, almost no one says anything. Most of the minimal dialogue deals with atrocities or protests with a character that "I will do what I want". It's such a quiet and boring movie that if it wasn't for the usual screams, I'd recommend it as a sleep aid. <br /> <br /> This is a movie to avoid unless you need sleep or unless you need to watch any euro cannibal movie. <br /> <br /> (One aside. VideoAsia has just released this as part of their Terror Tales series. Their print is strange letter-boxed, which seems to be the result of taking their print from a Japanese source (there is fog) that was cropped to remove the subtitles. In addition, their printing has no opening titles)
