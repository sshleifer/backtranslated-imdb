Okay the promos promised a comedy and people (few) went to see it. Being the first edition of 2006 is not a bad thing, or for that matter any year, because the first and last movie flop except GHAJINI and some more <br /> <br /> Okay comes to JAWANI DIWANI Briefly, the movie is acting If Emraan Hashmi does his usual thing unfortunately it is annoying this time after repetition. It has an annoying Hrishita Bhatt and a flop of Celina Jaitley <br /> <br /> Cringeworthy dialogues, comedy scenes and poorly handled drama and lots of loopholes. Direction is bad Emraan Hashmi is annoying here, fortunately now he is getting old. But post FOOTPATH ​​and MURDER and some decent work in some more movie actor in him took a backseat and instructors focused on his kisses and female image, which unfortunately lost it, it is after repetition Hrishita and Celina are bad Mahesh is horrible
