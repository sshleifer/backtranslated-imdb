Spotless cards about a bunch of half-naked men left off and punched each other. That is it. In approx. 5 minutes we see this. It's shot in black and white with tons of half-naked men running around and relaxing each other in the melody of horrible music. It looks interesting, but there is no plot and really - the violence associated with it disturbs. The gay eroticism in this is also played, but mixing it with violence was not a good idea. Some people who like avant garde material like this, but I found it incomprehensible, boring, silly and (ocassionally) disturbing. Really - what's the point in all this? I saw it as part of a festival with gay shorts and the audience sat there in stunned silence. I really wish I could go lower than 1.
