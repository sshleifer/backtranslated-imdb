"The seventh sign" borrows a lot from "Rosemary's baby" and "omen" (it actually blends the two stories). Even its title is reminiscent of Bergman's "seventh seal". Nonetheless, it all starts well, with all the omens scattered throughout the earth, and in parallel, a - delectable distinctive with Moore's husband trying to save a poor boy (who killed his parents who was sister and brother) from the death penalty. time, both Christian and Jewish religions are called to salvation (though the wandering Jew is involved), making the lines sometimes unintentionally fun (Have you ever been to Sunday school? But they taught me that God was love!). scene IMHO, is the short dialogue between priest John Heard - who does not seem to take things seriously, for badly he was not given a more important part, because his laid-back action is invaluable - and the young Jew. Demi Moore probably registered the same desire as former man Bruce Willis: saves the world. She doesn't save the movie for all that.
