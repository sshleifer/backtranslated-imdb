Well this just might be the worst movie ever at least the worst movie I've ever seen. They have tried these 666 children of Satan, the anti-Christa movies about 1000 times, and none of them are good, and this is perhaps just the worst of them. They think it will be better movies as they use the false blood. This movie has no idea about it, actors and film recordings are just awful. Can't even make out the 10 line minium of this movie. Really nothing to tell about, but it's just terrible. How they can make movies that way in their right mind just can't understand it. This can't be a Hollywood movie, is it? Just don't go see this spend your money more wisely.
