I saw this obvious schlock party on a video store shelf. And before I got my first video recorder, I figured I'd christen it with this little gem and it's bad to make movies at best! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is unintentionally hilarious. And it contains a como with Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn is inexplicable. And like Christopher Walken seemed to want to star in every bad movie in his later years. This movie is Mr. Quinn's Country Bears. <br /> <br /> It has lines like "Shut up and let me FIGHT !!!" <br /> <br /> And "You say a lot of sh_it!" <br /> <br /> And the priceless comeback: "Unfortunately, it is sh_it, hard acid sh_it!" <br /> <br /> You will be confused by a battle scene as Bo makes a SUMMER AULT across a pool table! And make a good Kung Fu kick when she comes up from the roll! Chop socky action and T and A excitement !!! <br /> <br /> Which schlock movie fan can ask for more? Oh, and when Mr. Quinn's character commits suicide and comes back to haunt Bo as a ghost, he asks him why he killed himself rather than dealing with his debilitating illness? He says, "Real men don't eat quiche." <br /> <br /> Uh, aaa, yes. If Bo was a smart cookie, she would call an exorcist just now and then!
