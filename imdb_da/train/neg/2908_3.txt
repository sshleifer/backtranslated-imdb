Based on one of the books by Gabriel Marquez and it can be brilliant literature, this biographer sucks as it is more like fighting against sleep instead of enjoying some cinematic delices. The story is about an old couple whose son died and lives a life that is heavily dominated by poverty, and where the protagonist is a cock that hopefully one day brings some money to an upcoming cockfight. I'm not in the mood to waste more words on this useless pretentious piece, just maybe you can see Salma Hayek in here, but sit 90 minutes in front of the screen for just that? No gracias .....
