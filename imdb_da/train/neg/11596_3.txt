"The Dream Child" in 1989 is the fifth film in the (generally overrated) "Nightmare" series, and most recently, the series became complete waste. The only good films in the series were Wes Craven's 1984 original and third part "The Dream Warriors" in 1987. The second part was disappointing and boring, and that was the fourth part where the former scary madman Freddy Krueger began to annoy with constant idiotic jokes . This fifth entry to the series hardly has anything to recommend except for (admittedly great) visuals and a scary scene, a flashback sequence to how Freddy Krueger came. The rest of the movie consists mainly of our razor-clawed maniac-turned-jokester shouting silly one-liners, and the old formula of a lot of teenage jackasses desperately trying to avoid falling asleep because good old Freddy waits for them their dreams. Lisa Wilcox is back in the role of Alice Johnson, and a lot of uninteresting crap, such as. A super stupid 'creepy' rhyme has been added for no reason other than having some kind of justification for making this superfluous and boring sequel. .. In short: No originality, just a fall in the old formula, and an overload of painfully annoying jokes. My (generous) 3/10 rating is due to the big visuals, and especially to emphasizing the difference to the horrible next sequel, "Freddy's Dead", which is terribly convinced. If you are not a hardcore Freddy Krueger enthusiast, "The Dream Child" should be avoided and even if you are, you are more than likely to disappoint.
