Up until this point, Gentle Rain was the movie I found worst in history. It has been replaced by this "blockbuster" out of Asia. It has a "star" and it's John Rhys Davies. He's out of shape to be the winding, magical flying baddie he's thrown here. The rest of these people couldn't make their way out of a junior high school play. No clich√©s were missed in the dialogue and the special effects were called in as often as possible. <br /> <br /> It is pretty easy to see that someone in Asia had some money and needed to create a vehicle for some actors they wanted to throw money. Or maybe it was a director or writer who needed a credit. My guess is that any career with this movie in its credentials <br /> <br /> makes you a big advantage and doesn't see this movie. One hundred Thanksgivings couldn't consume this turkey. <br /> <br /> The one fun scene was unintentional. The King's brother appears on the stage. The king? A beautiful, older, short Asian actress. (Bad actor.) The brother? A six foot European. (Also a bad actor.) No excuses were made for this. They just didn't expect us to notice that this poor man's Jet Lis brother was a wannabe Pierce Brosnan in a cheap dimest "Injun" wig straight out of an old western movie from the eighties.
