This is obviously a futuristic adaptation of Jules Verne's "Mysterious Island". Sound editing is pretty poor. You hear the dialog on set and you hear the sounds being recorded on a recording cab at the same time! This is an amateur movie with actors from Boston and shot around in New Hampshire. For those who live in New England and who read this comment will be wowed with a capital W. This movie is full of errors. You will hear the director's voice giving directions and giving directions to the actress. "Now get up." As for the other signs. There is this guy talking to his mind instead of his voice and this blue stranger. The alien guy speaks with a deep voice. When he swings or grills when he fights, you hear the actors' voice. As for the special effects, man! This was Brett Piper's early work to cry aloud! The creatures are good, but the animation is jerking. Really jerky. Kind of like Karl Zeman animation in JOURNEY FOR BEGINNING THE TIME (1955). The special effects are imaginative. Thge music is good. At the bottom, this film makes EQUINOX or PLANET OF DINOSAURSne look like a Ray Harryhausen epic. Did you know that MYSTERIEUS PLANET was a home video and was on a shoe rigid budget? A must watch for aspiring film makers.
