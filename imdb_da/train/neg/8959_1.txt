Some people may consider this movie a piece of artwork - to be able to express your imagination on film to create a movie full of antagonistic pain and death. Personally, I think this movie is a disgust that should never have been released. This film is repulsive, illogical and meaningless. Not only is it a waste of time, but it makes you sick for the coming days. The frightening images that appear in the movie not only make you understand the air, but they put in mind and it takes days to forget them. Such a shame that people waste their imagination over such inhuman suffering. "Kill Bill" would be another example, but at least "Kill Bill" has its purpose, meaning, climax and decision.
