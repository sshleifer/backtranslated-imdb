I can't help laughing to the people who praise this show as heartbreaking and tearing. For one, it is quite unrealistic that these people will have perfect lives after their new home. How can these families afford to sustain these new megahouses? And what about their poor neighbors? Property taxes must surely increase when this happens. Plus, the noise would annoy me. <br /> <br /> Secondly, how excessive can a reality TV show be? It is practically the same repetitive junk week after week. We are introduced to a family of patients who are renovating the home, so surprise the family and break out the Kleenex boxes. <br /> <br /> Not to mention how boring the renovation part is. The only interesting part of the show is to see how the house looks, but even that segment is destroyed by the false announcers and constantly creeping. "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" is a show pretending to be obvious, but it falls flat. Skip this one. If you like reality TV, "Survivor" is much better and moves.
