This movie is horrible. The story is about a woman trying to find out what happened to her sister. The movie struggles with its identity, lurching from Noir / thriller to erotic, with elements of horror thrown into good measure. The film has a very confused structure, for example, with frequent use of flashbacks without tying them into history. The reason is poorly developed, and the characterization made it difficult to distinguish between who was who and the part they played. There are some discrepancies in many movies, but the scene where the main character happily accompanies a virtual stranger to his home then goes up the stairs alone (where he says she will find a phone), minus the gun, she had brought with them that calling the police was too hard to believe. Some of the cinematography is very bad: we looked at a 42 "TV, so how someone with a smaller set could work out what happened in the scenes taken in almost complete darkness is past me. All in all a chaotic mess.
