Maverick cop with family issues and sorry to use his gun ?? Check! Isolated place with valuable object begging to be stolen ?? Check! Tasty dear love interest ?? Check! Assorted band of stupid cardboard gun feed villains with risky European accents ?? Check! German sounding bad guy is played by an English actor with a piece of corny dialogue for each apartment ?? Check! Corny one liners ?? Check! <br /> <br /> Deary me, does this movie take the throw or what? The clich√©s come as thick and fast as an avalanche, and most of the cast are just gawping at just how bad the script is! <br /> <br /> In a blatantly cheap and cheerful straight two video rip off of Die Hard just put on a mountain (complete with some chopped lines from the aforementioned), we have all the usual action clubs crossed by, progressively, when we go along with a good old-fashioned violence and nudity thrown in to wake up in the audience, who might just have nodded. <br /> <br /> Jack Wild is a policeman in full on the John McClane mode here, who even manages the time of the old, old guy with gun has used all his bullets over a time. <br /> <During this mess, there are a few well-known recognizable faces that I can only assume to use cash and / or simply play it laughing from the pointless opening scene that had nothing to do with the plot at all The final unlikely conclusion complete with ropey dialogue and even ropies effe cts. <br /> <br /> Looking up at this three quid from the supermarket negotiating effort on IMDb I'm surprised to find out that this dud owned only one but two successors, I have to find those gems on DVD! It seems that the first sequel is a rip off of Under Siege 2 and the second successor, well know! One thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor playing Jack changes with each movie, and even the character's name seems to change to the third installment. <br /> <br /> Blind buying of cheap DVDs, however, will not be the same if the studios did not continue to dread material of this terrible quality !!
