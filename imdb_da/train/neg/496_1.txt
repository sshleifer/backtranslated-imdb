Imagine you are a high school boy at the back of a dark, untouched theater with your girlfriend. How bad would a movie be to make you feel compelled to leave the theater and go home before it ended? This movie is so bad. Really. Movies are often so bad that they are good; This film is beyond the stage of bad-ness. It is painfully bad. Horribly, horrible, crime against humanity bad.
