The clich√© of the shocked soldier's home from the war is here given dull treatment. Forgetfulness, an excellent cast that limits the limits of their high talents, cannot redeem the "Soldier's Return" from its rigid-collared inability to move the viewer to emotional engagement. Best moments, as another reviewer noted, came when Glenda Jackson was on display; But even Jackson's cracking good movie power cannot draw the film's chestnuts from the cold, never-heated fire. Ann-Margret, she of sex-kitten and too often accused of missing plays, finds her actual and rather deep abilities wasted here - despite talking to a near-Middlesex accent. The hackneyed score, redolent of many missing TV miniseries' slathered-on saccharine emotionalism, is at annoying odds with the emotional remoteness of the script, blocking, and over-over formalism in the direction; Apart from its score and corset script and direction, the 'Soldier Return' has all the right bits, but it fails to get them to work together.
