- The film opens with a meteor crashing into a lake. Unknown to the locals is a dinosaur egg also at the bottom of the lake. The meteor heats the lake and makes it a huge incubator. You guessed it, the ovaries release a dinosaur that continues to terrorize the community. <br /> <br /> - What a complete garbage. It's not that I have anything against the stop-motion rental dinosaur, it's all about the movie that bothers me. The action is terrible. The dialogue is completely ridiculous. The comic relief is anything but cartoon. Logic is non-existent. Any resemblance between the "scientists" in this film and an actual scientist is purely coincidental. I could go on with an eternity on the bad aspects of this movie, but you get the idea. I feel it is pretty safe to call this disaster "MST3K Worthy".
