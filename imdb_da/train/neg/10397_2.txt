Just not the quality I had expected from Morris (love Brass Eye and Blue Jam). It is much like a not so bad student movie. What concerns me, in all this is why has it won a BAFTA ??? Morris makes fun of the 'enhrined mediocrity' (Ayn Rand) in much of his work (Nathan Barley) and yet with this piece the talented back spines and tells us it's raining! <br /> <br /> I just hope when he has chosen a topic I will love to tackle (humanity of terror - four lions) that he will not pick up and waste the opportunity to make a statement about the color of plain ignorance and meaning of this emotional and strong-minded phenomenon.
