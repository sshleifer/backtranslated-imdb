There is not a single sympathetic character throughout this film. Is it the lawyer who is played by Kenneth Branagh that we have to pull for? Well, let's see - we learn he's a sleazebag defense lawyer who gets criminals out of technical. He treats his colleagues as cattle, gets them involved in his own personal crisis (in the process of getting one of them killed), threatening the security of his children, threatening his new wife's new boyfriend, trying to strengthen the police and school administrators - and everything this for what? Because he was thinking with his little head! I really traveled for the father and his gang to knock off the lawyer and drown him in the swamp ... that would have made for a far more satisfying end.
