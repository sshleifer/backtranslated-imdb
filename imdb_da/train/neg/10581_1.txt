There was not an original idea in this story. Themes were drawn from various sources; a few are the ninth port, in the mouth of madness (another carp film) and the ring. It even went as far as with the same damned glowing circle from The Ring and used it as the film's namesake. The soundtrack of Cody Carpenter was anything but the promise of Suspiria. Hopefully no one will oppose this comment by spitting the word HOMAGE around. Yes, I saw that the theater played Argento's Deep Red. Claiming a tribute would be a scary cop-out. This was bottom-of-barrel. Throwing gore and "disturbing" pictures in the pan does not make a good scary movie. The carpenter used to know it. He should fade in turmoil or acquire a time machine.
