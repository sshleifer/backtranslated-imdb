Don't even waste your time, let alone pay rent for this piece of mud! How it was made is over me. (I don't know why there are at least 10 lines ... I've already summed up this trashy movie, but of course ...) The act was awful, just as they all needed lessons. The reason was weak, the end ... Feh! I think the cinematography was the only thing that didn't quite suck ... well, maybe the sound was minimalist OK. The one good thing is, if they could make this movie, even make some money with it, there might be hope for any scriptwriter with a real idea. So all in all! I think the same goes for actors ... if these people were actually paid, then you can too!
