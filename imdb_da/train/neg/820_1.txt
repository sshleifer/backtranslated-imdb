What did producer / director Stanley Kramer see in Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's very enigmatic manuscript? Was there a few left with that purpose? And what about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? What did they see in this very confused story? <br /> <br /> And why did Candice Bergen, which gave a terrible performance, such a rambling role? <br /> <br /> The Domino principle will be the same as The Parallax View or The Manchurian Candidate and miss the brand with a very wide margin. A big misfire by Stanley Kramer.
