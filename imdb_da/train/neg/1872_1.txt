BE WARNED. This movie is such a mess. It's a disaster. Don't waste your time with this one. I warned you! The action, the story, the dialogue, the music ... basically everything is so over the top, it's totally annoying and ridiculous. It caused me to vomit (if the dialogue / action / story did not, all of them are shot in the wrong). You will feel like you are watching a comedy. The problem is that the parts that are supposedly funny are not even fun. Play, history, filmography you can feel everything, just try WAAAAY too hard - but it never succeeds. Almost every shot is canted, but so what? This movie just feels like a student movie. No wonder they shot this in HD because it would be a waste to spend more money shooting this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are easily amused or bad acting, writing, editing, controlling, full of clich√©s, all that is forced in your face, oh and did I mention bad behavior? (yes, it's not all the actor's fault - it's the director!) then I think you'll like this movie. I had to see this a class. I would have turned it off immediately if I could. If you still can't tell now, I HED this movie. It made me throw up and get my time back ... at least I didn't have to pay for this waste. Jeff Goldblum, you know ... the guy from Jurassic Park / Independence Day is in this movie, but he certainly went downhill from then - accept roles for movies like this disaster.
