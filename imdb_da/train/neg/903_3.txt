1937's "Stella Dallas" with Barbara Stanwyck has not quite aged well - how someone thought a semi-updated version of the story would work now is a real puzzle. Maybe they thought jaunty, cheerful brash Bette Midler could do something about it, but this hoary script defeats her. Plot about a female bartender who has a baby out of wedlock and years later gives the young girl over to the child's wealthy father so that she gets a shot for a better life, cannot escape the tattooed, old-fashioned depictions and feelings. Funds work best with a film director who can manage her profits, but it doesn't happen here; Stephen Collins is stole as the man who changes his life, but Trini Alvarado is well-groomed as Midler's daughter. This is what used to be referred to as a "woman's image", a velvet, but it does not pass patterns because it remains too faithful to its origins in 1930. * 1/2 from ****
