I, like many other Bachchan fans, have been eagerly waiting for Sholay's remake. This movie was not. Thank goodness, they didn't let them use the name "Sholay" in the movie. Ram Gopal's remake is not worthy of the title. The camera's work, the locations, the costumes, the completely out-of-the-way dances, the dialogue is gathered to make the worst movie I've ever seen. You wonder if the actor went in to make this movie because they needed money, and Ram Gopal paid a lot of money for the cast. The only unpaid actor, the ant, was the only resemblance to the first movie. Abishek's role was absolutely ridiculous, did he need money to pay for the Ash wedding? Save your money, mind and time, don't bother with this movie or DVD when it comes out.
