A gossip-inducing snail-free disappointment, Inside Man tells the story of a detective (Denzel Washington) under investigation due to his possible involvement in the event of a lack of money. When a bank is robbed and hostages are held against their will by a mastermind thief (Clive Owen) and his team, the detective is encouraged to force the thief to surrender ?? his one shot to prove that he is innocent and worthy of his position. Enter a strong woman (Jodie Foster) with secrets and intentions sent to recover one thing from the bank's owner's safe stored in the bank and you have the right three-way dilemma. Unfortunately, you get it all in the movie, and eventually pay nothing. Denzel Washington is at his most uninteresting in an inefficient and unpleasant egocentric performance. The only saving grace for the movie is its competent co-stars Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, who are much better than the movie itself. In fact, Jodie Foster delivers the most surprising and highly-calibrated performance that plays against type as a reckless, meandering villain of the kind. Clive Owen doesn't get much to do beyond litter and poses, but the depth of his presence and his accomplished ability more than make up for his underdeveloped role. It is strange that so much talent is wasted on this movie with little influence or interest. You have to wonder which director Spike Lee was thinking while creating this movie. The most confusing aspect of Inside Man, however, is how much unjustified praise it has received. For a movie that seemed to have all kinds of a pre-summer blockbuster, it falls terribly flat.
