Am I wrong or is the 2007 version just a rip-off of the original? I have to ask, because the DVD I just bought is one of the worst movies I've ever seen ..... bad acting, bad editing etc .... the only "exploitation" aspect here is how we was ripped off for our money buying this piece of crap. It's nothing but a light porn flick ... no real gore, no scary pictures, just a cheaply made waste. If anyone wants to see an excellent movie without names actors, some slimy gore and a decent story ... get Baby Blood ... also made on a cheap budget but well made ... and an actual story too! I Spit was a waste of money, but I just keep it for a laugh .... it's pathetic! New comment .... Sept 3 ..... I will keep this movie forever, just because it's sooo it's almost good .... in a really bad way .... the worst deal ever ... a real crap movie classic!
