There is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or a producer: actress Nichole Hiltz. She is the show in this slowly moving and wildly unlikely revenge story. Directed by Simon Gornick, movie stars Joyce Hyser as a betrayed wife who decides to seek revenge on her cheatin's spouse. Oh, but not in the conventional way. She plans a total guerrilla war and recruits the bad girl Nichole Hiltz as her chosen weapon. She wants Nichole (as Tuesday) to come close to her ex (the beautiful but boring Stephan Jenkins, who will stick to music) to scare him and destroy his life. David DeLuise is good in his few short moments, and the former "Crime Story" star Anthony Dennison is almost nothing to do but scowl. Hiltz, on the other hand, comes out at various times as sexy and playful, so evil and rude. She also handles vulnerable and "maybe a little psychotic" good. She is also quite hot (although there are no cheeky bits show) so you can understand how she might come to any guy she's targeting. But the performance is a bit wasted in this movie, which is not edgy or interesting enough to recommend.
