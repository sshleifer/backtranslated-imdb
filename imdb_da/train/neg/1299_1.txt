This production has absolutely no history. The action is embarrassing. The promising Dutch television star Sophie Hilbrand star should not add this movie to her CV. Her performance is far from flawless and I personally believe that she has crossed the boundary of professional decency; about the way she exhibits in this movie. This movie contains too much unnecessary nudity, vulgar sexual scenes and rude language. It also shows a wrong picture of the Netherlands (as most films do). Don't watch this movie: a waste of time, a waste of money and an embarrassing record for Hilbrand, which has proven to be better with her close to the screen.
