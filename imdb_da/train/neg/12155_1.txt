If this film was written directed and produced with the intention of creating a bad movie cult classic, it might (I might say) have been a hit. Have you ever seen a movie that was so horrible that it gets fascinating about its mistakes? Well that's it. Each of the actors must be nominated for worst performance awards. It would be difficult to find another movie with this kind of production budget that contains as little value whatsoever. The whole thing, from the opening scenes, can withstand logic. The dialogue is absolutely incredible and illogical. The same for the film's behavior and general history. What is really fun is that some buffoons in a boardroom have actually made decisions to spend money on this piece of waste. Wow.
