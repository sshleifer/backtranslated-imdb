Let me first be honest. I didn't see this whole movie. I saw the first five minutes, and when I realized that I had almost fallen asleep, I decided to go ahead and see if it became more interesting later ... It didn't. This movie is just a collection of lame attempts to make a story that is already uninteresting and badly told something that it would never be: a decent horror movie. Because I feel it is important to say that even a movie with bad special effects can still be good if it is well made. This movie is not and will only put you in a deep sleep if you try to see it. Finally, I think it is important to say that I think this movie is in public, so if you feel you should definitely see it than a little search on the internet will surely show you a place where you do not have to pay to see this pile of cinematographic fertilizer.
