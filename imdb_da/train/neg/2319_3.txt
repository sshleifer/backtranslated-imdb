Many stupid plot holes in the movie. First, we see him see his master practice kung-fu and die in the midst of his practice. It's fine with me. And then at the end of the movie we see him using kung fu as he just learned to see his master when he was still a child. Is it even possible? I dont 'think so. <br /> <br /> This show is for Jay Chou fans only, and the film lacks depth in character development, movie style and plot unfolding. <br /> <br /> Someone observes that the captain of the basket team (forgot his name) and the idolized player Li Xiao look so similar, to the extent you think they were the same person? Long hair, sunshine boy look, tall and strong. Two of them looked as if they came from a mass-production factory designed to churn out products that make teenage girls scream wildly in orgasm. Not that the two actors had anything of value to contribute to the film as a whole for the film industry at all. <br /> <br /> The wit was lame and not at all funny. <br /> <br /> The scene with the 4 masters of Jay Chou came back to help him out in the basketball court, degenerated into a meaningless plot as they began to base their opponents ala Royal Rumble style. Worse of all, when the 4 champions won the match, the audience began to cheer, and the fight continued. It was really a WTF? moment. <br /> <br /> At the end of the show, when they win the match, thanks to Jay Chou's excellent kung fu skills. How he acquired these kung-fu skills is a mystery because the show somehow shows him acquiring skills simply by observing his master. <br /> <br /> Then his long-lost father comes out of the woodwork to acknowledge Jay Chou as his long-lost son seemed just as little to the director to pack the film. In short, it's a Jay Chou flick (instead of the usual "Chick Flick"). . See it only if Jay Chou is your fan. If you are one of those whose tastes in movies coincide strongly with them on the list of IMDb's top 250 movies all the time, then this movie is not for you.
