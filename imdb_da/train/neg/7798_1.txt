This review is based on the duplicate Shock-o-Rama video released in an unwanted world in 2002. How bad is that? It's terrible, which is what a '1' represents on the IMDb scale - but it's much worse than that. It is great to imagine that an original German-language print can improve - the comical English-language dubbing is not fun at all - but it is true that this is one of the worst amateur movies of any genre you will probably see. The zombies in the movie are as slow and clumsy as ever, and they don't seem to have the ability to talk or think about anything beyond their next meal. But they are also intelligent enough to drive chainsaws and malicious enough to know that western tabloids on genitals will undoubtedly experience their dining table conversation. George Romero's Land of the Dead was a zombie nation that maintained a piece of social cohesion; here are zombies nothing but an empty canvas for director Andreas Schnaas perverted performances. Completely without redeeming social value, and even worse, completely lacking in entertainment, Zombie '90 is a bad joke on anyone wasting money on it.
