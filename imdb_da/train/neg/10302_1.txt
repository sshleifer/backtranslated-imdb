When "Rugrats" falls out of the good and fun cartoon character into a mediocre and actually utterly horrible fare for two-year-olds over the past three or four years, the Klasky-Csupo tyrants should of course be out of ideas. After dumping all the characters, even more stupids are added, replacing some voices (although I like Nancy Cartwright, she is not Chucky Finster!) And has no sense of continuity (eg: in a Kimi episode I saw the other day, Tommy and Chucky each got a new puppy, but the subsequent episode, the above dogs never appear), you think the creators could kill the show for mercy. But no. <br /> <br /> All I want to say about this particular is that it sucks! Although it's not as terrible as the Kimi episodes, everyone is even stupid than they were, including grandfather (my God! He used to be the best character on the show, but now he has no real purpose). The end is unnecessarily fluffy, and the only difference between this and other crazy new episodes ('98 -'01) is that kids can interact with adults. Whoa, what fun! <br /> <br /> No stars at all for "The Rugrats All Growed Up". Klasky-Csupo, please destroy this show before it gets worse.
