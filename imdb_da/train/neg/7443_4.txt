There were some scary scenes that I always wanted more than just out, but otherwise this movie was pretty weak. There were too many questions that were unanswered, and when they tried to explain something in the movie, it was still rather unclear. After watching this movie, I still felt lost in many ways. It reminded me of Silent Hill a few years back. That movie was also unsatisfactory, but still better than this, because it was trying to work and the story actually made sense. The one, not so much. The action mostly in the Abandoned was decent, but the film dragged on one and never really gave any kind of satisfactory conclusion. As I said above, there were some scary scenes, but otherwise this movie was a mess. Sorry, I can't recommend it.
