Okay, when I came to the board for this movie, I really expected people to make fun. I was surprised to see that people over the age of 7 liked it. I enjoyed the movie ... but only b / c me and my little sister (who is actually only 10) have fun of it all. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry Jordan, but it was terrible. You know that a movie is on its way to the toilet when the cord can't work. And it didn't even have a good script or plot to redeem it. I also thought that the character of Pamela was very much lame ... cross-border pathetic. Though it was said, I thought there were a few good actors like beautiful Spencer, Hollywood, and Ronnie. It's still not enough to redeem the movie. <br /> <br /> Two things about this movie I just can't get over: <br /> 1.) That the spencer guy would fall for her. Okay, eww. I looked up the dates and in fact he is only about four years older than her, the difference in "Go Figure" seemed much larger. Jordan is a very nice girl, but in the GF she seemed like 10 or 12 ... she seemed like a little child! Jake Abel (Spencer) seemed like a college student. <br /> <br /> 2.) There is some way that Christ Yamaguchi would come just to skate for a girl. I think Katelin is good and everything, but it just seemed a little unlikely that Christ would go to a boarding school that didn't even have scholarships for skating or that a school would have used a skating book with such links. <br /> <br /> It was all said ... it wasn't the worst movie ever known, but it wasn't very good even in DCOM standards, which I consider rather low.
