This movie still freezes me until the bone thinks about it. This movie was not only bad as in the low budget, badly traded, etc. Although it was certainly all these things. The problem with this movie is that it seemed to intentionally try to annoy the viewer and do it with great success. What I want to know is, is it supposed to be a horror movie? I mean, it's horrible, but not in the way horror movies are supposed to be. I could see the first segment trying to be horror and failing, but what the hell is the other segment? It's just annoying. The third segment is like watching an artistic student film, which makes it incredibly the least painful segment. It's a cruelty that this movie is not so low on the bottom 100, so get your voices (1/10) with people !! I know some people gave these good reviews, but well, they are in a sadistic attempt to trick you. Believe me, it is impossible to like this movie. The only benefit of this movie is a fantastic life-prolonging effect: It feels like you've seen movies this year after only the first half hour has passed.
