John Wayne & Albert Dekker are competing for oil rights in Indian territory and under the attention of Martha Scott in this republic. Photos movie shot out of Utah, USA. <br /> <br /> An interesting western kind of variety due to its character and its more modern setting, where Wayne & Dekker play the old and new factions of the West. It is based on a story by Thomson Burtis who brings the manuscript along with Eleanore Griffin and Ethel Hill. Albert Rogell leads the way in the work that suits his career. A truly terrestrial story is truly saved by its final third, how fortunately the action captures and we are treated to something resembling a pulse. The light hearted approach to the romantic beach is not quite right, and a brilliant fist fight between the two main characters is destroyed by the fact that Rogell is unable to disguise the stuntmen who do the work. But hey, deserved men always deserve their glory. Solid support comes from George 'Gabby' Hayes and Wayne as usual have a lot of screen charism, especially when he rages off his gun. But in spite of its better than the usual republic's budget, it remains only a film of interest for the 1940s Wayne enthusiasts. 4.10
