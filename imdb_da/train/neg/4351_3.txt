Each generation fully believes that it lives at the end times. This has been true for thousands of years now. And movies like this feed on this. How did they get the big Orson Welles to tell this train wreck? This is a documentary about Armageddon's biblical prophecies. It tries to connect the prophecies as well as possible with what happened in the times it was made, which apparently dated and kind of stupid. The Reenactments look as if they are out of "unresolved mysteries" but without the high production values. People should have been embarrassed to participate in this. In short, the movie is dated, silly, reactionary and useless. Good if you want a good laugh, but not good enough to actually look for.
