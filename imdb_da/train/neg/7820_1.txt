Or: It's a bird? It's a plane? No, see ... It's a disaster! or: No need to look up into the sky. <br /> <br /> or: (... OK, that's enough.) If songs tried to make a romantic titanic movie to clash the cash register's record, he celebrated. The SR structure cannot do this, the dark and limited color scheme (I will call it "wishi-washi"), the boring usual dialogues, the clown with advanced foreign technology, the lack of fun and magic, etc. making the movie quite disappointing. <br /> <br /> It just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> The most important thing about a character like superman is that he is a superhero. It's the core, the most important thing. <br /> <br /> Love problems and unfortunately lost depressive supersoftie can only be a facet of a 2:40 long Superman movie, not all the time. <br /> Because then it's not a superman or superhero movie anymore. It is like a (and in this case a very bad and boring) social study, where every 30 minutes a person flies around. <br /> <br /> It's a big difference. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke. Holy Skywalker, this is Superman, so give us Supervillains, Superaction and the most important, Superfun. <br /> <br /> We want ENTERTAINMENT! Songs, if you want to make a 2:40 long soul, love drag drama about lost and unfortunately people? So take normal human signs and make a yentl remake. <br /> <br /> They say: Superman returns. And then supersadlysoftie is in the door. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the singer has tried to kill the legend without kryptonite, but a bad movie can't do this. Don't give up, they're planning a sequel ... The next gangster (and the Warner Brothers), make a superhero movie, not a depressive super-brand soap, or let it be. A superhero movie means a colorful fantasy with lots of fun and magic. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a very cheap chocolate box with supercoverage. Yes, technically there are all sorts of features. Yes, there are many small conversations, there are some jokes, a vision scene, etc. But the only thing that all these worse pieces have in common is their poor quality. <It's no more than a super-running patchwork and one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The ridiculous cast strategy (Throw them young as possible so we can make successors in the next 25 years) gives the rest. Kate Bosworth plays a 22-year-old star reporter, she resembles 19. Superman was full five years away, so he slept with her 6 years ago, so she was 16 (resembling 13) and a daily planet reporter, wroting "I spend one night with superman ". Warner Brothers, it's too much. <br /> <br /> Routh is not that bad, he plays a little wood, but the whole movie is wood, so ...?! Temporary good was margin and sometimes posey. The rest, forget it. Even spacious this is not his terrain. Reeve / Hackman / Kidder seemed so easy with fun. What a difference. <br /> <br /> In the end, Jesus is ridiculous. What the hell should it be? The problem here is, they mean this seriously, not like a joke. Next time does Spiderman or Batman or Ironman fall and rise like Jesus or angels? Or they talk directly to God. Why not ? They are superheroes who save human lives every day. So at least one presentation with god every week must be possible ... Oh my god. Maybe it was not the right advertised movie, but instead of a bizarre, dull parallel universe. <br /> <br /> For the warner brothers, this superlative depressive flick may be the greatest disaster in history. Not just because of the money. I understand how difficult it might be to create and transport some messages or feelings, but to show lonely, lost and, unfortunately, people are not new and thousands of movies or TV shows did better, in very old or new as magnolia. And the flying frogs were more impressive than this flying super-wife, sorry superman of course. <br /> <br /> Songs and WB, it's simply nothing. In fact, it's even more than nothing, it's like a black hole that destroys the passion for (comic / superhero) movies and steals us three hours in our lives. <br /> <br /> Wife. Smilla's little brother. (Very sour and green as sobbing.)
