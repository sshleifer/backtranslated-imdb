I gave this one more than one, because I thought there were some moral lessons in this story, and it provoked some thoughts and comments from my wife and I. The action and dialogue were mediocre, and I must admit that I came out, I felt it had been beaten over with God this, God it and Christ are our savior things. The film and the story didn't need it. If, as I am, you are a restorative Catholic or Christian avoid this, it will make you sick. The film did a great job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what could have been.
