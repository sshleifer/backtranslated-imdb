Maybe I'll be really old, but one just missed me and the old Funny Bone completely. Surely there must be something bad about this Irishman (that's me, Schultz!). Lord, Lord, what I would give to see the light! First, Phil Silver's manic energy, wild and driving was much of a part of the comic upbringing and education of life, if you want. Although it is possible that the series, which first states: "YOU WILL NEVER GET RIGHT" (1955-59 *) could have got on the CBS TV network with another in Sgt's role. Bilko, it's very hard to see any other actor / comedian in the company wearing these master sergeant stripes. Such strong identification is inevitable, but not the same kind of career-destructive typecasting of a nightmare that it turned out to be for some other guys like Clayton More ("THE LONE RANGER"), George Reeves ("THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN" ) and Charles Nelson Riley ("UNCLE CROC'S BLOCK"). <br /> <br /> A major obstacle to successfully adapting and updating such work from the 1950s TV screen to the 1990's public audience is our collective memory. Without being sure of the percentage of audiences, Bilko remembered the character from seeing the original races and early syndication revisions, and their numbers were certainly significant; Even a large segment of the youth had seen Bilko reruns in recent times. It was obvious that the new movie and source were miles; or even bright years apart. <br /> <br /> In order not to be considered a whole square, we need to consider some other points. <br /> <br /> Today is the 14th day of November in our master 2007, let me swear and confirm under oath that I have been a Steve Martin fan for almost 30 years. In addition, I have enjoyed game and talents by Bilko '96 Co-Stars Dan Akroyd and The late Phil Hartman. It was the talents of guys like this and so many others, Alumni of "NBC; s Saturday Night" and "SECOND CITY TV" who held the last quarter of the 20th century laugh. But a BILKO retreats; It just hasn't clicked. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if the movie had been made as a service comedy (always wanted them!) but without the Bilko Show names and gave it an identity of its own it would be more highly regarded by crabby old guys like me. So we've already had so many sitcom and comic strips turned into movies lately, what's next? Howse if anyone does Hal Roachs 2nd World War Army series of sergeants DOUBLEDAY & AMES and TV's 1. Cartoon Series "CRUSADER RABBIT"? Remember where you first heard it! POODLE SCHNITZ!
