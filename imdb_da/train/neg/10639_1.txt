Mindless, ignorant, unimaginable, career killer (where is the talented Angela Jones now?), Deeply unfunny waste. It is no wonder that Reb Braddock has not done anything else - anyone who has the chance to make his first film on his own rules, based on his own script, with the help of Quentin Tarantino himself and creates something like IT, someone who Think this was a story worth telling the world, does not deserve another break. Under the circumstances, the performances are good - the actors do what they are told and they do well. It's just that they shouldn't have done it in the first place. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 4.
