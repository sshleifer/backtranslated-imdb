I should have known that I had problems with Casper Van Diem as the protagonist. Words cannot describe, nor do they make any sense of how horrible this film was. But let me try to describe it: Terrible acting, horrible dialogue, corny situations, and all of it will give you the feeling that you are strengthening the greats and propaganda of Trinity Broadcasting Network. It's a weak attempt to try to show Hollywood that a movie can be entertaining and have a deep, religious message attached to it. They failed miserably. It was clearly the worst movie I've seen for a long time.
