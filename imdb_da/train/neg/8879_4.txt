I think Cliff Robertson was definitely one of our finest actors. He has half a dozen classics for his credit. He does it fine here like the heavy, but the direction is so bad, and the pacing is so tiring, it never comes out of the mark. The story starts well, although it makes me wonder how he could count on his wife hanging himself. Still, he is well-smuggling and carrying things together. The dead button is twofold. First and foremost, if we were to take the time using characters moving from one room to another or part of the house to another, it would eat up about a third of the film. Add to that, Robertson's character sits up in bed in the blue light and looks confused, adding another lump. I agree with those who said half an hour shorter would have made it a pretty decent but insignificant movie. The biggest weakness is just a dilapidated plot that, when all is said and done, leaves incredible questions. I don't put in spoilers, but when it ends, you're not thinking too much. I can come up with ten what-if without raising a sweat. It would have been better if it had become a ghost story.
