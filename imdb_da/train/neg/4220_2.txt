A brief review, but ... <br /> <br /> Avoid a thorough waste of 90 minutes at all costs. At the end of the movie I was no wiser what actually happened. It's full of cameos (Stephen Fry (3mins), Jack Dee (30 seconds), "Philadelphia" girls) and some vagally recognizable people, but it just makes no sense. Whether the story just got lost in the editing, I do not now but jeez ... <br /> <br /> Put on a DVD instead or go to bed and get some rest! <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (for cameos and a Morris Minor car hunt) <br /> <br />
