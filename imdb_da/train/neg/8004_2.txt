First of all let me say the first 20 minutes are great, the monster looks great and CGI is reasonably done. It's such a shame that the rest of the movie is such a disappointment, <br /> <br /> ******** SPOILERS BELOW ******** <br /> <br /> From the opening scene we can see this movie is anti-American, usually this kind of stereotypes would not disturb me (we British get enough from Hollywood), but here it is not subtle to make Americans brain-dead morons. It goes beyond the point of realism, and your left wonder if a Yank has raped the director's mother. <br /> <br /> The grieving scene was really bad and the part of the movie where it starts to go downhill. <br /> <br /> Here we are introduced to the Olympic medalist Aunt and Brother Uncle, who enters the memorial and begins to blame the father of death for his daughters, and then hit him before they all start rolling around on the floor and cry. Almost realistic binding in a time of crisis! <br /> <br /> The whole virus bar is ridiculous. If the Americans know that there is no virus, why waste time, money and resources for exploration? The US government agent orders the brain drilling of an innocent Korean for nothing, making the Americans look sore (or stupid). It was not helped by the fact that this guy was crossing for comic effects. <br /> <br /> The movie is about chasing the monster. American and Korean special forces are assigned to find the being, even though the film they are invisible. The only people chasing the monster throughout Korea are the main family and some random tramp that appear at the end to save the day! Of course, a few US / Korean agents are trying to stop them along the way. <br /> <br /> The sister was only included in the movie so she could make the decisive shot at the end. It was klich√©d, you knew it was going to happen, but to make it worse, she does bugger all the way! and my last annoyance, how in hell did that child survive at the end? the monster had swam with his head under water for approx. 5 minutes! Why didn't the monster eat the kids at first?
