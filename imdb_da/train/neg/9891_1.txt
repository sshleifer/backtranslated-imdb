I think the biggest disappointment in this movie was that right up to the end, I expected the actors' instructors to break in and apologize for how little the actor was. Considering the powerful subject, the glorious landscape and the effort made to create a wonderful set and spectacular images, it is a shame that much attention was not paid to acting. <br /> <br />
