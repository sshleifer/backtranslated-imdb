The past creeps on a rehab addict when he reconnects with his brother-in-law and a former boyfriend after what he hoped was his last stint in detox. "The dramas of life", presented here in the most simplistic way imaginable (not even the script has any bite or jokes). The cast consists of attractive, beautiful actors who are smiling at each other, and the music and photography are lugubrious (a few of the visual effects are ridiculous, indie clich√© touches the throwing message). Although it was written and directed by a man, it was produced by a woman, and I am not sure, but I think this may be a clear reason why this image of two men, burnt out brothers grows closer , never completely gels, never feels natural or seems to live in. It is an attempt to enter a male relationship, but the cautious, sterile presentation is a cheat. No heart is in this, living, breathing or bleeding this material. "The perfect son" is quickly diffused by too many chefs in the kitchen.
