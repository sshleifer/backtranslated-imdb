This must be accompanied by a special assessment and warning: NOT RECOMMENDED TO NORMAL PEOPLE. <br /> <br /> The occupation of Daneliuc with the most dirty body functions here becomes a real nightmare. It is also clear that the man is a misanthrope, he hates everyone - his country his people, his actors, his job. And this hatred makes him blind and he forgets the business he knew long ago. <br /> <br /> This so-called "movie" is just a fierce string of disgusting images with no artistic value and no professional knowledge. It is an insult with good taste and good sense. Shame, shame, shame!
