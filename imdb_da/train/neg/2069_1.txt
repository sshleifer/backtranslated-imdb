I went to see this at the Esquire Theater in Cincy, OH, and - I hate my life now. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeves would have been a more credible boxer. <br /> <br /> As a movie it was painful but seeing Bret Carr personally was seeing desperation at its peak. My favorite part of the movie was watching BC slammed in the face with what appeared to be a "C" battery. The jury is still out on this. It was from a dildo and it was in slow-mo. Yep. <br /> <br /> "Shoot only the left side of the face ... People become famous by demanding things!" - Bret Carr B. Carr donned a chicken dress for a bit of reverse psychology, which roaming Cliftons streets bashing his own movie. He should. This is correct to bash the movie. <br /> <br /> My soul felt chafed for this movie. Bret Carr is not charismatic enough to be the leader of a cult or smart enough to make it matter. That's the feeling you get from What the Bleepesque trickle of brainwashed, impressive neo-yuppies that came to see this Bret Carr work. It's an emotional drainage experience that just thinks about writing about this movie, so goodbye. <br /> <br /> -Anonymous
