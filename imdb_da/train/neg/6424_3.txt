A loaf would be scriptwriter and his agent (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) being forced to live in a self-storage space run by an eccentric and scary leader (Ron Perlman) whom they believe is the serial killer who terrorizes the city , "Costume Killer" (so-called, because after injecting his victims with Windex, dress them in stupid costumes). They convince him that his life story would make a good movie and bring together a group of misfit wannabe filmmakers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson) and discover that the art of making movies can be murdered. <br /> <br /> There is more to this movie, but unfortunately it was back in the editing room and it shows (rumors are the study wanted a "lighter" dark comedy). Our losses (and the actors who all do good jobs and deserve better), as this has the purpose of an unusual black comedy, but only rises to mediocre sweet. <br /> <br /> If you are a Ron Perlman fan this is definitely worth getting just for his performance. His comedic timing is excellent and he has the chance to make some really good impressions (he didn't laugh when he said at the Hellboy movie commentary that he needed an interference when he entered the Jerry Lewis state). He is simply fun to see in this one. <br /> <br /> David Dukes also shines in a two-stage (but pivotal) role.
