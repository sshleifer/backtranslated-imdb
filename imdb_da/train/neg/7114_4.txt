As for film, this movie was pretty good for the mid-50s. There were a couple of times that the lighting was too hot, but the shoots were generally in the frame and kept in focus. The action was above average for a low budget stink, but the direction was horrible. Several scenes were pulled out too long in an attempt at excitement, and the effects were non-existent. The skull's attack in the pond should have been completely removed from the last cut, and any attempt to bring life to the skull was evident with poker and string. I also couldn't help but believe that the budget did not allow them to supply the house so that they kept referrals to movers, and that all the stuff that was in store should come soon. Honestly ... it would have been more enjoyable if it were a worse movie. Being a "good-bad" movie wasn't bad enough, but it wasn't good enough to be "good" either. Get the MST3K version ... it's more fun.
