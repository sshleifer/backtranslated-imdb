People like me will tear this movie apart. It's just not realistic. The reason is sooooooo predictable. You can anticipate everything that happens coincidentally Of course they find the treasure and become dirty rich and fool the bad guy. We've seen it a million times before. The authors of this film must believe that the majority of the film that goes public is stupid. They must be right because most people actually liked this movie. I mean solving puzzles in seconds. The secret tax room hidden under the Manhattan subway? You would think with all the work that has gone on in New York underground That room would have been discovered before. and all that was built during the Civil War? PLEASE And the love story between Ben and Abigail ?? How sweet, and I thought the romance of Clive Cussler novels was weak. They just fall in love within 2 seconds, IF I would be more concerned about saving my own ass and then getting something. hell with the girl and the stupid piece of paper. 1/10 Waste
