I liked the original premise for this movie, which has led me to chase it out, but the problem I quickly found is that you know pretty much what will happen within the first 20-30 minutes ( the doubles come behind the mirror and take over all). <br /> <br /> There is no real twist (which is fine), but the final revelation also doesn't make much sense (how can she be dressed in uncertainty and fear of full movie if she is an evil id besides mirror?). Of course, the scenes were "beyond the mirror" chill when they first appeared, and the blonde's murder is also effectively scary, but in the end, unfortunately this seems to be a movie in search of a story or a more engaging script, arrow atmosphere on the atmosphere and over the top scary sound design for 80-90 minutes, it doesn't really cut it, it actually gets boring.
