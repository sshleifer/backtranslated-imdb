This movie is just not worth your time. Its dependence on New Age mystery serves as the only semi-interesting distraction. The reason is one that has been reused numerous times. <br /> <br /> I was only asked to spend time commenting when I noticed that some have tried to supply the reputation of this nonsense. Their motivation and objectivity are questionable as they encourage you not to see the movie errors, but on its well-conscious New Age awareness message. So would it be okay for some twenty to thirty evangelical Christians, or Islamic fundamentalists, to pour in positive reviews on film / television supporting their views? Despite the poor qualities of production or the lack of truth in any of its historical stories? I do not hope. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the followers come right behind me to say floral things about this movie, despite the truth.
