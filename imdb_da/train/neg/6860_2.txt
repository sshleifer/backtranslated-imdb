Beyond what is crazy people and there are religious nuts out there. The people have virtually no meaning most of the time. The film has no real beginning, middle or ending, and nothing is explained much. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a young man, with the unlikely name Hazel Motes, who apparently returns from a battle in the army. <br /> <br /> He takes a trip to a two-story house in extreme decay, windows on board. He goes into the house, walks around and finally writes a note that he leaves there. This scene comes to nothing and we learn nothing more about the house or its history. <br /> <br /> It is never explained exactly if the house is or where the people have gone, but we get the impression Hazel has probably lived there at a time. <br /> <br /> Hazel decides to go to a city. Why - we don't know. When he arrives at this city, he writes a name and address he looks at a bathroom wall and goes to visit this woman, who is a surprisingly bold hooker. He sees her for a while, and then he doesn't seem to see her anymore. Like everything else in this movie, it comes to nothing and does not serve any purpose. A young man named Enoch tries to be kind to him, but Hazel is really not interested, even though they continue to cross paths. </ br /> <br /> Enoch is as crazy as you can get. One of his habits is to go to the zoo and stand in front of the cage, where the chimpanzees are and talk to them insultingly. <br /> <br /> We never really know why Enok behaves like he does or why Hazel behaves like he did, beyond the fact, Hazel had an overdose of old-time frightening, fundamentalist religion through his grandfather. <br /> <br /> Later, Enoch is thrilled with a man dressing in a gorilla suit and getting the gorilla costume out of him and then running around in it. <br /> <br /> Hazel, who is hurt quite tight and seems to be in a constant boundary, does a little street proclamation. I got the impression that he was trying to rid himself of the truths of the religion that had been drilled in him. <br /> <br /> He has several meetings with a preacher and his daughter, although their interactions never really matter, and there is no plot line. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Hazel yields to complete religious fervor and begins self-harm. <br /> <br /> It's a very strange movie. Interesting in that is oddity, but apart from that, it has absolutely nothing to do for it. The game does an excellent job, but this movie fails to deliver either a point of view or a story. <Br /> <br /> The movie also has the characters throwing around the N word from time to time without connection to the rest of the dialog. <br /> <br /> 2 stars
