This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was like a "homework" for a movie class. It is missing the mark when it comes to the "message" it is trying to relay. Signs are over exaggerated, bad acting and as for a plot ... it's totally ridiculous. The cover is what made me believe it can be a decent movie, contributing is nice and it's about it. Moral of this movie: NEVER JUDGE A MOVIE OF IT'S COVER! Save your time, money and energy and make your own home video and you'll be far better than me. It was painful to see and frankly I am surprised that someone would spend money to make and distribute it!
