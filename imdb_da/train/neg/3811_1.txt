I hated this crap every Friday as part of tgif it was on and consistently sucked great time with stupidity every week. If you want to see something fun, see "No On Would Tell" Starting Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, it's really fun, showing exactly why nobody ever goes on a good movie career after making a horrible TV show. This show makes me really sick, I hate these kids, and Bob has to go out of a bridge to always do this crapfest. I've seen some things everywhere, but here. I write 10 lines! See 'full house' to see the smallest humanity has to offer in the way of art and entertainment.
