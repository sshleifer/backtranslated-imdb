Zombie Review # 3 <br /> ** Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Getting movies is actually "so bad, they're good", and Zombi 3 isn't just bad, it's miserable, Inexplicably bad in so many ways that a whole new language may be needed to just describe them all. More than that, it is a movie credited to Lucio Fulci that even by his standards absolutely no coherence, meaning or reason. But we cannot blame Fulci for not being really led by him, but by Bruno Mattei, who does not even have Fulci's sense of style to help carry the film. Mattei seems to have brought a little to the movie, but staggering ineptitude. Then I am ashamed to say how much I enjoyed every worthless minute of Zombi 3. It has no redeeming features - in a genre known for thin figures, weak history and lack of film-making skills, the Zombi 3 pushes the boat out, but it is even more fun than Nightmare City. The "action" starts when "Death 1" gas is stolen from a military base and damaged in flight. Who is the thief, why did he steal it, and why did the US military think creating cannibalistic legions of the living dead would be a good idea? All of these questions and more will not be answered in Zombi 3 .... After hiding in a hotel, the infected thief gets sour from all the green plastics growing on his face before being tracked by the army as something stupidly decides the best way to dispose of its corpse will be to burn it and send "Death 1" into the atmosphere resulting in ... zombie birds! Who then attacks people and turns them into zombie people !!! (If zombies are cannibals, why not the zombie birds just attack other birds?) <br /> <br /> Then we meet our "heroes", a trio of horny GIs, and a coachload of girls. There are also a few other guys with them, but they are not important - nobody is important here. You are hard pressed to remember everyone's face, let alone their name or find a reason to worry about them. They end up hiding at the same hotel as the thief (a week ago this was life with life, now it's buzzing with flies!)) But there is no escape from the undead. <br /> <br /> By this point out that you are either completely sucked in or you have turned the damn thing away. The manuscript is so terrible, even though the greatest actor in the world couldn't save it, so it's just as good to have some of the worst - and not just the human characters, the zombie action here is a very low time. There is no consistency in how the zombies behave - some shame about the time honored style, others fully engage in fist battles or are left with machettes, not to mention the zombies who are still able to talk (a gimmick that gives the movie it's HORRIFYING TWIST ENDING). They die from shot to chest (instead of head) and are even knocked out by a good left hook. How can you knock out a zombie ??? !!!!! In fact, the emphasis on poorly executed 80s often makes it like an episode of V ... The zombies also spend a lot of time hiding, apparently waiting for hours in ridiculous places on the chance of some poor sap going past and being scared by their life. They hide in bushes, in garages, in cabins, on roofs, in the water and even during pregnant women. At some point, a zombie follows a woman up the stairs. To kill and eat her? None! Pushing her into the water, the zombies and their scary sense of humor! <br /> <br /> There are plenty of gore ones themselves. Loins are hacked, sores pour green pus, and there is much in the way of eating meat, and people get their faces crumbled in. There is nothing to fit the original eye piercing, but if bad makeup effects are your bag, you will not be relieved. <br /> <br /> All this and I haven't even mentioned the horrible music, the unexplained flying zombie head, the scientist whose actor actually manages to stand out as really bad, or the final chilling punchline ... . in a brilliant twist on the original radio station is overrun by zombies, zombi 3 gives us a real zombie dj !! "He's gone over to their side!" Our escaped heroes wept before we vowed to continue to fight the immersion in a sequel that unfortunately never came. Zombi 3 is a nonsense - it would not be a loss to the world if every press was destroyed and all records of its existence were deleted, but somehow I felt my life richer to have seen it. <br /> <br /> Did I say richer? I meant 88 minutes shorter ...
