During a sleepless night, I switched through the channels and found this embarrassment for a movie. What did they think? <br /> <br /> If this is the life after "Remote Control" for Kari (Wuhrer) Salin, no wonder she's gone nowhere. <br /> <br /> And why did David Keith take this role? It's pathetic! <br /> <br /> At least I hit the movie near the end so I didn't get much of the plot. But it must have been the best part. This nerdy college kid brings home this dominatrix-ish girl ... this scene is straight out of the comics - or the cheap porn movies. She calls the mother anal reluctant and kisses her father "Oh, I don't expect the tongue!" Big lines! <br /> <br /> After that, I had to see how it ended. <br /> <br /> Of course, this bitch from hell has a helluva passing by so the SWAT team is upstairs. And yes ... they surround her! And yes yes! The child blows her brains out !!!! AHAHHAHAHAHA !! <br /> <br /> This is must-see TV. <br /> <br />
