It is apparently a Z-grade DTV horror movie. <br /> <br /> But with lines like: <br /> <br /> "It's easy to die, I have many times" <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> "Why are you reading that book?" "Because it makes the plot more interesting" <br /> <br /> and <br /> <br /> "You have made you in here, now you can come out again!" (after he takes a man into the basement) <br /> <br /> (and listen to what they are chanting) <br /> <br /> This is not clear what this movie was made In the oldest time of post-structuralism, is actually whether or not it is just bad filmmaking. The play is terrible, but some actors I know will hammer it up? <br /> <br /> An old house, clearly cut with a modern home, is the place of murder. A (bad) movie is made in the grounds, and the story repeats again.
