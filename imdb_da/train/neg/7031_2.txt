What made me track this movie down was view Vampyres, I thought I should get the other movies this guy (Larroz) has done, I was sorry I tracked this down, it's a weak attempt at an occult / satanic type movie laden with sex and only sex (with ugly actors and actresses this is an excuse for sleaze. The only redeeming factor was the setting and atmosphere, avoid this, too much hype surrounds it, it's not worth trying to find what it refers to to Welcome to the Gatehouse Edition, I hope he has some other movies that live up to Vampire's, Oh, and the goat's scene was very boring, I understand that is what carries hype.
