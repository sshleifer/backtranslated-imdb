Ever since I started visiting this site and voting for movies, I've never given a movie a rating of 1. Even the disturbing "Dance! Workout with Barbie" got a 2. There is a reason for this. <br /> Every time I find myself what I think is a really bad movie, I have to stop and ask myself the following question: "Is this movie really as bad as the horrible soul-sucking animal that is "Theodore Rex"? "And I've never been able to answer" yes ". I would give some reason to know what crackhead said "Hi! Let's restore 'Blade Runner' with Barney in Harrison Ford Role!" And decided that it was a good idea to actually spend time and money to commit it to filming. In addition, I would like to know what the hell kind of market they would sell this to if it hadn't gone to video. This is the rare monster: A movie that is too violent for children and too crazy foolish for adults. I want to ask "what did they think?" But in this case it may actually be superfluous. <br /> In any case, all you need to know is that you should only expose yourself to this monstrosity if you are one of the five or six healthy fans of "Howard the Duck", or If you are curious to see the most evil insane films all the time or you will really punish yourself.
