This collection really sucks! <br /> <br /> I rented it and thought I'd really enjoy some good games. Man this sucked! Fast-paced cuts, an extremely annoying speaker, and the fighting itself were heavily edited and shortened (I am thinking in particular of Jet Li's Fists of Legend match and Jackie Khan's drunken master 2 fight). <Br /> <br /> And what about the brawling streetfighters? What's so cool about it? I've seen more interesting battles for fighting cases! <br /> <br /> This is a stupid collection of slices for stupid people. <br /> <br /> Never buy this movie! Don't encourage the people who made this crap to do more of this crap! <br /> <br /> Instead, buy the movies where the battles were off and wath the fighting in their innocent glory!
