Really bad movie doesn't offer anything new. The usual squeaks and moans try to make makeup into a confused but thin story. Action is hardly pathetic. Why Liam Neeson signed this is someone guess. Owen Wilson is really one of the worst performances in the latest horror movie story. Catherine Zeta Jones is fun to watch and not much else though Lili Tayor did an above average job. The special effects were pretty memorable and the house itself was breathtaking and hauntingly gorgeous. But they cannot make makeup for the poor trades and the story that seems to have been thrown together at the last minute. Do not want to.
