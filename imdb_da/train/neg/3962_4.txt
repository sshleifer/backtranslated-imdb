I was really looking forward to seeing Nana after seeing Renoir amazing debut work, Whirlpool of Fate. I had read that Nana was generally considered his best silent movie, so I had great hopes. Unfortunately, it felt like a big step backwards. <br /> <br /> Catherine Hessling is the main problem with this movie. Her acting is over the top, even for a quiet movie. Her acting is more like what one would expect in a movie from the early teens, not in the late 20s. She usually has the same face that reminds me (sorry to say) of someone with constipation pain. It was also very hard to believe that anyone would fall for this femme fatale. There was nothing charming about her at all. <br /> <br /> The movie was also quite long, the camera's work was uninteresting (apart from a shot of a horse race) and editing was boring. The story reminded me of Pabst's Pandora's Box. It is interesting to compare the two because there are only three years between these films. Pandora's box simply scores at all levels where Nana fails. <br /> <br /> This movie is only for Renoir compliments or very serious silent movie buffs.
