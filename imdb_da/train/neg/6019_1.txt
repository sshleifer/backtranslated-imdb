This movie is a reason why IMDB should allow a vote of 0/10. The action is horrible, even what some here have promised, the Karpathia character! The script looks like it was written in haste. In one scene, the black preacher left behind when asked by Buck was what "dan7" in the computer graphics meant, "Daniel 7, * CHAPTER * 24." He probably meant VERSE 24, but the film authorities missed this slip. Perhaps the worst part is that the film's eschatological position is biblically unhealthy. While many Christians have joined the film's interpretation of end-time events, such an interpretation is in my opinion * defective. To understand these errors, read "Christian Will Go Through the Tribulation" by Jim McKeever and "The Blessed Hope, Biblical Study of Second Advent and the Rapture" by George E. Ladd.
