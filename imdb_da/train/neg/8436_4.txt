David Mamet is a very interesting and very equal director. His first movie 'House of Games' was the one I liked best and it set a series of movies with characters whose life perspective changes as they enter complicated situations, and it also sees the perspective of the viewer. <br /> <br /> So is 'Homicide', which from the title tries to put the viewer's mind to the usual crime drama. The main characters are two police, one Jewish and one Irish, dealing with a racist charge. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner, who turns out to be an old veteran of the Israeli independence war, triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective. <br /> <br /> This is where the error in the movie is more apparent. The awakening process is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operative, and the way the detective ultimately goes to the final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the movie itself is Mamet-like smart, but disappointing from a human emotional perspective. Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong notions, but the shortcomings of history are too clear to easily compensate.
