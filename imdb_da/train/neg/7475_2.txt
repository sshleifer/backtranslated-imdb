To be honest, I knew what to expect before I saw this movie, and I have to say it has the worst play I've ever seen. It has its moments, and at a comedy level, it's very entertaining, but I'm afraid it's not scary, and stupidity has taken on a new level. There is a lot of unnecessary doing, and the plot is everywhere. I have no idea why foreigners were evil and why they even came to this remote part of Wales (I mean who would go there anyway?) But I didn't care at the time because I was amused by the costumes and the bad CGI. As far as B movies go, this title deserves "to be so bad, it's good" and kudos to the filmmakers, because they probably knew what they were doing. For a long time these movies must continue .....
