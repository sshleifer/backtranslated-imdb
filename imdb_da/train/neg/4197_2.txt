Incredibly bad play, a not good, fuzzy story and flashy images and slow movements where they are least needed: Adrenaline is all that a movie should not be. <br /> <br /> Georgina Verbaan (such a so-so soap actress who has not participated in her English classes) plays rich girl Freya, who has the habit of "thrill seeking". Who basically do dangerous stunts, breaks things and annoys people. And not in a fun Jackass way. Then there is Dracko (Rivas). He leads pretty well, but has other illegal activities on the side. Then there is Freya's father (Lockyer), who also plays a dubious role. And finally we got Jason (debutant Fyall), the girlfriend of Freya. <br /> <br /> One day, Freya disappears and everyone seems involved, but we, the viewer are really indifferent as none of the cast is either fit or credible, and history makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Why was it made? 10.2.
