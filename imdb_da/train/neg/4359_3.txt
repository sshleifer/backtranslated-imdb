Wow, after you have deleted the disc by Timo Roses "Rout City" after approx. 15 minutes (South Park is about more than pointless curse ... I think some people just don't understand it). I was interested in this movie. I read a lot of positive things, and the packaging and appearance of the film seemed far from the total waste I had expected after "Rout city". <br /> <br /> Surprise: The movie is not total garbage, but the problem seems to be exactly that. Timo Rose tries to walk in the footsteps of German Horror / Splatter Cinema like Olaf Ittenbach and liken. It means "Barricade" is in parts extremely gory and detailed. Gore FX is not really trustworthy, but OK, the play is OK, but in some cases it gets clean. The hillbilly chick in the opening sequence is ridiculous and doesn't get better until she's shot. <br /> <br /> So what's the problem ... the movie is gory, has a typical German underground vibe (including the classic booby shot in blood), OK FX and a modern feel to what the packaging already promised? <br /> <br /> 1. Scripture is total BS. You get a typical hillbilly / lost in forest history with some guys + crazy camping out and meeting a degenerated hillbilly family. Everything only leads to torture / mutilation scenes and seems incredibly random and meaningless. This is the first thing that makes "Barricade" half-hearted. <br /> <br /> 2. Randomly is also the perfect description of a lot of camera work (I liked the repeated cut for the tweezers in the extended booby torture scene ... whether they had no material or the editor is working in a hardware store). Even worse editing ... surely, it's modern and far better than many other movies in the genre, but it's RANDOM. You have an overuse of the typical exposure effect everywhere and without significance ... it's just there ... all the time. Then there is some green / noisy movie look, which is also just thrown here and there for that reason I am not supposed to. <br /> <br /> 3. Like the aforementioned effects, there are many repetitive things in here. For example, most of the killings are edited with multiple repetitions of stabbing and punching. It is OK once, but here it is annoying and false, especially towards the end. Annoying also attaches to "the music" which is used permanently without any change in the background. It doesn't take long before it hardly makes the film bearable. <br /> <br /> 4. From all this comes the biggest problem with this movie (and many others in my opinion). If you make a splash movie with trashy, you feel pretty idiotic to polish it with special FX and new school editing. It looks like they are taking it too seriously. It's not fun because the decent Gore FX is wasted in this context. And where the classic Gore FX is OK, the computer's FX in scenes like the plug in the mouth or the shot at the end looks pretty stupid (and 3D splatter sucks me most even in movies with a budget and decent 3D artists). <Br /> <br /> I often wondered if the time of serious splatter movies is over and "Barricade" is just another example, it may be time to put it in the grave. It's not fun, has no character and is too sad for its appearance. The script is an inexpensive attempt at "Wrong Turn" and "TCM" that leads absolutely nowhere. You can take it literally ... the end is right there and just as random as many other things here ("I love you" in a splatter flick ... come on !!). "Barricade" tries to incorporate a lot and fails ... you can certainly accelerate through this movie for some extensive disembowelment, acid facial melting, nipple crushing and classic Friday the 13th style stabbing a pair while fingers in a tent (bloody boobies hooray!). But it's really hard to get through this. Overall failure, especially because you can see it could have been something.
