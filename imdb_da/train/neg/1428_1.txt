Although this film was made, dogma emerged as the predominant film-making method, and before digital triumphant overreach it. You get points. This masterpiece in 1991 clearly expects these developments. Corin Nemec is just as excellent as ne'er makes it good writer and narrator. The pace is slow but elegant, because the cinematography is so beautiful. Record it the next time it is on T.V., because I guarantee you will never see a better nostalgia-rip-off made-for-T.V. movie. Direct-to-video has never felt so good!
