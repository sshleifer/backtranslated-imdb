This was shown on the biography channel and was as informative as a children's cartoon! I gave it 2 out of 10 because it was aware of details because it mostly had a 70s feel to it, and the three ladies playing the three original angels looked like them, so the makeup was good. <br /> <br /> This should be the biography of the biography channel, but it was invalid of all that normally / usually seen in one of their biographies. No interviews with surviving cast members, crew members, production team members, etc., or their friends, families and any cinemas of these people. In fact, I know as much about the program as I did before I saw this movie, which was based on the (supposedly) biographical book. As if actually learning something that no one knew about the program and was not common knowledge well, it had never happened.
