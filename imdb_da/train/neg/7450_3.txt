I've watched this movie at the cinema many years ago, and one thing surprised me so badly that I couldn't see any redeeming virtues in the movies: Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman who never smiles or laughs while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks. Danny Glover was thrown like the bad guy, but - again - most viewers imagination couldn't go far enough to believe in him in that role. Also, Jared Leto was not credible as the former medical student. The excitement was just not there, as the killer was known very early. The final was again, neither dramatic nor tense: no one around me was worried about what would happen next time. All we could wait for was the end of the movie. All in all, a disappointing evening spent at the cinema.
