Seems everyone in this movie channels Woody Allen. They stutter and pause and stutter a little more. Only for REALY die-hard DeNero fans! It tries to seem edgy and artistic - but it looks like it looks like a very low budget film made by college students. The most used word in the whole movie is "hum". However, the film points to the atmosphere at the end of the sixties / seventies. If you like movies where people are constantly talking about each other, horrible lighting (even if it's for "the sake of art") and makes you feel like you're sitting in a lame political meeting, then you might like it - but you're have to be very bored. I found this cd in dollar bin and now I know why.
