Before I start watching the show, I heard it was amazing and aesthetically very interesting. What a deception is scripts so stupid that I am absolutely sure the authors are son and grandchildren of Scoobidoo writers. And what about SFX and colors, they are so extreme that it is painful to see, the colors are not saturated, they are over-saturated, and scripts are overwritten and the show is overstated. This show is like a bad pie where a child would only have sugar and butter thought because these ingredients are the best they are enough. Unfortunately for this show, the only two ingredients in this show are finally vacuity and a complete lack of credibility.
