I know I have already added a comment, but I just wanted to clarify something ... I'm not an old joiner from Baby Booms generation who grew up in a flickering b / w image of Phil Silvers, Jackie Gleason, etc. <br /> <br /> Before I was born, Bilko was already 20 years old, but I had the pleasure of discovering Phil Silver's Bilko courtesy of BBC2. I wonder if I would have had Steve Martin's travesty if I hadn't seen or heard of Phil Silvers - I don't know - maybe I would. <br /> <br /> Some of the other reviewers who think of this movie are worth a '10' admitting they haven't seen the original. I can only encourage you to spend 21 minutes in your life and see a single episode. If after seeing the original Ernie, Colonel Hall, Ritzig & Emma, ​​Duane Doberman, Henshaw, Dino, Flashman, Zimmerman, Mullin et al. Still think Steve Martin's movie is more than a '2' pint.
