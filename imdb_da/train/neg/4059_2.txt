Rarely has such a fantastic throw been wasted so badly. Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Illeana Douglas, Ethan Hawke, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken and John Turturro all jumped aboard, only to be torpedoed by a script that doesn't look more than a Hollywood joke. Tying Martin Scorsese to this was probably the draw, but the end result is far less than the sum of it's parts. Looks like a nightmare that has gone terribly wrong, each scene seems more constructed than the next. "Search and Destroy" is nothing more than abstract, stylish, self-reliant nonsense, and the whole movie is definitely boring .......... NOTE
