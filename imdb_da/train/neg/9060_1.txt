Channel surfing and caught this on LOGO. It was one of them, "I have to see this because it is so terribly bad" moments like the Roadhouse without the joy. Scripture is terrible; It is low budget and then there is the abyss where is this epic to be thrown and never seen from again. I mean, the protagonists go to a shipyard in some rented houses, and the house is, well, it's common, which is nothing, but they choose to show all the landlords who lean over it as it was the Sistine Chapel. I'm sorry to see 6 guys staring into each 10'x10 'boring room with a futon in it and gushing is paralyzed. I suppose they didn't learn anything from Bad News Bears in Breaking Training (see hotel room check scene) ... wow a toilet !!! yaayyyyy !!!! I don't buy it all over the top, so everything goes routinely. If it smells ... and it looks ... well, you know the rest. <br /> <br /> Avoid as bothered. <br /> <br /> Editing: Apparently other more intentional reviewers believe that since I did not like this movie, I am an "obvious hate" that I can only assume means I'm phobic, which of course is not is true. I decided to do this crazy, crazy thing and judge the movie based on the actual content of the movie and not its mere presence (that is, the refreshing to see ...). It can be refreshing to see, but it does not correspond to a great movie, just give them some better material to work with and tighter direction. In fact, I welcome the effort. Frankly, I'd rather listen to my kitchen of distinctive catalog than see it again.
