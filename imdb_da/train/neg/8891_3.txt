It is easy to know the most famous of all Shakespeare players. Shoddy direction, stagnant study work and erratic performance pampers a fine tragedy. In the city of Verona, Capulets and Montagues have been feuding for centuries, but tragedy is imminent when Romeo (Patrick Rycart), a Montague, falls in love with Juliet (Rebecca Saire), a Capulet. Bloodshed soon breaks out ... <br /> <br /> Studio work, especially during the daytime, seriously stagnates the physician's energy. It's a story that with its energy deserves to be shot outdoors. Along with this, the costumes are scary, with too many tights and ridiculous codpieces. The scene battle looks awful, with too much stretching and running around to be engaging. <br /> <br /> Patrick Ryecart is too easy to be a really effective Romeo. He controls the character's intensity when the plot goes, but his stubborn accent and gentle, often inaccurate eyes limit his reach. It is very difficult for the public to relate to this Romeo. Rebecca Saire is too youthful to be a good Juliet - she captures the character's na√Øve but a little more sassiness would have been welcome. <br /> <br /> The supporting roles are not much better. Joseph O'Connor's Friar Laurence is fine, but for many of his best lines has been cut. Anthony Andrews' Mercutio belongs to the stage and not to the camera. He gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result. Alan Rickman, who emphasizes his role, has almost no presence as tybals. He developed an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in recent years, but it is not in evidence here. The prince can be a good part with his short appearance, but actor Lawrence Naismith fails to give that part any authority on the camera. Only Micheal Hordern, who is probably his best role in this series, comes out of this with some dignity. His Capulet is well played and a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> See one of the other versions of this story instead.
