If John Waters had written and directed the "House of 1000 Corpses" after being repeatedly crouched with a heavy object, the result would probably be something like "The Blood Shed." It is mildly entertaining for the first half hour, but then it slips into a sort of featureless glop of constant screaming and people doing things to each other's genitals with electric cutting knives, cutlery and pliers. Susan Adriensen (Sno Cakes) is incredibly annoying, and Terry West (Elvis Bullion) is almost as bad no matter what he does in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing about "The Blood Shed" is that it won't take most viewers a long time to forget it.
