IF you are planning to watch this movie, please reconsider. I don't usually write my comments on anything I've seen on television, but this was such a waste of my life that I needed to do something productive to get the bad taste out of my mouth. Critics this movie would take too long, as there are so many things wrong with it. I just want to say, please never see this movie. It was a total waste of my time and it will be a waste of yours. Anyone who wrote a positive review of this movie is one of two things; totally incomplete or working for the company that produced it. Again I guarantee you will really regret watching this movie!
