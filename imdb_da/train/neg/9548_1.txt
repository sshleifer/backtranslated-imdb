I can't believe I saw this expecting more. It starts ok. This movie pushes the boundaries of reality too far !! At least the first was a bit realistic. It rips off the first movie and even mentions Joshua Project. Anyone who knows anything about computers will hate this movie. It has a good message in it though, look out for big brother !!! The movie just makes it as if Big Brother is much bigger than he actually is. It was very aggravating. Even the makeup on the actors was quite bad. Some of the actors are pretty good. However, some of the actors are really bad. The script was OK at some points and completely messed up with other parts. This movie plays about amenities about every five minutes. As I said, I can't believe I was watching it expect more. I think I'm going to pop the original to get back to the ground ... Q
