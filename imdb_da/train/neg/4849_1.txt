I just rented it today .... heard many good reviews in advance. WOW !! What a pile of steaming poo this movie is !! Know any address of the director so I can get my five dollars back ???? Finally, "Stop-loss" from "Worst Iraq War Movie Ever" hit the number one place. To be fair, I don't think there is any good Iraq war film anyway, but it was really bad. <br /> <br /> I won't go into any technical inaccuracies that are hundreds of reviews from other GWOT veterinarians who detail them all. If the director pleaded to hear even the slightest E-nothing about technical accuracy, they could have made the movie something realistic .... maybe. I suppose the author should have "credit" for this waste of a movie. Of course, he or she hatched the plot of this movie from some vivid imagination that was not affected by the reality limitations. Does anyone apologize for what the meaning of this movie was? Was there a message? Seriously though ..... WTF ???? <br /> <br /> I'm pretty surprised at all the positive reviews really. This movie is hard to see as a veterinarian because of all the clear inaccuracies, but even if one could overlook it, the plot sucks, signs are low (and at least said) and the play is at best poor. It's ironic, I suppose, this movie should be about explosive ordination, because it's the biggest bomb I've seen this year.
