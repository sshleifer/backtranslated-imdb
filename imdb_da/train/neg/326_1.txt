This early Adam Sandler movie was comparable to his life as a comic book in the same period in 1989. His character's constant recognition of his hidden comics and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from Sandler than the script. The movie is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature film, like Big Daddy or even Corny Billy Maddison. Unfortunately, Sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent, successful and fun way when this film was made, like his character. Most of the movie's "jokes" come from Sandler, who has conversations with himself, usually over his unrecognized comics, and settles because he's too ugly and can't get women. The movie is hard to look at because it doesn't treat itself like a real movie. Sandler talks to the camera and viewers throughout the film, who often refer to the film's low budget or questionable content. The movie is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to see. I would immediately forget that I myself saw this movie after it was over for fear that if more people found out, it would ruin Sandler's career. Send this one up in the video store, I rented it for free and it was still a waste of time.
