For the first few seasons, I thought the apprentice was a very engaging and exciting show. The combination of reality TV and a 16-week job interview was innovative, and the producers of the show managed to keep the show relevant and not for "out there". The new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke, and it has absolutely nothing to do with business - at all. In the earlier seasons, they used to put more emphasis on business tasks - now the focus is mostly on the board where the participants are expected to do everything to keep them on the show (ie lying, garbage, backstabbing, etc.). Boardroom can be entertaining to see, but it's low-end entertainment - Sometimes you wonder if you see a repetition of an old Jerry Springer episode. The tasks on the show are most boring and mostly a showcase for the companies that are stupid enough to pay NBC for advertising. And what is the deal about half of the participants who live in tents in season 6? It's just stupid and has nothing to do with business in reality. <br /> <br /> I have absolutely no respect for any of the participants this season, they all look like idiots to me. In previous seasons, at least some of the participants had a bit of integrity, now the participants seem to be killing their own mother to keep them on the show. It also seems that Donald Trump's massive ego is getting bigger and bigger for every season that goes by and to be honest, I can't see why anyone with reason will work for him. His rationality in the board does not at all make any sense, and sometimes it seems like he just likes separating people into what it is worth. <br /> <br /> R.I.P Apprentice. NBC, for God's sake, get the show off the air as soon as possible. It's just too embarrassing to see. The apprentice was once a great television show, but now it's just a big fat joke.
