This movie has many disadvantages and that is all I could see. It is painfully long and terribly straightened. I could see the entire audience being impatient and waiting for it to end. The maturity is well over 3 hours, which could have been edited for less than 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The transition between stories is average. Most people confessed to being seated and expecting something better to come out. <br /> <br /> It's fun only in pockets. ambitious project and one under par execution. govinda does a fair job, anil kapoor disappointed me, we rest as expected. If you are expecting something close to babel or actually love it then no matter how close.
