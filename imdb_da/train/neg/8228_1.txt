The problem with this movie is that it's shot at the worst possible camera and the movie is blurry and grainy. Maybe it's just the fact that the one holding the camera couldn't keep quiet because they had a fit or something. There is also too much poop and vomit in this movie. There is some vomiting every 20 minutes and it makes me think this was made by some bulimic or something. It was disgusting. Then there is the annoying high altitude screaming that continues and continues and does not stop until the credits roll. I also did not suffer when all her friends were shot (or not I do not know) and she goes into the habit and ties aids. It was just really stupid to have it yourself in a movie. How much gas can a person take to get a van? It must be a lot because they don't run out of gas for the rest of the movie. It was a horrible movie and I would highly recommend you never see it throughout your life.
