In the beginning I was happy to know about a new superman movie, though it will be great, but it wasn't. <br /> <br /> is a bad copy of the Richard Donner work, Lex is again a villain who doesn't do anything else, even played by Kevin spice. <br /> <br /> The evil plan is the same of the first movie of Donner that is very forced. <br /> <br /> The script is predictable and simple (all things Luthor finds in a museum or an old lady). The story is the wrong thing it must be Kevin Smith Script and it could be better. <br /> <br /> I just hope a sequel without Brian Singer and with a new talent director to do something new and not a copy. <br /> <br /> Everyone will read you later
