After reading all the rave reviews about this movie and a couple that gives it a so-so. I finally decided to throw in my no cents worth. I agree with most people on the point that if it hadn't been for Lauren Lewis and Chris Ferry, it would have been a disaster. Filmed in Mariette OH. just north of Dogpatch, where all the real talent fled south 77 years ago, at least as far as a tank of gas would allow. I got a chuckle from reviewers who subtly claim that they cerebrate a little better than most by claiming that they followed the plot without a confusion of confusion. This broad tale of the Crook brothers is like an old record with a ship in it. As an American, I understand the difficulties that film experts have to face. A trip to Romania would certainly have wiped out the budget. Let's see it all this movie was a loop the loop of Claire in the gas station, Claire on the side of the road, Claire under the ink, Claire in the house, Claire in the cornfield, Claire in school. Claire here and Claire there. It became almost monotonous and would have if she had not been the best actor in the cast. Josh and Jeff have to live, but don't write a two-sided script and turn it into an hour, twenty flick. Before you write another play about dreamy ghosts, see an episode or two of Ghost Whisperer or something and get a little background. All the cast except the above and a few others were engaged in their first and last movie. There is also a look of co-director Jeff as he is in all his films. Like Alfred Hitchcock, eh? One thing the film was about to make is that the cameraman seemed to have a fixation on Lauren Lewis' derriere. Well, with all the sarcasm now satisfied, I still recommend the movie to horror buff just to see this young actress in the formative time of her career (I hope) and that Chris Ferry has established itself as a villain worth seeing.
