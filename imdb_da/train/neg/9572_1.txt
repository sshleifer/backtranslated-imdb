One of the worst movies I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through, Killer Tongue is a terrible melange of the worst elements of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Brain Damage, and Pulp Fiction. Designed primarily to offend, apparently, but inane that only the most hidebound conservatives would be taken into it.
