About 15 minutes in, my wife had already wanted to leave. Not so much because of the material, but its lack. They decided to fill in the topics where the fun stuff should have been with as much language and absolutely vulgar talk as they could. When this would give up (very rarely), we will sit back and watch (not laugh, remember you) and wait for the next widespread or offensive remark (s). After approx. 35 minutes we both stood up and went. Everything we read said how good it was. The trailer looked good, and Roger Ebert actually called it "intelligent" and said it wasn't a raw sex comedy. Did he go to the right movie? Along with being cool, it's the only other movie I've ever gone on ... and I have no regrets. I'm sick of trying to see comedies in America.
