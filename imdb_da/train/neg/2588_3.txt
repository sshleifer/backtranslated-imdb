Band Camp was terrible, The Naked Mile was a little better, and this third to DVD in the American Pie franchise seems to be the same quality as its predecessor. Basically, Erik Stifler (John White) attended his girlfriend after meeting his virginity, and now he and Mike 'Cooze' Coozeman (Jake Siegel) go with Erik's cousin Dwight (Steve Talley) in college. With many parties' pledges, lots of spirits and enough hot chickens at Beta House, they have only 50 listed jobs to become official privileged members. But a threat appears with the rivals GEK ("Geek") House, led by power-seeking geek (and sheep shooters) Edgar (Tyrone Savage), who offers bigger and better than what Beta has. In order to settle once and for all, Beta and Gek go in battle with the banned for forty years that Greek games strike each other with the loser moving out. The last champion, Noah Levenstein and Jim's Dad (the only regular Eugene Levy) running the show, watching the people embrace bras, a gladiator duel floating on water, catching a greased pig, Russian roulette in the mouth with cartridges of aged horse spunk, wife carrying and drink a full keg of alcohol (with puking not disqualifying). It all comes to the sudden death, with a guy getting stripper around, and they have to resist cumming, Beta House wins when Edgar cums with a girl dressed as a sheep on his lap. Also star Flubber's Christopher McDonald as Mr. Stifler, Meghan Heffern as Ashley, Dan Petronijevic as Bull, Nic Nac as Bobby, Christine Barger as Margie, Italy Ricci as Laura Johnson, Moshana Halbert as Sara Coleman, Sarah Power as Denise, Andreja Punkris as Stacy and Jordan Prentice as Rock. The necessity amount is very little increased, like the gravity of the jokes, and I could guess it's rated a star out of five, but I like it. Sufficient!
