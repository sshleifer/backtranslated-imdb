What is the dark video in the beginning and sporadically throughout the movie? It's as if someone is putting muddy water on the camera lens. <br /> <br /> Violence and nudity can knock some people away, but it is with the worst act that makes a good cult movie I suppose. /> <br /> My favorite line is delivered by Tarquin the Vampire, "Alas, your race is stupid." Okay, no one should ever say "unfortunately" in a movie line unless they are English and live in the 18th century. <p> <p> The actor of the Van Helsing character and the bad girl "Rally" is not bad. I also liked Master Little played by Ron Little. Wicked Martial Arts! Don't take it too seriously and you'll enjoy it.
