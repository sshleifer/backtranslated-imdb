If you're looking to be offended or entertained or both, you'll probably have to look elsewhere. LMOTP really isn't even very thoughtful beyond rehashing the usual stupid clich√©s. At the end of the second episode, I felt a little embarrassed that I actually passed through the rugged mess. In addition to the thin blurred gimmicky premise that attracted all the initial attention to it initially, it is just another crippled, innocuous, and anti-septic commentary and entertainment quote that CBC typically excel in producing. And when "ZOMG MUSLIMS IN RURAL CANADA ROFLMAO !!" The hype welcomes itself, the show is likely to follow in ether with cancellation because it is so shallow when judged solely because of its benefits. Unless you are obsessed with Muslim culture in the West and / or are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject. I really can't see how LMOTP is fun beyond fulfilling the hype of hype. Other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural / ethnic dichotomy in Western multiethnic societies. LMOTP will never rank among them in entertainment or insight.
