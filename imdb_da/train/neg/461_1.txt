Warning: Avoid this super duper horrible movie ... If you saw it, you will be SOOOOOOOOO disappointed. <br /> <br /> Pam and Denise are grandma's age now, what are they doing? Trying to HARD to be young innocent and sexy, just not working at all. Pam and Denise seem so horrible in this movie. <br /> <br /> Plus, Scripture is absolutely horrible, I can't believe anyone can come up with such stupid ideas. With the development of the film industry, film lovers are not as easy to satisfy as those of the last century. I bet the filmmakers of the last century also hate this. <br /> <br /> Stay away from it. I think watching the "White Chicks" from 2004, it's so much better that this ... doesn't make a mistake at the time I thought it was the worst movie I've ever seen.
