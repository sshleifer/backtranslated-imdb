If this movie is meant to discourage people from making drugs, it fails. I was ready to start using them. I waited for something to happen and nothing ever really did. This movie is neither horror nor drama. It's just paranoia of meth users. This movie can win a prize for using the "F" word so many times and so useless. It wasn't well set out, but I felt they were doing Meth to replace Meth, they owed someone. Hector just got worse and more paranoid when the movie continued and the girl became more hopeless. The ending really made no sense. The movie had no meaning unless it just showed how annoying it is to get stuck in a house in the middle of nowhere with a meth-head. I trusted the other feedback when I decided to watch this movie, and the rating on this movie should be a much lower average.
