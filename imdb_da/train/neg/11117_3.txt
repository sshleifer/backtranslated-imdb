Spooks are pleasantly trash, with some orderly sequences, ridiculous plotter and dialogue, and some triple actors. Many have described this as a British version of "24" and one can see the similarities. <br /> <br /> The American version shares the weak silly plots, but the performance is so much slimmer, sexier and I suppose animals. <br /> <br /> Some people describe weak comedy as "mild comedy". <br /> <br /> This is gentle spy story hour, the exact opposite of something created by John Le Carre. <br /> <br /> Give me Smiley any day.
