This movie is the perfect illustration of how NOT to make a sci movie. The worst trend in sci-fi is to make your theme a horrible, sophomoric, pseudo-orwellian / Huxleyan / independent "vision" of "the human future." <br /> <br /> Science fiction filmmakers (and writers) as geeks, take themselves very seriously considering the high crap-to-good-stuff ratio of their genre. I think other genres with a high CTGSR (yes, I just made it, relax), like guys or action or even romantic comedy, seem to have a little better understanding that they don't change the world with some depth "message." <br /> <br /> Sci fi can certainly be successful at a serious level that many good filmmakers have proven. But there is a huge drawback to the whole concept, represented by "Robot Jox" with its low-rent "future" construction (lone good design element: the bizarre, smart billboard ads everywhere encourage women to have more babies) and its painfully strong handled "Iliad" parallels (He is mentioned for God's sake! I have not actually picked up this before I watched the movie as the tenth time, but I went to the public school so the filmmakers are not liberated.) <br /> Of course, if you are a crazy movie freak like me, this disadvantage has a big upside. I absolutely love movies like this because bad movies are quite often more fun and sometimes even more interesting than good ones. It's a bit of a Lester Bangs approach to movie viewing, I think. <br /> <br /> Note: The apartment in this movie (Gary Graham? Is it his name? I refuse to get started.) Is really not that bad. He does it. He's kind of cool, especially when he's full / hung over.
