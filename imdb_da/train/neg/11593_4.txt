I consider this movie as one of the worst in the nightmare series. It was so boring that I couldn't remember anything 20 minutes after the movie was over, it even kills me to write a review on it. Okay, # 4 was a joke, and Freddy was the joker. # 5 tried to return to the roots of the series. It was darker and more atmospheric than nightmare 4, which is a good thing, basically. They tried to shoot a horror movie instead of a comedy. Unfortunately, they forgot to add excitement and scare. Because of the Nightmare 5: The Dream Child is neither fun nor scary. What we actually get is a boring movie with the usual bad actors (perhaps with the exception of Lisa Wilcox). The plot (Freddy kills Lisa's friends using the dreams of Lisa's unborn child) has a good base, but it's just not enough for 90 minute movies. Sometimes the story becomes very confusing (maybe because there are none) and you can't stop by wondering what the filmmakers were aiming for. The play must have had more holes than Swiss cheese, and the film was therefore very cheesy though (let me say that I do not like cheese though, though I am from Switzerland). Not even the special effects were as good as, for example, in Part 4. <br /> <br /> Don't bother renting / buying this movie, if not for completeness, it's a mess. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (get used to it, # 6 is also a messy one ...)
