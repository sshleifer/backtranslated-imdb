Very bad plays and a very low story. Not even a decent B movie <br /> <br /> Events that were shocking as people who boarded a foreign ship were boring and very paralyzed. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst sci-fi I've ever seen. I saw the 5.0 stars and decided to see it when I liked the genre, but it sucked so badly. <br /> <br /> Now, there are really very few good movies on the ALIEN topic, I think because most of them are low budgets <br /> <br /> I give it 3/10
