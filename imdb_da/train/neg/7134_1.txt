So it's come to this. Fast, expensive cars that only the upper 1% will ever run. The girls lying next to them in gear headers. Second level and non-name actors. Cheap promotional impressions of people from niche culture. <br /> <br /> This is the waste that Hollywood has to offer. Don't make me wrong; I love the mindless action flick with hot chicks as much as the next guy. But please, the collective Brain trust, who greenlights these things please stop, count to ten, breathe, have a hearty "Woooooosaaaaaah", then you reel 20 years and remember what made movies enjoyable again? So actually make some movies like that again? <br /> <br /> I have nothing against poker but the whole pop culture explosion it has had over the past five years is ridiculous. Everyone and their mother believe their Maverick now (not half of them even get that referral). Some executive said, "Hey, what demographic will you leach $ 9.50 out of?" "I know, sir, the 18-35 market." "Okay, let's give them poker, girls and fast cars." "Brilliant idea, sir." The result? A movie I have seen a hundred times late at night on Spike TV, and more often than not with the lead role Dolph Lundgren. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong now, I'm not a movie snob. Over-the-top artsy flicks like The English Patient do not flow my boat, but generic movies that should not have been done right to DVD interfere with hell out of me too. Only young gear will get their engines revved by this, and I imagine them at the top end of their IQ range will see this for what it is: a junkyard.
