STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Ray (Ray Winstone) has a criminal past, Has had problems with alcohol and is now a drug addiction that makes him paranoid and prone to domestic violence for his wife Valerie (Kathy Burke) who is trying to keep the family together but ends up coming out as a doormat. Meanwhile, her mother Janet (Laila Morse) is aware of Ray's son, Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles) and his escalating drug addiction that sends him off the rails. The movie follows these despairable characters, which they did with their lives. It is said that the British seem to be miserable and it will include watching movies that entertain them this way. Movies like Nil by Mouth highlight this. It is a tale of a broken family torn apart by crime, poverty, booze and drugs, which Jeremy Kyle would cut up as a three-course meal. It is also essentially a tale of self-destructive men, three generations apart and each copying the other, tearing a family apart, and women trying to hold it together, even though they are not strong enough. If you get a bit of what it's about from the offset, you can see it doesn't promise to be cheerful from the start, and it certainly doesn't disappoint. <br /> <br /> That's what everyone said about the shows, and the main stars, Winstone and Burke, deliver some great actors. We see Winstone lose it with his wife and beat her sensibly after some more coke-induced paranoia, break down during a phone conversation with her, and release a typical arsenal of f and c words when she refuses to let him see his child. At the same time, we see Burke skillfully losing her praise on a staircase, the full effect of the night before throwing in. <br /> <br /> This is another of those movies where there is no 'plot' to follow, as such, just a real life feeling of these hopeless lives continues from one day to the next. It has been praised by many (including Baftas!), But it was just too bleak and gloomy for me. I have no right to criticize it for this by knowing what I knew about it from the offset, but unfortunately this is how I found it. **
