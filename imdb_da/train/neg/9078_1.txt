Wouldn't it be great, if not another teen movie actually puts an end to all those stupid, pointless, I get more sex than you are teens? In a perfect world, yes. But this one is even worse. This is not humiliating for the stars, it is humiliating for the distributor. All the jokes are mostly college students who expose things that people probably have no interest in seeing, but it's "fun". Devon Sawa, who was actually good at Final Destination, is just blunt in this movie. It makes you wonder if it is evil for purpose. Degree: F
