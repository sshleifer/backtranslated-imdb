Boris Karloff is Matthias Morteval, a dying, lonely old nut who lives in the Morhenge Mansion with some servants and tells his doctor friend: "Try not to heal me a doctor! I'm disgusting healthy!" He invites his nieces and nephews to his home and warns them that they may have inherited a genetic disease that causes madness by "shrinking the brain" (?) <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Morteval / Karloff ends up dying and murderous "toys" (the design of his dead brother) begin killing relatives. A mini-cannon burns real balls into a guys face, a lifestyle knight in armor attacks with an ax and a dancing Sheik staffs people with a knife. A guy gets spoiled doing some hilarious faces. In the end, Julissa and her boyfriend Karloff are still alive and hiding in the dungeon where steel gates seal the room. He plays the recurring organ music music (kind of agony used for the killings), the brother's spirit begins to speak ("the whole house will go with me!") And the manor goes into flames. <br /> <br /> This pointless mess is too dark, boring and the stupid dialogue never matches the lips.
