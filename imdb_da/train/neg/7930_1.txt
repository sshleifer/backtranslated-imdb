This piece of shit could have been praised 60 years ago, but it is one of the most racist films ever made with the Indians played by white men. The right-wing Republican James Stewart was a huge racist in real life like his close friend John Wayne. In 1971, Stewart actor Hal Williams fired from "The Jimmy Stewart Show" (a short-lived series that mercifully flopped) just because Williams was black. As if it wasn't bad enough, this movie is very dated and boring. See "Dances with Wolves" instead of a less racist view. <br /> <br /> Stewart was in the eighties when this horrible movie was made, and even with his ridiculous wig, he still looked like a pedophile chasing after 16 years â€” or Debra Paget. I'm surprised it was even allowed. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
