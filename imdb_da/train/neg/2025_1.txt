My wife and I are half entertained by Howie Mandel's show. I also like Shatner - even when he's most pathetic .. <br /> <br /> But this is definitely the worst show on TV. <br /> Please cancel this show. It sucks one **. The only positive thing I can say is that the girls are warmer on this show and seem to have less clothes than Deal or No Deal ... <br /> <br /> The questions are a mix of way too easy and incredibly unclear. And see Shatner or competitor say "Show me the money" makes me throw up. <br /> <br /> This won't last.
