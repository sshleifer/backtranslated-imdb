Dysfunctional family goes home for vacation and murder and chaos result. Vastly sexy Milligan in his most homemade. A little better than a home video (so much of Milligans movies are), it's a depravity 1960s style trip. Remarkable for the magnificent nudity and sex, this movie is neither sexy nor cruel and now plays more like picturesque. The film suffers from its uneven cast and from the fairness of the productions. (No one was ever sure where the money went on his movie since he was always broken). It's a bad bad movie that's not worth watching except as a Milligan complete or because it has some great people lurking around.
