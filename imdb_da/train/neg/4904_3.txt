Teamo Supremo are three children, consisting of their leader captain Crandall, Tau Girl and Skate Let, all with their own fighting game (buza! Chika! Woopa!) And outfit and movements. They work for the governor, Kevin, and were recruited after wishing to be heroes and play at that game. They also lead normal life and have family and school tasks, but most of the action takes place away from school games. The bad guys all have quite unique and unique features, such as. Mister Vague and his men, who never seem to know what their plans are, but still act. From an evil robot to an evil baron, the three must come across them and stop their evil and often strange, plans to get power, revenge, etc. <br /> <br /> The animation itself is pretty nice and smooth, but the style looks seems to be simple for that purpose. The backgrounds have overlapping colors and the buildings seem futuristic. The music is pretty nice, and the show is not too bad, although the style is not my favorite. The plots are almost always obscene and ridiculous, but it is a cartoon and you cannot blame them for it. But this would not be the same rank as Fillmore! or Pepper Ann.
