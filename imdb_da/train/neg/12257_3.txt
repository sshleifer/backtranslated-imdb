"It's not such a big mechanical toy," says a sign early and commenting on "Jaws". Well, "Blood Surf" would only want to have an animal as compelling as the shark in the "Jaws" series. In other words, the digital special effects of this movie are TERRIBLE. Action and management are also not much better; They seem more suitable for a deodorant or a bubble gum commercial than a horror movie. The attitude of the people working on this film shows contempt not only for the genre but also for the audience. Saying you "looked like" this movie only encourages filmmakers to offer us more of this crap, further destruction of the poor horror genre. (* 1/2)
