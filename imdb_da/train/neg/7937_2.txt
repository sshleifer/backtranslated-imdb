After 30 seconds you already realize that there was no real budget for this cheap ban. The story is taken from amazing movies like "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Hills have Eyes". I like those movies, even though they are doubly good (Wrong Turn, Timber Falls, Carver). <br /> <br /> But "Side Sho" is hard to see: the actors are really bad, the dialogue is cheesy and the music is stupid and completely misplaced. You don't care what happens to the characters. The so-called bad guys are also not interesting and rather stereotyped. So what about the blood and do? Well, there are some, even though it is pretty cheap and the action is very poor. 2 points, just for gore and blood, but understand that this is not worth anything, even for gorehounds ..
