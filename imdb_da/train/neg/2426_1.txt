Trust me, this is a lax movie you want to avoid and it comes from a great Denzel Washington fan. The frustrating part is that it is 1/3 of a large movie. The first part of this movie does an unusual job of setting up the characters and the new relationship between Creasy and the girl he is paid to protect. The trailers for this movie all mention that she has been kidnapped. So I give nothing away when I say that the film degenerates into an almost irreversible mess when she is kidnapped. Whatever the director tried to achieve, everything he does succeeds in making the audience literally nauseous. Fast, hectic and chopped pieces follow for the next half hour as Creasy tracks down the perpetrators. These cuts are so unnatural and nauseating that all they do is scare you out of the story. I am sure the director thought that this disturbing way of presenting the story drew a change in Creasas character and pointed out that another movie would follow. Well, he was right. The movie that followed was complete and unsatisfactory crap. The result of this is a depressing end that even destroys the quality first 40 minutes of the movie.
