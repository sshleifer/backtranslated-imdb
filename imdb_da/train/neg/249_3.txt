Saw this movie in my English class this afternoon and was surprised at how bad this version was. Don't make me wrong, George C. Scott was great as Scrooge, but the rest of the throw fails so badly. Sometimes I couldn't stop laughing at the stupid play and the repetitive line: "Merry Christmas to everyone!" Other times I almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> The movie is based on a Charles Dickens short story about a rich guy who doesn't think Christmas is anything but humbug. After 30 minutes, the rich guy is visited by three ghosts who persuade him to celebrate Christmas. I can't understand how this movie, with a script so bad, it must be written in five minutes, can be so well-qualified. Instead of this piece of waste I recommend you, Bill Murray Comedy Scrooged. At least it was fun ...
