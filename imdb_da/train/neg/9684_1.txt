Quiet, stagy, strange and opaque, if visually striking ... a wannabe-erotic fantasy. Really boring, too much male nudity (including father's son's incest), and just a kind of shameless meaninglessness. However, I will admit that certain passages of dialogue, taken on their own terms, have a lulling, haunting quality.
