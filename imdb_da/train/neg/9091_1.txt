Seriously, I've read some of the reviews on this movie and I have to ask where people are watching the same movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I give the nominees a lot of credit to be able to recreate the 1930s vintage Los Angeles, but then what? <br /> <br /> Neither character likes, the story seems futile, Karen Black is simply not a very good actress. Donald Sutherland is just icky. (and his character "Homer Simpson" makes me want the animated version. D'oh!) Then you had the creepy child actor, the scramble Billy Barty and so on. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movie cinema buffs love and the rest of us watch each other and go, "What dunk!"
