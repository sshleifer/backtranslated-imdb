The Treasure Island DVD must be required viewing in a film production course! It is a textbook example of how NOT to make a movie. When you watch the movie and then listen to the author's / director's comment, he graphically shows the huge gap between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates with the audience about them. Call me old-fashioned, but I'm thinking of movies as a means of communication, and communication is not complete if the audience doesn't know what the hell the director is talking about. The director's admonished purpose is to invalidate a movie by "Hollywood Conventions". Among these conventions, unfortunately, consistency of character and clarity of the concept. The director himself realizes that audiences often do not understand points where he intentionally avoided a "Hollywood clique". But he never seems to understand the idea that clich√©s exist for a reason. They are short to convey complex ideas quickly and clearly. It's nice to avoid them, but they need to be replaced with another way of communicating the same idea, not just eliminated. The film is built on an exciting performance, rich with potential. Two dolls are assigned to produce a personality and background for an unidentified body to be used in a disinformation mission at the end of 2. world War. Soon, each one begins to populate their personal fantasies with the character, and their invention becomes more and more real to them. A person with less contempt for the "Hollywood Convention" of traditional storytelling could create a wonderful movie with this idea. This movie is definitely not! The puppets do everything they can to bring consistency with these characters, but they are all too often defeated by the confused and confused script. Especially, I am increasingly impressed by Gonzo, who plays the lively corpse. In a number of muppet films, he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet.
