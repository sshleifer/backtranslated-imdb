This is the most saccharine romance I have ever put through. The perfect movie for an inactive housewife in the scarf, housedress and ostrich dressed high-heeled mules to look in the afternoon, lying on the couch eating bonbon. In fact, bullets play a prominent role in the film. <br /> <br /> The only reason I could look to the end is to finally look at Keanu Reeves dreamy face in almost every scene. In most of his films, he moves too fast to get a good look. The only quick action in this show is Giancarlo Giannini, waving his hands with Latin emotional - more Italian than Mexican. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is as stiff as wood. Unfortunately, no bodice is torn - the hero is shameful and perfect and gentle. The aristocratic warm-blooded old world club is as old as the hills. What does it mean if they are Irish or Italian or Mexican? This is an adventure. <br /> <br /> I knew before the titles ended that this would not be the movie I was hoping for. The glowing grapes resembled the front edge of all food ads in Women's Day Magazine. I couldn't see his name on the list, but the art director was surely Thomas Kinkade, who paints millions of dollars in Irish huts snuggled in fuchsias. This film was literally seen through rose-colored glasses. If you like dreamy pink and blue skies, this movie is for you! (Bonbons looked really good too!)
