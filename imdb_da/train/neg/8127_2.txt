Currently, this movie is on IMDb as the 42nd worst movie ever made - which is why I rented it from NetFlix. However, I am sorry to report that the movie, while poor, is not nearly as bad enough to deserve to be in the bottom 100 movies ever made list. I have personally seen at least 100 movies worse than this one. Almost a glowing endorsement, but it just didn't meet the expected level of horror that had to be included on this infamous list. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew on their delayed honeymoon (by the way, they are also married in real life). He is a doctor who is obsessed with bats and insists that they go to a nearby hole. When they are there, they behave very, very, very silly (characteristic of a bad movie) and are quickly bitten by a bat. According to this film, bats love to attack people, and there are vampire flags in the US - both are not at all right. <br /> <br /> Strangely, after being bitten, you don't even lose the hospital !! The first thing on everyone's mind (especially a doctor) is to get medical attention immediately, but not this breast. Soon he has seizures - but he is still not interested in seeking help! Again and again you think this must be the stupid couple in film history !! <br /> <br /> After a while he finally goes to see a doctor and is sent to the hospital. But then it is too late and his attacks become more violent and he starts killing people to suck their blood. When it is quite obvious to anyone that the man is a mad food, the wife (as her husband's grapefruit for a brain) has refused to believe he is dangerous - even after he attacks people, steals an ambulance and drives a police car from the road !! <br /> <br /> Now Moss goes through these episodes most, his eyes roll back and he looks like a normal person. It is strange, however, that he develops bat-like hands a few times and at the end they used some fine dentures to make him look completely bat-like. Had this been really cheesy, the movie would have earned a 1. <br /> <br /> In the end, in a twist that had almost no sense, the wife inexplicably turned into a crazy lady and had a swarm of bat kill the evil sheriff. How all this was arranged was a mystery that was Moss's and McAndrew's belief that this movie would somehow help their careers - even though they both had reasonably long career on television playing bitrolls since 1974. < <br /> Overall, very stupid. The reason is stupid and makes no sense and relies heavily on people appearing too stupid to be real. Not a good movie at all, but not among the worst movies all the time. <br /> <br /> NOTE: For some reason, the IMDb displays the graphics for the three DVD sets for IT'S ALIVE, and these are two successor pages of THE BAT PEOPLE website. While BAT PEOPLE has been seen with the title "It's Alive", the two movies are not at all related. It's easy to understand the bug - especially since they both came out in 1974, but the movie, I just starred starring Stewart Moss and Marianne McAndrew, and the second movie star John Ryan and Sharon Farrell.
