Drew Barrymore plays young Holly Gooding, who moves in with the aspiring hack writer Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern), completely disturbing her life claiming that her "doppelganger" or evil twin is out to kill her and her family. <br /> <br /> This stupid horror movie is a bit difficult to take seriously, though the filmmakers and actors themselves seem deadly. "Doppelganger" is confused, with some unpleasant silly dialogue. <br /> <br /> Some viewers will notice that Drew's character's name was drawn by Audrey Hepburn's role in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" and that the Newber's character's name is a game on the name of the famous author Patricia Highsmith (he is actually trying To rewrite "Breakfast" as a horror movie, believe it or not!). I assume it deserves some credit for not being your typical horror movie - I think author / director Avi Nesher seems to be really caring for his characters and gives his movie more plot than standard slasher fare. Following a stupid villain-explaining-everything-to-audience conflict, the film continues to file a fierce, out-of-the-box clash that must be seen as believed. This movie probably doesn't run out. <br /> <br /> Hey! Drew kills her mother in this one. No, I'm not funny. Jaid Barrymore turns out almost in the beginning to be severely slaughtered. <br /> <br /> Drew is always very attentive and very sexy in this. Newbern comes out as a sympathetic enough "nice" kind of guy. But the highlight of the film must be the scene with Sally Kellerman, an attractive veteran who is very professional in one scene as a former nun who has started a telephone art business (!!!!!!). <br /> <br /> The movie is largely unwanted, but rather entertaining on a blurry, sordid little level. <br /> <br /> 4/10
