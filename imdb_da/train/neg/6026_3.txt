* Review may include spoilers * <br /> <br /> predictable, campy, bad special effects. It has a TV movie feel to it. The idea that the UN is being taken over by Satan is an interesting twist to the end of the world, according to the Bible. The prerequisite is interesting, but its excuse falls by card. If you want to convert people to Christianity with a movie like this, at least make it a quality one! I seriously checked my watch while I was watching this piece of drink. can't say much else about this movie since i saw it over a year ago and there is not much to say about this movie beyond ..... skip it!
