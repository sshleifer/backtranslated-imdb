I grew up Baptist, and I know the story this movie is trying to tell, even though I no longer believe in the story. I will give movie kudos to be as good as the average lifetime movie of the week. Mildly interesting, mediocre acting, a little slow, the manuscript is predictable, the music is juicy, and it is a bit melodramatic. And all the people left behind have to be the creaking, clean, non-Christian, ever. Not a single curse word from any of them. But I laughed aloud when the actor played the man who drives the United Nations pronounced "atom" as "now-cues", like Bush. Is there any Christian code of honor that requires that since Bush claims he is also called by God, all Christians should cover their ignorance by misunderstanding this word in the same way as he does? LAUGH OUT LOUD! I really had a difficult time taking the movie seriously at all after that. After the "now-cue" event, the film began to feel packed, manipulative propaganda. I was looking for something brave. In fact, I was looking for something that could make me think, but I didn't find it here. If you're looking for thoughtless entertainment, stop here - it's a good thing to kill a rainy afternoon. But if you're looking for intelligence, look elsewhere.
