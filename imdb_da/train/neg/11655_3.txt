I was very disappointed with this movie. I thought "Scary Movie", though not a great movie, was very good and fun. "Scary Movie 2" on the other hand was boring, not fun, and sometimes simple stupid. <br /> <br /> The Exorcist / Amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie. James Woods was great. Now I admit that I am disadvantageous as I have not seen any of the films that this parody contrasts to the first one where I had pretty much seen them all. But bad comedy is still bad comedy. <br /> <br /> Something that really hurt this movie was the timing that destroyed some of what might have been good jokes. Scenes and jokes are far off. <br /> <br /> The same jokes are also repeated again and again. For example, the talking bird. Ok it was fun the first and maybe even the second time. But it continued to be repeated for the annoying. The routine between wheelchair and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was fun at first, but it continued to be repeated and ended stupid and even tasteless. <br /> <br /> Some jokes were even repeated from the first movie. For example, "creaming" I suppose you would call it Cindy (Anna Faris) was fun in "Scary Movie" because Cindy had been giving her boyfriend sex so long that it had essentially blue balls. from hell and it was fun when he 'creamed' her. But this time it was out of place and not fun. <br /> <br /> The bathroom and sexual humor were generally more entertaining and well-timed for the first time. Scat humor was exaggerated and not necessary in the other movie. Tori Spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie. <br /> <br /> But I enjoyed Shorty (Marlon Wayans) who, in my opinion, was the funniest character in the first movie. The scene with him and the pot was one of my favorites from the other movie. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong, I love Wayan's family and their humor. Therefore, this film is so disappointing. . . They have much more comical ability than endless scat jokes.
