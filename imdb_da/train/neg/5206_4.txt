Adapting player to movie theater is often a bad idea because they are two different media. Do you think it's a good idea to make ZULU a stage game? Imagine where two bold red coats sit in a tent that blocks "Blimey, thousands of them out there". Fantastic movie and a bad stage play. To get a stage play to make a big movie theater, there are two necessary things </ br>> 1) A fine casting that creates on screen chemistry <br /> <br /> 2) Great dialogue <br / > <br /> On paper Cher and Chazz Palminterri would be a good choice but not in those roles. The story is about a hitman played by Palminterri, and breaks into a house to kill a wife played by Cher, with most actions taking place inside the house. I couldn't take those two characters seriously, though it might have been the script's fault that can't tell if it's trying to be serious or fun. Since the story is very static, it is extremely important that the dialogue shines, and once again because of the bizarre tone of the manuscript, it scares more than anything else with much of the conversation that is about sex acts. if you want to see a good translation of a scene game that is transferred to the silver screen, you give TRUST a miss and see 12 ANGRY MEN instead
