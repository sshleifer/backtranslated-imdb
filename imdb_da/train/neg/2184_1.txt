This movie is a loose collection of incomprehensible analogies and ill-conceived plot units. <br /> <br /> Movie Story: The film director was a pervert who drove around the city filming random women. When his wife discovered the film rolls, he was forced to quickly draw a story. He claimed he made a movie called "The Brain That Wouldn't Die". Eventually, his wife demanded that he show her her so-called movie. That night he quickly filmed some extra scenes with a friend and "The Brain that would not Die" was born. <br /> <br /> I hate this movie! Plot Synopsis: The protagonist's fianc√© is killed in a terrible car accident (which he caused by ignoring the clearly posted road signs). He grabs her head from the wreck and resuscitates it. After resuscitating his head, he goes and fetches a bunch of hooks. That's pretty much what happens to the rest of the movie. In the end, he fights and is killed by a monster living in the closet. The monster appears with little or no explanation. However, the monster saves a hooker and I assume that they live happily ever after. <br /> <br /> Page Notes: The End Credit Screen claims that the movie is called "The Head That Would Not Die". <Br /> <br /> I hate this movie!
