Looked at Hulu (too many advertisements!) So it broke pacing, but even though it was like seeing a really bad buddy movie from the early 60s. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis where both are played by Jerry Lewis. If I were Indian, I would protest at the portrait of all men like venal and all women who shrews. They cheated on the music videos for western sales and used many Western models so that the men could touch them. I usually enjoy Indian movies a lot, but it was a big disappointment, especially for a modern Indian movie. The story does not take place in India (Uncle continues to refer to when Mac returns to India), but I can't figure out where to go.
