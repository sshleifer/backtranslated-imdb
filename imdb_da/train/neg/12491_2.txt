Hm. While an enjoyable movie to pick plot holes, point to thrilling plays, primitive (at best) special effects (all of which have made me watch this movie three times over the last six years), Severed reaches among the worst I've ever seen. I am never sure who the protagonists are, all I know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine, as seen in the dance floor murder scene. All in all, I don't really like the movie, because only the first 30 minutes are pleasant, the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialogue and imagery that doesn't go on to the story of a logical conclusion (which I can't remember anyway).
