It is rare that I come across a movie, this horrible, this annoying and annoying. It's undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The reason when it's not a blur of confusing and pointless over flashy editing is ridiculous. Why did Domino become such a bad ass hard bitch? Because her goldfish died when she was a child, and this "traumatic" event left her emotionally stunted and hated everyone. When the dialogue is not clich√©d or banal, it is filled with ridiculous lines such as: "There are three kinds of people in this world: the rich ... the poor ... and everyone else". At some point, the bounty hunters have some guys tied up in the back of their bus who has a combination number tattooed on their arm. Because of a confusing mobile phone call, instead of rolling up his sleeve and just reading the number, they blow off the arm with a shotgun. At another time, bounty hunters take a bomb at a meeting arranged with the mafia and threaten to put out the bomb unless the mafia lets them go!? Clearly not going to the meeting would have been just as easy. <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley is convincing and terribly dissatisfied. Mickey Rourke manages to save some credibility from this mess. I have enjoyed some of Tony Scott's earlier films, True Romance is one, but all I could think of while suffering from this drift was that it must have been made by a complete idiot.
