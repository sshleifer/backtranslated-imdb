Misled by the horrible lie on the front, "fun as American Pie", my boyfriend and I sat in front of the TV waiting for a comedy ... and that's certainly not one. You will not laugh once if you are not one of the Jackass-like ever-teeny minds. It's not even an erotic movie that would at least be something because it's about sex ... So what is this? The erratic plot deals with a guy who wants to lose virginity (zero in originality, I remember "losing it" for one) and his gang of friends. The rest of the characters (ie the girls) just come and go without credible reason. Come on, there are even dwarfs (so simple: "dwarfs are fun ho ho" ...) The play is very TV-like (as is the video in the whole movie) and absolutely amateur in most of the girls' cases ... < br /> <br /> Terrible movie. Amateur, poorly produced, and above all not FUNNY. Kids and teenagers will love to see it with friends because of the severe and sex jokes. Other than that, don't even think about renting this movie.
