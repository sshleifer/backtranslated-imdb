This was by far the worst low budget horror movie I've ever seen. I am an open minded guy and I always love a good horror movie. In fact, when renting movies, I specifically look for some good underrated horror movies. They are always good at laughing, I think I have seen many. But this movie was just so awful that it wasn't worth a chuckle. I was considering turning it off for the first five minutes ... which I probably should have. There's nothing good about it, first of all, the camera crew suck3d A $$. The intro was stupid, just like the end. Effective and special effects were terrible. Please I beg you, DO NOT see this movie, you will absolutely hate it.
