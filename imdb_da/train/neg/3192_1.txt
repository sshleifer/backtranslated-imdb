What reviewers and MST3K are out of the best part (and only memorable scene) of this otherwise horrible movie: There is a very good rape situation committed by the bad guy (Ben Gazzara look-like) on Maria as mentioned, later killed through TJ's urgency ). Perhaps rape is a strong word, "jail ritual" may be more appropriate. The background behind this chance, but forced meeting is the mobster who hides "Ben Gazzara", introduces him to the girls hanging by his pool. The 30-ish blonde is theirs, but our villain must be quite beaten by her, because the proposal is at that time. His first step is to try to drown her until his mafia don blesses telling him to turn it off. Like the girl in high school, you didn't like, but would still have carnal knowledge of anyway ... Let's just say he catches up with her in the cabana later.
