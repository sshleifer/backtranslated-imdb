Forgive me to say the obvious, but some movies are good and some movies are bad. There are, of course, extremities within the two broad categories. Movies like The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan and Star Wars Castle comfortably enter the good category. At the other end of the spectrum are the films that simply do not deserve to be mentioned by name. Occasionally, someone produces a really miserable movie. A movie to be designated as a demonstration of how horrible a movie can be. A movie that is more than bad. One such film is the Maiden Voyage. In short, the Maiden Voyage is a story of a luxury cruise ship hijacked by a gang of evil criminals who demand a ransom from an equally evil ship owner. Of course, there are quite a few American heroes on board, complete with ejected jaw and sculpted breasts that save the day. <br /> <br /> This is a production that plumbers new depths. Everything knows it's bad. The action, the direction and the so-called plot are breathing poor. In short, it is an insult to any unhappy viewer's intelligence. Even an American viewer would be annoyed by his shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> I will resist the temptation to compose a list of things that attacked me about this movie. But the stupid than stupid conclusion should serve as an appropriate example of what I mean. <br /> <br /> Imagine you are a vicious hijacker and you are in an open lifeboat on a calm sea. You are in the company of the hero who has a ticking bomb. Said completely throws the bomb to you and diver overboard. What would you do? I don't know about you, but I would throw the bomb as far as I could get into the ocean. Not this guy. He looks at when our hero swims away, and then he tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate results (for him). Enough said. Such a transition would tell the mention on the Darwin Awards website and may also be an appropriate appropriate conclusion to the production team life.
