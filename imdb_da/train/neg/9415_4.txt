Heavily edited and often confusing. The original screen version of Man On Fire was out of date at least ten years old when it was made, and the last few years have not done better. This is the kind of movie that producers with too much money and too little experience do to get attention, and everyone else just does to pay their outstanding aliment or drug dealer. Scott Glenn's bodyguard embarks on a limb to save his 12-year-old charge, the kidnapped daughter of a wealthy Italian family. An interesting cast - Joe Pesci, Brooke Adams, Danny Aiello, Jonathan Pryce - has done better, the action is sluggish and sparse, and only John Scott's exceptionally fine score (some of which have come up in Die Hard's last wheel) makes a positive impression. A case where remake (made by Tony Scott, the original choice of director for this version) is an improvement.
