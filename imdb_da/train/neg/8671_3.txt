I saw this movie on March 21 this year. But say disappointment. But much better than "Tridev". Plot is hackneyed. The movie opens when he saves a bride. Anyway.Azghar Jhurhad makes a plot to kill his young brother. He makes a plan by sending some people. They come to a school pretending to be Prabhat's friends. Cool that child. His father throws him out of the house. Then it comes later He and Aakash go to Kenya to find him. The child who played Sunny's brother in the movie was sweet. Sadly, he had to get his character killed. The girl was sweet but was annoying. The other child did well. It did well. Kiran was appropriate. Mrish and Gulshan did well. Cinematography is excellent in both India and Kenya.Script is weak but has a few good dialogues. Also pulls. The movie. The music was okay. I only liked a song "Saat Samundar", the lyrics of that song were good. The other songs were forgettable. Don't look here. The Rating 3/10
