I admit that I don't expect much from a Roger Corman movie. In general, I expect a lot of walking and bad scripts. But in this case I am pleasantly surprised. The Gunslinger is a story of a woman (played by the spunky Beverly Garland) taking over as a sheriff after her husband is brutally murdered. Mrs. Garland is a pretty good shot herself and kills one of the murderers the next day at her husband's funeral. Her first task is to close the local bar that breaks the city's curfew. The bar owner tries to buy land in anticipation of being bought by the (hopeful) railway. But Mrs Garland is a thorn in her plans, and the bar pattern hires a man to kill Mrs Garland. Due to Mrs Garlands playing her role honestly and realistically, there is absolutely no temptation to go to Suzanne Somers "She's the Sheriff" jokes. With the exception of a pair of faux pas (the apartment door that opens out from inside, jeep tracks and the two riders waiting on the screen for their queue to drive around a corner), the movie becomes quite passable as a movie ticket price. However, Corman could not withstand the cushioning of his movie with horse scenes, just as he does in other films. <br /> <br /> Sterno says The Gunslinger is a horse opera worth your time.
