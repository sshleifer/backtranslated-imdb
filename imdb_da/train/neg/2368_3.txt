Okay, it's stupid, they say they don't make another nightmare movie that this is the "last" ... And what do they do? They continue to make another, not the next (part7) was bad, but why do they play us. Nevertheless, this movie made no sense what it was, so it was extremely boring, the characters were very one-dimensional, Freddy was another joker who is very stupid for such a good series. The reason is very, very bad, and it's just worse than parts 2 and 5. I didn't get the movie, it's a stupid tale in 3-d, meaningless! Id says. I hated this movie so much that I still have all the parts I didn't like that were pretty much the whole movie. This is so different from prequels, it tries and tries, but this one tried the hardest and was hit back on the face .Again there hadly been some death scenes, though they were different, they sucked bigtime. How have they gone so far? Have they not seen the biggest mistakes in parts 2 and 5? But they do this? It's all for money, DO NOT SEE THIS SAD EXCUSE FOR A NIGHTMARE SERIES. <br /> <br /> I gave a nightlife at ELM STREET six (6) 3 out of 10. GOOD POINTS OF MOVIE: Had potential with plot. <br /> <br /> BOTH POINTS OF MOVIE: Awful action / lack of death / for fun to be classified as horror / very confusing.
