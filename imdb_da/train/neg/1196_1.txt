How can a movie with Amy, Posey and Raechel not have any fun in it? Believe it or not 'House Bunny' made it better and more fun. Hopefully the managers had a good holiday and got some money - this movie is an embarrassment to all of them. It's a cliché from the beginning to the end. Clichés can work well with a script, or at least an idea. This movie does nothing but uses cliché by cliché rather than ideas or script. It uses the actresses' formerly existing persona rather than developing characters. Bad, sad and rubbish. Now I seem to have ten lines of text for a comment. Really? Why? As an IT ops manager, this is another example of sloppy coding.
