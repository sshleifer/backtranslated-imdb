We expected something good when we went to see this bomb. It's basically a Broadway game set on film. The music is simply horrible. There's not a memorable song in the movie - have you heard any hits from this movie? You don't want to because there's no one. Some of the songs go so long that I got up to the toilet and got some popcorn and it still went when I came back! If they were good songs good - but they suck. The pace is slow, terrible character development. The management was praised for her song, but sounded like she was screaming every song - it was almost impossible to stand. This movie has nothing to offer to all but deadly Broadway enthusiasts. This is undoubtedly the most popular movie I've seen in my life. A complete waist of time and money. There is nothing memorable about this movie except Danny Glover - which was not enough on the screen and whose character was not sufficiently developed. Rent the video and you agree - this movie was an animal, over produced, polished dog does.
