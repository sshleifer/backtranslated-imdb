<br /> <br /> This movie (not a movie - clearly recorded on a cheap cam-corder) can be one of the greatest movie stink bombs in history. Beware: the packaging advertises flick as an erotic exploration of sex abuse. The film is not an exploration of anything, and it is no more erotic than staring at its own warts. The scripture is meaningless and meandering, with all the plural elements serving as segways between supposed sex scenes. But even the sex scenes are lame lame lame. Except for the former, they are about three seconds long (then again, maybe my version was cut) and comically overshadowed. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a decent movie, you won't have it here. If you're looking for a titling sex-girl, you won't have it here. Whatever your life's goals, desires or perspectives, you will not see this movie. How they got Rosanna Arquette, Natashia Kinski, and Ed Began to act in this stink bomb is riddle in the extreme.
