I bought this DVD set, sight invisible, and wish I didn't have it. Scripture needed some serious rewriting, as it seems to be completely devoid of any sense and pale to the book. The lighting is awful, very unpolished, but if it was just that I could overlook it. The script does not focus enough on the characters ... there is hardly an introduction to various characters that make it a little difficult to distinguish who is who (especially in the planes - no idea who is dying when). <br /> I have long felt that the key to a good movie is getting the audience to worry about the characters; If you don't, you have nothing. There was no focus at all on the characters - you never got to know them - who they were, what they liked. What made them do the things they do. The series is 5 hours long and divided into 6 parts ... I bet you wonder what they did with this whole time if they didn't detail the characters --- they put a lot of stuff in it .... I want to say that at least an entire hour is spent watching them land and leaving in their flight LOL (I really think we have to see it over and over again ???). I would have given this a much higher rating if they had just improved our knowledge of the characters.
