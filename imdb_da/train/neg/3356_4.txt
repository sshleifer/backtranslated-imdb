The Shirley Jackson short story 'The Haunting of Hill House' is an atmospheric tale of terror that transmits supernatural phenomena in an ancient mansion. The atmosphere is well set out, and the chills are well staged. A thrilling masterpiece. 1963 Chiller 'The Haunting' remains close to the book, but also adds its own details to the plot. Fortunately, these are very few, and then frightened terror and chills are even better on the screen. The black and white photography only adds to the movie's fragility. Excellent! <br /> <br /> And then Jan de Bont made this. In 1999, the resumption of The Haunting hit the cinemas - if you could call this a remake. Why they should remake the 1963 movie is a mystery in itself, but at the moment we are watching the film itself. It starts regularly, as most horror movies do. The set used for Hill House is beautiful and oddly mysterious, and in a few minutes it seems that the movie will actually be quite fair again. And then comes the first scare: A loose harpoon thread cuts a woman's face (Dr. Marrow's assistant). This is fun, and the truth is told, it almost had me in tears. <br /> <br /> From then on, the film just spirals down. The play seems to be some wood as the film continues, with Owen Wilson's character being particularly annoying (so it's such a relief when he is beheaded by the smoke). <br /> <br /> The special effects make this movie virtually, which is a shame because most of them are incredible cheeses and look very dated. Examples of these are many, so I won't bother them. <br /> <br /> So, along with hundreds of others, I recommend that you see the original cooler or, as an alternative, buy the short story of Shirley Jackson. But please, stay away from this. And if you decide to watch this, watch it on the TV (as many channels love to screen this movie and not the original) or rent it cheaply, but please buy it no matter what you do. Don't waste your money! <br /> <br /> Final rating: 4/10
