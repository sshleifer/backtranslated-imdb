Phantasm .... Class. Phantasm II ..... awesome. Phantasm III ..... erm ..... terrible. <br /> <br /> Although I would love to quit this movie, I simply can't. The movie seems to be "sold out". First bad characters come when the video has trailers for other movies at first (something the others did not). Also for many meaningless characters, the examples the child (who is a crack shot, funny at first, but soon you will have him dead), the woman who uses karate to fight from the balls (the sleeve should not work or rather should not) and the blooming zombies (what the hell are they doing there, there is no connection to them in the other phatasms). There is also a serious shortage of midgets on a continuous basis. <br /> <br /> The only good bits are the cracking start and of course Reggie B. <br /> <br /> (Possible SPOILER comes up) << br /> <br /> For me, this movie works like a filler between II and IV, as extra characters just leave at the end so that it can continue with head 4 in IV. Overall very, very disappointing. 3.10
