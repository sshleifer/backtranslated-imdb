(First of all excuse my bad English) Of course, only a movie with Jessica Simpson can contain serious goofs like this. I am Norwegian, and I felt offended and shocked that the filmmakers in this movie did not take the time to do their research on making this American / "Norwegian" film. Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country. <br /> <br /> So I make my corrections out of my frustration: - the country is called norway, not norway - "da" is russian, not norwegian. - Norwegian priests never use the black cape with the white paper in the neck, as the Protestant church is far dominant. It's true we have a traditional folk music (which we only use twice a year), but the clothes in this movie are more like a German outfit. - I couldn't understand the so-called "Norwegian" in this movie. Jessica had no meaning .. neighter did the "Norwegian priests" <br /> <br /> The only thing I recognize is the Norwegian flag (and the Viking hat, but it is so stereotypical, what people think of norway - vikings!) Oh. <br /> <br /> Well, I think the people who made this movie will never read this comment. but at least I clean up some things and relax some of the frustration ..! I am proud of my country and I would love if people in the United States were less stereotyped and more precise when talking about this country. <br /> <br /> It was all .. Long live Norway! ; p
