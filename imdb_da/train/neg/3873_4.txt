Alicia Silverstone (pre-"Clueless") plays a modern crime-obsessed teenager who tries to solve the brutal killing of a local girl. Pat Verducci wrote and directed this B-flick, which is not very well-made, but is surprisingly serious about its leading character. Silverstone is appealing and successful in carving out an interesting young woman here, despite the kitschy undermining of the image. The support model (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) is not bad, although the violence in the last action goes overboard. Not a cheesy camp party, but nothing exceptionally memorable either. * 1/2 from ****
