The golden age of Disney cartoons was dying in the late 90s. This show Quack Pack should not even be considered a DuckTales spin off, because the show hardly had anything to do with DuckTales. It's about a teenage age Huey, Dewey, and Louie as they make trouble for their Uncle Donald and speak in hip-hop lingo and they are fully dressed unlike DuckTales. I prefer the small adventurous nephews from DuckTales. There are people in Duckburg and the ducks are the only animals living in Duckburg. There are no references to Scrooge McDuck. The stories are repetitive, the plot is boring, but the animation is good. If you want lots of slapstick humor, I recommend it to you. If you want a better Disney show see "Darkwing Duck" or "DuckTales".
