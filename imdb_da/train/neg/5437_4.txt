The Mysteries of Pittsburgh are based on the short story by Michael Chabon about the young son of a notorious gangster who spends his last teenage summer roaming around with two friends. The year is 1983, and the young Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) is at a crossroads. Unlike his father's lifestyle, Art plans to become a stockbroker. Visually faced with painful attempts to create beautiful hip indie filmography, the whole movie feels like the director - whose earlier efforts Dodgeball was fun if it is directly commercial - desperately seeks indie credibility by cobbling together aspects of other indie films, but sprinkling it with stars like Mena Suvari, Sienna Miller and Nick Nolte. Like so many of the starred premier sites in Sundance this year, it felt like a secret studio-sponsored vanity project to help the director earn some indie credentials - it failed in that respect and as a movie in itself.
