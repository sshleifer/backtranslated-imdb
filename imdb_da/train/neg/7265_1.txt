So right here at the Chicago Film Festival - avoid it at all costs unless you have sleep problems. It's a movie filled with pretensions - it opens with a minor quote from "Hiroshima mon amour", and it's all downhill from there. Camera Work - Imagine a child trying to imitate Wong Kar Wai. History line - Smokey Robinson and the Miracles "Love I saw in You was just a Mirage" extended from 3 minutes to over 2 hours, but filled with repetition. For offensive emotional pain, this film is with benches in the Methodist Church that my parent struck me when I was a child. I will have 2+ hours in my life refunded. Julian Hernandez's promoter prefaced the view with a comment that the film was "controversial" - only the film's narcotic effect.
