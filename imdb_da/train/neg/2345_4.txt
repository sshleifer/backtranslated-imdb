I looked at Posted on The Wind with Rock Hudson, Lauren Becall, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone- Robert Stack was horrible - just bloody awful - he was supposed to be a charming jet-setting millionaire - instead he came out as a jerk from the word go The plot was stupid and exceeded and the 3 "romantic" leaders had no chemistry. Somehow, Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for the best entertaining actress - though her campy tramp character was boring - think of Splendor's older sister in The Grass filled with evil and bitterness and lacking charisma. Director Douglas Sirk has all over cast their way through dialogue that felt compelled, and the end result was a waste of 99 minutes. Had a cameo by the actor who played the boss at Get Smart
