Not even Bob Hope, escorted by a lot of fine character actors, can save this poorly written attempt at war-time comedies, as his patented timing has suffered, which one has to work. The reason involves a Hollywood movie star named Don Bolton (Hope) and his attempt to evade military service at the beginning of World War II, followed by his event by mistake in a confused attempt to judge a colonel's daughter ( Dorothy Lamour). Bolton's agent, played by Lynne Overman, and his assistant, depicted by Eddie Bracken, engages with him, and the three are involved in various escapades of training exercises recorded in Malibu, California, Hills. The Paramount budget is best for this effort, employing some of its top specialists, but the direction of the normally reliable David Butler was lax, and this is due to a lack of comedic element in the scenario. A shift towards the end of the movie to create a chance for the hero of Bolton is still born with poor stunting and camera action in evidence. It is strange that Lynne Overman gets the best lines, and this veteran master of snow works very well by them. Dorothy Lamour looks nice and also looks nice, and it is always a pleasure to see and hear Clarence Kolb as her father whose voice is unique on the screen or the radio, but there is little they can do to save this movie, damned as It is with a script error.
