"Little Man", now on DVD, is a Wayans Brothers flop. It's the story of a less than a midget criminal played by Marlon Wayans, who hides a diamond in a woman's bag after a hoist. He and his partner Tracy Morgan discover the genius plan to pamper Marlon as a baby and plant him in the lady's home. He then goes through all kinds of "Home Alone" or "Child's Play" as chaos to get the jewel back and be treated like a baby. I was surprised at how low the humor was in this movie. The jokes have been done elsewhere so many times that they are not cute or funny. I almost think the movie could have been more fun if they didn't use CGI and used the little actor Marlon's face was pasted over. By watching the deleted scenes (minus CGI), this actor was fun in a Mini-like manner, but they chose another route. A few cameos and Tracy Morgan make some fun scenes. Put your rental price $ on Borat if you want some real laughs these days. <br /> <br /> http://mcmusicnotes.blogspot.com
