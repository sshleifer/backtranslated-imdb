This is definitely the worst bigfoot movie I've ever seen, and possibly the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The actors and actors were horrible, and it seemed that they were trying too hard to play their roles like dorks, hard guys, jerks, know it all, etc. And the bigfoot itself was horrible. It seemed to be a kind of computer generated image from Atari & Intellivision. At some point near the end of the movie as an army of sasquatches chasing after the remaining survivors, one gets shot and when it runs it looked like a poor man's version of donkey king himself! And one is hit by a ball, and the blood coming out of it was just awful animation. Another thing that was annoying was the music. Way too much music (classic score or whatever you call it) throughout the movie. It never ended. Oh yes, the movie is also boring. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I highly recommend taking your $ 3 or whatever they charge to rent this movie and use it on a gallon of gas or a value menu somewhere. LOVELY AWFUL!
