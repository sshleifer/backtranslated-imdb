Run ... don't go away from this movie !!!!! The purpose of the very young children, this movie will drill you to tears. If the Gamera trilogy from the 90s raised the bar, this movie just lowered it. It is slow and the monster games are good, but rarely seen. This movie made me dry in the cat box. Just a very poor offer for a phenomenal 90 series. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT !!!!!!!!!!! Here are the top 10 reasons. Gamera fans from the 90 series will HATE this movie. <br /> <br /> 10. This movie is a drama that follows a child who tries to cope with his mother's death and fears losing baby Gamera for a fight after knowing that his father saw the adult Gamera die . <br /> <br /> 9. You see the adult Gamera for maybe a moment at the start of the movie. He gets his ass kicked by a couple of Gyaos and self destructs ??? He looks old and blunt. Plus he looks nothing like any camera you've ever seen. His dress looked cheap and hurried. <br /> <br /> 8. The young Gamera you see through the rest of the movie looks like a Pokemon. Big eyes and sweet ... it will remind you of baby Godzilla from Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2. Gamera is now too sweet. <br /> <br /> 7. This movie has the pace of watching a NASCAR race during a 3 hour rain delay. I watched this movie with 2 other Gamera fans and no one was happy with how slow this movie moved together. I've seen an SUV full of cool people going up a mountain road, moving faster. <br /> <br /> 6. Like Godzilla: Final Wars, this movie had very little kaiju time on the screen. Final Wars had much more, actually and better matches, even though they were short. <br /> <br /> 5. Children take the title role. Friend of all children theme and bad writing killed the original Gamera series in the 1970s and history repeats itself in the 2000s. The most successful Gamera movies gave up the Sesam Street feeling and went to a darker place. Why go back to a failed formula? This should be a new trilogy and poor ticket sales killed any hope for this story to continue (god). <br /> <br /> 4. Gamera lost its iconic roar. He now sounds like an elephant with a strep neck. <br /> <br /> 3. This movie can produce a new Olympic event ..... Imagine a relay race that involves hurting very young children. You need to see the end to understand this point. Where were the parents? Oh yeah ... right there sending their kids to a kaiju battle zone. <br /> <br /> 2. The special effects were good but sub-par for a Gamera movie. Legion and Iris had better effects. The best effect was to show the apple-shaped baby Gamera aircraft. Not too impressive. <br /> <br /> 1. This movie is just not what adult kaiju fans are expecting. The director was involved in the Power Rangers, and it shows. It comes out as a cross between ET, always: Sunset on Third Street and TMNT. Kudos if you know all 3 references. Rent at best or see once if you buy it to complete the DVD series.
