The wonderful "Z" Channel in Los Angeles showed this Pia Zadora movie about six months after "Butterfly". I had such great hopes for the actor, and then she goes from bad to of course WORSE in this movie. Again it was the 80s and I must tell you Harold Robbin's work had been obscured by smarter writers. Jacqueline Susann ripped into him (she hated her way of writing women), Irwin Shaw's work was hit by many women, and of course Sidney Sheldon had her kingdom in the late 70's in the early 80s And then came Jackie Collins, who made women stronger and equal to men in every way in his books, even more. Therefore, this work melts. Harold Robbin's work in the 80s just didn't start the audience. Pia Zadora, who appeared in one of Robbin's work, was like throwing kerosene on a fire. The support molding was also not a help. <br /> <br /> Oooooh ... it was terrible to look at it and even 20 years later it looks even worse. I was hoping for Pia as an actress and it was all shot when it was done. It would be difficult for Pia to redeem herself as an actress (although John Waters throws her in "Hairspray" was a spark), even though she has a good singing voice. <br /> <br /> Hey, Pia, wherever you are. ..Hairspray can go for a walk! Join the show. You may be the biggest comeback story yet. <br /> <br /> I just hope they burn this movie to you if you do.
