I watched this movie a year ago in a group tradition of Fast Forward Film Festivals, where we would set out to rent a bunch of B movies and vote for who chose the worst. <br /> <br /> The night we saw this, it was voted best because of the sudden and fun costume. <br /> <br /> This is definitely a silly, kitschy movie that has to be seen under the full understanding that you see low budget fluff. Personally, however, I do not recommend additional drugs ... this film will leave its own mark on you. <br /> <br /> It made enough of an impression on me that I have actually tried to get my hands on a copy for some years. <br /> <br /> A good choice if you are looking to see bad movies. This is fun and I can remember jumping music ...
