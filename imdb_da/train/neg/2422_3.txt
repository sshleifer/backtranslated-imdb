This movie really does not promote the kids to be nicer and have better attitudes that a family movie should, and this would not be considered family anyway because it has some things in it that children should not see. Not the best ABC family movie if you ask me. If there were less sexual themes in the movie, it might be better. Hollywood does nothing to make a movie better by adding in sexual situations. There really is no reason for them. At least it's a TV movie. I would not waste my money on this waste by renting it. If you have other things to do than watch this movie, continue with them.
