This (extremely) low budget movie is compared to the great classic "Silent Night Deadly Night" as it is labeled as a Slasher Girl. Let me first say that even "Silent Night Part 2" is better than this (one was full of flashbacks of the original for more than half of the movie). "Christmas Evil" tries to become psychological by introducing the protagonist as a person who goes insane (a strong word), slowly (very slowly). He is annoyed by people who do not get the true meaning of Christmas, and in the workplace he cannot stand how the manufactured toys are made with such lack of quality and love. Dressed up as Santa Claus, he finally goes on a killing Also a strong word, as only 3 people are killed without the real need for special effects. No voltage, no voltage, no doing, no throw. For one exception, it is: Jeffrey DeMunn is in it. He is best known for playing aside Tom Hanks as one of the guards in the classic "The Green Mile". He still has to kick himself these days to always accept the role. He really is the only one who can really act, his supportive role is better than the main management. (which is also not so bad, but if you are overshadowed by a small supporting sign, you are not great either.). And what about the strange ending? (You have to see it, to believe it). "Christmas Evil" is just as boring, nothing happens and the artwork is just misleading. This is not a slasher. You want to see a real cutter, check out the biggest time: "Silent Night, Deadly Night".
