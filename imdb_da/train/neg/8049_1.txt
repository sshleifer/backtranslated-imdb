A warning to you not to be seduced by the names Bigelow and Red. _Undertow_ is meaningless and unengaging, and often made me think of a phrase by Twain to wish that all the characters would be drowned together. When someone brings up the category of worst movie ever made, it is nothing like _Plan 9_ or _Attack of Killer Shrews_ that I am thinking of; It's like this. What a complete waste of time - my own and everyone involved in this flick.
