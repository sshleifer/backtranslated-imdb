I wrote a review of this movie further down after buying it on DVD and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> After reading a few of the comments made since then, I tried to see it again. Being a film student and making similar budgeted movies myself (ie no budget, shot at digi cam), I stand by my original comments. This is a budget project that is not budget (and not very good), published on video / DVD to look like an award winning film (if you read the cover). Then the public deceives you into thinking that this is something, it is not. I want my money back under the trades description act! Complete Rubbish!
