From the very first moment, this "thing" is just a horrible sequence of extremely short cuts in blurry camera work. While the overall plot has all the options for a thriller, the story tells so much that I can't buy it. From the middle of the film, character acts do not make me sense. Stop reading now to avoid SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> Ed's idea of ​​getting Edna to make coffee for them after shooting her son's arm is far below his alleged experience; It's just a very stupid idea. Domino, who does not question the fragmentary orders she receives from Claremont Williams over a broken telephone connection, just excludes me; Shouldn't she be long suspicious of Williams turning them in? These FBI agents seem to be out of their mind and appear with just one helicopter for something they have every reason to consider a capital mafia shoot-out. Moreover, what they do by detaining and leaking information against Cigliutti is quite a lot of incentive to murder; It seems to me goodbye to justice, if that is how the FBI conducts investigations. In fact, they would have a case messed up beyond repair if they acted like this. We'll see a car accident that would normally have been seriously damaged if they didn't kill most passengers, but miraculously left them all with just a few bruises. On the contrary, the accident immediately follows Domino, who loves Choco, who from Domino's point of view is in no way founded by past events, but merely by being pushed to the eyeballs. <br /> <br /> The whole sequence of scenes From the beginning of the phone call from Claremont Williams, it seems to me as willing to be dramatic razzle glare. This combined with the horrible, unpleasant camera work just makes a piece I hesitate to call a movie. I am sorry about the wasted efforts of the main players whose talent is undoubtedly.
