Not as bad as it is credited to be (Hooper is made far worse) ?? more disappointing to me. Such an imaginative concept that never really gets carpeted in by Hooper with his financial direction and even less so in the smoky (excuse the pun). It goes so scary and over-top in a dead, serious tone, becomes ridiculous and unfocused, so the whole pessimistic mystery / conspiracy story is easily telegraphed to end up quite abruptly. Because of that, pacing continues to be rather sluggish, and Brad Dourif (cold to see him in a leading role) seems to struggle with an unbalanced performance despite the fact that he etches a bemusedly quirky intensity to his off-color character . Although it is cheaply made, there is a competent technical attitude to it. But it does not seem to go anywhere outside with its idea and wants to plaster in unpleasant jolts (like some do work) and conspicuous steaming special effects (flames, flames everywhere) instead. Hooper displays some stylish frenetic images (more towards the latter), and the camera work is quickly maneuvered, and the brilliant score is titular. The performances are all over the store with the advent of William Prince, Cynthia Bain, Dey Young, Jon Cypher and Melinda Dillon. Also Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis have small but funny cameos ?? especially Landis. Nothing surprises, but it is passively engaging.
