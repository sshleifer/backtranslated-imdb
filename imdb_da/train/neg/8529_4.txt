Which boob on the MGM did it think would be a good idea to place the magnificent Clark Gable in the role of a Salvation Worker? Ironically, another beautiful prominent star, Cary Grant, also played a salvation army guy just two years later in the heavily overrated SHE DONE HIM WRONG. In my opinion, it is pretty easy to see the foolishness of these roles, but I still wonder who believed Salvation Army guys are "HOT" and who could look at these dashing men and see them as realistic representations of the parts they played. Long ago, I used to work for a sister organization of the Salvation Army (the volunteers in America) and I NEVER saw any studly guys working there (and unfortunately that includes me). Maybe I should have got a job with Salvation Army instead! <br /> <br /> So for the very curious, it's a good movie to watch out for, but for everyone else, bad writing, sloppy dialogue and annoying moralization make for a very slow movie.
