One would think that a movie about a young person would be expressed with his germinating homosexuality would be anything but boring. Think again. This production should be bottled and sold as a cure for insomnia because it is about ten times as powerful as any sleep aid on the market. It is almost as if the film producer was considering making a movie, but became lazy and decided instead to run a series of random (and randomly boring) pictures and go-anywhere scenes, throwing into a few actual scenes of actual acting, pretending Good lighting is important in the film making process, and wraps it under an arthouse film. This is just the kind of crappy product that makes it easy for many traditional filmmakers to poo the indie movie movement, and which keeps the public easier to embrace indie films. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in movies covering this topic, you would much better match some of the great short films available on Logo's website or rent Get Real. Better yet, read Stone Butch Blues. Whatever you do, skip this long-lasting drunk.
