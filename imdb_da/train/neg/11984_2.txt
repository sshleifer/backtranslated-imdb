Ugh! Another of the "fool of the front" DVDs. I had expected some kind of action at least with bears, cats and so on the cover. I have nothing! Bad movies !. <br /> <br /> I forced myself to see it all the way through thinking that it would eventually happen ... not luck. <br /> <br /> The reason why I gave this a 2 is because of the landscape; otherwise it sucked. <br /> <br /> The child was terrible and spoke to himself (although I suppose they could not just run a movie with stupid music and no dialogue at all), making his lame karate for a tree stump, threatening a raccoon , munching on worms, and (what a dumbass) kicks a porcupine. And he wouldn't pull them quill out so easily either ... they stick like fishing hooks. At least he struggled carried (weakly) a couple of times. <br /> <br /> What happened to the flashback case? It made a bad movie even worse. I wanted to see a survival movie, not some dramatic b's about a child suffering from divorce. What more can I say? Well, maybe they should have had the bear eating the baby or something. At least it would have been more exciting. <br /> <br /> People don't play your time on this one.
