Okay, I've seen lots of movies dealing with witches and occult, but this one was just plain weird. This movie begins like this cult of witches led by a really bad Orson Wells who plays the stellar (couldn't have got anyone who looked and seemed more like a satanist), he just didn't belong in this movie. But in any case, the coven takes a new member and sticks a doll that looks like someone and causes her to get miscarried. The lady who had the miscarriage and her husband went out to a place called Lillith in the bushed, and the lady in between sees a picture of her sister or the one who calls her and warns her to stay away from there and never uses her forces there or she will die The couple, after they settle in the strange city, discover that all the inhabitants are all witches, and she becomes curious and afraid of all her neighbors and friends. Then strange things start to happen when the lady discovers a funeral that takes place on a hill that suddenly disappears (it was scary) and to see the little boy belonging to Orson Wells on playgroud that he later asks the lady to help bring him back to life. The lady soon tries to escape the city, but only to find herself trapped by its inhabitants and powers and finds herself ignoring everything that the spirit is trying to warn her about. This movie is ok, it has thrills, but it could really have done much better than having Orson in there.
