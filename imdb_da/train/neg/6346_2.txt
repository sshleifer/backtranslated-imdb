This movie stinks! You will have back the two plus hours required to get through it. Sliding doors, w / Gwyth Paltrow and directed by Peter Howit, did what Melinda & Melinda are trying to do much much better. That movie was clever, witty and well-behaved. I cared what happened to both Gwyenths - or rather the characters she played - and the notion of supporting the role was amazing. <br /> <br /> Where Melinda and Melinda are tiring, the dialogue is constructed and I could have cared less about any of these people - at least of all Melinda. A Melinda is so dysfunctional - her first glass of wine is at. 10 - and so melodramatic she is ridiculous and not in comic sense. The 2nd Melinda is fine but forgettable. Woody Allen's former ensemble film worked because I guess he spent time on the manuscript and the actors were talented. A few trivia for this movie is that he wrote this manuscript in two months: you can tell. And while Chloe Sevigny is talented - those around her are not enough to be a great deal. The movie ends up being Chloe Sevigny and a lot of other people you know you've seen in other movies, but can't quite remember which ones. <br /> <br /> Sad, very sorry.
