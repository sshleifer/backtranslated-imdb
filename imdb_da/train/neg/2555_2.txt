This movie may be one of the most horrible horror flicks I've seen. The length was almost not long enough to include a good story. Also the way the foster parents died was simply ridiculous. The mother suddenly dies from falling through a shower after stumbling across an action figure, and Dad is shot by a police officer? I can see where some originality could have been what they needed, but it could have been better. The fuss of it all also made me press stop before it was over. After hearing the whole of Lucy's name and figuring out it was 'Lucifer' I wanted to gag. Yes, it is interesting that Lucifer was a woman, but look at the name. It's a man's name. It must be given to a male character. All in all, the film was a drill and could have used a better plot.
