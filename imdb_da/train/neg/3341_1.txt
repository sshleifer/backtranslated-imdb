I just rented this movie to see Dolph Lundgren, whom I hadn't seen in any movie since Rocky IV. Unfortunately, this movie was a big disappointment. All the parties' actions were bad except for Mr Lundgren, who was okay-ish. Kata Dob√≥ was somewhat nice to see despite his ridiculous outfit and makeup. The plot is not smart at all, it's something that has been repeated a million times in different movies. The villains were completely stereotypical, and Lundgren's character had no depth in it. I don't really expect a movie masterpiece, but unfortunately it is not a decent act. Each turn of the plot is highly predictable, and the incredible amount of overrealism and cartoon letters started to irritate me very soon. I would recommend it to young children who want some comic-like action but only if nothing else is available. <br /> <br /> 1/10. (I think the current average vote of 7.0 with 6 votes must have been influenced by someone involved in making this movie)
