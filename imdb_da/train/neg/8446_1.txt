Absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen ... Can anyone tell me where should I have laughed? There is no single hint or shadow of an idea. The three leading players are pestilent, especially the one (I think it's Aldo) from Sicily, who can't make a Sicilian accent !!! Not to say about the dreamlike deployment about Dracula ... just another appropriate, drawn from the worst cabaret tradition, to make this "movie" last a little longer. Massironi and Littizzetto do what they can, but this so-called movie was really too hard to save. I would have given it "0" / 10, but the lowest mark was 1/10 and then I had to overestimate it with a tag.
