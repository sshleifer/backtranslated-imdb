The nutcracker has always been a somewhat problematic ballet. It has little resemblance to ETA Hoffman's original story on which it is based. <br /> <br /> In the ballet, the story is almost over in the second half, when Clara (or Marie in this version) travels to the Kingdom of Sweets to see a series of character dances. <br /> <br /> There are an infinite number of stage productions that interpret the story in countless ways (not always successfully) to compensate for the ballet's weak libretto. <br /> <br /> Balanchine's version has no sense of drama or history at all (despite the fact that there are lots of drama and mystery in Tchaikovsky's wonderful first act music). The result is a completely forgettable first half Christmas party, where there is almost nothing going on, and where even the dance (the little one is there) is not very memorable. <br /> <br /> The pantomime overtime, especially of Drosselmeier, which may look passable on stage, just looks stupid on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, things are not much better when we come to King's Sweets (Act II in the scene version). Although there are a few choreographic highlights, most of the choreography is gentle and uninspiring. This is certainly not vintage Balanchine. <br /> <br /> Balanchine is widely regarded as a master of abstract dance, but I have always felt that he was less successful as the creator of narrative ballets. Seeing this movie version of his stage production by The Nutcracker has only confirmed this view.
