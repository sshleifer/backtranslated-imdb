Man, it was fun. It must be under COMEDY. Or STUPID. It would have made realizing what a pile of smelled it was much easier. Seriously? I would like someone associated with this movie tased, effective immediately. For anyone thinking of seeing this "movie", let's go over a few plot points. Oh wait. There is no one. There is literally no plot. I think Casper Van Dien is bored, and he decided to film something with some random, and miraculously became videotape. This movie is literally the worst movie all the time. Don't believe me? Go see it. Do it, man. I challenge you. But be prepared to pour out your eyes. If you can sit through this without blowing a cow, you are very strong and brave.
