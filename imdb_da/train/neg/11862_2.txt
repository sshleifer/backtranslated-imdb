This movie probably had some potential for something; My confusion is how these totally prosaic unfunny themes continue to make it theaters, it's as if ideas are being reused just because generations are. Really the decerebrate oafs behind most movies are like dogs, they return to take their own vomit. Now the $ 19 richer now because of me. It was not at all imaginative, there was no redeeming moment, all that was distant fun was shown in the trailer (and nothing entertaining was in the trailer), performances were strained (especially Molly's, totally unconvincing). What should theoretically be a comical relief, was the homoerotic friend with a penchant for Disney movies; none of his analogies hit home, his small moral speeches were flat, I literally waited for them to continue saying something meaningful, only to find out he was done. The so-called "hard 10" is the most insipid plastic being (apart from having a horse-like face with a strange smile); I honestly found her friend Patty (referred to as the Hamburglaren) to be far better than her. But then again, gentlemen prefer brunettes;) Well, nevertheless, the whole premise is that society is superficial, and if love is true, it transcends all social facades; the way they showed this, with a guy carrying another's scrotum and the millions of times-mutilated-and-killed death-horse for early ejaculation routines (with obvious distress to American pie and happiness - the latter in the obnoxious scene, who is involved with the family dog). I feel like the movie was like adjoining ridiculous jokes in an unformed miserable ball of raw wastewater. Going to show marketing can push something out there, shine whatever filled mass and call it gold, people come (worked for me). Made with tirade.
