I want to keep the card that I know I don't have to say much. <br /> <br /> "Alive" is a strange little movie that obviously appeals to some, but I found it fun to be gentle from the very beginning. The film did very little to make some of the characters cozy and the story was sometimes so horrified that I completely lost interest. As I said, I know others enjoyed it, but I found Kitamura's "Alive" to be anything but - a lama, extremely boring drama disguised as a thought-provoking action-sci-fi flick. I felt like I was suckered into watching this movie, based on its exciting performance and uber exciting cover art. <br /> <br /> My suggestion? Beware of Kitamura's much more enjoyable freshman action "Versus" or his 2004 riot "Godzilla: Final Wars". <br /> <br /> And don't be confused, I'm always up for a good thinker's movie, but it certainly wasn't. There was a moment for a moment that I was really worried about a single event taking place in this overly preachy, dialogue-heavy film. <br /> <br /> If you want to talk about something ... talk about boring.
