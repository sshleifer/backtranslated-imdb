In spite of the great futuristic toucans, the clever Asimov premise and Will Smith's reliable cool performance, this movie does not live up to expectations. The clich√©s come thick and fast; (waking from a recurring nightmare, the maverick cop has his badge recalled by the hardass lieutenant that list more would be pampering it - you can see the end a mile away). This film is also phase-bound - you never feel you have traveled anywhere; What should be a global disaster never leaves a natural CGI Chicago. The robots themselves are good at close-up, but the crowd scenes look more like bad Disney CGI is exaggerated over and over again. And if you can destroy the robots by smashing them, why should they inject "nanites"? You know it's a duff movie when stupid questions like that start to disturb you before climax. It could have been good, but it's less than the sum of its parts, mainly because of the completely predictable plot that could have come from any action movie from the last forty years.
