I knew it would be, but I gave it a rental for some laughs and maybe some thoughtless fun. Anyone who reads a couple of my reviews can see that I'm pretty easy to please. I really didn't think I would end up feeling this negative about it. The reason is about an old army of dragons led by a large snake that will destroy the world unless some selected heroes who inherit responsibility can ?? become one with ?? a good dragon ?? or something?? I do not know. It was so stupid that I didn't have a hard time keeping it. <br /> <br /> It has a really stupid story full of ridiculous moments and greasy concepts. So many of the events felt completely random and sudden. <br /> <br /> I suppose there was studio interference or something because the biggest problem I have with the movie is that the story looks like it's trying to be so grand and epic, but everything happens so fast and goes so fast. I want to have just hit one million plot points and action sequences in a big ball. The film is like a blow to the face. It doesn't take much time to establish characters or drama. Imagine the trilogy's 'Lord of the Rings' for 90 minutes ?? You could have most of the epic battle sequences, but there would be no build-up and you would hardly worry about the outcome of these battles. That was the case with Dragon Wars ?? 90 minutes of me not giving a shit and waiting for it to be over. <br /> <br /> Fantastic CGI with something okay to manage, but terrible acting, fast pacing and stupid history made it very difficult to enjoy for any reason. I would probably have loved it when I was 6 years old.
