Woody Allen has made some of the greatest comedies ever, and I seriously want to say that Annie Hall is the biggest movie ever, but if I really think about it, I'd probably think of one or two better, but It would be difficult. He has, of course, had some movies that are not quite good, but not as bad as Manhattan Murder Mystery and Sweet and Lowdown, but he has never before had a movie as bad as Melinda and Melinda. Not quite so tired and so unfunny, his movies are usually witty and fun, but how did this happen, is it still our good old Woody? The plot runs about four friends who eat dinner together. Two are playwrights, and one of the others mentions a funny story that happened to a friend of her. It's about a young woman breaking into an evening party unexpectedly. We never hear the rest because the two games begin to debate whether it would create a better comedy or tragedy. So we start to see the two views. Both the center of this woman was called Melinda, who has problems both with drugs and with her former husband. In the tragedy, she is an old family friend who, after attempting suicide, decided to appear at her old best friends door without any apparent reason. Comedy is about Melida, who stumbles into the evening party after beating 28 sleeping pills. Both go on a windswept wind of events that never make sense or fit together, or make you laugh more than once or twice. There are some fine performances by Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrell, but they cannot fit it together on their own. They can't stop it from sinking further down than most of the other movies this year.
