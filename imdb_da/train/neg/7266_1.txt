... and yet we were told there was an hour and 20 minutes left. <br /> <br /> Why, oh, why wasn't there an editor to tell the author / director to snip, snip, snip? Apparently, this author / instructor previously made shorts; as a card it would have been okay. But the lack of dialogue begins to congratulate after twenty minutes. The lack of much music is glares. The background noise (speech, traffic and especially a ubiquitous helicopter) gets old really fast. But the worst failure is in history. There is precious little beyond a card. <br /> <br /> After an hour we saw variations of the same scene over and over again. I screamed almost on the screen, "we get it, we get it !!!!!" It's amazing that after leaving the theater, we could drive home, see the Daily Show and parts of the Colbert Report, get ready for bed, and know that the audience was still trapped in the theater. <br /> <br /> Pampering your vision is not enough. You need to give the audience enough to share your vision.
