can any movie become more naive than this? You can't believe a piece of this script. and it is predictable that you can tell the plot and the end from the first 10 minutes. the leading actress seems to be Barbie (but she doesn't, the doll has more plays). <br /> <br /> The ease with which the character passes and remains in a music school makes the phantom of the opera short story seem like a historical biography. I do not even want to comment on the characters' rare character, but the one good thing in the film is Madsen's performance, which manages to bring life to a melodic one-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> The movie is so cheesy that it sticks to your teeth. I think some 13-year-old Britney-occupied girls are shouting, "Oh, give us a break! If we want adventure, there's always the Brothers Grimm book hidden somewhere in the ceiling." I gave it 2 instead of one for Virginia Madsen only.
