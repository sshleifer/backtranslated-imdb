I won't waste a lot of time on this one, as far as I'm concerned, it's not really a movie to begin with, just a careless mish-mash of borrowed footage and embarrassing amateurish new footage made solely for the purpose of to put the whole mess together and call it a "Boogeyman" successor. Literally 80% of this movie is stolen from its far superior predecessor "The Boogeyman", a movie that the authors of this waste apparently didn't even see, because they couldn't even get actress Suzanna Love's original character's name (Lacy) right . And to add disgrace to injury, the killer is invisible in the original recording and visible in the new recording, apparently they think their audience is as stupid as they are. 0 out of 10 and I want IMDb's rating system went so low, the most discerning and blatant attempt to tear off people's money I have seen, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNING!
