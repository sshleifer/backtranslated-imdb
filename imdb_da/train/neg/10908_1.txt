Nothing in this movie is fun. I thought the premise to give a human libido of a randy ram was interesting and had to laugh. WRONG! There is simply nothing funny about the movie. For example, the protagonist who makes a passport on a goat in the heat in the middle of a farmhouse farm, is not fun, it borders on indecency. They play around with the bestiality of this movie on one level, and it's just not fun. <br /> <br /> We all know that dogs will eat anything, anywhere, anytime. The main character does this with everything, everywhere, every time it's not fun either. It will be a clich√©. <br /> <br /> Rob Schneider is probably acceptable in the role. By this I mean that he is not a bad actor, but with cluttered material it is difficult to comment on quality. But Coleen Haskell, the other half of the human romantic leaders (do you count the number of animals that the protagonist is interested in as a romantic driver too?), Seems to be embarrassed all over and she should also be. She seems to work in a kind of vacuum, detached from all the other actors in the film. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie only if you want to get bored with tasteless, boring, repetitive material.
