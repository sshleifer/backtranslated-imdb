This may or may not be the worst movie Steve Martin has ever made, but it was certainly far from his best. Of course, he did this scream for the paycheck. Dreck like this certainly does nothing to improve his reputation as a fun man. What he doesn't seem to understand is that when people go to watch a Steve Martin movie, they expect to be entertained, not bored with tears. It's sad that he dragged Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman with him. I do not understand why talented people cannot grasp the fact that people will not see them in miserable films. If you want to call a movie a comedy, then it should be fun. It wasn't. Shame on the US military to allow itself to be associated with this papal too. The Full Metal Jacket had more laughs than this miserable excuse for a "service comedy." Phil Silvers rolls safely in his grave.
