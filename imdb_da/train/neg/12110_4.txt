What is most striking about this semi-musical set in the 1920s Berlin is the amazing movie and editing. It is the top of the line from First National in these departments. The story is mildly engaging and resembles the drawings of Miller's other two films (SUNNY, SALLY), where the working girl is romanticized by rich boys with family satisfaction, complications and final clinic. All four music tracks are stacked at the beginning of the movie, and we go for a long stretch without further musical buzz. Miller sings parts of I think of BABY and reprises because of you. There is also never BLUE, and even if you are not the first one. <br /> <br /> Miller here is very engaging and delightful, reminiscent of Irene Dunne in the way and delivery. Unfortunately, she does not dance as it is her forte. SALLY remains her finest movie, with this subsequently as second and rather poor SUNNY a much inferior runner up. Her life was tragically shortened by a sinus infection before the days when hospitals and antibiotics made such tragedies preventable. It is worth visiting these movies themselves to see Ziegfeld's top stars in their twenties.
