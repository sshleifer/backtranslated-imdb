It was over with slashers about 88 so it was time for the osteic rip offs of the older movies. Brain is well done, the script reminded me of video drum but then in a more cheesy way as I said before. The action can go through with it. But these are the effects that make you laugh, the so-called brain is really a turkey, and the blood is never shown. The opening sequence is what makes this movie worth seeing, hallucinations are really neatly finished and reminded me of nightmares on Elm Street, remember that the phone comes alive .... Some how to watch this flick and wait what happens next walk. It can be seen for all the freaks out there, because there is nothing going on in it and, as said, the blood is not there, but there is nudity for the perverts. I've seen worse movies than this one, just wished they had made it bloody ...
