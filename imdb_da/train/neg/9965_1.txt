WARNING! SMALL BIG DETAILS REVEALED! <br /> <br /> I can hardly find anything positive about this movie. It's written so badly that each character is a caricature, but it seems to be taking seriously. It's badly thrown, especially Ralph Macchio (all baby-faced, 5-foot-nothing of him) like a streetwise tough. Plate elements are all drawn in black and white, with each situation almost escalating to an extreme peak. <br /> <br /> The most egregious of all (PLOT ELEMENTS TO BE REVEALED) may have the most free and constructed nude scene in the history of semi-serious film. One can only imagine the filmmakers saying, "We need JoBeth to throw her top ... hmmm ... I have it! ... early in the movie, let's give Nick a ridiculous dialogue about shaving yourself in the times ... ... when JoBeth can use that line on him later and really got going in the hallway ... yes it is the ticket! "<br /> <br /> I want to give manufacturers credit to tackle a major issue in 1984, one that appeared too heavy in the late 90s with events like Columbine. But the performance is terrible. This movie could have been a dark comedy in "Heathers", a campy political statement "Network" or a serious study like "Brubaker". Instead, it tries to be all these things - and end up being none of these things. "Teachers" get a F.
