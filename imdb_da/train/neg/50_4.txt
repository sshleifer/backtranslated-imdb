Three parts "horror" movies with a guy in a retired house asking the viewer not to go "out there" and (unfortunately) give us three stories to prove why. <br /> <br /> The first story involves a young couple in a car accident meeting with two psychoses. It leads to two completely predictable terms. Nevertheless, it is fast (about 15 minutes) violent, well-traded and well done. Predictable but fun. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, a man flees to steal a large sum of money. His car breaks down, he is attacked by a dog and stumbles into a nearby clinic. VERY overt, poorly done and extremely slow. Although 30 minutes this is too long. Good play though. <br /> <br /> The third is just a scary story. It involves a beautiful, lonely woman looking for Mr. Right. It has beautiful set designs, a nice erotic feeling and a nice sex scene. But (again) predictable and not even extremely scary. <br /> <br /> It ends very stupid. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's first worth seeing, but that's it. Set for one and then turn it off.
