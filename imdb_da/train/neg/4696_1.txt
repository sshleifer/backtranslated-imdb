I know the people and I did some animation and graphic design and the show is terrible! They are rich little children who have no talent, and probably just asked Nick to accept them! Alex has played drums for a year I have played for 4 1/2! The movie is horrible and so is the show! This is the craziest most mixed comedy that isn't even fun I've ever seen. It's so stupid it makes me barf !!! It's just so crazy that Nickelodeon would ever accept something like this and so stupid! They are so stupid and strange! I hate them and their show and think when Nick realizes how stupid it is, they will most hopefully take it off!
