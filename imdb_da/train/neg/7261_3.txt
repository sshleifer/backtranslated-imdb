This British-Spanish co-production is one of the countless films shot in Spain in the wake of the unexpected phenomenal success that Italian "spaghetti" westerns have had, and as is typical of such a genre, there is one eclectic selection of established and new international stars: Robert Shaw, Telly Savalas, Stella Stevens, Martin Landau, Fernando Rey, Michael Craig, Al Lettieri, Dudley Sutton, Antonio Mayans, etc. Ironically, this incoherent mess of a movie serves as an excellent example why most Americans of film genres became a dying race in the 1970s and today are practically (or is it officially?) extinct. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie, not just because the western is one of my favorite types of movies, but also because it had all the qualities, including an exciting premise, to be a good - for not to mention the fact that my father bought a paperback version of A TOWN CALLED BASTARD's romanization according to its original ease! As it is, the film's only virtue (if indeed it can be called it) is its sheer eccentricity: for example, Stevens, who plays widow for revenge on the man who betrayed his revolutionary man, sleeps in a coffin (! ) driven around in a wagon by his stupid servant (?) Sutton; Savalas, as a bloodthirsty renegade, who initially seems to be the movie's greatest villain, is sent insecure from his own hands Lettieri very early in the picture; the piece of the piece turns out to be Landau, which in the film's very first scene seen loot side by side our legendary hero-turned priest Shaw! Fernando Rey, who plays a blind man, is the only one who can identify rebel Shaw, who eventually turns out to have been just a front for ... well, never mind! As you can see, the plot is very confusing and it gets alien from there! The production team responsible for this film was also behind other Western fares during the same period as CUSTER OF THE WEST (1967), BAD MAN'S RIVER (1971), CAPTAIN APACHE (1971) and PANCHO VILLA (1972).
