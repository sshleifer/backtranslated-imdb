The story goes like this, Netflix was late sending me my DVDs, so I went on to the analog rental site known as "Blockbuster Video" They suck you. Really bad, you have 150 copies of the latest lame movies for your pleasure, but I will never see any of them. So I saw BTK Killer there on the shelf, all by his lonely self. I like to watch movies based on serial killers. It's just a part of humanity that I will never understand, so I want to see that kind of thing. Anyways I put this DVD in and suddenly from the very first second, it sucks. I sit there with my b.f. and we are like "what is this kind of shed?" Unstable camera operation, horrible action - The first scene where a woman is killed, wondering if she would rather just calmly yawn instead, then get a rat stuffed into her throat. I really wonder if the director has a hard-on for this crap. There is nothing decent about this "movie". All I have to say to the director is "do you own a freakin stand?" Every shot was brutally unstable. The music was horrible. It was as if they just decided one day to make a movie. They probably gather people from WalMart to show up and "act" for them. Just awful. If you make a movie like this, it's your hobby - not what you have to do to live - don't make it to the DVD neighborhoods for movie buffers like myself. Better left at home for your friends when you have a party and run out of interesting things to entertain them with ... Then you break your BTK KIll movie and say, "Do you want to see this crappy movie I did once?"
