I watched this movie back on the first theatrical release, in a fair empty theater. Believe it or not, after decades of watching movies, this still stands out clearly in my mind as the worst movie of all time; or at least the worst I would allow myself to see. The actor is far below the standard as a random group of drunk high school students stuck out of the street and forced to learn their lines for 5 minutes or less. <br /> <br /> After the first shock of disbelief, we laughed for a while as each scene hit new downs. But after a while even the dubious joy struck and it was just sad.
