Complete drive. An unfortunate manifestation of the hypocritical, toxic culture a decade ago. In this movie, pedestrian regret for slavery goes hand in hand with colonial subtitles (the annoying red-haired Shaka rice?). Also, forget about the historical reality. Did most Western slaves not get from West Africa? An American slave easily caught Shaka with a handful of men? Finally, David Hasslehoff could not have been more challenging. One can only consider how would he have gone into the miniseries? (Immediately impaled most likely). The miniseries were excellent and it is unfortunate that DH should have got his hands on something unique and made it everyday. (I have a tendency to believe that he had a hand in creating this failure).
