Sometimes a prerequisite begins well, but because of the requirement to go overboard to meet the demands of an audience suffering from attention deficit, it causes a gruesome mess. And for three reputable actors who have done better work before and after, it's a deadly shame. So let's see. Locality: A loving couple living in a beautiful home is threatened by a poor politician. Interesting to say the least. Make the incoming police officer a little disturbing why not. It was well done in HAND, ROCKER CRADLE and SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, and it's a proven ticket to a successful thriller. <br /> <br /> Now the dilemma is here.
