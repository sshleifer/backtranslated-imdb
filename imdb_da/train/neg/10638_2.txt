Evidence that not everything Tarantino touches turns to gold. This is absolutely plastic all the way. It is easy to see it without Quentin's involvement, it would probably have put on the shelf for years, assuming it would ever have been produced in the first place. It's about a woman with a fascination with death who gets a job cleaning up after crime scenes, Angela Jones is convincing in this role, William Baldwin is better as the serial killer who keeps Jones in work! All in all, quite poor.
