As a premise, this backwood's version of the Dead Calm storyline had a promise. <br /> <br /> But director Eric Red's inability to make a convincing hurricane leads to an abundance of continuity and light failures. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the viewer is more spellbound by the bizarre weather effects than the intended story. Intermittent spikes of skin-fisted over-direction are also distracting. <br /> <br /> Charles Dance, making a 'stingy backwoods hardass' schtick, does its best to save the movie. But in the end, undertow squeals like a pig ... and have more ham to start.
