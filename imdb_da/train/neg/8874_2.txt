But there are not too many of them. Probably the worst "big release" movie I've seen in my life. Definitely the worst for this year. There is no point in commenting on the plot, cast or actor. The problem is beyond all that. It lies in the absolute stupidity of the annoying nature (not the funny kind) of everything that takes place on the screen. I don't know why I gave it a 2/10 instead of 1/10. Probably because of Steven Martini. He really tried. Bottom line - 95 minutes washed down the toilet with a pair of brain cells. Avoid at all costs.
