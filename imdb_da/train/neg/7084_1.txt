As many others have said, this is a horrible movie, from every aspect of film making. How they ever got some renowned name actors to take on this project is amazing. Many people have complained that it was shot on 'cheap' camcorders. Yes, it was shot on video but not 'cheap' video. What made it bad was the lighting, the white balance, the shooting technique and the editing. <br /> <br /> There were so many different shooting and editing methods that it was a production crunch. Hard, inconsistent lighting, over the use of handheld shooting (ala Woody Allen), chopped editing (another Allen technique), but poorly done without real purpose. The lack of white balance in the restaurant kitchen scenes is embarrassingly very amateurish. <br /> <br /> The simulated sex scenes had no acting value at any level. <br /> <br /> How this video has ever made it print is beyond me. It is worth looking at if you just have to be surprised at how bad it is.
