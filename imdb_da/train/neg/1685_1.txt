All the children from 14-16 will watch this movie (although you are only allowed at 18.00). They have heard that it is a very scary movie and they feel so cool when they see it. I feel very sad that children can't see what a good movie is and what a bad movie is. This was one of the worst movies I saw in months. Every scene you see in this movie is a copy from another movie. And the end? It's an open end ... why? Because it's impossible to come up with a decent one for such a stupid story. This movie has just been made to scare you, and if you are a little smart and know something about music, you know exactly when you are scared. <br /> <br /> When the movie was finished and I turned to my friend and told him (a little too loud) that this was a total waste of money, a stupid child was so strange to me. This day I could make an Oscar with a home video of my goldfish if I only use the right marketing.
