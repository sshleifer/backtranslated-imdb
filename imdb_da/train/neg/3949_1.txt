I got a DVD of "Bogeyman" and this stunker was an extra feature. I assumed it was "Boogeyman II" because it was paired with the original. But you know what they say about those who "assume": it makes an "ass" out of "u" and "me". I had read before viewing that BII contains a lot of pictures from the original and that the star actress Love. As I watched the "Boogeyman's return", I decided to hold onto the original recording to see the infamous dead-to-toothbrush scene. Before I knew it, the movie was over. Rip-off. I think I thought this was BII because this has a similar title to one of BII's alternative titles. Oh, at least it was just an extra feature, right? <br /> <br /> Let me stop talking about my error and start talking about the movie's flaws. Many, many mistakes. Who does this guy Ulli work, whatever he is? Does he really think that the same movie will sell in different forms. There is nothing original to keep Part III up. It is basically a flashback of the original through the eyes of a psychic who gives us a gruelingly boring play-by-play as everything happens. It's the movie. Oh, and a dead-for-stereo scene, but you can read it from someone else's review. My interest in "Boogeyman II" is always lost. <br /> <br /> Finally, note: this is not a series of movies to look back.
