So this was an HBO "Made for TV Movie" eh? Is it an excuse for such a pathetic plot and horrible action? Such a shame to see Jim Belushi reduced to a role so repetitive (shot to, survived, lie, beat up, survive, shot on, lie and then ad infinitum. Call it a script? As for the British who are embarrassing to see Timothy Dalton's pathetic (or did he just pause, depends on how much he was paid I guess?) Attempt a southern sheriff). As for the other Brit, the pale blonde one, what a w *** is! There is a tendency to glorify these "English speaking" (sic) super-violent bullies lately, perhaps thanks to Mr. Madonna's two films succeed in entertaining and justifying the violence by the proficient use of irony and humor that Pulp Fiction does. But this movie discredits and degrades the genre. definitely one to miss.
