In general, I like horror movies, but unfortunately it fell out of one pound booth in my friend's hand. We sat down to see it, ready to be scared and ended up spraying food everywhere, we laugh so much. The concept is not that bad, but why the decided number ten in the series would be lucky, I do not know. The worst thing about the movie is the actors. The camera work was poor, special effects are actually not bad if I'm generous, but overall the story didn't celebrate any connection, because the actors were just as effective as a small lump of badly charred elm. They were wooden out of target, especially a sharp young actor who was fifteen years too young to be taken seriously as any kind of state agent. He looked more like a public school boy indeed. There was a really entertaining sex scene where he looked like he was bobbing for apples when a busty lady rode on top of him, and later his soft underpants were hysterical, but then I remembered it shouldn't be a comedy . I desperately slam my brain to find something positive to say about this movie except the occasional flash of breasts, but there is simply not. Let's hope ten were lucky numbers, and they don't do another, I'm not sure my ribs could take it.
