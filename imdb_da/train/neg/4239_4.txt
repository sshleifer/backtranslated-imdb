This was a better than average movie I thought, because it was on cable. I had expected something like cheese melodrama and bad special effects seen in classics like Christmas tree or first daughter / goal / shot etc.. Ron Livingston as the hard-pressed SWAT Commander. It is good to see him see the same material again, he had so many happiness in the Band of Brothers. The producers and the designers had done their homework because all the scenes and pictures looked like they did that day back in 1997. <br /> <br /> So if you get the chance to watch this movie and I'm sure you will since FX recreates everything 50 times ... take 2 hours and enjoy it.
