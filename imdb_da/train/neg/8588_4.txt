Revenge of Sith starts with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting, so gets really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes with the same horrible dialogue and boring machinations that have plagued the rest of the prequel series. The only thing that improves the procedure is the slow - and I mean slowly - building what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader. And when it finally comes, it's pretty okay. Not good. Not even good. But pretty okay. This movie is very overpriced because it does not suck to high skies like the previous successors. Instead, it is just turgid, boring and routine. But you have to say, wow, the CGI environments are really impressive at times. Bu the lightsabre matches? They are all a blurry mess. I think the dark side grabbed Lucas when he started these prequells, and no one noticed. This will make a lot of money, but thank God it is over, this once-worshiping franchise has been knocked down enough. I saw the 12:01 show and after that I heard a group of very young children say, wow it was amazing! But all older than eight muttered the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle. It was a little boring. I just thought the birth of Darth Vader would be better. Then we all said.
