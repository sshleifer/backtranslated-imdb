"Night" (pronounced by Trevor Gagnon) along with his brainiac friend "IQ" (pronounced by Philip Bolden) and the always hungry "Scooter" (David Gore) are children with big dreams. They will be the first flies in the room. And what encourages their dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon, Apollo 11 is waiting for its historic ride on the launch pad near where the three hang out. <br /> <br /> The first thing you notice is the animation of the movie. I found it done very well done. The landscape had depth on it, as things in the distance actually looked like they were behind the scenes of the focuses. I didn't watch the movie in 3-D when it was broadcast on HBO. But I could see that there were really no scenes that exploited the 3-D effects, except a battle between characters near the end. I was also not really impressed with the drawing of the characters. For me, they did not look like a fly, especially in the dyeing. The flies were an unusual blue-gray, which was a little distracting to me. <br /> <br /> The performance from the cast wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. There were many times I focused more on my computer than the story. The scripture was certainly written for a younger audience, with comic moments that make younger children laugh. I saw nothing for adults as jokes that they will get the punchline for the adults to understand the meaning. <br /> <br /> The story was not followed in this movie. In fact, I think it was completely ignored, as the main focus was the flies. I also hated when a well-known astronaut appeared on the screen and explained that the stories of the flies in the film were a work of fiction and no flies were on Apollo 11. I liked how he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their life for exploration of space itself. <br /> <br /> If you're an adult, it's not for you. It was not made for the whole family. This is definitely only for children. But save this for a rainy day.
