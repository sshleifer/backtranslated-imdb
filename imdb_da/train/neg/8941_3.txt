Ed Wood is obscured and becomes Orson Welles. This movie is amazing. Vampire witches fighting in terribly choreographed scenes and dialogue that could have broken ribs with laughter. Plan 9 From OUterSpace there is no chance of this. Described by the author and psychic Stephen Armourae on the Vampire Forum as a masterpiece - he is from England and thoroughly sarcastic. <br /> <br /> It's got Stephanie Beaton, and the producers know what's going to save them from the banking circuit by repeatedly using her. Even though she leaves me cold as she looks more like the undead than all the devil's lifts. And Eileen Daly is just a lower rate Elvira. It's all badly done. <br /> <br /> See it for the script itself
