This movie begins quite horribly with a woman who is tied and psychologically tortured. There are male full frontal nudity, dead animal parts, dogs licking nipples, the female losing control of the bladder. Everything shot in a gray cold color. Effective, but a little too much. We continue to see the BTK killers' youth as well as the present and his story of crimes. The excitement is completely psychological, and the killer scenes enter their victims' homes and talk to them lasting quite a long time, and that is scary. Here we do not see fancy or good imaging, it looks like shot with your home camera. It does not seem scary, but in a way to see a criminal engage his victims for some time before they kill them, it is quite unusual and chilling. What this movie does not have is a drama, really. There are some cop scenes every now and then, but there is no excitement about them finding the killer. There is not much of a bow to this story. This could have been an effective psychological thriller, a study of madness. Unfortunately, the film is filled with genuine slaughtering material. It is scattered throughout the movie and comes suddenly again and again. Sometimes you don't know it's coming and don't have time to look away. And I must reject that. I am too low budget horror movie, but I do not tolerate animal suffering. It was unnecessary, excessive and came without warning. I am glad that Lionsgate releases things that no one else does, but they should have passed this movie or edited out of the animal. Stay away from this waste.
