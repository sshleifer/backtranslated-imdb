Way back when I rented videos for free, I picked this one up. OOPS The things I wanted to mention outside of the summary already given were these. 1: A person who had a lot to do with this movie had a strange and ill fascination with food, it was gross and unwanted. 2: There is a kind of soundtrack in the background of the movie that seems to be there all the time, and mostly I felt in days after seeing this garbage, I found out that they had something subliminal in track. Either that or it was just traumatizing badly or both. Many times throughout the film you can tell the author and the instructor did not have much experience or talent. And don't even ask about the actor.
