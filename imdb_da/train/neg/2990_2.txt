Ohhh man! Now that's where I'm talking about! As for bad / cheesy horror flicks, this movie was really in a class of its own. A real gem! <br /> <br /> First, the movie was not originally in English. It's okay because the voice dubbing was really outstanding! Here is my favorite extract from the dialogue (and there is much more where this came from)? "I feel a little better. I'm just thirsty for your blood!" <br /> <br /> And what a drama! Here is a play-play interaction between the interaction between the military and the researchers? <br /> <br /> Scene 1 ?? Researcher: "You can't do it? It'll be a disaster!" - Military officer: "It's just science fiction" (he then continues to cause a complete disaster like the scientist predicted). Scene 2 ?? Researcher: "If you do, many people will die !!!" - Military officer: "You don't know what you're talking about." (He does it and many people die). <br /> <br /> Scene 3 ?? Researcher: "Don't do it? It'll kill everyone!" - Military officer: "It's nonsense" (he continues to kill everyone) <br /> <br /> Scene 4, 5, 6, 7 ?? (you get the idea). <br /> <br /> If that wasn't enough ?? There were a few scenes that really stood out like instant classics! In one scene, the military literally has 10 guys pointing to two unarmed men. The manager shouts: "Guess them!" and all 10 army boys, one at a time, drop their weapons and fist the two opponents! Instant classic! <br /> <br /> And calm. No attention to detail was omitted! This movie even had a hip / upbeat '80s keyboard / synth soundtrack to set the mood! <br /> <br /> And believe me ?? I realize that this review may contain some spoilers, but there are so many treats in this epic I really just scratched the surface. A movie of this caliber only comes out once a decade! A real movie watching experience! A masterpiece! Wow!
