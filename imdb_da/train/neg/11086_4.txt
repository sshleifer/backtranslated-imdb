As far as Spaghetti Westerns go, I would put this man out of the dull side of the genre. It's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it lacks the brilliance and flash of some of the other SW's I've seen. Guy Madison does his best in the lead, but lacks the screen charism needed to pull it off. With a remarkable exception, the rest of the cast is not very good. The direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that I have not seen before. There is just not much to be very enthusiastic about. <br /> <br /> The cast exception I mentioned is Rosalba Neri. She is the only bright spot in this otherwise mediocre movie. Unfortunately, her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: IMDb page for this man cannot die is wrong. Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson, but instead she is the character Melin. I am not sure how anyone could fail Rosalba Neri for a guy named John Bartha as stated in IMDb's credits for the movie.)
