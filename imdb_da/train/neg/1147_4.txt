This movie is for F.B.I.'s story when Knots Berry Farm is to the old west. Shamelessly sanitized version of the Federal Bureau of Investigation fight against crime. Hoover's heavy hand (did he have any other kind?) Constantly shows teevee quality script-reading actors, cheesy sets, cheap sound effects and lighting 101. With Jimmy Stewart with 20% of dramatic capacity, Vera Miles chew nature, the movie has every c -lists known in the mid-fifties with nary a hint of irony or humor, from the 'Amazon jungle' to the 'backyard grill, all sorts of sound phases and backs. Even the sliders are canned and known. I imagine Mervyn Leroy was full every night. Except for a few (very few) interesting exterior images, there is nothing but a curiosity.
