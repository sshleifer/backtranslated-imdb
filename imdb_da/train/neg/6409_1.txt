I just watched this movie yesterday ... I can't believe the reviews on this site. Those who give it over a star must be Buffy fanatics. Well, I'm a Buffy fan of the first order, but I know something when I see it. At all levels, this movie is horrible. Technically, much of the time you do not know where you are in this movie, even within a scene, it jumps POV as crazy without reason. No logic at all in cinematic terms. Emotionally bleak for bleak guilt and trying to be a psychological thriller when it's just confusing. Throwing nasty-looking redhead in your movie is a cheap way to convey "atmosphere". I ran out of patience with it long before the last action, but I had too much fun with my friends to do the MST3K riffs to turn it off. Since leaving Buffy, SMG has had 2 successful movies, even if listing "Scooby Doo" on your CV could count. Gellar is a fine actress, but she (or her agent) can probably not find a vehicle for her. And Mr Shepard, if you have trouble paying your mortgage, I will send you a pair of pants if you promise you will not appear in a movie like this again! (The property in Patsy Cline must also sue for defamation!)
