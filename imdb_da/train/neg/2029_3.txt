I can't see enough TV shows to understand the attraction of VIEW MONEY, but I assume it holds something to appeal to the indispensable audience. Probably a quiz show, it offers contestants huge amount of money to answer a few simple questions. But the quiz elements only play a small role in the matter, which I find slightly complicated. For example, before answering a question, a participant chooses which question to ask by choosing from random "A", "B" or "C" choices. Does this serve any purpose other than slowing down the game? It would be much quicker just to start with "A." Participants can forward questions, but must answer one of the three questions in each category. <br /> <br /> After answering a question, participants are asked to "lock in" the answer - another delay tactic. The participant's next task is to name which woman from about a dozen go-go dancers in the cages reveal a map indicating how much the question is worth. A correct answer adds the card's dollar sum to the competitor's continuous total; a wrong answer draws the same amount. This time-consuming step actually has some entertainment value, as it gives the audience a good look at the easily dressed and uniform beautiful dancers. Meanwhile, the competition is reminded that an unfortunate choice of "killer card" will end the game immediately. This, of course, makes the competitor sweat and causes further delays as the nervous participant contemplates the sudden loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars. My suspicion is that the possibility of a sudden disaster is the show's topmost appeal. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the whole process has slowed down even more by a lot of empty junk between host William Shatner and his competitor along with the occasional routines of the caged dancers. All these delays are burning up so much time that it may be possible for the audience to forget what the original question is when the correct answer is revealed. <br /> <br /> A typical 30-minute episode of JEOPARDY often comes through as many as 60 questions. The first 30 minutes of the SMTM, which I looked at, came through only six questions (many of which concerned other TV shows). No one in his right mind would see this show because it is fun to play together by answering the questions at home. It leaves three possible reasons to see the show. <br /> <br /> A. To see how a participant responds to being on the brink of winning as much as one million dollars, only to lose everything in one stroke. <br /> <br /> B. Looking at beautiful young women performing sexually suggestive dance routines. <br /> <br /> C. To enjoy William Shatner's scintillating banter. <br /> <br /> My choice is "B", but the women are not enough on the camera to justify suffering through an hour of this show.
