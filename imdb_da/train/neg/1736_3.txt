Let me start by saying that I used to really like Betty Grable, especially from the "Down Argentine Way", but when she came around for this disaster, she also had "round" and honestly the whole movie was a shame. Costarred with Douglas Fairbanks JNr (who must have been quite desperate) the story was bad, the colors good and the movie too long. It had some of the old standbys in it like Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner trying to stimulate interest but without success. The music score was miserable and I have to say that not a tune was memorable in any way .... as I was such a fan of Miss Grable, I always wish I had never seen this one!
