This movie seems to be completely meaningless. There is no reason why everything that happens in it happens as if it was written by a young child who is bored halfway and thought "how can I unpack it?" And what did Jared Harris and Christopher Walken think of? Did they do that for a bet? I couldn't tell you, I'm not quite sure there is one that is quite honest, but if it is, it didn't register. Jared and his bird go to Ireland after she falls down the stairs as they lash up as you do. They go to a house with a very annoying little girl in it, meets Christopher Walken, who has dug up an old wife who is kept in peat. He brings her back to life for no other reason than it continues the story, and she shows her gratitude by immediately beating him. From then on it will be a little stupid. A few hours in my life that I would like to return!
