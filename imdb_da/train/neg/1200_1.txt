VERY boring, obvious, boring Exorcist rip-off with a Doberman with red eyes - that's the scale of the special effects in this made-for-TV cheapie. Richard Crenna is as animated as a chew hunt. Very 70s dress and music only adds torture. Must put you to bed almost as fast as "The Corpse Vanishes" or "The Blue Hand". Virtually worthless. MooCow says eaghhh what a smelly dog! : = 8P
