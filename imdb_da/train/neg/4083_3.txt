I watched this movie when it was released, and my disturbance for it has attached to me all these years. <br /> <br /> Here's why: <br /> <br /> Greenway's goal seems to be to take any literary image in Tempest and do it literally. If a sign were to say "my heart is flying," we would be shown a genuine human heart, with doves wings attached, flapping over the screen. <br /> <br /> This process gives some lush taboos, but in the end it is a light exercise. And it gets deadly boring. <br /> <br /> I don't bury the pleasure other viewers have found in this movie, but it's worth knowing that not everyone in the audience was enraptured.
