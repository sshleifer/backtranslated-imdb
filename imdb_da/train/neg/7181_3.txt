Now I am not mistaken, I enjoy Christmas movies. I love it a wonderful life, and I really enjoy the versions of a julecol with george c. Scott and alistair sim. But this movie is horrible. I think I love life singing the ghost of Christmas singing is especially painful. albert finney sings pretty well in annie. I don't know what's wrong with him in this movie, but it sounds like someone is trying to sing through a mouthful of dead gerbils. The only thing that saved this movie for us was to turn off the sound and watch the dance songs accompanied by the Southern Park Christmas CD.
