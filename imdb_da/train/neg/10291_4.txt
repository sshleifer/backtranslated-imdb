80 minutes, and it felt twice as long! Short crossing is not short enough. In fact, the first 50 minutes consist almost entirely of a dialogue (more of a monologue really) of a woman approaching the Middle Ages, boring drone about "men", disappointment, sex, aging and her recent breakup to a French teenager she met in the ship's cafeteria. <br /> <br /> The boring monologue continues as they go to a duty-free store and to a bar where finally her self-catering runner pushes him away. "The story" cannot end there, of course, so she persuades him to listen to his drone more when she brings him to her cabin. What a little romance, sex or for that matter, all in all, this movie besides bitter rantings is hardly enough to justify the price of a rental unless you are one of those who love dramas where nothing interesting happens at all. Yes, the end is very nicely finished, but it is little reward to submit to yourself what is equivalent to making your living room a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic glow. Of course, some people may like it. I could be wrong.
