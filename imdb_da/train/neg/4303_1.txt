Previous comment made me write this. It says that Muslims are blonde and Serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed). This comment just says that this statement can be made by the racist. Look, race is nothing. I am color blind. I look like Pierce Brosnan, but I'm not Irish. So what? I can add that I'm not 100% Serbian, I have some Austrian and Croatian blood in me, but what's the point. I'm dark, half-born? Is that so? Anyone who uses racial prejudices with such bad intent as Lantos (producer and director is racist to me. Karadzhic, Izetbegovich, Milosevic, Tudjman, they are all monsters, and I blame them for destroying my life, my family, my country, Yugoslavia, Hope they will be All in Hell, but it will not return to our dead relatives, I am proud to be Serbian, and I am proud of my cousins, Austrians, Croats, Muslims, Hungarians, Arabs (yes I is from Serbia and I have a multi-ethnic family.) This film does not show the suffering of Serbs or Croats in Sarayevo, terrible terrorism of street bands, Muslim extremism. I add: I kneel and pray for all innocent sisters and brothers Muslim, Catholic or Orthodox, killed This film is manipulation of our misery, false humanitarianism, which does not help at all, it helps Lantos fill his pockets with more DIY, okay!
