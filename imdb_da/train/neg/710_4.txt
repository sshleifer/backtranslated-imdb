I read Rice's novel with interest and became quite enchanted with her characters and heartbreaking history based on historical truths. But I was simply APPALLED by this disastrous adaptation. The castings were based solely on physical appearance and not merchanting talent (with the obvious exception of Peter Gallagher, who was neither blonde-haired nor could get out of a wet paper bag). The cast is embarrassingly clumsy and inconsistent attempts to influence a French accent were fun but not in an entertaining way. I found myself waving through this dull and melodramatic trip tree and was surprised that I made it to the end. A warning to the novel's fans - stay away from this.
