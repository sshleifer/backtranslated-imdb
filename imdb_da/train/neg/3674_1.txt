Note: I want to reveal a key part of the plot, but if you have looked at the DVD cover or promotional material, you already know it. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be written by an eleven year old who is not very bright and was probably very tired when he wrote it. The author does not know the difference between a chemical and an organism. <br /> <br /> Forget the fact that the UN and NSA appear to be running the show in Hungary. Forget the fact that when these gentlemen intelligence agents go after a person whose mere contact will kill you in a moment, they do not wear protective equipment (not even gloves). These are quibbles associated with this movie. In the scientific world in this story, 2 + 2 = 6.34 and gravity sideways. The fact is that the people in this movie do not (with a few exceptions) behave as man behaves. Almost every time a sign responds to something, it is inappropriate. The love story (of course there is one) makes the soap opera scripts like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I can't believe we wasted a free movie rental on this thing.
