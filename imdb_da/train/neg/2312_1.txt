This is one of those movies where I could wish I had just been in the bar. <br /> <br /> The movie is frankly boring. Which story is, is very flimsy, and you should basically guess it. The film greets itself with pretentious camera techniques that seem to have the purpose of causing migraines and making it look like a student movie. Did I say it was boring already? If all the characters suddenly died at the end of the movie, I would not have cared less because I had no emotional attachment to any of them. <br /> <br /> There are about 4 good minutes in this movie, but it was about it. This is the first time I've ever considered going out of a movie theater during a show, but I kept believing it might get better. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> What movie you could threaten creepy kids with.
