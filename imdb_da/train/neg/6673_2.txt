My first clue as to how bad this should be was when the video box said it was from the people who brought us the Blair Witch Project, which was a masterpiece to this piece of waste. The action was on the caliber of a 6th grade production of Oklahoma and the plot, as it was, is predictable, boring and inane. 85% of the script is four words and numerous variations on them. Mother F seems to be the "author's" favorite because it is constantly used. It must have taken every 10 minutes to write this script in some dives at last call. Thank goodness I rented it and could jump through most of it quickly. Don't waste your time or money with this.
