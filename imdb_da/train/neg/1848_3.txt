There are bad movies, so there are the movies that are so bad that they become almost art. This is one of those movies. My partner and I are still both kind of shocked you know, staring into space and boilers! You can tell that the people involved (I hope they changed their names to protect themselves) had a blast and they certainly weren't shy. I give this one out of ten just because of the gratuitous dirt and really bad effects. I laughed loudly for most of the movie, so I think you could say it showed me a good time. Beware of the viewer, the above words in no way interpret that this is a good movie because it is not. All I can say in my defense is that it was impossible to pass a movie with such a big title!
