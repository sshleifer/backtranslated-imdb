A note for you all budding authors: Examine this movie. If your dialog reads as the dialog box in this movie, you must shred your script and try again. <br /> <br /> I didn't have high expectations but was intrigued by the description that suggests there was a mystery at the Christmas Decorations Factory. The mystery is resolved very early, and the film becomes an equal romance. I almost stopped seeing it in 5 minutes, 10 minutes and at the first break. My spouse, who is the Hallmark & ​​Lifetime fan, gave up at the first break. <br /> <br /> The Forest River is a business town - the main business is Aiken's Ornaments, who make all kinds of holiday decorations. The patriarch of the company has recently gone away, so the future of businesses can be in the question. We will soon meet Noelle, who would rather be on Wall Street than Main Street, and the mysterious Justin who gets a date with Noelle after a big snow white jumps into Justin's car. When we have met Alison Aikens, we have great care for the board. We have our history set up. <br /> <br /> If you can't nail all the arches of history at the first commercial break, you haven't seen enough of this kind of Holiday movie. Maybe it's a good thing.
