Oh dear sir. This movie ... It was terrible. I'm a big fan of horror movies. And mostly horror movies say others that they are bad, I like. The actor who played "Scarecrow" was great, I want to say. But this plot was terrible. It made no sense! It had far too much fun and an unnecessary (and outrageous) sex scene in the beginning. I think the director was trying to be "shocking" or whatnot, but it just came out terribly. To add to the pile of festering crap they called a plot, the actors (besides "scarecrow") we are awful, and I cared so little about them that I soon forgot who was who. Eventually, this movie made me sick. If you can avoid watching this movie anyway, do it.
