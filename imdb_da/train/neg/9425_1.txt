Has anyone edited this movie? Or was it just the DVD release that had huge thirty second holes between scenes? It's OK, even though I fell asleep, I saw it for the first time. Then I fell asleep the second time and the third time. The reason is actually not the worst I've seen, but it's close. The action is not the worst I've seen either ... but it's close. The production .... Now I can honestly say it was the worst I had ever seen in my life! Not trying to be annoying, but Unhinged could have used more production. <br /> <br /> Please don't think I am a horror movie herd or even I didn't like this movie. I just felt that I was laughing much more at the movie than I felt I was laughing with it. The cruel moments were not too poorly finished, but could have been done better, even with a brilliant budget. Signs seemed scary developed, or ignored everyone, the twist ending was pretty bad, and the exhibition took forever without much. <br /> <br /> I would recommend avoiding this movie. <br /> <br /> 1/10
