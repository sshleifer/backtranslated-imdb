If this movie were worse, it would have been directed by Uwe Boll. This obscene mess makes Ed Wood look like Hitchcock. It's been a while since I've seen this steaming pile, but I remember wishing to do serious bodily harm to everyone involved. How anyone can give this movie more than 1 star amaze me to the kindness of all those who saw this tripe. I give it a star because there is no rating lower. All copies of this film must be burned, the soil wound with salt and reserved as a landfill for the most toxic waste. No, a copy must be kept under ultra hi-security and shown only to filmmakers as an example of how not to do so.
