I was excited to see a Catalu√±a movie in Berlin's competition. But after the presentation I was totally disappointed and furious. Too much blood, too much time, too many themes for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like any war, was horrible. Revenge, a very human behavior, not quite at all, appears in countless films and drama, as well as the relationship between gay and skepticism in Spain about Catholicism. But what Mr Villaronga is trying to do is a pseudo-tragedy that may belong to the worst of the film's history. It's really a shame to see Angela Molina in this movie. I do not recommend anyone under any circumstances to go to watch this movie.
