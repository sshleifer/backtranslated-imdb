I'm a bit of a fan of Lynches work, so I was excited when I found this DVD. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. It is a series of short cartoons that try to show a disturbing and disgusting kind of humor. The animation is very raw, no doubt done with Macromedia. Each cartoon has a big, fat guy who knocks his family up and generally seems like a dunk to everyone he knows. <br /> <br /> For those who are not familiar with this animation era, they will probably be impressed by it. But if you've spent a lot of time at Newgrounds.com, like me, these cartoons won't be any different from any of the other things you've seen before. Many of the popular amateur artists at Newgrounds do much better work than what was shown on this DVD. If Lynch submitted this work to the site, he would blend in perfectly with some of Newground's artists. But when I saw this on DVD, rather than on Newgrounds, I give it a 4/10, instead of a 7/10 that I would otherwise have. These cartoons fit the internet, but with a name like David Lynch on that, I expected better quality both in history and in animation.
