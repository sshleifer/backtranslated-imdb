Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular is just boggling the mind. This show is not fun, it's not wise, it's not original, it's just a steaming pile of bull crap. Let me start with the characters. The characters are all one-dimensional morons with highly exaggerated voices that just sound like nails on a blackboard. The voice action could have been better. Then there is the animation. My God, it hurts my eyes and just looks at it. Everything is too flat, too pointy, too bright and also candy coated. Then there is humor or lack of it. It's totally idiotic! They just take those B-grade jokes that aren't even fun at first and then repeat them to death. They also throw in some senseless potty humor that sickens me. And finally, last and least, the music. It is simply annoying. It sounds like it was composed on a child's computer and doesn't generate any emotions at all. I wish there was a score lower than 1, I really do. This show must be seriously canceled. It's a show I'm trying to avoid like the plague. When I hear the theme song, I immediately switch off the television. If you've never seen this show then don't do it. Watch quality programming like The Simpsons or Futurama.
