Let's be honest here: The only reason anyone bought this, the only reason anyone went through this, and the only reason someone could claim to enjoy this is because David Lynch did it and because you want to have David Lynch's children. But guess what? Even David Lynch can produce a piece of shit. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Lynch wanted to exceed normality and experience the absurdity in itself as a purely professional. Perhaps the horrible cacophonist sounds, and chicken brabble visuals have to involve something about the place of humanity in the world, our relationship with the real, the absurdity of it all. <br /> <br /> Instead, just saying one thing to me: I just lost $ 20. <br /> <br /> If I wanted offensive offensive, I could swing Hansen high and leave me ear soft. If I were to be absurd for absurd, I could just take a dump on a plate and see it for 33 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is a single redeeming quality for Dumbland - it's meta, meta funny. It's so bad that it's not even fun because it's so bad. However, this fact is a little fun. <br /> <br /> If you hate yourself and hate your money, buy Dumbland. If not, save yourself the pain.
