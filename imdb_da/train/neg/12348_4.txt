This movie is much like "Flashdance", you know that dance flick with Jennifer Beals. That movie is probably the most boring movie I've ever seen, as it's not even bad enough to be fun. "G.I. Jane" is much better than that movie, but it doesn't say much. Here, Demi Moore swims a lot and there is loud music and we'll see her fight and everything, but it's certainly not very engaging. I really think the idea behind the movie is a bit interesting, but the script is too clich√©d and Ridley Scott can't do anything about it. Well, as I said ... It's better than "Flashdance" ... (4/10)
