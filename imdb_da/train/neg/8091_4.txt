(This is an overview of Disney's later English release with Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart and co.) I really wanted this movie to be good. Really, really. I'm a big fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this former Miyazaki movie, I was eager to see it. But I was shocked, shocked, I say, on the quality of this movie. These later movies boast well-made plots, three-dimensional characters and the best movie music ever since ... well ... ever. This movie just doesn't come close. <br /> <br /> Well start with the positive aspects. Like all Miyazaki films, this is still very imaginative, with a bizarre fantasy / sci-fi setting, in a post-apocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species. Nausicaa also boasts some far superior animation for other movies from his time. (though not as beautiful and fluent as Miyazaki's later film) And the English voice dealer is quite well done. <br /> <br /> But this movie ... just ... is not ... good ... The characters are all papers - from saccharin sweet little Nausicaa, to the ruthless evil Tolmekies, to everyone. Once you've seen each of them for 30 seconds, you've seen everything there. And the fact that the plot just fits together doesn't help. <br /> <br /> Then there's the music ... Now Hisaichi hands down my favorite movie composer, but Nausicaa doesn't make him justice. Half of the music is the 80's keyboards of exaggeration, and it goes normal and leaves so suddenly that it distracts the visions rather than helping them. I suppose Hisaichi was told to compose a lot of music before he even saw the picture. <br /> <br /> But wait! There's a big message with this movie, right?! Let's all save the environment! Difficult that this movie hits you over the head with it as a sledge hammer. There is a scene where Nausicaa hugs a tree. No really. I'm not kidding. <br /> <br /> It makes me a little sorry to talk about how lame this movie is. But for some reason, all the other reviews on IMDb seem to adorn it. And when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell what's going on, it's lame. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of person who grows anime, enjoys 80's music and plants a tree every Arbor day you will probably like this movie. Otherwise, save your money for his later movie, because they rock great time.
