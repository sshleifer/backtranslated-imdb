This movie has no plot and no focus. Yes, it must be a slap-stick, stupid comedy, but the screen writers have no idea what the movie was about. Even the title does not coincide with the film. It should have been called "Cool Ethan" or "Cheaters Never Win" or something like that. The characters are not developed and no one cares about what happens to them! The girl's roommate character (from That 70's Show) was the only person worth seeing. She was fun and stole all the scenes she was in. The others have to make sure their own diplomas are in the works, as they will need a different career than performing.
