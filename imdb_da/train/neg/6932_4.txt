I've been waiting a long time to see DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON, and after I saw it, I was really disappointed with it. It's not the baroque movie I expected to be. The trailer (which I saw on a somewhat strange DVD) is much better than the whole movie, which is remarkably forgettable. There are almost no sharp scenes in it, and the look is interesting, but it doesn't even come close to other Baroque-style films out there, from Fellini or Jodorowsky. The signs are boring, and there is almost nothing dramatic going on, even though we see rape, crucifixion, insanity, etc. <br /> <br /> The main problem with DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON was the fact that it was the talk - more than anything else. It was almost like seeing a book. I just wanted the movie to have moments of silence or mood or something, instead we see / listen to the protagonists chit-chat endlessly about boring things. <br /> <br /> A missed opportunity.
