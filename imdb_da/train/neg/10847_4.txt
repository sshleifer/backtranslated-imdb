The director cut the version which was the one I saw was very long for this type of movie. Almost two hours are too long. If you have the choice, you should definitely go to the non-executive crew. <br /> <br /> The main plot is barely taken up, the film is made up of the majority of multiple murder scenes that are connected, but the feeling is that they are only shown to fill the movie with splatterish violence. The connection was not revealed until the latter and the lack of context bored long before I was there. Like a horror movie, it doesn't work. You never get the necessary feelings for the signs because of mediocre action and the general disposition (character is presented, 15 minutes later the character is dead). This pictures strong side is located in the splatter section.
