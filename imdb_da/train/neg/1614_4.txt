The second half of Steven Soderbergh's revolutionary biography on Che Guevara deals with his last campaign to export the revolution to Bolivia. To maintain his saintly visage of Che Soderbergh, the frogs he pursued after the revolution in Cuba and the stupid of his Congo adventure ("This is the story of a failure", he writes in the foreground to his Congo Journal) are concentrating fully out of Che's attempt to gather support to rise up against the government of Bolivia. It would turn out to be a disaster and Guevara's final act. <br /> <br /> What plagued the first chapter follows here as Soderbergh lowers his film into a creep to study the apprehensive face of the contemplative Guevara, which is again played as James Dean in the east of Eden by Bernicio Del Toro. The problem is that Guevara has been successful in winning converts, and he quickly finds himself and his starving companions are swallowed up in the heart of the dark Bolivian Jungle. Unlike Werner Herzog in the magnificent Aguirre, the wrath of God fails Soderbergh to exploit the jungle's metaphorical possibilities to increase the guerrilla desperation. He seems more concerned about keeping Che's nimbus over his head than exploring the panic setting in the dead. There is a Herzogian moment where Che is sitting with a hard horse, kicking and screaming to make it move, but overall Soderbergh's mise scene remains flat, dull and uninteresting. <br /> <br /> In both his films, Soderbergh shows that he is obviously a Che groupie, and because of that his focus remains myopic and narrow. He spends too much time building his monument for Che and too little developing his relationships with key actors in his story, especially Fidel Castro. Worse, do it with a slow and eerie approach that never gets on fire. One would think he was imbued with enough Eisenstein and Vertov to realize that sweeping change has been shown much better with sweeping style.
