I wake up suddenly, aware that I'm throwing myself on the plastic cover, and realizing it's a warm Saturday afternoon. Why did I sleep? Did I hit my head or swallow all my grandmother's muscle relaxants? Can it be adult onset narcolepsy? <br /> <br /> No, I immediately stopped on cheap seats while browsing the web, and the amazing lack of humor and talent drained my vitality with the speed I answered. <br /> <br /> That's the main shake, mouth-agape, shoulder-shrugging bad. But I have to give these moronic and boring twins credit to sell this idea through. Perhaps they had the same effect on the ESPN programming director that they were wearing me, and when he / she woke up, there were already some terrible episodes in the can, and he hoped that since all the viewers were asleep, no one is going to be how terrible That is, and he / she can keep the annual salary of $ 425,000. <br /> <br /> You have been warned.
