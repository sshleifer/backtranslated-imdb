All the harsh women in the world couldn't keep me from pushing the stop button about a third of the way through this awful rubbish. With the secret play, just as horrible script plus the poor CGI FX to match; This movie is an insult to the werewolf genre. It must be serious, which in itself would be fun if this movie could even make it to the level of being a bad joke. <br /> <br /> This is one of those films where the people behind the camera are of course competent, but are too lazy to do anything even a quarter decent. Avoid at all costs and watch one of the classic Werewolf movies instead. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10!
