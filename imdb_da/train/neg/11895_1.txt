Oh my God, what the hell happened here? I don't want to say it again, but what kind of reverse movie is this? The headline in this is the way that is worst than duplication in "King Kong vs Godzilla" and Linda Miller had to be the worst actress in it, and the costumes are really cheesy. It's about some villain called Dr.Who who gets henchmen to build a robot gorilla that has the same strength as King Kong, but when this robot breaks down he builds another and then tries to kidnap Kong. When he does (that's when Linda Miller gets annoying), he makes King his slave, but everything goes wrong, and King Kong escapes. Then, who sends the robot after him. Later when I watched the movie, I got a headache when Linda Miller and the other clowns began to moan. As I sat through the misery of watching the DVD while I was playing, I was hoping that the madness of the movie would end until the fight. The end must be a really bad one because they could have shown King back on his island and fight dinosaurs again. <br /> Don't watch the movie under any circumstances or if you do ... beware of the tray you want to receive.
