The biggest thing that fails hell out of me is that they say Zues takes DUTCH commands. But she speaks to him German. The 2 languishes are completely different, it's like saying "well he takes French commands" and starts speaking Spanish. <br /> <br /> James Belushi gives the feeling of being a comedy actor, not a detective at least. The role just doesn't fit him, even if it's a comedy. <br /> <br /> For many stereotypical / predictable things. Typical comment or comebacks. <br /> <br /> If you don't look at the things I think it might be a good movie to see if it's ever on TV. But I wouldn't suggest renting it.
