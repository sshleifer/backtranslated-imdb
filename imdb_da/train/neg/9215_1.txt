Checks the spoiler warning just in case. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen Mazes and Monsters felt like I was wasting 101 minutes in my life. The only redeeming quality of the movie was scenes that were trying to be serious, but just ended up being fun as they were so bad. Evil dead somebody? Unfortunately, M & M (fortunately for us) did not develop a sense of culture and resulted in a trilogy. This movie attempted to solve a number of problems that the protagonist Robbie (played by Hanks) encountered throughout the movie. It ended up being a horrible mongering video about stereotypes that helped burn D&D is the devil's movement in the 80s. <br /> <br /> To avoid wasting your time and money, remove this junk. /> <br /> PS - Although the cover looks a bit interesting why I suppose my brother bought it, it is by no means happening in an imaginative unless you consider New England or New York City to be such a place .
