I love to see early color films - you think the 40s clothes were not all gray? <br /> <br /> Margaret Rutherford dominates this movie. Her "eccentric" yarn is actually quite attractive and yes, she has an amazing hourglass figure. But I feel that she was given the head a little too much. She probably developed this characterization over many notions, and no one told her: "If it gets laughing, let it be." She makes too much horror when she has to be down to earth. Madame Arcati's joke is that the media was usually portrayed as wispy women in long drapes. Arcati behaves like a retired chief champion (we really put our back on it!). The contrast between her soft, ordinary way and her crazy belief is not really brought out. Just because all the actors are English (except for Cummings), the Americans feel they must use the words "Brit", "Stiff", "Lip" and "Upper". Oh, give it a break! The three main characters lose their temper all the time and make risqu√© remarks (Has he loved you? Yes, but very discreet - he was in the cavalry!).
