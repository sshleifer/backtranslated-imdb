This movie is one of the worst of the year. The main characters have no chemistry and the play is terrible. Paul Rudd is the only one who has any talent and the only one who is not annoying. I've never seen Desparte Housewives, so I don't know how Eva Longoria is at that show, but in this movie she was horrible. It's like she doesn't know anything about acting. All his character does is whine the whole movie and she can't withdraw from being a b **** and still be entertaining. And the other girl, Lake Bell, shows little emotion, and it's like looking at the cue cards as she reads them. <br /> <br /> As far as history is concerned, it is so biscuits. It goes from point A to B with a little surprise. So much more could have been used with Kate as a ghost. The reason should have been more about her and the things she does as a spirit. FINALLY WORTH: It's not worth seeing.
