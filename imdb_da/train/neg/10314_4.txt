As one who likes chase scenes and was truly fascinated by this fascinating true life's story, I was optimistic about entering this movie, but too many obstacles got in the way of the good story it should have been. <br /> <br /> BAD - I'm a fan of Robert Duvall and many of the characters he has played, but his role here is a boring as an insurance scientist. The dialogue is insipid and the beautiful Kathryn Harrold is genuine garbage dog. From what I read there were several directors who replaced each other on this movie and that is too bad. You can tell that things don't match the story. I couldn't get "involved" with Treat Williams' portrait of Cooper either. He should have been fascinating, but he was not in this movie. It is also a bit of a sad comment that a guy commits a crime is a kind of "people's hero", but I admit that I also run out to be the guy. <br /> <br /> Not everything was disappointing. I can't complain about nature, from the lush green forests of Oregon to the desert in Arizona. <br /> <br /> I want to see this movie restored and done better because it's a one-of-a-kind story.
