I gave this movie only 2 stars because Dominic Monaghan actually puts in action in his play. Everything else about this movie is extremely amateur. Everything related to the direction of this movie was very poorly executed. Not only should the director reconsider what she is doing for a life career, but perhaps she should see a few movies. As Dominic Monaghan is a very credible actor, he puts him in a movie of this caliber making him look terribly. Where the "actor" played Jack's best friend should never have penetrated the camera. I don't expect much from such a small movie, but maybe a little more time and effort will come in the characters and their surroundings. Don't waste your time or money on this movie (as I did), you will be very disappointed.
