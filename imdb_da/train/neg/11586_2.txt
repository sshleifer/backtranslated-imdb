A nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. There is no escape. I love the series and I think Freddy is probably the best character ever in horror movies. But even though I'm a fan, I can't help but see that this movie is mediocre. There is not even an effort to build an interesting story and strong figures. Now they had just given up. They don't even try. They are of course the production and hope for a few more light dollars. The story does not take your attention. It's so simple, it's almost absent. <br /> <br /> Alice, a survivor from Part 4, is now pregnant. Freddy comes back through the baby's dreams. In the beginning, we learn that to stop him, Alice must find her mother. And that's it. <br /> <br /> The story progresses slowly as there is such a small plot, which makes it pretty boring after a few minutes of bad dialogues and horrible actions. In fact, it's the only scary thing the play is, as the deaths aren't even cool. <br /> <br /> The characters are so uninteresting that we couldn't care less for them. The girls are as uninteresting as possible. The whole cast reminded me of a poor amateur theater group. I've seen better actors in school games. It's really embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wilcox still manages to bring some classes to this. She is beautiful, sexy and has some talent. But the material didn't let her shine. What a pity. <br /> <br /> Stephen Hopkins work is not close to Renny Harlin's brilliant direction in Dream Master. He tries some imaginative shots at the end, but the excitement that Harlin and Craven have created so well in the previous films is nowhere to be found. <br /> <br /> The Dream Child is just another imaginative sequel. It's the kind of movie that gives the horror series a bad name. <br /> <br /> The end to the once scary Freddy. It's too sad to see him now. A clown that is not fun. A bad joke. Goodbye Freddy.
