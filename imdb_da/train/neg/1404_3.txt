Arthur Askey's great comic book skill was as he communicated with his public. His juvenile jokes, stupid songs and deaf dances went down well because he was able to engage folk and draw them into his off-wall world. The lack of a live audience was a distinct disadvantage to him and he was never quite comfortable in movies. He has his moments in Ghost Train, and his character, Tommy Gander, has been tailored to make the most of his talents, but the Askey performer needed to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Askey's support for the movie is not strong; it includes regular co-star Richard Murdoch; Betty Jardine and Stuart Latham as a drowsy honeymoon couple; Linden Travers goes over the top like a 'sour woman'. Also on board is Peter Murray-Hill, who offscreen married Phyllis Calvert, as the nominal leading man who gives a totally bland reading of that part, and leading lady Carol Lynne, who turns into an equally incomplete performance. It's left to character actress Kathleen Harrison, who effortlessly steals the movie as a parrot, loving single woman who is being smashed on Dr. Morland Graham's brandy.
