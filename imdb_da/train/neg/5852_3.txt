Bradford Dillman plays a scientist waking up one morning in the midst of a bloody crime scene; having partial amnesia (or "global amnesia", as a sign claims to define as optional memory) finds the researcher a private detective in the phonebook hoping to resume his life together. Abhorrent concoction very loosely based on Walter Ericson's book "Fallen Angel" (filmed in 1965 as "Mirage" by Gregory Peck). It was enough for racy for television - what about drugs and hippies added to the mix - that NBC initially refused to fly it, which is how this low budget runs in theaters. Director James Goldstone becomes freaky with hyperkinetic images and camera tricks, while editor Edward A. Biery encounters zigzag cuts. Unfortunately, their colorful gimmicks cannot cover the weaknesses of this updated plot, and the spectacle is extremely overwhelmed. Dillman, under pressure to commemorate the events of that evening, goes through an actor's seminar on tics, tribes, noses, and crazy half-spits, spitting dialogue like: "Dream ... a dream ... drugs ... yes, drugs ... it sounds ... bells ... help! "As a vicious co-founder with a Cheshire Cat smile, Pat Hingle is almost up for Dillman in the Grand Thespian department by continually approaching everyone in baby talk that stretches like a middle-aged peacock and twists the mouth in pain. Hope Lange's scientist / love is interested in the short act, but not before she screams at indifferent girlfriend Dillman: "What shall I do, speak Ape Man? I want you!" This is a huge "Jigsaw"! * 1/2 from ****
