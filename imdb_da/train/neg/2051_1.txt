Since there was nothing wrong with the play, etc. Etc. Is the font for the episode completely free of this series of phantoms or no phantom. It was a waste of 42 minutes to see the martial man hunter. You should know that in the middle of 6. series no matter what is happening, it is not really what is going on and really does not bring to the story of the series, except that the martian jester again meets and wasting 30 minutes to do so is by far another case of bad writing in the soap opera in smallville . I really like the exhibition, but mainly because of the cast and the 3 or so good episodes every year, but which is ever on the written cast that works or is used to work on the soaps must be canned. This was by far the worst. With the first 4 minutes you know that what's going on is fake, and everything that happens is a dream based on Clark's influx of course caused by a phantom zone character, and when he wakes up he'll win and blah blah, then The authors do not have to really create a villain who will speed up the story line any this week. Perhaps also added another villain to die in the last episode, the martial man hunter was in and made him fly away again or come back and tell Clark he forgot about the sunglasses to look into this episode and call it one day.
