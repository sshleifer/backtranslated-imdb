I admit that I have grown old in the hippie diabetic, I am a sucker for these kind of movies. I can enjoy some of the ships of the hippie genre far more than most "normal" people. However, this movie is simply awful in every way possible. Every step of hippie silliness is presented as a gospel, the police killing a young long hair when he peacefully lands a plane. This movie is so horrible that it is not even fun to watch as a deaf man on the hippie drone's excesses. It's like a left-wing version of Dragnet, except without professional actors. The only reason I gave it two stars was because there were some ambiguities of interest on the soundtrack and I couldn't find a choice for negative stars either. No actors, almost no plot, sheeze, barely a script ... you have it, an "art" movie .... All this done by root canal slowing, pulling out every pointless scene just to fill the time. <br /> <br /> In a bizarre twist of life imitating art, the star's "nonactor" of the movie joined a real-life municipality and robbed a bank in Boston, one of his co-killers was killed, and he was sent to prison where he was killed in a suspicious weightlifting "accident" ..... and just thinking, he got to leave this as a legacy .... Oy vey.
