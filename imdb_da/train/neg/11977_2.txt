Roy Rogers and company are trying to bring "Sintown" back to life - it's a ghost town that can go boom, whose silver mining is successful. Andy Devine (like "Cookie") slapsticks around. Jane Frazee (like Carol) loses a piece of bitch to Mr. Rogers' sharp leather. Foy Willing and Riders of the Purple Sage stand-in (or is it sing-in?) For A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and the Pioneer's sons. James Finlayson (from Laurel and Hardy films) adds to the "slapstick" look of the "Grand Canyon Trail". A loose floorboard delivers the winning comedy performance. Mr. Devine's mule kicks his heels. There are also energetic human beliefs - but the material is not grand. <br /> <br /> ** Grand Canyon Trail (1948) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frazee and Andy Devine
