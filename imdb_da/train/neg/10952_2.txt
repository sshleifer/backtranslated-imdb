I hate how this movie has absolutely no creative input. I know they go to realism, but to be honest, I just don't want realism. Realism is boring. If I want to see the daily life, I will live. Tell me an interesting story and we talk. I can handle the low production values, hell, I'm a sucker for low production values, but at least work in some good ideas. The direction goes only as far as grabbing a video camera and moving around, but of course I have to dig it because it makes things so much more realistic. Hitchcock used to say drama was essentially life with the boring bits cut out. I can only conclude this is not drama, not with a long shot. We'll see Rosetta go to a place Rosetta works in a bakery, Rosetta eats a waffle, Rosetta wears around bags far, Rosetta goes home, Rosetta goes somewhere ... it's just not that entertaining. Nor is there a deeper meaning. I was so sad that I started looking for some reflections on life in this movie, but it's just pure realism, the most overrated quality in the industry. I suppose I should love this, but come on, there's nothing in there.
