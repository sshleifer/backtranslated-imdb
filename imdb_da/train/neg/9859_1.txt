This movie is just lame. A total waste of time and money. The jokes are predictable, the characters are so clich√©s, and the way they talk about RPG players is not fun either. The problem is, the authors do not seem to know how an RPG game works, and most importantly how to make jokes about this game. Of course, there are a lot of losers playing RPG as freaking retards and total tabers. But for me it is not the funniest way to make jokes about this game. History doesn't make any sense at all. Who cares how long a game will be played? The biggest problem in this movie is that the authors and actors did not even try to know what RPG should do about it. I'm ashamed to see this lama movie.
