Marilyn Miller made only three films before her incredible death - the wonderful SALLY (1929), the comedy HERE MAJESTY LOVE (1931) and this trifle - SUNNY (1930). It is quite poor both as an early talkie and as an attempt at a musical - even though she has four dance songs, she sings only two songs (WHO and ONE MAN ALONE). The rest of the score, including the spritely title tune is jettisoned, although we can hear the latter in the background scoring. Miller looks overweight and amateurish here - no star quality at all. Even her dance is cloutish. The film is very poorly written, stocked with outdated and unfunny jokes and stupid situations. If you are interested in Miller as a performer then you have to check it out, but for general entertainment, stay away.
