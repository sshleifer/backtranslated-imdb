For the life of me, I can't figure out why anyone would make a movie like this. The reason is tired, the play is tense, the language is consistently foul and sometimes the use of the "F" word as if missing dialogue was widespread, so let's throw in another pair of "Fs" for good measure, is what the American public wants to hear '. Gossett was particularly wild and seemed to enjoy his part. Forget about this c__p, rent Shrek and get a good laugh.
