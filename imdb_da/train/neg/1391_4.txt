Before this was made for television films, I had relatively low expectations. This is because it was made after the last episode of the series had aired, and many of the series' originals were gone. There is no President Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, Londo, Vir, G'kar or Lyta. If you remember, the most common series of all the fixed ones, except Zack, Vir and Captain Lockley, were B-5 permanently. Now for this movie they took back Garibaldi (who was not in the last B-5 movie) to come with Zack and the Captain and the Doctor makes a short and irrelevant appearance. But because so much is away from the old chemistry, this film is already severely handicapped. <br /> <br /> The film is about a Soul Hunter (Martin Sheen) who is taken to Babylon 5 in search of a globe filled with souls stolen from a hidden archive by an archaeologist (Ian McShane). A lot of ghostly mumbo-jumbo things arise, but honestly it was all pretty silly and meaningless. Yes, yes the station almost blew up, but was rescued and everything, but frankly I felt like it was the case with "having done it - and made it much better in the past". <br /> <br /> The secondary plot that was more for comic relief was much more interesting as an entrepreneur installed a holo-brothel and the commands that were not sure what to do with it, and when they tried to push them to close, they were beaten with a lawsuit. This was fluff, but it gave a couple of laughs - something the other bad plot was definitely missing. <br /> <br /> Initially, Sheen did a good job of playing The Hunter - with her wild eyes and bizarre supplies. But repeatedly throughout the episode, he fell out of character. This should have been seen and corrected. <br /> <br /> So the final verdict is that this only applies to total die-hard B-5 nuts (like myself). Others see it might assume the series sucked - which is a great injustice. This is a good example of a show that does not know when to finish.
