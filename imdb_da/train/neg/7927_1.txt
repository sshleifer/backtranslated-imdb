This movie is AWESOME. I saw it today with my cousin Jay-Jay. He said it was okay, but I think it's RULEZZZ! I mean, it's so cool. Ted V. Mikels is so brave and smart. He made a movie completely unlike the horrible Hollywood movies that Matrix and Stop or my mom will shoot. However, it could have been better. I like ninjas and pirates. I also like the great talon that the funny man wears. I think he's the coolest guy since the Domino Pizza Claymation guy. Not only does this movie look really cool, like the out-of-focus movies my father made on my birthday when I became 6. Without it, a complex narrative with dozens of signs that seem to be completely independent tells them meet everyone at last. It is genius how this web is woven to make everything come together. I wish Ted V. Mikels would make a successor. But it needs more foreigners. And a pirate.
