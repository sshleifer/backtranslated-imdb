Absolutely an odd debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, an alcoholic family man whose life crumbles around him. Cecil takes a phone book, sees the name of a preacher and calls him in the middle of the night. He goes to the preacher's home and discusses his problems. The priest teaches Cecil to respect the word of God and have Jesus in his heart. It does everything better. Ahh ... if only everything in life was so easy. The fact that this "movie" looks like it was made with about $ 500 certainly doesn't help. 1.10
