This is the worst possible crap. H. Rider Haggard's novel is very entertaining and dramatic. The authors of this worthless movie do not follow it closely. Well, old novels are not sacred, and making free versions of them is fine with me if you have ideas about one's own. If all you can do is change things and replace them with uninteresting and emigrated clich√©s, stick to the original. If they had done so, this movie would have been at least twice as good even with worse actors and if filmed inside a studio with cabins made of cardboard. There is no imagination at all only fatigue. This should only be purchased or monitored by collectors of Victorian novels made for film. <br /> <br /> Just a tip and not a spoiler, I think those of you who have read the novel understand what has happened and what to expect if you decide to watch this TV or - God forbid - waste money on buying this. Gagool an old baddie witch in the book and some precursors to Gollum have been transformed into a lovely gal!
