This movie is a good example of how even some very funny jokes can go terribly wrong. I really expected at least something from this movie after seeing the add-on which was fun as hell, but the movie wasn't half as good. The weird part is that the jokes are actually fun, spoofs of smoking bans, Jo Bole ... etc are really good jokes, but I don't know who to blame this movie flop on. The primary candidates may be: - 1) The Hammer (actors) and the hammeresses (actresses) and not even the funny kind 2) The Director 3) The guy who threw the actors and / or the director Anyway, if you really are bored and I Really think watching this movie or else getting a copy of every ad or teaser of this movie and laughing your ass because they will be far more fun than the movie. <br /> <br /> ps the only saving grace of this movie is mahesh men and the funny chappu bhai
