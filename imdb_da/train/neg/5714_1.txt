I've seen many good Korean movies, including thrillers and movies with darker overtones, but this one sucks. The director seems to be a sadist who happened to get someone to produce some junk. The movie lacks any entertainment value and is not even a thriller. I can't believe anyone really made such a movie. Although the plot is ok, the story and the feeling of it is horrible. <br /> <br /> I'm sure I won't see any movies from this director. No sense of filmmaking and complete disappointment in having thrill moments. All this has to show scenes with psychopaths wasting the wheels with badly shot scenes and showing more blood and rains that make it exciting. Very disappointing movie, and I strongly recommend skipping all movies of this kind.
