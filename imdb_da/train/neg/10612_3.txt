Wow, what a good premise for a movie: Put it around a film producer with the author's block, who decides to take tango lessons. Hi and what an even better idea is the central role of a film producer interested in tango. Gosh, I wish I had that talent for genius. Yes, I'm sarcastic. <br /> <br /> It amazes me that this type of zero potential for making money films is made. Join me unless you are a rabid tango fan (I admit that they exist, judge by the comments) or a mortal member of the Sally Potter fan club (?) Is there nothing in this movie that makes you hurry up the cinema can see it. Even though you are in tango, much of the movie is taken up with meaningless scenes like a house that is being renovated or a man in a wheelchair walking along a road. <br /> <br /> Coming soon REVIEW LESSON where a failed screenwriter from Scotland sits in front of a computer that writes very sarcastic but very entertaining film reviews he sees. Gossip in shock when Theo Robertson puts the boot in the latest Hollywood blockbusters, crying in sympathy as he gets another bulletin board from a movie company, falls in the mood when he takes a bath and rubs soap over his well-heeled body. REVIEW LESSON will soon come to a cinema near you if someone is stupid enough to fund the movie <br /> <br /> PS Sally Potter is not related to Harry Potter
