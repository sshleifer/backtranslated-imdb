Imitating its long title, the film finds opportunities to get close to the 90's. The beautiful sets are here with everything that made Hamer's production values ​​a trademark, but Paris drowned in the fog is a sign of indolent neglect. The story is obvious and can be summed up in a dozen words, so nothing comes unexpectedly and nothing worth more than 5% of your attention is expected. <br /> <br /> The management is heavy as a direct transfer from stage games, actors are mostly stiff as wax figures (ok this is a Hamer feature, it's only sometimes better with the whole package). My conclusion: This movie is garbage bin, not worth the time I spend that night. The eternal life is a dull question, and I should have hoped that the men responsible for programming at Cinemathèque would have known better.
