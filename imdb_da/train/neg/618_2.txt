Maybe one of the worst teen slasher movies I've ever seen. I start with the bad points in the movie that largely covers the whole movie. First of all, something nobody can avoid: AWFUL ACTIVITY. I swear they brought some random children out of the street based on how they looked. Second, BAD / UNCONVINCING CHARACTER WORK / DEVELOPMENT. You know almost half of the children killed here. All you expect is that they deserved it somehow. Scarecrow's character was overdone, and a cheap rip-off of the other great fantasy killers like Freddy or Pinhead. Next: BAD DIALOG: The scarecrow was full of horrible lineages that would make you laugh because it was so terrible. Lines like "Let's find some small animals for torture!" Really just leaves you with an eyebrow erect. Last but not least: Next out: BAD CASTING. How old was the guy who played Lester? Like 30? The back of his head was balding for God's sake. There is much more I could say about this movie, just as it is cheap special effects, it is "high school movie class" effort, but the point is understood. It's just bad movie to make the worst. What I thought to be "good" in the movie: -Measurable for those with low, low, LOW standards -Would help put insomniacs to sleep. -A very cheap laugh, or even a giggle.
