I watched this movie at a Sneak Preview screening, and I'm glad I didn't pay for it. This movie is just disgusting. Its full of dick and speed jokes and is not proud of the action sequences (eg the shootout in "Little Germany"). I made a small list of things I enjoyed in the movie .. and much I didn't agree with. <br /> <br /> 1. Dave Foley's penis. 2. The joke jokes. 3. The Poop jokes. 4. Dude was a pussy. 5. No Gary Coleman. 6. Taliban 7. Resuscitation of Bush .. We get it, he's an idiot .. Continue. 8. Dude has blond hair. 9. The plot. 10. Killing of minors 11. Uwe Boll was in it. 12. Most of the cast were just furious and out there. <br /> <br /> Now the (few) good <br /> <br /> 1. Dude uses a cat as silencer as in the game. 2. Lots of action. 3. Crotchy made a return (and a como from Posten's maker) 4. Uhm .. I didn't have to pay for it. 5. There are a few "what the ef" moments <br /> <br /> Ball did it again. He made another crappy game in movie adaptation. Kudos to you, Mr. Boll. 2.10
