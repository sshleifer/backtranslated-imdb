I can't say enough bad things about this train wreck. It's one of the few movies I've ever been tempted to go out of. It was a bad premise to start with, first pregnant man, but then they tried to make it a spoof. What did they tell all the right pregnant men ??? This was the worst movie I've ever seen. If it had enough votes, it would be on IMDB bottom 100. If it were possible to give it a zero I would, and I would still feel that I had given it too much credit.
