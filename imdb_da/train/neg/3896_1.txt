Well. Astronaut Steve West sits in a plastic space capsule commenting that "you have not lived before you have seen the sun through Saturn's rings" while the obvious mid-light sunlight flows through the window as he suddenly has a nosebleed. Then West is home to a secret hospital, a melting gelatinous mass that goes crazy and causes a large nurse to run through a false glass door. Apparently, West becomes "stronger as he melts", giving almost as much meaning as anything in this hopelessly purile, adle-brained moovie. Then this dopey "Army Brass", which looks like Coleman Francis (director of many bad moovies), tries to cover up the information, but goo man runs around and kills everyone he sees because he melts. He is attacking a bickering old couple because he is melting. He screams a horrible actress and helplessly stops for approx. 10 minutes because he melts. He melts because he melts. For example, the dormant Rick Baker should be the star here, but they just look hokey. The movie is badly shot, and everything looks so dark and dull, it is very hard to figure out what is - not that it would help anyone. MooCow says who cut the cheese with this one ?? : = 8P ps - "Don't you have any crackers?"
