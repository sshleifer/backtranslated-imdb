This is a bad, bad movie. I'm a real founder: trust me when I say that this movie's regret of accuracy is just that. This is especially true in the crooked little scene when the squares combine footwork with the 80s pop. The end is predictable, and the movie is a drilling from start to finish. Terrible.
