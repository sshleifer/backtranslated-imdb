Four years after he made his direct debut with the art house snoozer "Welcome To L.A.", Alan Rudolph shows us what he really wanted from Hollywood was to be one of the boys. "Roadie" is a frat-boy fracas complete with barroom brawls, horny harpies, Art Carney in a soup-up wheelchair ... and Meat Loaf on the wheel. Meat Loaf (plays Travis W. Redfish!) Is actually a pretty charming on-screen presence and perhaps in a smaller role (in a better movie) he can actually be indratiating, but Zalman King's script is full of stereotype redneck humor and helpless meat. kept wide and moronic. Alice Cooper, Roy Orbison, Hank Williams, Jr., and Blondie all make appearances - and everyone looks embarrassed. They should definitely, "Roadie" is a bad trip. No stars from ****
