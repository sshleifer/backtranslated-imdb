After being bitten by a bat in a cave, a doctor named John Beck undergoes an accelerating transformation into a human beings. His wife assures him that there is nothing wrong with him, it is just because of rabies or the anti-rabies drugs he is. The local policeman believes that John is responsible for several cruel murders. "The Bat People" by Jerry Jameson is a hell of a horrible movie. Scripture is deadly boring and there is no gore or nudity. This pointless shot is so insanely boring that you will scratch your head in a total disbelief after having suffered through it. Although the design of a manbat being by a young Stan Winston is completely pathetic and unmemorable.Avoid this stink like the plague.2 out of 10.
