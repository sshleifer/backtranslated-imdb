It gets really bad. The only half-time release quality is the effects of the thousands of bullets used during the film. There are context errors everywhere. The action is horrible, except Kirk. The story is as great as the degree and the belief that the movie is a video game itself kills the movie if it wasn't already a corpse. So all in all, it's a waste of your life. I would have given this a zero if it was an option on the rating scale.
