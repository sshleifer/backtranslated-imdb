There is a big difference in releasing an original, intense, edge of your space, scary, gore party, and filmmaker Eli Roth and his team have done with "Cabin Fever" and simply acted like it. The film follows five college students into a cabin in the woods, which begins to prove fatal as one after another yields to this mysterious, fast-acting meat-eating disease. It is not long before friends turn on each other, and they can hardly see each other, much less will be in the same proximity as them. As rough as it all sounds, there is a certain spark behind the basic premise of this movie that could have worked in the hands of a less intrepid movie maker. Unfortunately, what we end up with, badly drawn characters whose sole purpose seems to be beautiful at the beginning to make the inevitable breakdown more contrasting, is a hackneyed script so profanity drawer as letting the viewer reconcile the dialogue and several incomprehensible subplots That motivates a little more than (in one case) a acting appearance by Director Roth. This is sloppy film production in several ways! Avoid this time consuming.
