This is one of the many B minus movies labeled as film noir hoping to create interest in something that lacks it. All aspects of the movie - script, acting, direction - are mediocre. The three leaders' plays are wood. I suppose John Dall was expected to go places in the film industry, but then someone realized he had a little talent and therefore ended up making television work. Lee J Cobb, who is usually fantastic, can't rise above the poor script and the bad direction. Jane Wyatt must be a femme fatal, but does not come close to convincing viewers. The movie has two of the strangest cars I've ever seen, the one where John Dall goes after Lee J Cobb is particularly weird. The DVD transfer is typically Alpha.
