I gave this movie a really good chance and it betrayed me. This is very little more than a black and white excuse to drill hell out of the audience, although the egotist Bogdanavich (who did better with TARGETS) gets "good performances" out of a ton of hams in their debut. Lots of teenage chicks come out of this movie, like. Make the teacher's wife, impotence, Make the ugly prostitute (who is very awkward shot and grins things completely, not that things really went everywhere) and lean dipping. I suppose this movie should be fun because of all sex nonsense, for me it was just annoying. I was seriously much more entertained by cleaning my fingernails than seeing this mess.
