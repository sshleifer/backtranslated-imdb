This movie is a horrible distortion of lies and exaggerations, composed of the most shameless lunatics ever to work on a television movie. The story is wrong and a complete lie. There is nothing in this movie that accurately portrays Senator McCarthy. It's just a terrible scam, and I am surprised that anyone associated with this production has ever had another job in the industry. The Marxist Leninists, who wrote this garbage, did so to attack a man who was justified by history and their fears that anyone would dare to destroy communism. Unfortunately, Ronald Reagan took over these communist emergency jobs, where McCarthy relaxed, and they could not stop him, thus the end of the Soviet Union and its cohorts. <br /> <br /> Never watch this movie if you're looking for truth about late McCarthy. Read Ann Coulter's book, "Treason" for a better look at the truth about late McCarthy. It will also help if you read about what really happened to Senator McCarthy by reading http: // www. thenewamerican.com/tna/1996/vo12no18/vo12no18_mccarthy.htm
