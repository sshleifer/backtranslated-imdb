After watching the hot Eliza Dushku in the very good Wrong Turn, I decided to choose this one instead of Return of the Living Dead, of all movies. Haven't seen one yet, but considering it's one of the most recognized horror movies ever, sure to say I made the wrong choice. There is simply nothing to recommend this movie and I'm talking about the seemingly superior killer cut. It didn't even have the youthful sex appeal from mediocre to bad movies as I know what you were doing last summer or Valentine or Urban Legend. It simply had no meaning, held no excitement, had very little interesting plays or convincing writing. The release date was apparently extinguished many times in about a year, and the cause is obvious. The whole movie comes out as a bunch of pointless scenes thrown together randomly to meaningless effect. If you want to see Dushku, turn wrong. I would like to see a movie with her and the super-happy Elisabeth Harnois - but I don't even think that would have made this movie appear. Casey Affleck, so promising in Good Will Hunting, is horrible here - he seems to lack both intelligence and gut. That's enough about this.
