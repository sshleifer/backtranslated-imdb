Interesting film about a concrete event that took place during the civil war in Vermont. It kept my attention at last, and I do not regret seeing it. I have never ever read anyone about this raid event, so I was curious to see if the rebels took it off. I enjoy historical movies from that era. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is with the Confederate uniforms. They look too good !!! The actor was sometimes a bit stiff. I like the old man who eats the potatoes because he didn't have teeth. The wounded soldier playing with a dog was a little strange. Overall, it was a descent movie.
