All I can really say is that I'm happy to knit socks while watching the movie, or I would be very sad to have wasted 2 hours in my life. The action was horrible, the plot was even worse. There were some scenes that should be serious that had my husband and I laughing loudly. I highly recommend this movie to people who like to make their own version of MST3K.
