This movie was amazingly amazing movie all through scary as hell. and i think it was as much as pulse and IT and omen etc, but with a good movie comes a crap to finish right? RIGHT! This movie ended up being pathetic stuff. I think a ghost returned time in a chicken house, and now it seems I've done it, that means I can call her and it's the right time because she thinks it is. right? wrong. my ass! I don't care if the ghost is Satan, it just doesn't happen. It's a movie yes, but most evil movies or famous movies like this are supposed to make sense, but it didn't. It just showed us what I just said, and people don't believe it. Can anyone tell me why you all have not noticed the pathetic part. The movie for me ended up in the hospital, and that's all. Check number 3 is much more kick ass
