Terrible. This thriller should have been buried. What a piece of shit. Terrible writing, signs are less than credible. Horrible Schlock !! Stick some B-stars in a terribly written POS to try and give it a small credit, but it doesn't fail. If I did not write ten lines on this movie, I would have given it a word drive, it starts with 'sh' and ends with 'it'. Terrible end, retarded. Who writes this crap. The end of this movie is so constructed, weak, it's like they had no idea what to do with this story line, or they just ran out of money. Most likely due to the number of cameos in this movie. It is a good thing that these actors are coming out, for it would be a career order. Good thing for those who hardly want to see it. At least none important as future investors. It could have ended a thousand different ways, but as it is, I feel cheated out of my precious time. <br /> <br /> Don't bother with this, you'll feel like you're wasted time you can never get back.
