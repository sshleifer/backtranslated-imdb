This is a sad movie about this woman who believed her ex, which she loved so much, was probably dead, but his research father had just got a magic on him to make him this really cute shark guy. Kind of Beauty and the Animal. It could probably use a ballroom dance scene and maybe some song candlesticks, but there are some beautiful gross plants instead. They make this one girl really itchy so she can be eaten by the hacker instead of scraping through the whole movie. The scientific guy is a good father who is trying to reunite his fishy shark son with the woman he was engaged to, he even makes private time for sex, but the woman in this is a really low snob and thinks shark guy is an ugly icky monster and won't have anything with him. She gave up on love! Just because he was a shark! I thought it was pretty boring how all she had to do was kiss him, and he would return to normal, and they would live happily ever, but it is not that kind of movie.
