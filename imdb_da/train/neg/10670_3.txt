Flat sign that you do not and will never care about. Cringe-inducing dialogue in places. No twists (they think they have one, but if you didn't find out after about 40 minutes you're not for light). Lots of well-known actors in roles and performances, fortunately for everyone involved, will be forgotten as soon as the final credits roll. <br /> <br /> I don't mind 'slow' movies, but they've got to go _somewhere_. This does not. <br /> <br /> The reason was not what made this a direct-to-DVD movie, it's just a pretty handy excuse to try to drum up a fake controversy. <br /> The 37 (!) ten (10) assessments must be from the people involved in the production.
