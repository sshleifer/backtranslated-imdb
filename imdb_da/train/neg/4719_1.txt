I just want to say that this production is very one-sided, breaks the necessary impartiality if you want to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> There are no credits from the people they interviewed so you cannot have an idea if they are worthy of being heard. <br /> <br /> Tells the story from a single point of view. Doing this is very dangerous because the next generations learn the bad idea and therefore continue the war. I know this is not the only reason for wars, but neither does it help. <br /> <br /> You can see this documentary, but read a lot on the Internet before. Balcans are complex as human history is.
