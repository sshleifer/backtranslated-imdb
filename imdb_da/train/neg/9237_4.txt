Stalker is right! Girl looking guy, girl want guy, girl telling earthly ways to keep bumping in him, girl will not leave him alone, girl seems like a patient, girl can not stop talking about him, girl pretending to love another guy (or two), he does not pay attention to her because she is annoying, girl will still not leave him alone. The game right, Drake's character could have been charming, but she is utterly untenable in her pursuit of Cary Grant's character, her boyfriend is boring and unfortunately drakes Drake's attempt to play "charming ball" as "disturbingly denied." which is fine for Cary, but it's so close to a welcoming performance that I've ever seen from him. The direction is dark and the dialogue is simply dim. <br /> <br /> Screwball comedy is very difficult to manage and when it fails, as in this stubbed-out butt of an experiment, it just stinks. Even worse, Drake uses the entire movie that needs a lot of Valium and a detention order. She destroys any humor found in this dryer other than mummy waste.
