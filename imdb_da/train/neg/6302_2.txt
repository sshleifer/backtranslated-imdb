The British heritage film industry is out of control. There is nothing wrong with filming classic novels, but why do they all need to be taken up by talentless nobodies? This movie rips the intestines out of Orwell's tough novel, making it a harmless, fluffy romantic comedy. 'Aspidistra' may not be Orwell's best work, but no one reading it can forget the amazing depiction of poverty. Orwell not only emphasizes the cold and hungry, but the humiliation of being poor. In the novel, London is a gloomy, gray, cold, heartless city, and Comstock asks to be blown away by a squadron of bombers. But this film exudes something that might interfere in some way, and instead creates a jolly nostalgic trip to the charming 1930s London, where everything is lit with golden sunlight shafts, and even the slums in Lambeth are picturesque and filled with fresh scrub urchins and happy prostitutes. Comstock's poem about the sharp wind sweeping over the rubbish streets seems completely out of place in this chocolate box world. Worst of all is the script's relentless bonhomie, old jokes and clunking dialogue. It's so frustrating because Richard E. Grant is the perfect person to play Gordon Comstock, and the movie is full of great actors. But that's all for nothing. This movie made me so angry! Britain's literary history is something to be proud of for its wealth, complexity and power. And what do we do with it? We use gentle nobodies to make it soft-centered, anodyne cardboard for people who want to feel they 'get some culture' while drinking their Horlicks and quietly quitting.
