Oh God! The first time I heard about this bad show was when one of my friends shouted like an idiot "JOHNY TEST" while playing video games. I thought he was confusing "Johny Quest" (by the way, one of the best cartoons I have ever seen in my life "and changing" Quest "with" Test. "It is strange that I am mistaken but in fact I was wrong, he didn't change anything he heard about this show. <br /> <br /> One day while watching TV, I heard that Cartoon Network was going to be released, I wasn't sure what was plotted for this show, so I adventured myself to see it, and here's my answer "I want my stupid time back" (Because I saw this crap and "My Gym Partner is a Monkey". <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst shows I've ever seen, first, the beginning of the most stupid song in the world, so plotted ... Oh, where are my manners? I haven't said the plot of this show. About a boy who has AMAZINGLY INTELLIGENT sisters who have a laboratory and experiment with their own brother, OHHH, now I see why his name is Johny TEST, he is aroused by her sister's experiments. <br /> You know, I honestly miss the Dexter's La b (before it was transformed into the new Dexter, a total crap too). This is a bad copy of the old good show, except that this show is incredibly bad. Don't look at it, do something more productive in the half hour than look at this crap.
