This movie takes what might have been a good idea, a mummified 2000 year old witch and completely destroys it. Nora and Jim are alcoholics who go to Ireland to dry out. They go with their Nan and Uncle. Uncle has discovered a 2000-year-old witch preserved in peat. He revives her and she takes the form of Nora. She can't be killed conventionally (more is a pity). However, Nora prepares a way to do this. <br /> <br /> This is a gothic horror movie that has been made on the cheap. It's a bubbly mess. I have to ask why anyone would like to make such a bad movie. I am tempted to learn witchcraft to make it disappear. <br /> <br /> AVOID ALL COSTS
