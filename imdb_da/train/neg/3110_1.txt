I usually come to this site before going to the cinema as I like to see what other people think of the movie. I read many reviews that said 'thriller not a horror movie'. This asked me to try this movie. I really have to take the problem with these "thriller / horror" statements, as it wasn't! I almost went and asked for my money back and if you many reviewers enjoyed this rubbish .... well be easy to be happy! At the end of the film, the people behind me said "a waste of time" and I turned to them and replied "I couldn't have summed it up better". I waited for something to happen ... but it didn't. There was the potential for many good scares (or excitement, if you liked), but nobody happened. Williams acted quite well, but I felt he was shortly changed by a poor script that dithered around and went nowhere. Save your money people, this is a turkey that will be in a DVD store 'negotiating box' near you for the foreseeable future!
