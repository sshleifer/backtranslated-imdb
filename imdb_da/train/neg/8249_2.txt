Hiya people, <br /> <br /> Well, this movie really sucks. Think "Love Actually" in reverse. Nothing fits right, nothing is coherent, and at least nothing makes you laugh. Love is rare in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a total flop. As stated, there are three redeeming points if this lacked potential in a movie. <br /> <br /> With a star billing by Jennifer Love Hewitt there will be hordes of guys who will send with grace to see this just to get a glimpse of petite Hewitt with form fitting clothing. To tell you now, guys .... there are some promising scenes .... but it's really weak eyelids. The "possibilities" here are the water down. Nonetheless, I looked at everything that was tempted by the next scene where you know what ..... titling! B) The ending is romantic and positive. That it is contrary and "over the top" is relevant ..... but for me it was still a positive point. <br /> <br /> C) Dougray Scott plays a fun friendly guy ........ refreshing! THANK YOU! <br /> <br /> 2/5, not worth your 10 or so dollars. <br /> <br /> 2/3 is completely over, I was convinced that Jennifer Love Hewitt became the next softcore legend. Although I take it back for now ..... it is strongly attached to her next movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and her sister is way stupid. Her husband is way stupid ... and dunk, she's stupid stupid. <br /> <br /> Next time. can't wait for the next love actually with JLH!
