Yes I know that "talkies" were just invented for the cinema 2 years earlier, when this was produced in 1929, but this film showed that there was much to learn about the art of producing films. It comes across as a filmed "hammy" stage game with the actors melodramatically illuminating their lines, rolling their eyes, using too many pregnant breaks, and using movements more suitable for silent cinema, which I suppose was normal during their training to work more naturalistic on the screen. The gap between the lines spoken should have been tightened up during editing, as it significantly lowers the film. It is only interesting for Titanic buffs who would like to see an early example of this marine accident on film. In the next chronological order they could see "Titanic" (1953) A Night to Remember (1958) "Titanic (1997) to see how the cinema's depiction of this tragedy developed over the years. There have been many documentaries and television films made including the dreadful "SOS Titanic" (1979) On my verse that is a DVD, David McCallum introduces the introduction, which was he who played Harold Bride Marconi's junior wireless operator in "A Night to Remember" (still the best feature film - read please comment on my "Tribute to Walter" comments on IMDb under Howard Morley.demon.co.uk) and commented on the series of 4 videos titled "End of a Dream" so he was well qualified to give the story. more interest I found a recording accompanied by actual photos of the 1912 US Senate hearing, which is also on DVD.Actors tells the actual words spoken by Lightoller 2nd officer, J Bruce Ismay, CEO of White Star, Harold Bride and others including Gloria St ewart (The "Old Rose" in Titanic 1997) is used for one of the first-class surviving women.
