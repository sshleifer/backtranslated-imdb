I'm not an artistically inclined person. I am a science-minded woman and I felt that this movie might be one of those campy artsy type movies on a budget. I saw part of it with my fiance and my future stepdaughter. We tried very hard to find anything in this movie to keep our interest. My fianc√© and his daughter voted it and we moved on to Ocean 13, but that's another story. Not to be discouraged, I woke up the next morning and gave the film another shot. I started to watch this movie again seriously. I just didn't get it, I thought I'd get it. I thought the funniest part was the rubbing of the ashes, and the urn found a spot that the fireplace was used as a vase for what seemed to be dead flowers. Interesting and still had dead things inside. It was a weird and bizarre movie. Maybe that's what they were after, but I won't be fooled the second time!
