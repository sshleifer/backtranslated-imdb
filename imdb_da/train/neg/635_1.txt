Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Unfortunately, her role demanded no. She didn't say much and then bleached through the whole movie. Luise's character was a slave and was then married to Paul Muni's character (he did a great job for his performance). Seen in ancient Asia, both actors were not Asian, but were very convincing in their roles. I hope Paul Muni received an Oscar for his performance, for that is what Luise has to get her Oscar for. She must have been a breakthrough actress, one of the first to method action. This seems like something Hollywood often does. Al Pacino has played an Italian and Cuban. I felt Luise's performance to be lackluster all the time, and when she died, she didn't change expressions from previous scenes. She became the same throughout the film; She has only changed her expression or emotions twice. If her brilliant plays were so subtle, I don't assume that.
