::: SPOILER ALERT ::: <br /> <br /> Sooo, Arnie is really a good guy, but after an incident with some helicopter battles and some disobedient orders, he is sent to jail (or rather a sort of work camp). He escapes, but after a short time he is caught again. This time ends in a freakish reality show where he has to run for a while from a bunch of tough guys with different themes and eventually die. But we all know Arnie, and we all know that he is harder than even the hardest of the hard guys. I really wanted to like this movie, like an Arnie fan and everyone. But "The Running Man" contains too many errors that really annoy the crap out of me. Eg. The reconstruction of Arnie's battle within the helicopter, where the shocked audience is shown a brief overview of the incident, complete with 5-10 different camera angles. This means that the military helicopter where Arnie flew was equipped with nearly 10 cameras that filmed the crew members, one of which is one of the crew members Arnie's eye. <br /> <br /> There are also other flaws, and the plot, which in theory seems to be very interesting and innovative, works for a while, then it creates a kind of stupidity and urealism where it drowns. <br /> <br /> The play cannot really be said to be any better than sub-pair, with Arnie in the leading role, making an average Arnie performance. The rest of the throw goes by without being particularly good or bad. <br /> <br /> The special effects are ok, without being impressive. <br /> <br /> RATING: 3/10
