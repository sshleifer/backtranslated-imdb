I remember I loved this movie when it came out. I was 12 years old, had a Commodore 64 and loved playing Rambo on it. I was therefore very excited when I came to buy this movie really cheap. I put it in my VCR and started: The man this movie is really bad! Sylvester Stallone says as 3 words throughout the film (except for the horrible sentimental speech at the end) and has the same expression on his face all the way. And the stupid love thing in the middle, it's just so incredibly predictable. I ended up relaying the whole thing and went to exchange the movie for something else.
