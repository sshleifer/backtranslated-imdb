On average, even according to Monogram standards, this mystery (a recovery of The Sphinx) has an oddball plot that does not become unraveled to great effect - you will look through it after approx. ten minutes. The two leaders have a good dialogue at the beginning, but John Hamilton is hopelessly boring as the villain (perfectly cast Lionel Atwill derives from the role) and Warren Hymer's nitwit shtick is rather annoying. It is worthwhile, however, to sit through for a five-minute look by the incomparable Mantan Moreland as Nicodemus Guardian, who gets better at the defense attorney under a hilarious courtroom. You must give it to Bill "One-Take" Beaudine; he was not much of an instructor, but he would always turn a routine programmer with some yummy vaudeville.
