This is just typical Bruce Willis, action movie schtick. See it with some popcorn and your friends. Rent it to save money. None of them is realistic. The fighting is not realistic. The soldiers are not realistic. Victims are not realistic. And why was Tom Skerritt's character talking to Willis from the deck of his career? What happens to it? He can't do it from within the ship <br /> <br /> Of course, Bruce W. gets a machete wound. There are a bunch of average explosions. <br /> <br /> If this movie exactly represents Navy SEALS, don't get stuck in Africa, expect them to save you! The noble attack on the village bothered me the most. "Front seats for ethnic cleansing" ... as Bruce looks at the slaughter in town. So what does he do? He creeps into the city on his stomach. Yep. How many died while they were plastered? Oh well ... a body count was necessary, I think. <br /> <br /> And if one African guy was so important, why didn't he go chatting with older people and kids? Can he say "Duh?" <br /> <br /> Finally, the film was very dark. Not just in the plot, but so much happens at night, it was hard to figure out what was going on. <br /> <br /> Rent it.
