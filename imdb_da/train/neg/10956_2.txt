I bought this movie from Gamestop's discount, which was used for movie storage, and the cover made me laugh uncontrollably so I bought it for 99cents. The film itself is retarded, and they use ten different monkeys throughout the film, which are almost unlike each other. Not to mention they use a stunt double which is just a short guy in costume that makes a desperate attempt to imitate a monkey. The director has more than likely committed a murder suicide with the chimpanzees after the film debuted in an example of another low-rent Warner Bros. film and he ended up with money for the studio. It also doesn't help that he wasn't even notorious for the horrible work he did, he wasn't even known for producing a poop-chute movie. Why was this movie ever made?
