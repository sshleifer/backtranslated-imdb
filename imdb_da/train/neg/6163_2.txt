Hooper is not fun, not excited, not romantic and not informative. There is no real drama. You'd think a movie about the world's biggest stuntman wanted some drama that was an attempt, but it didn't work right. No character study, no experience, it didn't even look like the actors had any really fun, they just tried to act as if they were having fun. There is no need to look at unless you like to look at Burt and want an occasional glimpse of Sally. The prancer horse was beautiful and did what he had to do. In fact, Prancer was the best actor in this movie. Smoky and Bandit were such a funny movie that I was ready to like Hooper. This movie proved to be a real disappointment and a waste of time
