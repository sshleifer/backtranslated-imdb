I read a couple of good reviews on this table for "Mr. Scarface", but for all uninitiated in the genre of Italian gangster movies like myself, the picture will probably make very little sense. In fact, after the initial setup involving the ten million lira scams, the image was settled into a fairly routine raising with a minor twist in the identity of Rick's (Al Cliver) character. The entire gang war listing was muddied to me with the involvement of Vinchenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli), but as most other viewers commented, he is the only one who gave this image any life with his often ineffective attempts at violence. I found it a bit unbelievable that Manzari's goons, who chased Tony through the streets, didn't go out until Tony himself put a hand on them. For all of his title character, Jack Palance was wasted quite uncertainly in an anticlimactic near-finals, making the US title, "Mr. Scarface," rather. I've seen enough spaghetti westerners to know they're not all working; I think in this case that my first look at a spaghetti gangster flick didn't quite do it either.
