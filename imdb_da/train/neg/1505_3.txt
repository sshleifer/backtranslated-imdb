A completely obscure Italian-Western, stupid story full of clich√©s and lack of logic, some mediocre actors, filthy settings, lots of slogans, and people are massively shooting dead. <br /> <br /> This has nothing to do with Django. - At least not in my German translated version called this German DVD edition "Adios Companeros" and has Macho Callaghan fighting against Butch Cassidy and Ironhead because their gang killed his (he is the only survivor). Then you have Butch Cassidy and Ironhead fighting each other because they argued and the gang split. And you have Ironhead fight against everyone because he's just the biggest and most greedy asshole anyway. Yes, that's it, no more wisdom in history, hehe. A small role of Klaus Kinski as Reverend Cotton is remarkable (therefore I bought this DVD). In one scene, he tries to separate two men fighting by hitting them and screaming "I said love!" And in another scene he wins a competition in throwing horseshoes and goes nuts in a second - great! <br /> <br /> It is also noteworthy that JOE d'AMATO aka Aristide Massaccesi did the cinematography - I love this gentleman's incompetent exploitation thrash, so it was an "aahhh" for me.
