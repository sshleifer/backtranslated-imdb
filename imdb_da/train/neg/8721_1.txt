I'm sorry, but it's just pathetic. The little girl was abrupt, their was not funny characters and the plot sucked. Besides, it wasn't even a street, because the movie wants us to believe. If you check a complete reptile guide, you will find that it really is a crocodile, not a street. Of course, they didn't hire a real animal expert or they would know that the creature is a hook. It's a sad excuse for a movie. Especially the end. I almost fell asleep with this one.
