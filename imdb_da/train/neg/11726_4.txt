Wesley Snipes is the James Dial, an assassin for rental, agent of the CIA and pure bad special operative. During his spare time, Dial turns a cowboy hat and breeds horses with macho names like Beauty. Enter Agent Collins, his supervisor. Enter a new mission - kill a terrorist who is in British custody. Of course, the United Kingdom, an allied state, is a good place for hidden ops and headquarters outside the courtroom. The murder is a great success apart from the fact that the escape plan blew. So Dial's partner and locals are killed in action trying to escape the police while Dial gets hot property with London's coppers trying to get to him and the CIA is trying to dispose of him. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for the Dial the Security House is routinely visited by a teenager Emily Day (Eliza Bennett) who loves to hang out with cold-blooded arrest warrant killers and help them escape the evil British law enforcement ... <br /> <br /> With a script like that I have to say more? On the plus side, Wesley Snipes is Wesley Snipes (it's a pro or a cow), and the movie is quite engaging. On minus editing, it is very heterogeneous and has a veil effect on the stomach.
