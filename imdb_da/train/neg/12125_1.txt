Why do people who do not know what a certain time in the past was feeling it was necessary to try to define that time for others? Replace Woodstock with the Civil War and Apollo Moon Landing with Titanic sinks and you have as realistically a flick as this formal soap opera populated exclusively by low-waste. Are these kids too young to be allowed to go to Woodstock, and who did not manage to go to school class composition? "I want to show the old men, I propagate my own movie and prove that you do not need to know nuttin about your subject to still make money!" Yes, we already know that. The only thing that looked at this movie did for me to give me a little insight into subclass thinking. Next time I see a blunt in a bar that looks like Diane Lane, I drive the other way. It is child abuse to let parents experience worthless children. It is audience abuse just to keep Woodstock and moon landing in a flick as if it ipso facto means the film depicts 1969.
