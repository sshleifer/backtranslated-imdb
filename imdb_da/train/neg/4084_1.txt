Every now and then you hear radio djs inviting listeners to nominate movies that the listener cannot stand or never see all the way through. This is the movie I think of ... days later. <br /> <br /> It has something to do with a game from Shakespeare. It's not safe, but I think I bailed on this movie about 20 odd minutes into it ... I realized that my toenails wouldn't clip themselves and they looked at me to cut. <br /> <br /> This movie just seemed boring and pretentious to me. Although this is the first movie I have given such a low score (which I have actually tried to see), I would not put you off other films by the English director, Peter Greenaway. I remember thinking that his "chef, thief, his wife and her lover" was a really great British movie, even though the content was sometimes belly curative - a brilliant movie, but I can understand why people would bow to see it. <br /> <br /> Another good movie from Greenaway was "A zed and two noughts". Again, it had some content that shot the limits of good taste, but was interesting enough. <br /> <br /> The second movie I usually think of late for such radio shows is "Brazil". It never managed to look all the way through - kept falling asleep! <br /> <br /> Unless you have a taste for self-explanatory movies that are off-puttingly highly stylized, work-paced and hard to follow, steer clear of Prosero's Books.
