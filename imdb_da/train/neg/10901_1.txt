And a few more "no" s on top of that. Voodoo Academy is without a doubt the least ambitious movie of all time. What is it that tries to do? Tell a story? Obviously not; As has been pointed out, most of the just-legal guys are rubbing themselves. Could it be an attempt at subversive homoerotism? Well, perhaps, if not for that fact, it never goes beyond the most harmless and non-threatening forms of male contact. (It is to the delight of no one, repeated about 80,000 times.) Well, it's kind of a horror movie; is it trying to scare us? Not unless the director intended to do so through the complete tedium and vacuum of his "work". Never in my life have I had a movie less. These are the most boring and unnecessary things I have ever seen. It's like the Voodoo Academy takes the genre of horror, zombie and gay movies, puts them in a grinder and drives them through a coffee filter - instead of being the kind of coffee filter that filters out coffee beans, that's the sort of who takes out everything vital, edgy or in any way interesting. The result is a 74-minute movie every time as exciting as a glass of warm water - only without the ability to rehydrate you after the 10-day gin-binge that inevitably comes upon you if you see this abomination of human effort.
