I had rather big hopes for this movie, even though it got a bad review in the paper. I was extremely tolerant and sat through the whole movie. I felt completely ill at the end. Although I am not in the smallest pride or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema, I have enjoyed both Woody Allens' Everything you ever wanted to know about sex, ... 'and Michael Hanneke' Funny Games' - I found the director's occupation with this ten-year-old who wanted to drink women's milk completely ill. And when the movie climaxed in an "orgy", where the boy drinks both his mother's milk and the woman, he has solved for the whole movie, I almost vomited the total perversion and sentimental cardboard that it is. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong, I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema as well as independently made movies, so this girl should have enjoyed me immensely. Avoid this movie at all costs, it should be referred to the annals of history as a lesson in poor cinema.
