A "friend", clearly without taste or class, suggested that I look at Ron Atkins work. If this is representative of his oeuvre, I will never see anything else of him. It is amateurish, self-reliant, criminally foamed and self-giving rubbish. "Hov's shortage" of the title is an angry low-cost filmmaker who kills a bunch of hooks. There is a bit of nudity and some erections, but no single element could possibly save this from the hangman's nose. The lighting is appalling, the dialogue is pueril and mostly shouted, and the direction is clueless. I saw a doco on US exploiters during the recent Fangoria Convention. Atkins was one of the highlights. He spoke as if there was something important about his work, but after seeing this, I see nothing of any imports at all. There is also no style, and the horrible video effects (like soldering) only improve the amateurity. Not so bad is it fun. Avoid.
