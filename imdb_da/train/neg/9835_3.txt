Before I explain the "Alias" comment, let me say that "The Desert Trail" is bad even by the standards of westerns staring at The Three Stooges. In fact, it features Carmen Laroux as a semi-flat girl Juanita, when you hear her Mexican accent, she is immediately recognized as Senorita Rita from the classic Stooge card "Saved by the Belle". <br /> <br /> In the "Desert Trail", John Wayne will play the Moe Howard character, and Eddy Chandler will play Curly Howard. Like their Stooge colleagues, an ongoing gag is in 53 minutes of film, Moe hits Curly. Wayne's character, a skirt that hunts bully, is not very end-moving, but must be the good guy. <br /> <br /> Playing a busy rodeo cowboy Wayne holds the rodeo cashier on the gun and takes the prize money he would have won if the participation had been good - the other riders have to pay 25 cents a dollar (actually even less after Wayne robs the box office). No explanation is given to Wayne's ripping of the riders and still considered the hero who gets the girl. Things get complicated at this time because the villain (Al Ferguson) and his sidekick Larry Fine (played by Paul Fix who would continue to play Sheriff Micah on the television's "The Rifleman") watch Wayne Rob's cash office and then steal the rest of the money and kill the rodeo manager. Moe and Curly are to blame. <br /> <br /> So Moe and Curly move to another city to get away from the law and they change their names to Smith and Jones. Who do they meet first, but their old friend Larry, whose sister becomes the other half, loves the interest (Senorita Rita left the old town and makes no further appearances in the movie). <br /> <br /> Larry's sister is nicely played by a brilliant beautiful Mary Kornman (now adult, but in her younger days she was one of the original cast members of Hal Roach's "Our Gang" shorts). Kornman is the main reason for seeing mega-lame western and her scenes with Moe and Curly are much better than anyone else in the production, as if they were using a completely different crew to film them. <br /> <br /> Even in 1935, the action sequences in this thing are extremely weak and the technical film making is staggeringly poor. The two main hunting scenes end with stock footage wide shoots of a rider falling from a horse. Both times the editor cuts a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground, but there is no horse in the frame, the film layer is completely different, and the character has different clothes than the stunt rider. There is liberal use of stock footage in other places, none of it even externally convincing. <br /> <br /> One thing to look for is a scene in the middle of the movie, where Moe and Curly come on the horses and drive away (to the screen to the right) from a cabin as the possen gallops toward the cabin from the left. The cameraman follows the two stooges with a slow pan right and then makes a whisk to the left to reveal the nearby bag. Outside of home movies I have never seen anything like this, not because it looks silly (as it does), but because a competent director will never create a scene like this. They would film the two riders who left and then reposition the camera and film the possen approaching as a separate action. Or if they felt creative, they would create the sequence so that the camera shows the riders in the foreground and the possen approaches in the background. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
