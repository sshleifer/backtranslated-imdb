Well, Jesus of Montreal is basically an intelligent movie. The actors are really good and the technical side of the movie is okay. But even though I was very interested in the subject and would like to think and discuss about religion (I am an atheist), it was hard to force me to watch the movie for the bitter and in my opinion somehow unknowingly fun. Why is this movie so incredibly boring? I do not know. It's just and so it's not advisable.
