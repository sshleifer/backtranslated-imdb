In a way, the Corridors of Time is a success story because the movie reaches its goal: seen by thousands. But it fails to make them laugh ... Les Visiteurs has been successful because the topic was an original way of considering the time travel: Forget Zemeckis' Back to the Future, here comes the old France, the Middle Ages knight and its almost barbaric lifestyle . Full of pride, fun thanks to the old words he uses, Montmirail can sometimes be disgusting, but he keeps his honor. Then comes the successor. <br /> <br /> No one had anticipated the huge success of Les Visiteurs, the first. And it's not to be a movie expert to realize that the corridors of time have been made for money. <br /> <br /> The general story begins after the end of Les Visiteurs and immediately tries to justify the sequel with a time paradox that would have needed something else. Explanation: It is not necessary to try to get those jewelry that Jacquouille has stolen back; You can't remember this lovely red, shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of 1. episode? Where do you think he found the money? Selling jewelry ... And it's just one of many gaps Poiré tries to avoid ... and fails. <br /> <br /> Let's look at the characters: Montmirail doesn't change, he's just a little more boring. With regard to Frenegonde ... it's another story: Valérie Lemercier decided not to compromise herself in this sequel to avoid being stuck in a civilian role. And Muriel Robin tries to imitate her in a way that I found so pitiful, I almost felt pain for her. And Poiré does not realize that a caste of humorists is not enough to make a good comedy. <br /> <br /> Forget about the time travel, the digital effects, concentrating on the story, and you'll see enough space on a postmark to write it 10 times. <br /> <br /> The greatest interest in this movie is the landscape. A movie for young people, let's say up to 13 years.
