I saw this trailer and thought to myself my god is this movie for real, who would like to watch this movie and at the same time I thought my friend turned me over and said "we should watch this movie". ... even so I saw this about 5 minutes walk and I tried to put a brave face and enjoy the cheap scares but there wasn't even any of them. It must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen the director have no influence, no perspective, the same shots were used over and over again, he did not build up excitement, the throw was probably simply told to scream crying. I would love to see the script as the first 40 minutes were mostly annoying girly giggles and bad music, there was absolutely no sign development. <br /> <br /> The reason is just ... well there was no plot it was basically I know we will terrorize a high school on their prom night with a stalker serial killer, it's brilliant! hmmm The action was what you expect in an Australian soap opera hopeless, the protagonist Blondie Good Dam, she annoyed me. her longest line must have been a half sentence, and every time she was on camera, she took just another rude expression. <br /> <br /> Listen to me if you have any taste in movies, do not see this and if you like me and do not have a good choice then I wish you good luck, maybe you smuggle in an ipod or magazine. Can't believe this movie was made!
