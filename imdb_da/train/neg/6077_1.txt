Would anyone really see this RUBBISH if it doesn't contain small children running around the nude? From a biographical point of view, this is probably one of the worst movies I have ever experienced. Some perv woke up one day and thought I would make a movie with little girls and call it art, keep them in the landscape and there is no need for a story or explanation of how they came there or why they didn't appear to live anywhere or Have parents because p * rn movies don't need anything like that. I want to comment on the rest of the movie, but I have not crossed spoilers, so I just want to say avoid, avoid avoidance and find yourself a real movie to watch
