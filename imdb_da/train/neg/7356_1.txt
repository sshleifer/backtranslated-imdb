Get into this flick, just as it started, in an afternoon where I was at home with a touch of flu - otherwise I would have missed it. It would probably have been the best. <br /> <br /> I noticed the presence of Lindsay Crouse and Jay Thomas - both very good artists - and thought it might be worth a visit. It turned out to be to some extent, but only because it is one of those stories so horrible it fascinates. <br /> <br /> Zoe McLellan has little to recommend her talents, except for her Jayne Mansfield or Loni Anderson-like bosom. Unfortunately, her performance - at least here - makes Mansfield and Anderson to be Garbo or Davis in comparison. <br /> <br /> The young rat's white rat, the owner's cat, the young man having the owner expelled and held in his own home, and a bunch of baptismal houses (including the young emergency lock) are running around a biosphere plant and the absurd conclusion. I waited for at least some stage or plate element to contain at least a modicum of realism, credibility or ability to evoke some empathy / sympathy - but it turned out to be in vain.
