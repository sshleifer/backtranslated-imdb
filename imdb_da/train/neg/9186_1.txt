You know the sense of hilarity you get when you see a movie trying so hard to be a serious, thought-provoking piece of cinema and failing? When you can't help but push out to laugh at the sheer horrible character of the bin that stretches your screen? "The House of the Dead" is struggling to achieve even this low level of cinema. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, "House of the Dead" manages to recreate the feeling as if you have just awakened to find out that the cat has put the curly business on your forehead while you were sleeping. It is clear from the outset that the female actors have been thrown to their cleavage size (which they use shamelessly) while the men for their hardcore "kick-ass" setting. I honestly didn't care about any of the characters at any moment in the movie and found myself actually wanting their death to save me a good hour for this torture. Uwe Boll should have considered screening two hours of footage from the game itself as a movie. At least we become better actors ?? But not all guilt can be placed on the actors as it is certainly a challenge to produce a compelling film when faced with the film in this movie. It is undoubtedly the worst part of the movie and actually contains such lines as: "These are zombies, clean and simple" and "no cap'n, we must not go there! It is evil!". <br /> <br /> We all know that Zombie movies are never going to be particularly thought-provoking or full of meaning; At best, they are a harmless two-hour act, blood, and terror. Waste, yes, but entertaining waste. Not the kind of rubbish bin that breaks out of your bin bag when you pull it over the room and throw your shoes in milk-cartons and overdue banana skin. According to IMDb, "House of the Dead" received such bad reviews that no Danish cinemas bought the movie. If only we could have had the same privilege. <br /> <br /> Final score: 1/10.
