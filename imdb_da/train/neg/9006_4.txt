<br /> <br /> When I ignored some of the differences, this was actually a pretty decent horror / monster flick. So I will give some of the good points first: - The dragon was quite convincing, especially as she prowled through the tunnels looking for lunch (hint: she likes people). - The action was pretty non-stop, and after a weak start I was completely absorbed in the story. - Sorry to say I was angry with the dragon - she was probably the most compelling and consistent character in the movie. <br /> <br /> Now for the incomparable things ** maybe some spoilers **: - If you were jogging an incendiary dragon in 1100 AD, would you charge in his hole with a barrel crawling under your arm? You h. - a female character with an American name, blonde hair and obvious Slavic accent, trying to pretend to be Spanish? Huh? - A senior scientist whose slave accent you can cut with a knife, and apparently born in Chicago, educated in the United States? - A military helicopter pilot who performs his own repairs, flies a large transport power without other crews, and is an expert man and martial warrior to start? OKAY. Uh huh. I will not even mention that he gives 3 different call signs in 2 minutes while communicating with his base. It's still better than some of the Japanese monster flicks from the 60s, but not too much. If we are lucky, we will not see Dragon Fighter 2, even though the ending left that opportunity open. Or maybe they will hire a real director next time. After all, I gave this flick a 4 out of 10. Add 2 more if they rewrite the plot and Dean Cain gets eaten in the first ten minutes. <Grin>
