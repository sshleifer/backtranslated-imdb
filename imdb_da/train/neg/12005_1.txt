We've all seen some endless epics in our times, but this one tops them all! The film is so long and so slow that in order to put things in perspective, I felt much older when I left the movie hall than I entered. In almost 4 hours, it could have been done for a teleserial. <br /> <br /> What starts out as a promising comedy is slowly losing its pace. Nikhil Advani has woven the plot of about 6 love stories and he cannot justify any of them ... There is no link between them at first and the links shown in the last 20 minutes just seem to be forced to link the story . <br /> <br /> Stupid dialogues have made the situation worse (most are repeated in Hindi cinema over the years) and silly movies. <br /> <br /> Priyanka doesn't realize she should actually play her role rather than just glam on the screen ... A complete waste of beauty without trading skills. <br /> <br /> And then there are high-humorous Govinda & my-face-twists-better-than-jim-carrey Akshay Khanna who continue to itch at the top of their lungs to irritate already tired viewers. Only good part in movies is John & Vidya's love story and beautiful play / comedy by sohail & Isha. But they are so good at their roles that just these two couples could have justified the movie without stumbling it with another bunch of characters. Their gloss is lost in the middle of other substandard plot lines. My guess - Director made two separate films (maybe more!) And some beginner assistants blended all records beyond a point of sorting them out so the director was left with no choice to show it all as a single movie ... See it only, if you want to test your patience !!!
