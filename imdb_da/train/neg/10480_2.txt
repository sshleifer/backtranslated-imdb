It has a good name, but it is, and you get no more than that for your money. In fact, the movie's first 30-40 minutes you can find it a bit funny, but after that, the story goes from one side to the other with no particular reason, and you just can't understand what happens before the action is gone. <br /> <br /> Yet, producers (Roberto Angel Salcedo) call him an actor, but I don't think how he does it could be called nothing but overactive !! .... period. The little child who plays as his son has no sense of acting, and I think it was just a service he did or did because he had no idea what he was doing. <br /> <br /> For some reason while making casting they thought that by casting comedians they could get it, but they didn't! And sometimes the tasteless cheap humor is so bad I don't buy it. <br /> <br /> But hopefully it's as bad as it gets. To get people to accept these DVDs for the good taste audience, they must offer some food with what can train. <br /> <br /> Spouse
