Ultimately too stupid and pointless. Yes, there is the gilded burmese mother, but most children will probably miss it. Meh. Instant. <br /> <br /> Animation is, as we expect, super-real. The baseline can best be described as thin but persistent. Although the ending seemed to be random to me. The underwater sewer is a suitable obnoxious consideration of the world, and somehow riches and money seem to count on much there. Oh yes, and there is a romantic interest with the woman, who is the cleverer, more knowledgeable and starting with the couple - it in itself quickly becomes a tiring (anti) stereotype. Probably your kids will love it though.
