The translation / translation in this movie is purely hilarious and provides the only entertainment in this otherwise boring and derived zombie girl. I haven't laughed so hard in my life as I just saw Zombi 3 (and I've seen some really bad dubbing in my life, believe me). Seriously, the filmmakers could re-edit this movie and release it as a comedy and make millions of dollars. It's just so much fun. But if ... If you fall off your sofa, laugh at copying in a Fulci zombie movie, it's not your cup of tea, so avoid this at all costs.
