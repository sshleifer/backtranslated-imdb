Action, violence, sex and gross language are the things that the characters do throughout the film. And all they do is done for no reason. Mark L. Lester is (unknown) known for his violent (reasonless) films (Commando, The Base). The story is strange but stupid. The actors play their stupid characters very well ... I am not telling you they are stupid, but I think they are very bad actors. It's another low-budget unknown B-series action movie. If you saw something like Operation Delta Force, Drive, Patriot, Sanctuary or something like these bad movies of the same kind as Misbegotten ... don't rent it ... and don't rent any of the movies I mentioned ... I give it 1 and a half out of 5.
