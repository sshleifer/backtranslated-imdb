This is definitely one of the worst movies ever made. Each scene is painful. You will moan at the flimsy attempts at humor, the awkward camera work, sexism and racism, the ridiculous story line, wood acting. Poor Joan Bennett; She is the only one in the movie who is not embarrassed. In all terrible.
