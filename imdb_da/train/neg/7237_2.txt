Life is really too short for movies like this. I knew it couldn't be good when I realized what I already suspected - that David Schwimmer would play the same type of person he plays in 'Friends'. <br /> <br /> Let's see, either the guy can't play anything but a geek or he's never offered other parts. I have a feeling that it is a mix of both. <br /> <br /> And I have to say that it is extremely difficult to suffer a movie that completely wastes the significant talents of Gwyneth Paltrow, Barbara Hershey, Toni Collette and Carol Kane !!!
