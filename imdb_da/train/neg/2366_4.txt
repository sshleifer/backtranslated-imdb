I'm a fan of the nightmare series, but this one is horrible. The dead are so trendy. If you were to see this 20 years later, the entire nintendo scene is outdated. I liked flashbacks. I think they should have made a prequel when he was still alive. It would have been more interesting. This is a movie you can take or leave. Depends on how much free time you have.
