The only reason this movie is rated a 1 is that zero is not one of the options. With a plot thinner than depression era cabbage soup, horrible plays and special effects that look like they came out of the Thunderbird TV series, it is amazing that Widmark did not kill the director to put this black mark on his CV. Even after the 1950's standards, the special effects are terrible, with the exception of a pair of underwater underwater sequences. I can only assume that it was nominated for the best special effects because there were no others performing effects except 20,000 leagues under the sea and them! It was definitely no competition for Disney that year if this was their only competition. I would not recommend the movie, even for hard core submarine movie buffs, as the most realistic scene on the submarine was limited to a shot where sea water can be seen dribbling down the uphill periscope. There are other, much better, sub-movies that you can enjoy from this era, like the aforementioned 20,000 leagues or Torpedo Run.
