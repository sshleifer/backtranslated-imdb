Doc Savage: The Bronze Man is a horrible movie. Bad scripted, over-acted, and just stupid. That said ... it's actually an enjoyable movie on some level. This movie asks to be seen in a group with a plentiful supply of cheap beer. It's one of the movies "Santa Claus conquers the Martians" or "Yor, Hunter from the Future" ... so bad it's almost good. If you have the right group of people, this movie is a lot to see. It's campy. It is fun. It has a theme of Sousa. If you're looking for a good movie, look elsewhere. 10.3. BTW, I've heard rumors, some studies are exploring the possibility of a remake ...
