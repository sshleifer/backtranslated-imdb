I know I'm in the minority, but ... Uwe Boll is about as talented as a seed. Not even a pad just a seed. He is reminiscent of about a hundred other non-talented hacks fighting for a useless crap party after another. <br /> <br /> This movie? Is a crap party. Slater's talent is only minimally exploited, leading to belief that he has other things (like his failed relationship) on his mind. Reid performs as if she has either forgotten her acting, has been hit hard on her head and made it possible to forget her acting or have one of the worst directors in the film's history. I am voting on the third choice, even though the other two are always possible. <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll has never done a single thing from which I have derived even the slightest joy. Frankly, I am satisfied that he made this stink. I was worried about Bloodrayne, competing with "Underworld: Evolution" for ticket sales. Now I am convinced that Len Wiseman has nothing, and I mean nothing to worry about. <br /> <br /> This rates a 1.0 / 10 rating for this messy, horrible crap party, from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
