Oh, it's so bad, it's funny. The only way to explain something here is a pornstar with drugs that resulted in the decision to make a movie just for fun. I mean: you get to see pornographic interest topless, having sex, then killed by human mutants. There are lots of gore, including the classic "something is wrong with her, oh no, it's half the person she used to be" and the unintentional murder caused by panic. But you can also find fun things like the intestines pulled through someone else's ass and a guy running in the woods, and then he finds himself beheaded by a cord tied between two trees (this makes a metallic sound subsequently as in cartoons). Somehow there is a market for people who go beyond porn, they really need to know what's inside an actress, only genitals are not enough. Therefore, you will see lots of summarized autopsies on slaughtered bimbos. There is no dialogue. Jenna and Chasey have really tiny parts, and I really wonder what Richard Grieco wanted when they accepted a role here. I think it's a movie you have to look with the button fast forward and see only the juicy things just to be reminded of the old school C-class horror movies.
