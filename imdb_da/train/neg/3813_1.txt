What a crime ... You forgot to brush your teeth ... let's make a 30 minute show about it and get a couple of kids to make some noise and then get the dad talk to them all because that's what he has to do. <br /> <br /> But don't forget Uncle Joey should make some odd sounds and cooky faces, then Uncle Jesse should show up with his black leather jacket and some jeans and look beautiful in a few minutes while everyone is discussing how to mother would have done things if she were around. <br /> <br /> Yep, full of zany little adventures of a whole lot of nothing and a whole long history of rebuilding it. <br /> <br /> Full House will not only carry you to tears, but it will make you age twenty times faster than you normally would.
