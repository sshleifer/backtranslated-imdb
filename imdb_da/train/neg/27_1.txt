Horrible movie. Nuff Said. <br /> <br /> These lines are just fillers. The movie was bad. Why should I expand what I don't know. This is already a waste of my time. I just wanted to warn others. Avoid this movie. The action sucks and the writing is just moronic. Bad in every way. The only lovely thing about the movie is Deniz Akkaya's breasts. Even it was destroyed, however, by a terrible and unnecessary rape scene. The film is a poorly constructed and completely incredible piece of waste. OK now I just have to intervene on IMDb for this stupid rule with 10 lines of minimum text. First I waste my time watching this offal. So, I feel compelled to warn others, I only create an account with IMDb to find out that I have to write a frigate essay on the movie just to express how bad I think it is. Completely unnecessary.
