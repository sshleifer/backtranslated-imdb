This is a film about animal cruelty. Under the cover of a marathon runner, we see depictions of extreme animal cruelty, including literally running a horse to death in slow motion. The guy who did this has his conscience spiritually cleaned by the flames of the horse's funeral / burning, which of course is still dead, tortured to death. This is one of the sickest, slimmest movies I've ever had the displeasure to see. As Gene Hackman and James Coburn near the finish line on their DYING animal, we must admire their spirit to finish the race. I would like to put manufacturers and directors in a marathon race; I decide when they are finished, probably about. 20 minutes after they stop breathing.
