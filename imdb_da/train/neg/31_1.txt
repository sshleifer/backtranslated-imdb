This is the biggest insult to TMNT ever. Fortunantely is not officially found Venus in canon TMNT. There will never be a woman turtle, it took away from the tragic tale of 4 male unique mutants who will never have a family of their own, once gone no more. The biggest mistake went over the Power Rangers to TMNT with a horrible episode; the turtle's voices were wrong and they all acted out of character. They could have done such better work, better design and animatronics and NO VENUS. <br /> <br /> Don't bother with this people ... it's crooked worthy material. The lip flap was slow and unnatural. they completely disrespected shredder. The biggest baddie, some dragonlord guy was corny. the turtles looked corny with things hanging from their bodies, what about the case of raphs thighs? the stupid looking sculptural plastrons! <br /> <br /> If they looked normal, acted in character and relaxed Venus, get rid of the stupid kiddie cartoon sounds ... and better write it could have been good.
