Yes, CHUNKY, this is the nick name Donna Reed's romantic lead game by Tom Drake marks her! So let's get it straight away. From her first legendary role in THE GET-AWAY (1941) for her last, DALLAS (1984-1985) Ms Reed could NEVER be described as CHUNKY. Not this attractive and slender actress. If roles by M.G.M. rarely lived up to her talents. <br /> <br /> Mrs Reed is supported by a cast of competent character actors who unfortunately have to flock through this alleged "screw ball" comedy. Obviously, M.G.M. was out of their depth to make this type of movie. A type better produced at COLUMBIA, PARAMOUNT, RKO and even UNIVERSAL. Neither the 'Touch' of Ernst Lubitsch nor the power of Preston Sturges could save this movie. A fairly conventional romantic comedy that had all the markings of a pre-war training (WWII). <br /> <br /> If Irving Thalberg had still lived, the play would either have gone through a significant rewrite or never seen the light of day. It fit into Louis B. Mayer's 'safe zone' of no challenging family entertainment. A form that could not cope with the post-war challenges of the DeHavilland decision, loss of their theater chains, television and would contribute to reducing M.G.M.s. Fortunetly for Donna Reed is her best days ahead of her culmination in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY (1953) and her Oscar winner as Best Supporting Actress.
