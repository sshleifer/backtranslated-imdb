I like movies at the end of the day. I like B-movies. I was hoping I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> I could ignore the bad effects, the often terrible music, the cringe-inducing lines. I could ignore the unexplained events, and the fact that the film is constantly relying on deus ex machina is excusable, given the subject. I could ignore the fact that the people who are struggling with hunger and trying to reach world peace are the bad ones. None of these things kill the movie. What kills this movie is that it is simple and simply boring. Nothing actually happens; Almost all the scenes in the movie are designed to push the film creators' morals on viewers at the expense of actually having a coherent story or any kind of excitement. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for an entertaining B movie, look elsewhere. This movie is just boring.
