A woman's nightmare burns her fear of being buried alive. The cheating man wants her dead and decides to use her phobia by sticking her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement. Of course, the B-horror movie drink Brinke Stevens turns into horrible ghostly creature. The only reason to see this amateur junk girl is Michael Berryman in a really little cameo and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard. And the last twenty minutes of Brinke's bloody rampage is very fun to see. The special effects such as the ridiculous decapitated head are really awful. Look better at "Scalps" or "Alien Dead" again. Of course, I don't expect classic entertainment from Fred Olen Ray, but "Haunting Fear" is too boring to be fun.
