The only reason I looked at it myself was because I found it in my local library (and will relentlessly touch them on wasting public money on it), and despite the abundance of breasts and donkeys, it didn't take long time to realize that Fast Forward button was my friend. Horrible direction, pedestrian camera work, occasionally bad for almost passable plays, chintzy effects, and one of the worst screenplays I have had the displeasure of seeing vividly (as it was, terribly stunted and mutilated) in a long, long time Best grin actually comes from "making of ..." featurette, where the bad sap is involved in this HDV root attempt to justify their lame efforts as if they had been working on something special rather than something that would not be entirely forgotten next week. Wait! Apart from the fact that someone lured Tippi "The Birds" the honor of all people to do a lot, along with Kane "Friday the 13th" Hodder! How this happened, I never know, and to be honest, I don't care. Look at your own risk and do not say that you have not been warned. This is film making on his pretentious, craving worst. It only gets a 2 from me to have some pretty naked women, and even then just barely.
