This movie is a joke, and Quinton must be ashamed of himself and try to leave it as a Modesty Blaise movie. If you have trouble sleeping, then everything means renting this movie. The pins they call an actress who supposes to be Modesty Blaise must be the most boring person on this planet. Maybe she could be used as a hatred in the background of a real movie. Twenty-five minutes of nothing, thank you who ever invented the hotkey. If you see this movie, if you can call it, your path will be RUN. I can't help but think about what World War III could spend the money wasted by this crap. this movie is boring the actors are boring waste of color a waste air they breathe If you want to see Mostey Blaise Film then see it they made in the 60s, maybe what the director should have done.
