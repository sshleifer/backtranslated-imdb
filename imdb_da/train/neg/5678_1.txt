This should be one of the worst, if not the worst, movie I've ever seen. (I couldn't see it all the way through). Simply and simply, it is free violence just for its sake and the ridiculous storyline only adds to the lacking and incompetent filming. Ill. And only suitable for those with love for manic mutilation. After murdering hundreds of men, women and children, Seed is finally caught after he has murdered several police officers, who finally get a hint of his residence. He is doomed to death by an electric chair and miraculously survives! Buried alive, he digs his way out and plotted revenge on those who knocked him off and flicked the switch. Needless to say, more cruel murders follow ...
