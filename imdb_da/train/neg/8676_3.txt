Avoid the US version. It is with added American footage and the worst duplicate you've ever heard certainly made by New York amateurs. The headline is so bad that it sounds like the Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think a black guy from the Bronx makes Chiba's voice. I couldn't see the whole movie, it was so bad. Instead of this Americanized version, you can see Chiba's other greats like The Streetfighter or Karate Warriors.
