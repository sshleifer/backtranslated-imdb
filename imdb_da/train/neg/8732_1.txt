The foundation is about the death of young children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings. During the film, it seems that he has some problems with his daughter. Eventually, the serial killer gets caught. That is it. But before you find out who you are, you must see some horrible plays by all the actors. It's amazing how bad these actors are, including Hopper. I could go on like this, but too much of a waste of time. Just don't watch the movie. I've warned you.
