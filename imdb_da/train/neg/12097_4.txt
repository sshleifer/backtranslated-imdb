I didn't really hope much when I went to see this. After Mst3king, JasonX was with some friends, but I was hoping for a similar experience here. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film took over too seriously. Do I care about Jason's problems? I'm sorry no. There is a legion Ft13th movie covering it anyway. At the time of the day he is an undead serial killer, I just don't want to get it sympathetic. Freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the movie with hallucinations and what not, but unfortunately they were few and far between and at the end of the movie it was degenerate for a bad episode of celebrity deathmatch ... just not fun. <br /> <br />
