Yes, I got through it all, God knows why. <br /> <br /> It was a long afternoon, I had nothing to do, it was bitterly cold out, okay, it's all lame excuses, but they're the only ones I have. <br /> <br /> I gave The Darkling 4 stars out of a possible 10 - I've seen worse movies, but this one is certainly right here in the old garbage bin of poor cinema - poor script, poor acting, poor lighting and cheesy special effects. The storylin, which never makes sense, is about this simple little family, father, mother and little girl - that I assume the viewer must "identify" with, all three were boring and annoying. You just want the dark side to get all of them. <br /> <br /> Daddy is a cook whose hobby is cars. Father meets a rich man named Rubin, who collects cars and who also possesses a creature he has bought in the "mysterious" Orient. Ruby holds it in a bird cake and refers to it as "The Darkling". <br /> <br /> During the movie, Darkling is explained as 3 or 4 different things: a shadow without a person, the inner darkness that is in us all, and the devil. So consider what one of these explanations fits your fancy - because you trust it, it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> The Darkling's main problem seems to be that it needs to have a companion - it gets a human companion - and then it is finally dissatisfied with man. Of course, this leads to enormous wealth, followed by disaster, for the person who is associated with The Darkling. <br /> <br /> And for the rest of us - it just leads to a very long tired movie. <br /> <br />
