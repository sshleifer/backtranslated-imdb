First, I don't want to tell you why I rented this movie because I'm still confused myself ... Air Rage is like any movie I've seen where a plane is hijacked. There is of course an important person on the plane and the captain looking for revenge. The sad thing is that some of the methods to stop the creatures have already been used in other films. Should we really be so unoriginal so fast? Although it is Ice-T (which, for an unforgettable reason, makes painful attempts to perform while he is not busy putting "c" back in front of rap), who is glorified on the cover, the film actually stars less than amazing Kim Oja as a stewardess who is "surprisingly" overlaid by the five hijackers who of course come back to haunt them. As for the rest of the casting, the only person I managed to recognize was Steve Hytner, more commonly known as Kenny Bania from "Seinfeld". <br /> <br /> I can't forget to leave my favorite part of the movie as a hijacker used about a pound of plastic to blow a lock of a door ... BRILLIANT. The plot was unnaturally predictable. <br /> <br /> Scripture - horrible. It came to the point where I could say something that I felt would make a stupid comment and that would be the next line in the movie. <br /> <br /> With regard to special effects ... the only thing special about this movie is that I wasted the cost of electricity to run my TV and video for 100 minutes. <br /> <br /> And the title - the movie DID takes place in Air. But because of the smaller than the star's performances, the only rage in the movie was to the viewer. <br /> <br /> So if you're in the mood to pick a movie yourself, just because it's bad. Please SAVE YOURSELF, do not choose this.
