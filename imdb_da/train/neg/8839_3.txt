Nice trials and good ideas (redemption of the prostitute, people help each other out ...) but a bad result ... Of course, the director tried to imitate his French colleague Tran Anh Hung by recreating a mood supposed to depict Viet Nam .. The only problem is that this Viet Nam is far away, and when the "scent of the green papaya" had a historical background ... trying to project this kind of atmosphere (muted sounds and slow pace of life ...) on modern days leaves a sense of false. Besides that, it quickly creates a boring of boredom, and the result becomes too obvious. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the action takes place in Saigon or Da Nang because it is here, Harvey Keitel, ex-marine in the movie, was probably stationed during the war ... But in southern Viet Nam Speak no or very few people with the clip Northern accent shown by the actors ... Seriously odd even for a poor Vietnamese speaker. <br /> <br /> An old poet with leprosy ... very questionable (not a disease for people in his state), a peasant girl who can read and write extensive Vietnamese poetry ... ... even more dubious ... <br /> <br />
