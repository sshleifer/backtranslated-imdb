When I rented this, I hoped what "Fire of Fire" did not deliver: a clash of modern technology with mythical animals. <br /> <br /> Instead, I got a standard "monster hunts stupid people in remote building" flick, with bad script, bad music, bad effects, bad plot, bad acting. Bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave it a 2 was that in theory there could be worse movies. In theory.....
