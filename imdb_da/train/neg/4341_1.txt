It was so boring that I turned the DVD off ... maybe halfway through. It was so weak I couldn't even pay enough attention to tell you how far I was doing it. Although I really would think the picture of the young Carlito would be a little different, I just couldn't buy it. I really don't owe the actors, because I think it was the script that might have fallen flat. I found myself laughing a couple of times, but I don't think these lines should be fun. <br /> <br /> It is only saving grace that I bought it in a 2 DVD set and I would have paid the price I made for the original alone. This is one of the cases where they should have left the classic alone.
