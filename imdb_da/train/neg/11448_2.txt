In no way is this movie as bad as 'Perfect Stranger', but it just wasn't fun. It couldn't stick to a kind of comedy - it jumped from SNL, to Adam Sandler-esquire, to romantic, to little guy scoring big, to slapstick, to "Loser" (movie) types of comedies. Although there were some pretty funny slapstick moments (fallen down the hill) no one was very much fun or outstanding in any way. The 'Schindler's List' was more fun (and felt shorter). You never knew if Andy Samberg was in high school, a college dropout, or just a loser living with her mother - Sissy Spacek in her worst choice of roles. And poor Ian McShane, the serious actor, if I should just mention one, is allowed to read into the camera. The story draws and is completely predictable through the end (no spoilers here if Adam Samberg's mother wants to see it). Don't use any money to watch this movie, and maybe Lorne Michael's will get hints and start producing quality (Yes, Wayne's World and Tommy Boy's quality) movies.
