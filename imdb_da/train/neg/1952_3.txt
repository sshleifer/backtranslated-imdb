Scott Menville is not Casey Kasem. It is the first, most important and most disturbing thing about this attempt to recreate Scooby-Doo and the company. <br /> <br /> Shaggy's voice is creaking and doesn't sound like he's ever heard in any of the previous incarnations of Scooby shows. They have also changed clothes and the classic way to go from the original to. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what they're up to yet with the scoop angle, but it certainly doesn't follow formula used in any of the previous Scooby shows. <br /> <br /> And the animation style is very bizarre and distorted. I like it, but it's not real Scooby-Doo type animation. But the strange animation used for other WB shows grew on me; It can also. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing - once - if you can cope with the lack of proper Shaggy voice. That's enough to throw one out of enjoying the show properly. Besides, I'm not trying to be an inflexible, nitpicking fan. Develop or die as it says says. We see how it looks to two episodes - so I have formed a much more solid opinion.
