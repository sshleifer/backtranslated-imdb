This is the least scary movie I've ever seen. How blob manages to eat someone is the movie's greatest mystery. The block moves so slowly that another in a zimmer frame could escape it. The block has a great piece of happiness across a typical horror movie woman who, instead of running away, stands still for half an hour so she can be eaten. If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend you, it's too fun to be taken seriously.
