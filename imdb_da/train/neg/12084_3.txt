Tag: <br /> <br /> 1. A famous game <br /> <br /> 2. A director with now own ideas using <br /> <br /> 3. a copy of the stage design of a popular theater production of the game mentioned in 1. <br /> <br /> 4. an actress - who has no sense of the part he plays And you get: "Hamlet, Prinz von DÃ¤nemark" <br /> <br /> I listened to the radio game "Hamlet" with Maximilian Schell as Hamlet and I was so disappointed. I hoped that the filmed version would be better that Schell would at least have a body language to emphasize what he was saying - nothing. So the set ... the minimalist design is not everyone's taste, but I like it when there is just enough on the stage to clarify what is the setting and no more. Alas, it's at a stage in a theater. It doesn't work in a movie based on a game that actually has credible settings. That the idea for the set was copied from the theater production, where Schell already played Hamlet ... let's say if that was the only thing to complain about ... I wonder how Schell could get hamlet to be anywhere Initially, place and how someone could allow him to play Hamlet another time. If you have the choice to watch some of the about 60 movies based on "Hamlet", don't look at this unless you're a masochist or really hardcore or like to poker fun on non-specific actors.
