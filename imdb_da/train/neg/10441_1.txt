I stopped seeing this POS as soon as the snakes began to "take over" the plane. <br /> <br /> First, I thought maybe it should get a "one" for comic relief. But then I realized that I could only see the three stooges for free and laugh more! <br /> <br /> Whatever I have had for Samuel Jackson, it has been irreversibly destroyed. And Hollywood shows once again how removed from reality they really are. When I was a kid, we used to catch snakes for fun. The only thing that snakes would do is huddle in the bottom of the hold. And no amount of Hollywood comics can change that. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth traveling to Blockbuster. Be warned: if you pay for it, the only "victim" is your stupid ass. <br /> <br /> If you want to be really scared, I suggest the descent. If you want humor, go to your local stand up comedy club. Their worst performer will be a million times better than this trash can.
