Somewhere out there there must be a list of all the worst gay movies made every time. One is obliterating camera images of the stars, sitting and staring in the room, or where they focus unbearably on kitty kats eating spaghetti. This motion sickness image is a story of a boy and a boy, and they live and love and swim and are stuck in caves and one of them has a depressed mother, and another has no mother and they talk and go and swims and has sex and gets drunk and then breaks up and a person goes to the hospital for eight days and then comes out and there is very fast forward and rewinding, and there are long-lasting shots of one of those looking into the room or just sit and do nothing. I think it's a kind of gimmicky filmmaking technique or maybe it's that film is so bad that they have to fill it with long, wasted shots because otherwise if they were to rely on plot or story, the movie would be about 14 minutes. Don't make me wrong, it's about the 30th gay movie I've seen in the last 6 months, and some of them (most of them) have been very formal, predictable and boring, but this is a really horrible waste of The best so far was "Beautiful thing". So I saw this and after the very first opening image, which long and lingered, I thought, "Oh no, it's going to be creative sinful mah". But I gave it a chance and looked at it, and when it ended, I threw the DVD into the garbage. Sorry I didn't like it and if you did, sorry if I insult.
