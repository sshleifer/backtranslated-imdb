The "Secretary" is one of the cheesy, cliched, "thrillers" to be exposed to on a Sunday afternoon when there is almost nothing else. While the plot (a demented woman becomes jealous of anyone who succeeds her in the office and decides to do everything she can to stop them), can be one of a kind, I recognized countless plot phrases, probably taken from other TV movies that I had been exposed to for the same reason. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, I wasn't crazy about the cast. Mel Harris is one of the actresses who appear in so many television films as either a "mother" or a kind of "victim" for foul play or abuse that one has to wonder about the kind of life she is leading. In this one she gets the pleasure of playing a mother and a victim of psychic secretary Sheila Kelly, who was not a very good choice as the villain. While Sheila Kelly has made some good career moves (Singles, Breaking In, and I guess law and order), she is also obsessed with a number of pitiful TV movie roles, and this just adds to that. For the others, I have no clear memories of them, so it must say something. <br /> <br /> This will play on the Lifetime network (I think this is where I saw it), but don't bother to see it unless you're too sad. Not that it will make you more excited ...
