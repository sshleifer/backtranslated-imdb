AntiTrust could have been a good vehicle for Rachael Leigh Cook, but the director scared his best scenes. In the scenes she's in, she's just a zombie. She is involved in a sub-plot simulated for a sub-plot in "Get Carter", but she handles the subplot better in "Get Carter". (I blame the director) The director's greeting to Hitchcock was corny. (It is the scene where Ryan Philippes charactor realizes that he may not be able to rely on Tim Robbin's charactor, at least I think it is a tribute to Hitchcock. The DVD shows the scenes that were cut out. I think That the director should have confidence in his instincts and not listen to the test target groups.
