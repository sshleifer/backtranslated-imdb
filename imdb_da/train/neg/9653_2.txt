I just wonder what is the purpose of making movies like this? profits? and to whom they refer, which intelligence should use your brain to see something like this crap? This movie can be seen by under 3 year olds, if you are an adult, don't try to see it. That's why I think Hollywood started using cartoons in movies with actors like this, you must forget about the cinema's art. Make sure you get tons of popcorn to consume time to pass until this movie also ends up getting many colas hamburgers your laptop your mobile phone This movie can easily be used in a restaurant but certainly not in a theater. My dog, who is always next to my family when watching a movie, leaves the building. It is certain that this film refers to people without claim from the cinema art. The only thing that this movie can be used for is to watch it when making the supermarket's shopping list. I give 2 stars to support India's cinema effort, but nothing more or less ..
