Sam Mraovich should never be allowed to touch a camera again. If he does, he must be arrested on the spot ... at least for petty larceny. Anyone who pays a penny to rent some of his waste must file a claim and be compensated. This was innocently my first impression of his "work" ... and that will be my last. Ed Wood looks terribly good to me right now. <br /> <br /> When I return to this work for the video store, I will personally ask that it be taken out of the shelf. An active supporter of gay, I am annoyed and angry that this swollen, extraordinarily obscene male is allowed to distribute and pack something like this with a coltish beautiful boy on the front (Jamie Brett Gabel who fortunately has no other plays in IMDb) and an interesting synopsis on the back that is used as bait, and then markets it as a "movie" rental. Believe in me, this has no place to be on any rack anywhere; It is simply not a movie of any kind. Offensive, irresponsible junk like this can only be detrimental to the efforts to promote and support gay (hell, gay in general!) For those tempting to rent this out because of coverage, you will be disappointed. Gabel is not so flattering to watch movies as he is at the front, and he appears once or twice without a shirt - that's it. Instead, the homely Mroavich on his own obnoxious, apologized for the lovely naked nudity. <br /> <br /> This "thing" he "gathered" is a reverse vanity project for Mraovich. Both he and his friend Michael Habousch (who I understand, spreading similar dull waste) are terrible in this. Mraovich intentionally constitutes a complete no talent (in all areas), desperate to intervene on any "loser" attention he can for himself. He must be pitied.
