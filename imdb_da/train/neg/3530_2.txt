When Ritchie first exclaimed to the scene, his film was hailed as fun, witty, well-timed and original. If one could compare the hype that he had generated with his first two attempts and the almost universal disgust that his last two excursions have created to consider - has Ritchie found out? Is he really that talented? Does he really have some original original ideas? Or is he simply a pretentious and selfish director who really wants to be the Fincher, Tarantino and Leone all rolled into a colossal and disorganized pile? After seeing Revolver, one could be excused for thinking was it all went wrong? What happened to his great sense of humor? Where did he get all those mixed and collapsed ideas from? Revolvers are trying to be clever, philosophical, and concise, trying to be an intelligent psychoanalysis, trying to be a complicated and complicated thriller. Ritchie makes a gigantic effort to fulfill all of these many objectives and invests large pieces of a script for existential musings and many plot phrases. But in the end, it is only to construct a seriously heterogeneous, unstructured and ultimately unfriendly film to the audience. Its plagiarism is so sinful and obvious that even though Ritchie at least tries to give his own spin, he must be punished for trying to deliver it as his own work. So what the audience ultimately gets is a terrible manuscript intertwined with many pretentious onliners and clumsy pieces. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, Revolver is a non-original and bland movie that has stolen countless themes from masterpieces such as Fight Club, Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction. It is loud, but it is inevitable that the shoots are superfluous. <br /> <br /> Revolver deserves to be lambasted, it's a really bad movie, which is a strange masterpiece from a wannabe author. However, it falls flat on its Pharisaic face and just fails to know everything it will be and is achieved.
