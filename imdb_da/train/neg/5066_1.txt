This is the worst show. Buntch of adults act as children no humor nothing. Even Sesam Street has better humor and more adult than friends. "Friends" may be the worst I've ever seen on television, and I've been sitting in front of the tube watching friends. "Stacker simply isn't good for other, contemporary series. It lacks the intelligence of" Seinfeld "and the wonderful self-abandonment of" Frasier "pomp position. The characters in" Friends "seem to be designed to make them offensive This outrageous group of neighbors makes my meat creep. <br /> <br /> The unintentional show is completely without any edge, the characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is sophomoric - but deliberately. interesting to observe a writing session since writers may have to slave to aim lower than their abilities not to confuse the loyal friends of "friends".)
