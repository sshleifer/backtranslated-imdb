Only reason I saw 101 Dalmatians was its original song and costume design nominations for Oscars. I must admit that I was less than impressed with this movie. In this sequel, Cruella DeVil (by the way, Glen Close pulls this role out very well) is released from the hospital because of her good behavior. She likes all kinds of animals and unlocks all her fur. From then on, we only wait until she starts to have crises. Soon, she does and tries to make the best dress of the fashion world, of course for herself and from fine Dalmatian fur. Except for Glen Close, I found everyone thrown pretty stupid, but from a child's eye fun. That's fair enough, since its target market is, I suppose, children under 12 years. Absolutely great entertainment for kids and families, but didn't do much for me. * out of *****
