Ya I rented it, so shoot me! A decent premise puts an otherwise awkward story without real payout, but at least it's shot well. Director Jon Keeyes takes the simple idea of ​​a false haunted house with real danger inside. In most cases, this should be a slam dunk, but this little stink jumps quite quickly. The kinematics are above average, and the play is at best mediocre, but the story and writing are simply horrible. Slower scenes pull forever and the scares are too few and far between, with no real climax to the movie. An eerie mood has been set in the beginning, but it loses its brilliance before any kind of horror occurs, and I was sad and made another sandwich ... Cover art is appealing, and I assume it's worth the rent, If you are looking for fun low budget kills, but if you enjoy a good story and eventful ending, come up with something else.
