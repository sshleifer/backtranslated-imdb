She may have an Oscar and a Golden Globe, but this film shows why she is also a stubborn Razzie nominee. Making a movie that is so bad must be an indication that she needs money. She could advertise why you shouldn't talk on a mobile phone while driving, especially at night on the way to a crowded mall. <br /> <br /> Susan Montford should stick to producing (Shoot 'Em Up) as she is not as good as writer / instructor. <br /> <br /> She is accosted by four thugs in the mall and the first thing they do is tell her they have a gun. What is she doing? She begins to push and curse them as if she knows martial arts or something. She manages to get away, but is lost in the forest after crashing. Why didn't she drive to one's house? We get four bullies with weapons after a lady with a toolbox. Of course, their weapon is no match for her wrench. Ha! Of course, she also has a tire iron and a screwdriver. The poor bullies. <br /> <br /> Now she's home for Christmas - and she brought a gun!
