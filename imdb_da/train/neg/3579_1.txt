Immediately after renting and watching this movie several years ago, a friend and I decided that it defined the absolute zero on the film scale. There was nothing about the movie that could have been made worse than it was. To this day, we still consider movies, even very bad, of how much better than "The Lonely Lady" they are. <br /> <br /> A long time ago I saw an interview with Eleanor Perry, who wrote the screenshots for, among other things. "Last Summer" and "A Mad Wife's Diary" and she said she had been asked to write a manuscript for Harold Robbins' book The Lonely Lady. She said she sent a treatment and it was rejected because they did not believe she understood the difficulties of a Hollywood screenwriter. She said, "I think they got someone else to write it." The interview was filmed before the movie was released. She died in 1981, and I hit the first thing she did on entering heaven was personally thanking God for saving her from involvement in the result.
