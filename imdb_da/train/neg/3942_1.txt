Oh my god, what a horrible movie. The film has all the right people involved, unfortunately it is not worth seeing. I saw it for free at my local library. If I had paid to see this I would be even more sad. This movie is not available. How could Tarintino be involved in such a slow paced, unexciting movie. No wonder it didn't get much distribution, everyone involved must be ashamed. I can make a better movie with a dated video camera and my big toe. Its challenging, I really hated it. Tarintino just lost some standing in my eyes. This must be a kind of sick joke. Don't bother with this movie. If some even suggest, you should see it, kill them.
