I never read the book "A Wrinkle in Time". To be honest, do I really want it after watching the movie? Well, I shouldn't review this movie, I'll start with it. Next I will say that the TV movie is pretty forgettable. Do you know why I say it? Because I've forgotten what's going on in it. I told you it was forgettable. To be honest, no TV movie will ever be better than "Merlin". <br /> <br /> How do I describe a TV movie? I have never written a review for one before. Well, I'm just saying they usually have some celebrities. A wrinkle in time includes only one. Alfre Woodard (Or Woodward, I'm not sure), Oscar winner. <br /> <br /> The movie has cheesy special effects, a mildly interesting plot, scenes that make you go "WTF". The movie is incredibly bad and it makes you go "WTF". What did I expect? It's a TV movie. They are usually not good. As this is. A wrinkle in time is a waste of time and a great time consuming. To top it off, you will most likely forget the other thing it is over. Well, maybe not the other one is over. But within minutes. <br /> <br /> A wrinkle in time: * / ****
