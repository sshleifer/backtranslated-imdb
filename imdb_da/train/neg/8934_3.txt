I bought this DVD without any previous reference, but the names of John Huston, Raquel Welch, Mae West and Farrah Fawcett on its cover. I found the Brazilian title very strange, but I decided to look to expect to see a funny comedy perhaps as "Switch". However, the non-sense story is horrible and difficult to describe. Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed) is undergoing surgery to change his gender in Copenhagen, and he returns to Hollywood and says she must be Myra Breckinridge (Raquel Welch) and claim half of his uncle Buck Loner (John Huston) . During the days, Myra and her alter-ego Myron corrupt a young couple in her uncle's academy with kinky sex. At a certain moment, the cluttered manuscript is so confused that I think the whole story was just a thought of Myron that was caused by the accident. Unfortunately, the beauty of Raquel Welch and Farrah Fawcett is not enough to keep this flick. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Homem & Mulher At√© Certo Ponto" ("Man and woman up to a point")
