Surely, if you ask any mother who is the most beautiful baby in the world, she would tell you that her son is the most amazing child in the world. She is right, at least in her own world. <br /> <br /> The producers of the movie were biggie's mother and his good friend Puffy. Well, should I say more? I turn it down for those who don't want to make a simple deduction. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was fake. You can just put a few biggies MTV video together and call it a movie. The beautiful Angela Bassett played Biggies mother. The real in life resembles a dog. <br /> <br /> I'm just wondering why he called himself biggie small. Big body Little cock? Big mouth Little sound? Big fat little eyes? Disclaimer: I am a person of color. So keep your racist comment to yourself.
