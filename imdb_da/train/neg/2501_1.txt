I saw this on tv the second night ?? or rather I flipped over to another channel every so often to see infomercials as I couldn't stand it anymore. That was bad. Really, really bad. Not "so bad, it's good" just flat out bad. How was it funded? Who thought it was a good idea? An actress of my auditioned and was told he was not good enough to play a bad guy, but I think what they meant was "rode yourself and ran from this steaming pile of @ # $%." I bet the rest of the cast had the opportunity. To be fair, the play was difficult to judge because of the horrible fake American ascents. The shooting was dullllllllllll. The action was awkward and silent. The dialogue was inane. By far the worst thing was sent. In fact, the Interislander ferry is a shabby boat and on film it does not scrub well. Instead of trying very successfully to make it look like a new crew model with bits of tinsel wrapped around rusty polls, I don't kill you, they could change the script to explain or even celebrate the shabbiness. Stupid, Dum, Dum. Don't look at this movie, not even as a joke.
