I bought this video pretty cheap ex-rental, and thought that the cover looked pretty good. And it was nice, but the movie is a bin. I can handle B-class, I can even even enjoy a good B-hull (ie "Surf Nazis Must Die" is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be), but it was just bland gentle among. Incredibly boring scenes were broken up for sparingly good healthy cheap porn and entertaining dream war sequences. This movie has very little to offer.
