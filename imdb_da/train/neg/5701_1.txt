And then the great rewriting of the story continues with Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> This was pointless ridiculously bad. It shocks me that such an incredible amount of money can be used to produce what is the most perceived, ill-acted inaccurate movie I've ever seen. It's terrible. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage's brief flirting with serious action seems to be over. I can only assume that Leaving Las Vegas was a glitch in an otherwise litany of horrible movies. <br /> <br /> Diane Kruger proves that her performance in Troy was no fluke, she really can't act. <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel is ashamed of himself for working on such a trip. <br /> <br /> Only recommended for those who either recover from a recent lobotomy or people with an opinion that America invented the world.
