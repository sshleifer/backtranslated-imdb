I'm not sure if Carpenter seeks to raise questions about abortion and make the very heavy and obvious point that a woman should be aborted if Satan is the father, but it pulls again and again. Ron Perlman is ridiculous. The baby is really stupid in appearance, basically a crab with a baby's head mounted on it. You can basically see the material on Satan's costume. What a mess. This episode has about five minutes of history and 55 minutes of history. Very, very bad. And the end is just ridiculous. After learning that his child is dead, the devil destroys the abortion clinic and kills everyone in a huge, bloody, gory rebellion? NONE! He just puts his head down and swallows out of the room. Terrible.
