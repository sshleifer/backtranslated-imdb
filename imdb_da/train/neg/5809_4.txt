I can't see why filmmakers reminded this movie. <br /> <br /> The 1972 movie with McQueen and McGraw is almost a classic. Steve McQueen was an outstanding actor and Baldwin is only an inadequate actor. He has no passion in his game. Also, the action in the original "Getaway" was amazing. But remake has no action! It's almost boring despite the fact that the film production in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994. I don't understand the way Baldwin was imprisoned from Mexico. I think it's a mistake in history. So I think there was no need to re-insert it, or if they decided to recycle a classic, they should choose an excellent actor for the first role, Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ...
