Imagine pulling the mask off a deadly assassin and finding Barbara Cartland there ... that's what happens to this movie. The opening showed a promise, but soon all the omissions of being a thriller (or even an imaginative love story) fall, and the only reason they made this story becomes superfluous: to fill a gap in their female vision by create another new recognition of "misunderstood, frightening evil" (Andrei) meets innocent, whimsical beauty "(Paula). <br /> <br /> Instead of wasting some time creating an original premium, the filmmakers went straight after the money shot: The bad boy was tame by the whimsical beauty. Then a series of creepy and heavily cliched love scenes flowed with pseudo-philosophical / poetic fluff. Andrei's admission of being (eponymously) a 'poet' has been delivered to round off the perceived qualities that a Byronic hero should have - but even when we are told in heavily stressed writing who and what he is, it is still difficult to believe in it - or care. <br /> <br /> For a Byronic hero / antihero for work, history needs subtlety, style and innovation - all of which are completely absent here. This is not a modern opera phantom, it is just what happens when a weak and pretty stupid woman (with loose knicker elastic) dates a bad man who after meeting her seems just as dangerous as bunny slippers. <br /> <br /> The performances could have saved this movie if they had been good: the female leader is busy looking sexy and "World War II", no matter how forced or ridiculous it is; and poor Dougray Scott seems to have been the drug when he pushes through his part. This is not his best work. The mica of interest was brought by JÃ¼rgen Prochnow as 'Vashon' and Andrew Lee Potts as the young photographer / brother. A better movie would have offed the sister and held the brother instead.
