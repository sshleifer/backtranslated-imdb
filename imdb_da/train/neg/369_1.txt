I almost called HBO and demanded my money back for the month just because they sent this movie. I can just watch the movie experts around, "Okay, we need to come up with something like Home Alone, only we are adding a lot of money to the child, hiring actors and oh joh, we make it much less fun!" < br /> Okay, maybe not the last part, but that's basically what you got here. Not even worth seeing if someone else rents it. And as a movie for children? Forget it. I wouldn't let my kids see this, not necessarily because of bad taste jokes, but because I didn't want them to say, "What were you thinking about showing us to paralyze the trash bin, Dad?!?!"
