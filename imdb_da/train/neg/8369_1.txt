Since this image is classified as a "pure entertainment" work, and as there are already many comments on it, I would like to welcome something that is relevant to the abuse of humor. We can see that Marlon Wayans plays the joker role in this movie. Surely as long as he has been involved in the casting work, he has always acted like a little man - an actor can change his usual dress, but can hardly change his appearance - and the latter can be an advantage when needed. But far away from what I had expected, I saw a picture very disguised and pretended to exhibit various aspects of baby life by a mistaken 40-year-old criminal. And with a ridiculously happy end. So what's the point? Many elements are mixed together, some of the most important are violence, sex and criminal activities, the history of which is poorly composed and to some extent lacking sense: where is Vanessa when peace in her house is violated and persecuted man's life? In addition, the diamond is even larger than the world's No. 1 Cullinan! But the most boring facet is the continued attempt to make the little man a superman by showing his physical weaknesses. And they call it humor. A diamond is precious, hard and fragile; it cannot be cut by any other material, but only captured by the warm blood of a male goat. Therefore, it is no more a diamond but pieces of dirt.
