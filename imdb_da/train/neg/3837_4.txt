I've seen (too) many flicks from this company - this is about the middle of the package. The good side is a little more stylized and under control than some of their fare - less of the sophomoric attempts at humor and more respect for history (for what it is worth). Many of their titles, such as Sexy Sixth Sense, are buried by baaaad performances and an amateurish sensibility. On the other hand, I found the simulated sex scenes not as hot as some of their other flicks (like Vampire Vixens, Gladiator Eroticus, Spiderbabe or Mistress Frankenstein). <br /> <br /> Misty Mundae is always a 10 at Peter meter, which is Darian Caine. I found Barbara Joyce warm in a school marm and Ruby LaRocca a sexy little hottie. <br /> <br /> Watch this with the remote control in your (free) hand at night when you need a break from porn. Don't waste your time checking out the story - you have better things to do with your life. It's not a movie, it's purely T&A, but not bad by the standard.
