There are some movies you just know they are going to be bad from the frame one. Even if you were completely unaware of Ed Wood's work, you look at the commentary from "Plan 9 from outer space" and you just know you're not going to see the next filmy masterpiece. Just when I saw the first shot of Uwe Boll's masterpiece "House of Dead" with the guy sitting at the front of the house, his introduction began desperately trying to sound like he had just come from Sin City, I knew that i'm in a helluva ride. <br /> <br /> Then the movie starts like that - first, the protagonist says that everyone else should die. You know, to keep you wandering. Then he begins to introduce the rest of the characters with lines like "Karma .. think she's Foxy Brown" or "Alicia .. my ex .. we broke up recently ... I had to study and she had to fence" . No, I'm not talking. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this bunch of 20-somethings who couldn't get out of a wet paper bag goes to "Rave of the Century", rave a couple of tents, a port-a- potty and a scary scene located on a small island in the middle of the Pacific. Our gang missed the ferry, but fortunately we will find a way to get there, the way to be a fishing boat run by Kirk (Cpt Kirk? Get it? Man, who wrote this script is a genius) and his sidekick, who is a bastard child by Simpsons' Cpt McAllister and the killer who knows what you did this summer. <br /> <br /> To make the long story short, the band comes to the island, no one finds there except some bloody T-shirts and then decides to go hell away from there. No wait, they don't, they are actually all happy and like there are free booze. <br /> <br /> With that scene, the movie hits the rock bottom and then against all odds it goes further downhill. Some guys in rubber boots are starting to run around, there is some screaming and shooting, our gang goes to some house to meet another gang they leave the house, meets Cpt Kirk and a police force (who between them has about 500 pounds of money) arms) and then decide to go back to the house. Somewhere along the line, they are converted into a S.W.A.T. Hold, go into the matrix, the rubber boots start to multiply as bacteria, and I start crying because I actually paid to see this. To add insult to the injury, every few minutes, there are shots from the video game on which this crap is based, and there is a cute game-over-cut scene for a few characters when they die. <br /> <br /> I seriously hate this movie. It doesn't even fit in the famous "so bad, it's good" category. It's just pretty bad. The script is bad, the zombies are terrible, there are no tensions, lines are bad, actors are bad. The list goes on. <br /> <br /> You will probably see this movie just because of its reputation for being horrible. Do not do. There are bad movies that deserve to be seen. This is not one of them.
