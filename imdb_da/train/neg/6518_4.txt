The film is quite fun and involves in approx. Four dates, then it becomes an obvious advertisement for a guy you (and even his "friends") really can't stand. It is a beautifully interesting concept; movie dates on a quest to find true love in modern LA. The problem is that it feels incredible (and bad) script at times and obviously self-promoting. It's hard to worry about and be drawn into any of the characters because the author / actor is so egotistical, obscure, untrue and simply unlikely. You end up saddened by his dates.
