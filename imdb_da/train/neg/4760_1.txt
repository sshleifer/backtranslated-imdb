This recast of Anthony Shaffer's classic game did not last long in cinemas. Recently, I have a little through it on cable, I still congratulate myself not to waste money on a ticket. Director Kenneth Branagh, author Harold Pinter and star / producer Jude Law told himself that their prestige alone could sustain this travesty through an interminable 93 minutes without any fun or class of the longer original. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine improved his reputation by playing the second lead in the stunning 1972 movie. He now seems to have intent on destroying it by trying the lead played in the version of Laurence Olivier. (Both were nominated for Best Actor Oscars, but lost to Marlon Brando in GODFATHER.) When he looks puffy and lashed, Caine slips through the section with less depth than he shows as Batman's butler. He had already lowered himself to a guest appearance in GET CARTER's terrible remake. What's next - ALPHIA II, or SON OF MAN, WILL WANT TO KNOW? <br /> <br /> But no one benefits from this inane adaptation from Pinter, who thinks that frequent curse and an extra sexual angle can compensate for the absence of Shafer's witty character interaction. Branagh's direction relies on bluish lighting and a fun set of designs that wouldn't stick to another nightclub. Neither the shadows nor the tight, exaggerated close-ups can help Law overcome his dull screen persona. The result is a failure both as a straight drama and as a detective player, which means that you forget the purpose behind the title. <br /> <br /> Fans of the original stage production (with Anthony Quayle and Keith Baxter) and Olivier / Caine films would do well to regard this business as a bad dream. The late Mr Shaffer, who wrote the 1972 play, as well as Hitchcock's FRENZY and several Agatha Christie adaptations, must turn in his grave and wish he could plan a real murder or two!
