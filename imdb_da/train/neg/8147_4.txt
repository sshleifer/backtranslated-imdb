This movie was a confusing piece of waste. You never knew what was going on. The characters were poorly written and mostly they were completely unsympathetic except Gus (played masterfully by George Eads). I hate this movie, but compared to others (Dark Harvest, Dracula's Curse) it should have won an academic award. It was particularly sad to see a talented actor like George Eads in such a disgusting and sticky movie. Life you've sunk to brand new low. Someone has to make sure that this director never works in movies again. It should also be a horror movie because it was much more fun than scary. For shame Life, For shame.
