A novel by Remarque. A casting that looks good on paper. A leftist is struggling to stay in Paris between the war. A Gestapo officer undercover. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that there is no synergy here. The bits and pieces never gather. <br /> <br /> Stories of leftist refugees in France need not be so boring. Read Arthur Koestler's memoir "Scum of the Earth" (if you can find it). Or his chilling "Dialogue with death" (ditto). For me, the only interest in this movie is in some of the random details. <br /> <br /> The wires spend a lot of time drinking calvados, the Norman apple brownie. I welcome any call to have a nip calvados myself. It certainly made this movie seem to pass faster. But according to the film, it is only sold in low-cost, low-cost salons. Vive le tabac parisien! I say so. References to intoxicating fluids are abundant here; It seems to be a concern for the scenario artists. I enjoy movies in France because it can be fun to wait for the inevitable full-fledged ad on a wall in the background. I was not disappointed. This time it was for Byrrh, a very unusual choice. This movie would judge a 10 if we only judge it on the refinement of its spray paintings. <br /> <br /> The film's disinterested score is by Louis Gruenberg. Gruenberg is best known - if you can call it that - for his opera "The Emperor Jones", based on the O'Neill game. It premiered at about the same time as the movie version with Paul Robeson. The opera survives today in a recording or two by Lawrence Tibbett. Again it had to be surface again; The opera seems to be an appropriate subject to mention here when Charles Boyer's character works under his "Czech" aliases. Two of them are "Wozzeck" and "Gunther", both prominent roles in German opera. Is it just coincidence? <br /> <br /> Drops of name just seem to be part of this movie. Note that they call "Himmelstoss" on the phone. Himmelstoss accidentally is one of the main characters in Remarque's former "All Quiet on the Western Front". <br /> <br /> Now it's in the jokes in place; Guess there was no time to develop any drama.
