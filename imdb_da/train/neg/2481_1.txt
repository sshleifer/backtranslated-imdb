I had never heard of Larry Fessenden before but judged by this effort to write and lead, he should keep his day job as an actor. Like many others here I do not know how to categorize this movie, it was not scary or scary so it cannot be called a horror, the plot was so wafer thin it cannot be a drama, there was no excitement, so it cannot be a thriller, it's just a bad movie, you should only see if you were the fan of the Blair witch project. People who liked this movie used words like "ambiguity" and complex and subtle, but they read into something that wasn't there. Like the Blair witch, people were afraid because people assumed they should be scared and bought in some guff that it was scary. This movie actually started well with the family "meeting" the locals after hitting a deer. It looked like a modern edition, but then for the next 45 minutes (well over half of the movie) nothing happened, the family potted about their cottage, which was very nice and dandy but not the least entertaining. It was obvious that the locals would be involved somehow at some point, but Essendon clearly has no idea how to build excitement in a movie. Finally, when something happens, it is not even clear how the father was shot, how he dies (the nurse said his liver was just the grass), and all the time, this wendigo spirit apparently strikes the apparent shooter on a lot. clumsy way with 3rd class special effects. The movie is called Wendigo, but no attempt has been made to explain it in a clear way. The movie ends up confused and leaves you very dissatisfied. I would have bailed out with 15 minutes to go, but I wanted to see if this movie could fix itself. It didn't.
