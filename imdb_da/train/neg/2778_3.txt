This movie seemed to have gone all over with good camera, sound, movies, sets, music, costumes ... but drum roll spoke Gary Stretch! I don't know if it was his bad action or simply a bad script, but would say it was both. Given the cast of him in this role, I found it difficult to mess up for himself in the end. I wanted him to be dead in battle or one of the swords / knives. <br /> <br /> So was the pinnacle of the plot killing the king because the king didn't have dinner and sex with his queen? Beautiful lamb. And to go to the extreme to kill his own son? And then push her lover as a subsequent king? I see a thread or two here and there of historical bytes, but the way this was presented was farcical. I don't recognize Gary Stretch from anything else, but he was horrible. I read another user's comments on sound being called, but don't think he was called ... does he speak English, doesn't he? It was really terrible. The lines were read straight out of the coroner table ... flat-line. It might be that he just didn't have the voice to carry tone fluctuations. <br /> <br /> Apart from this, I saw it at the end, so the movie had at least an "interest". It could have been more if the manuscript / lines and casting had got more work. The landscape and movie crew along with very good quality movies are what really made this movie above all else. The casting and history were all secondary. I give the movie staff a 10.
