I saw this regurgitated pile of vignettes tonight on a preview screen and I was just blown away by how bad it was. <br /> <br /> First, the film flaps almost its blind blind spots. There are no black or gay New Yorkers in love? Or who do the self-employed white people say in love? I know it's not the love crunch of ammunition-tangible inclusivity, but you can't pretend to have a cinematic New York with these rather widespread members of society. Plus, you know the people who produced this ish thought Crash deserved the ham-handed Oscar, so where's everyone? <br /> <br /> Possibly worse than the bizarre and intentional socio-economic ignorance were the downward offensive chapters (remember when you were in high school and people were openly despised by beautiful young women in wheelchairs? Me either). This movie ran the spectrum of ways to be the worst. Poor acting, poor writing, poor management - everything spans any possible genre that ever concerns wealthy white people who smoke cigarettes outside of fancy restaurants. <br /> <br /> But thank goodness they finally got powerhouses Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson together again for the Jumper reunion. And aside, Uma dodged a bullet; Ethan Hawke looks devastated. This, of course, is one thing about his appearance, but added an incredibly scary extra vibe of cruelty to his scary scene scene opposite poor, lovely Maggie Q. I had a terrible time choosing my least favorite scene for the end of the movie questionnaire, but it must be Anton Yelchin / Olivia Thirlby bit for the sheer lack of taste that mourn me because I really like these two actors. I don't even consider myself slightly offended, but all I could do was scoff and look with disgust as a person's 50-year-old aunt. <br /> <br /> In close proximity to this incredibly tight competition for horrible things, Shia LaBeouf's tone is deaf depicting what it means for a former Disney Channel star to act against Julie Christie. I do not mean the opposite, I mean against. Courage is the only explanation. I now realize that the early order with Orlando Bloom is a relative highlight. Climax. Be aware of this when your brain begins to leak your ear shortly after the opening credit, which seems to be a nod to the first New York Real World. This movie is embarrassing, strangely dated, unarticulated, ineffective, pretentious, and finally divorced from any real idea of ​​New York at all. <br /> <br /> (The extra star is for the Cloris Leachman / Eli Wallach sequence, as it's actually pretty sweet, but it's just a bright spot in what feels like hours of meaningless masturbation.)
