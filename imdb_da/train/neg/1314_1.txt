This is the worst piece of shit I've seen recently. There is nothing good about this movie. The reason is simple stupid, dialogues make no sense, humorous scenes have never heard of the real humor. Actors just don't play, the worse they don't even try. The script itself is something that is in the same league with Ed Wood and Uwe Boll. There is only one good thing in this flick, the fighting. They are well choreographed as one would expect from Hong Kong guys and are the only reason to see the sun's prince. Even though I think the fighting just fills the empty space so you don't have to think about the story. But this weak and absurd plot can prevent you from seeing it at the end. Avoid it unless you are a fan of dragon lady Cynthia Rothrock.
