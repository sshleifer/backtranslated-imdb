VILLA RIDES (1968) turns out to be a big disappointment! And even though Sam Peckinpah had a hand in the manuscript with Robert Towne, it still appears as a sounding movie that is dry directed by the unmoved Buzz Kulik. Firstly, top image Yul Brynner as Pancho Villa is wrong for that part! He is not charismatic enough to play the great Mexican revolutionary! His one-note performance lacks the fire, and gusto Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland could have brought the role. Brynner simply looks like a Russian aristocrat dressed up as a Mexican bandit in the midst of the Mexican Revolution instead of the Russian. Also another picture Robert Mitchum is completely wasted in the picture! His part as a biplane flying ace lobbing homemade bombs from the air in the cause of the revolution is a poorly written lean role that could have been played by any smaller star. Mitch does not have a decent line throughout the movie and, in his opinion, brings his second Mexican revolution picture to the far superior "Bandido" (1956), which unfortunately no one seems to have any interest in publishing on DVD. Besides missing any kind of style "Villa Rides" also suffer badly without the presence of a female star! There is starlet Grazia Buccella as a young Mexican girl giving Mitchum the happy eye, but her casting is only perfunctory. Someone like Claudia Cardinale or Jean Peters might have added a few badly needed notches to the exciting story. <br /> <br /> There are a few good action scenes in the movie, but a few good action scenes do not make a movie spouse and the less than perfect Panavision image quality plus the repetitive Maurice Jarre theme tune doesn't help. <br /> <br /> As Paramount is used to, there is no extras - not even a trailer! Yup, a disappointing movie and DVD presentation that could have been and should have been a whole lot better.
