Lorenzo Lama's stars as a kind of CIA agent, capturing an exotic beauty called Alexa, kidnaps her daughter and forces her to fight with her former employers. O.J Simpson is also on board to give a dash of acting credibility to the not so talented ensemble. I must admit that I'm not a fan of Lorenzo Lamas, or his movie. He stinks But in comparison with O.J Simpson and Lamas' comatose wife Kinmont, Lamas seems like ah, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I only saw the CIA because of the renewed interest around the O.J Simpson test. You can see because if your parents had cable and the extra channels, you couldn't avoid this movie. In 1994, you could go to an Amish community and some moron would have this game in their portable TV. The movie itself is a collection of lame action sequences and would be intrigue, though the shock value of O.J Simpson jumping for fireballs and exchanges would be a liners giving some unintentional humor. Also where was Bobby Knight and Kobe Bryant making this a complete camp classic? <br /> <br /> * out of 4- (bad)
