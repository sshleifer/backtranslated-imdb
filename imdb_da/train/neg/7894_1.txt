Unless you are an evangelical Christian, you do as an Egyptian and avoid as the biblical plague. Awful - why oh why does IMDb show the most favorable reviews at the top of the list - it was due to one of these, which I just wasted at the end of what started as good evening on this folding disc. The basic principle started strong enough - I was drawn into the film and was interested right up to the point where Bible preaching took over. It's a waste. <br /> <br /> This movie has so annoyed me that I registered with IMDb for the first time just to complain about it - at least I hope that doing so will save someone else's evening. /> <br /> Hay - what a Christian action on my part ;-)
