This movie is incomprehensibly bad. It begins with several random explosions and then cuts to a sock of a T-Rex talking (!) To the audience. It goes back and forth between the sock and animation all the time, probably because the filmmakers cannot afford live actors. I'll save you the long, tiring, relentless plot that pulls this pitiful movie into a brutal 85 minutes. <br /> <br /> One of my friends found this very rare video in a hobby store somewhere selling print b movies, and he bought it for the sole purpose of making fun, but it didn't show that our intervention was necessary. This movie makes it fun by itself better than we could. <br /> <br /> I thought Ed Wood's "Plan 9 from Outer Space" was the oddest movie in existence, but let it be for Japanamation / Lego cars / Sock popping over him. If you see this movie everywhere, buy it without hesitation. It is very rare and worth many, many good laughs.
