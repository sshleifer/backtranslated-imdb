No plot, crappy acting and endless gore .... This should be a horror movie? There is no fear or excitement, just BOOM BANG GORE, so done. Some kinda marines are in the desert for a bit of strange, crazy reason and they are being chased by the mutated animals from the first movie, which was good and it should have been left behind. <br /> <br /> This is just another excuse for money and the use of meaningless violence, like the "Saw" sequels. They know how meaningless the plot is and the more they can add, people will see it. I miss good excitement horror movies. Come on Hollywood, you can do much, much better.
