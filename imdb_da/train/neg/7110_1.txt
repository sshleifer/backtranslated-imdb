Well, you have to give the director credit for how gutsy he was. Gutsy would be the right time. Not only did he use a total throw of five people (no extras at all), but he also decided to use sub-parameter effects with a confusing and boring plot, he too, and I don't shout, put a warning at the beginning of the movie as you may die of fruit !!! But they promise a FREEEEEE COOOOFFFFFFFIIIINNNNN. Having a spooky gardener is always a good move. Yaaa-unique-aaawwwwnnn .... <br /> <br /> If you see the Mystery Science Theater 3000, you may have seen this. They like to show horrible movies just to tell you. <br /> <br /> A great gift for someone you hate.
