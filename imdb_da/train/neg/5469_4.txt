This movie may have weak production values, but it also does so well. The special effects are gross and well done. My favorite part of the movie was Chrissy played by Janelle Brady. She is super warm and also has a good nude scene. Robert Prichard as head of the band is fun, like the other members. This film actually tries to make a point by saying that the nuclear waste sector is bad. 4/10 Fair comedy, gross out movie.
