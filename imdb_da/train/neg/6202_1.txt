I saw the whole movie through to the shameful end, even though I felt so sad about what I saw. I felt the director screamed for attention, and the only way he could achieve this was to be as repulsive as possible. Since I have lived in the UK, I have come to love this country, but this movie shows British youngsters in the worst possible way. There is nothing to say but avoid it, it will make you sick and sick. The people involved must be ashamed.
