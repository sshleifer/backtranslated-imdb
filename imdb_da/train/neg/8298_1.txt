This movie was not very entertaining, certainly not there as original or as good as a Christmas story. The characters (except the youngest) try to imitate the previous actors and they fail. Hillbilly neighbors come out of nowhere as they were not part of the first movie. This really sucked, could have been good with the original cast, so again maybe not because the story is so weak. Skip it over.
