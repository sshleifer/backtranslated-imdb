This movie . . . I do not know. Why they would take such an unfavorable character as Pippi Longstocking and cast the uniquely charmless Tami Erin I will never know. Why they would spend money on artistic direction and some non-all-that-bad special effects, so don't bother to edit it properly, I will never know. Why the sets and costumes are sometimes at times, and sometimes bizarre, why they ordered such bad songs, so the script doesn't make any sense (not even at a stupid, children's movie level). . . . what did they think? Nothing about this movie is just as it should be. Every single part is called (and always bad), every sound effect is a little wrong, every edit is in the wrong place, each performance is bad in some way. It succeeds in creating a suitable atmosphere in spite of all the problems, but it never captures the magic that is Astrid Lindgren's creation.
