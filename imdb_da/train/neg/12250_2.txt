By seeing Tobe Hooper's pearl, Crocodile, in 2000, I developed a great interest in college / crocodile niche in exploitation / monster genre. I look forward to a sensible producer to follow up with several successors to these lovely bonbons of goodness. If only Ed Wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts. With Ed writing the scriptures, and a room full of monkeys that create crocodile-special effects on a computer, all we would need would be a molded crown food with Russ Meyer breasts and Ren Hoek pectoral implants. <br /> <br /> While Tobe Hooper's crocky opus caters to his own films, Blood Surf chose to separate a bunch of aging themes from the chum bucket of other movies. See if you can see past Nerd's succession to find allusions / homages? / Rip-offs for Jaws, Temple of Doom, Indiana Jones' Last Crusade, The Convent, Godzilla 2000 and any James Bond movie. Also try to find ready for TV dishes, where the editor gave up to make sense of the warehouse. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed that crock didn't get to try his sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmental science ... or crocky appreciation, but history's quasi-captain Ahab gets his tour de force speach. Perhaps in the coming years we will see a crock galloping out for a shootout in a golden sunset. Or hopefully, a monkey will be washed down in the toilet by an international space station for the midgets and enjoy the exploding drum of zero-G monkey / midget / crocodile bloodshed. <br /> <br /> All in all, the lack of a whammy bar in surfing music irked me.
