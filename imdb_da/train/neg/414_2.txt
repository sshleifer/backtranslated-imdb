Go into this movie, you know this is movie has six lab technicians in a sealed lab with an invisible lunatic. So, right away, you guess who will live and who will die. The survivors end up being exactly what you expect them to be, so no points of plot are there. <br /> <br /> And if you're not sure if this is a B movie or a movie just happening in a lab with an engaging story, William Devane plays a role: immediate B movie status. <br /> <br /> The movie is promising at first. In the laboratory, we are introduced to the invisible gorilla that is becoming increasingly violent. Oooh, foreboding. The best scene in the whole movie is when the lab team makes the gorilla visible again. Great special effects. Same thing when they make Bacon invisible. <br /> <br /> There are a couple of blonde breasts, a real lame dirty joke and enough in place to give this movie an R rating that it really didn't need. <br /> <br /> For a thriller, there were really no surprises, except when Shue does like MacGyver in the freezer, which is more of a 'Whaaaa?' Okay, that's a surprise. That's when Caine (Bacon) comes back one last time in the elevator shaft. It was a surprise, but only because you shout at TV, 'Noooo! You're already dead! Quit the movie! "Talking about shouting on the TV, that was all I did in the last 25 minutes or so. 'Turn on your f # @% ing goggles!' Instead of putting on their infrared goggles so they can see him, they try every second trick in the book (fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems). <br /> <br /> The story eventually lost it. But the special effects were good; That's the only reason I give it a 2/10.
