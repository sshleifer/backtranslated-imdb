This movie has some of the worst plays I've ever seen! Some scenes are original, such as the nails coming through the floor. This nail trap captures these bad guys. The rest of the movie breaks down as you walk. I can't believe this movie isn't even in the bottom 100 movies all the time. I also can't believe there are successors! The next crap movie I want to see is R.O.T.O.R. Could R.O.T.O.R really be much worse than this? <br /> <br />
