i love horror movies, low budget, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s .. but how can anyone believe it's a very good scary movie? Let's compare it with titles in a similar haunted house movie. Haunting, changeling, the shiny. or for a similar technology based horror movie that was FAAAR better (but still FAR from large) Demon Seed. OK, I want to be fair .. let's compare it to TV-tailored movies! don't go to bed .. waaay creepier and better done. salem is very, night stalker, night gallery, not even going in the basement or crowhaven courtyard was far better. * SPOILERS * first and foremost, because as good a scene as the bloody shower scene was, you have a scene like the opening scene .. oh boy! The honeymoon comes alive to extinguish some fresh teens! TERRIBLE. also what we understand about the house. It should apparently use its camcorders to see what's going on, and it's a very emotional house. Not a spirit or demon or unity, it is a house that is "obsessed" but of what? we are led to believe in a lifeless object learned to love suzie / margaret, our protagonist? now that i am on the subject suzie .. another scene that bothered me in general, this poor old crazy lady is going to tell you she was your nurse, throwing her heart out, falling into the boiling pool, fighting in pain for 45 seconds, and what does margaret do? Does she risk her hands being burned to save this poor, older woman who came to warn her life? no, she's standing there looking! The action was mostly better than the average for a horror movie, but this is positive than that. For at least a more interesting and fun horror movie about a lifeless object that kills people, the deathbed sees the bed that eats. I have a sense of the people who have judged this so high, either have not seen it since it originally broadcast or remembered that they scared them as children. This movie was pretty much deserved less.
