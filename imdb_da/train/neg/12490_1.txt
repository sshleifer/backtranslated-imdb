I own this movie. I bought it for $ 3.99 at a fairly large video retailer to do some "indie" movie research when I just finished my own function and edited it. Now, when I feel about my skills as a first-time instructor I just sit down with a plate of cookies and Severed. Within minutes I feel good !!! <br /> <br /> I hate talking to another filmmaker so I just want to use constructive criticism: 1. Find good actors. the time. It really helps 2. When you record video, your scenes and darken in the computer light up later in the post. 3. Close-ups are better for Video 4. When an actor enters a scene, wait a bit before <br /> <br /> make them talk so we know what's going on and who's talking. 5. Never show the back of a door while waiting for someone to open it. Damn worth $ 3.99 <br /> The true Horror would get reviews Severed has here on IMDb. And you have to give these guys credit ... they were distributed.
