It's the kind of movie that everyone involved should be embarrassed about. Bad steering, over the top action and a plot falling on without any other point than showing violence. I thought when I first saw it might be a satire in the media and how it shows violence, but it is not. I'm not sure what makes the movie worse. Oliver Stone makes his worst rule ever. From scenes where Woody Harrelson's face morphs for no reason or Robert Downey Jr's terrible performance as Wayne Gale, a reporter who seems to be quite bonkers, this movie is simply a mess.
