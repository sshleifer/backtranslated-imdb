As some other comments show, this movie can scare you when you are a young child. (And that's probably all it's good for.) <br /> <br /> But if you're older, this movie only makes one thing: suck majorly - and so I don't mean the acting, its soundtrack, cutting or s.th. such. I'm just talking about "plot" (if you can call it). <br /> <br /> SPOILING FORWARD ------------------------ <br /> <br /> I don't want to give any more spoilers than necessary (if you have read this, you will really see the movie), but if you are educated from a school, it is just a great insult to your intelligence. When I looked at this, I was stunned most of the time, for what happened was just so stupid. <br /> <br /> This includes: <br /> <br /> the formation of UNITE (an evil UN association) <br /> <br /> -> we just have to believe it's evil. is it even evil at all? if so: why is it bad? <br /> <br /> - the badge of evil in the form of a tattoo <br /> <br /> -> there is no need to impose this on the people, so why hell (no saying calculated) do they? <br /> <br /> - Invite Christ to your heart only as a relief tool <br /> <br /> -> because there is no one in this movie considered "a true Christian" ever does say it stupid prayer. So ... just say the prayer before rapture, and you're saved - no matter what? <br /> <br /> Consider 1/10
