Don't watch this movie. Bad plays and stupid effects. A complete waste of time. I was hoping to see a lot of beautiful murders and hot chicks, instead of the director relying on expensive slaughter videos to shock you, the guard. Disgusting. The murders are rather paralyzed, basically suffocation. A woman he eats worms in his mouth, he puts raw hamburgers on her face and strangles her. BTK = BTK broiler, burger king "killer" new sandwich .... ha ha. I don't think this movie was too much on actual facts. I think the real BTK killer didn't bring around a bunch of rodents, scorpions and worms .. and oh yes ... also a slaughtered cow head. Go figure.
