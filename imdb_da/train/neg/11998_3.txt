this is a horrible, horrible movie !!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> First of all, TOOO long. the longest movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The stories are all too damn over the top !!!! <br /> <br /> In fact, there are too many stories that the story line is destroyed. <br /> <br /> The comedy wasn't comedy !!!!! it was not fun at all .... the story is so repulsive and poorly written that it doesn't matter if the characters live or die ....... <br /> <br /> I had some expectations from this movie ......... but my expectations were completely broken in the first few minutes ...... the only good thing about this movie is the music ...... and of course Vidya Balan. she gives the best performance and stands out among all the top actors ...... she is just a new comer and yet she shines and makes the rest of the cast look so pathetic !!!!! Govinda and the Blonde who play their love also help save this disastrous movie. Govinda fits perfectly with the taxi driver's role. And Blonde also gives a very subtle and consistent performance .... Another talented actress Ayesha Takiya is totally wasted in this movie !!!! so is priyanka !!!!!!!!! Akshay does its part well, but it also seemed over the top !!!!! Anil and Juhi are also completely wasted ...... <br /> <br /> The only one who is not wasted is Salman because he has no talent whats ever wasted !!!!!! !!! <br /> All in all, this is a very impossible movie with Mishmashed manuscript and TOOO Masladar that the story is shaped according to the stupid comedy scenes. imagine how stupid this movie is !!!!!! <br /> <br /> 3/10 it's four hours long !!!! think and RETHINK before going to the movies !!!!! better avoid it !!!!!
