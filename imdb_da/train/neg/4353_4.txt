The class is a comedy series depicting a group of 27-year-old former classmates. <br /> <br /> I like the idea of ​​the show. That is why it ensures that the class is not fun, even if it has the obvious potential. It's not enough corky, just dorky. (Haha.) This is due to a slow pace and the lack of actually hilarious battle lines. Some actors also have problems with timing. Most of the inventively written characters are the twins Kat and Lina Warbler (Lizzy Caplan and Heather Goldenhersh), but even they just seem a little too square for the show's good. On the other hand, the characters I find most uninteresting are the main character Ethan and the one used to connect Duncan and Nicole. <br /> <br /> What bothers me with the series is that the only Latin character Aaron is picked up for his accent (though by a non respectable character, yet).
