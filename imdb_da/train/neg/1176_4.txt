Revolutions always present opportunities for dramatic films, as most revolutions are in themselves dramatic events. Unfortunately, the movie that this movie lacks in drama is compensated for by superior boredom. You don't care who wins, loses, dies or lives - just finish it as soon as possible. This is largely due to what seems to me to be superficial use of background technology. Scenes in Paris and the French countryside have a cardboard quality about them. They might be better done at a mere stage and left that way. One cannot expect the amazing effects of "The Flying Daggers House" or "The Golden Compass", but it is a 2002 digitally mastered production. Signs appear to enter a scene to enter a scene, so much that you lose count the number of times that come in and leave the premises. In my opinion, this film is the French Revolution of the 1790s in the "papier-mache" revolution of a "papier colle" world.
