Think of this movie as a Saturday morning live-action program from the parents page. Even the little ones will find this a hard to please because it runs like molasses! I can't quite understand how god it is to do something typical and uninteresting, especially in the costume department! Too many warrior wizard movies out there have used the same old plotline many times over, but it's a lot sharp considering its appeal to the little darlings. And who in the world would have let a topless mermaid be thrown in the first place? I thought it was a "family" movie! MST3K, here's another nice gem for your 1999 TV season!
