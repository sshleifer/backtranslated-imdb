Julia Roberts, of course, makes a concerted effort to discourage her teddy bear Pretty Woman persona with this pointy spousal abuser thriller, but it's hard to imagine she ending up making a performance so powerful and compelling (and Oscar wins) as she did in Erin Brokovich based on the back of this rubbish. And no bones about it, it's just a Julia Roberts vehicle, but unfortunately her performance is not the most insidious thing about it. <br /> <br /> The reason has all the markings of a late night made-for-cable and not be under the impression that it will provide some insight into the dark world of domestic violence because not of the characters is Outlined enough to make you really fit. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, disappointing and unsatisfactory, without Robert's name over the title, I'm sure it would be completely flopped, deserved.
