I'm surprised everyone (even the critics) seems to think it was a good movie. It was the most clich√© thriller ever made that I have seen. We have the 'bad guy' who wants to force the 'good guy' (or girls in this case) to do something or get the consequence. The 'good girl' in this movie will use her smarts and skills to defeat the 'bad guy' and save the day and her beloved. Use charisma, courage and confidence to save the day. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Well a young woman named Lisa Reisert meets with a young man named Jackson Rippner (lovely name) at an airport. A coincidence leads to another, and soon it seems that fate brings these two together. Sharing drinks sitting next to each other seems to come together in every way ... Is there more to this strange thing? Could these two be for each other? Does 'fate' have a reason for their strange and random encounter? <br /> <br /> Well, as it turns out, unfortunately yes. Jackson is going to Lisa to help him murder the director of Homeland Security by moving him from one room to another so that his men can start an attack on him. Oh, if she doesn't do this, her father is dead. Although we never learn the exact reasons why and who really is behind this madness, Jackson explains more how this will happen and why is it in Lisa's best interest to help him. <br /> <br /> Of course, Lisa beats his evil plans with her smarts and poking him in the neck, raising his chairs and hitting him with a hockey stick. Oh, and before that, she drives him wildly through Miami airport, where she passes post 9 11 security and steals a car she later uses to run over the man ordered to kill his father. <br /> <br /> Yes, right. <br /> <br /> First of all, I find it strange that a man like Jackson, who can get his hands on high tech weapons, needs help from a hotel manager. Couldn't he just sneak a bomb into the building? Wouldn't it make it safer for him and his team to discharge any third parties? And why do characters like Jackson explain everything they have to do for someone they threaten? Doesn't it make it easier to stop them from the same people? <br /> <br /> The actors did their best in view of the movie they were given. Racheal McAdams and Cillian Murphy are still actors to watch out for. I also think Jayma Mays (who played 'lovable' Cynthia) will be someone we want to see more of. It's just too bad that they were all stuck with this. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10
