I quote Oedpius Rex because it is a tragedy that this film was made by itself! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I am by no means a Uwe Boll hater like most of the humorous people on IMDb! <br /> <br /> Uwe Boll movies like Postal and Tunnel Rats are hilariously bad and therefore entertaining. But honestly, this movie was just awful. I hated it so much that I would give it a zero star rating if I could. The story is just shit! It spends four-fifths of the film building the plot, and then they have the middle, just scenes of grizzly terribly tastefully made murder! Finally, it ends with a "villa winner ending", which is perfectly acceptable but it could certainly have been more tasteful than this! <br /> <br /> I'm not against Uwe Boll (as I said earlier) nor against violent movies! I love royal violent movies! I loved the Saw movies, the Hostel movies, the Tokyo Gore Police, the New York Ripper, the 28 movies, the Dog Soldiers, My Bloody Valentine, the Last House for the Left, the Guards, the Wolf Creek, every Tarantino movie, every Sam Peckinpah, even Cannibal f ** King Holocaust! But this! OMFG !!! <br /> <br /> This was just cruel, sadistic and perverted! And look at the movies I just mentioned! If I liked the cannibal holocaust and not this then it must be bad! Uwe, don't go dark again! You're fun when you're light hearted, like Ed Wood. This was just a horrible experience! I felt horrible all the time after seeing this! <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE !!! AVOID ALL COSTS !!!!!
