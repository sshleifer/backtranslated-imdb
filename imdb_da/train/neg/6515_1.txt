This is not a boring movie, the audience can stay on the chair fascinated by this selfish character, Miles Berkowitz, both the filmmaker and the actor here. The story is simple: after a divorce and ten years of a Hollywood non-career, the author plays a quest for love in front of the camera. The first question is about how true everything is: what is written, what happened randomly? Both answers, "yes" or "no," depict M. Berkowitz as a low average human beeing. If you're looking for a fiction about love like this, I urge you to read some independent comics: Chester Brown, Joe Matt ... Besides that, I was quite disappointed to hear so much against my country, France. I know Americans usually say that the French are arrogant (it can be true), etc. And surely the French (and the whole world) have many griefs against America, but why so much hate? Don't think I didn't like this movie just because of it anyway.
