Basically, it is a couple who want to adopt another child. At the adoption office, they meet a mouse (Stuart) and they decide to adopt him. If you think this is stupid, keep it because it gets worse. Stuart arrives at his new home, where he is treated as a human child. (Save me!) The rest is basically the usual cliché, family problems, jealousy from the oldest "brother", and ultimately all problems are resolved and they are all a "happy family". I'm not sure if the instructor thought he was creative by introducing a mouse to the cliché, or he just tried to fill in minutes, but he only upgraded the cliché from boring to abominable. <br /> <br /> So why did I give a 3 and not a ZERO? Because of the family cat who loves Stuart as much as the "brother". And because of some funny footage where Stuart uses his small size. <br /> <br /> On the overall, I think the movie would work reasonably well if: a. Stuart was a PET and not a "sibling". b. It had kept the fun footage Stuart was trying to overcome and had left boring clichés that didn't match any other.
