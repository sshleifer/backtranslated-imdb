note to George Litman and others: Mystery Science Theater 3000 riff is "I don't think so, * breeder *". <br /> <br /> My favorite riff is "Why did you look at his" like "?", simply for the complete absurdity. and "really well did not!" All in all, I must say that we must give credit to the MST3K crew to try and ridicule this TV movie. You really can't make fun in the dialog box; Bill S was a good playwright. On the other hand, this production is so bad that even he would reject it. a junior high school drama club could do better. <br /> <br /> I recommend that you buy a book and read 'Hamlet'.
