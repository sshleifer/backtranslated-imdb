After the opening credit there is a black screen for approx. a minute. A moment of nothing so a girl wakes up and takes a shower. Then her and two colleagues' friends go to a rock concert, after much padding they hit something and slip off the road. They awaken in a cabin inhabited by a wheelchair-bound old lady and her offspring. Unfortunately, the murders are very tame for a presumably Nasty Video. Twist ends silly and predictably. No one involved in the mess would ever do anything again. So there are sometimes happy endings. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Sara Ansley gets topless and Laurel Munson has full frontal on screen <br /> <br /> My character: D
