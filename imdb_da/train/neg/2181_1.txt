I saw this movie thinking that it would be one of the old B movies that is fun to watch. I was so wrong! This film was boring and of course aimed at men who like to look at bodily women. The story was so ridiculous and incredible that it lost my interest altogether. It seemed to be in the same genre as the Ed Wood films - the bottom of the barrel.
