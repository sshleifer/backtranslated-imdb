How is it possible that a film that is bad can be made. Bad play. Bad script. Just an embarrassment everywhere. This is just a bad clich√© after another. <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie has some big names in it. Unfortunately, they are singers and not actors. <br /> <br /> This movie made almost no money for good reason. The appeal of black cowboy movies is just not there. It's a pity they didn't have a good story to tell. <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie has some big names in it.
