You can tell they spent 5 $ doing this. It's a waste of your time ... ugh .. there's nothing distant about this movie ... ... I don't know why I watched it ... chick is not hot. horrid acting .. you could do something and it is a better use of your time .. like watching tv playing shitty video games .. i feel robbed. simply robbed .. of my time. I have never made a review for a movie before you can probably tell, but this movie I felt I needed to save the poor souls who are seeing it and looking at IMDb before to see if it is decent and looking at the comments. -There was no action - no hot chicks - no budget -ittttttttttttttttty-play-it screams bad movie. **** ALL movies are in a room. ***
