I wasn't sure how to judge this movie as it was so bad that it was actually a lot of fun. I'm not a Gackt fan in any way, even though he's talented, despite the nice pseudonym that sounds like a cat who hosts a hairball. I always thought Hyde was talented, but faith is an interesting album. <br /> <br /> But on the subject here folks. This movie is ridiculous. It's so over the top and nonsense, it's almost like a parody of supernatural action movies. <br /> <br /> The movie has almost no plot here except it is only about vampires with gangster friends. In a way, this movie almost reminded me of Spider-Man 3, with how there were too many ideas, resulting in not enough time to pay attention to one of them. The action scenes were ridiculous. Quickly edited, almost hard to understand, with choreography that is so ridiculously bad. Although Hyde looked very stylish during the action scenes, but only the movie's only redemption. I am a sucker for good action movies, but the action was terribly done. Although the final shootout was ok and the height of this otherwise depressing movie. <br /> <br /> It keeps jumping between genres, not a good thing. It will be a drama, or an action girl or a horror or a romance ... what the hell. If this review makes you angry, why? Is it because Gackt and Hyde are your love? Don't be fooled by yourself, this movie is bad.
