This was really the worst movie I've ever seen. Michael Vartan is warm, but who is this woman? And she looks awful through the whole movie, her hair is so bad! They speak in as monotonous voices, and there is no chemistry. The cover of the DVD does not even come close to what the film really is. Really, really boring. I had to accelerate through some of it because it was so painful to see. I really want to know how on earth I could believe it was good? hhaha they literally like talking and saying "yes" and there is no passion at all. I couldn't tell at all that they were in love. I'm sorry, but it was the sadest excuse for a movie I think I've ever seen.
