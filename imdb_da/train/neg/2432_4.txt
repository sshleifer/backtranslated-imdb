Not much to say about this one. A plot you can virtually sting for the first 10 minutes. Nothing too wrong with this movie, very little action movie action. There was a chance to examine the characters' emotions occasionally. Whether an action movie is the right genre to deal with, I'm still uncertain. Sniper was one of the easiest movies to see without being aware of, as it had small twists and a fair plot. I was probably guilty of it, so with another watch or with undivided attention it might be better. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but the best of my 4 out of 10)
