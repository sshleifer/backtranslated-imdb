This movie was sold for one dollar at Wal-Mart on a DVD, and so I don't feel I lost anything to watch this movie except my time. Enjoyed the appearance of Tom Hanks (Robbie Wheeling), who was very young looking and gave an excellent performance considering that it was a horrible script. The story is about students who decided to play the game Mazes & Monsters, only in a very realistic setting. Robbie Wheeling has previously had trouble playing this game at other high schools and is advised by his parents to leave the game alone and get good grades. Robbie meets a very nice gal and has a romantic fling with her, and when he starts playing the game, he stops loving her and seems like a monk. There are some scenes in the film taken around the former World Trade Center and also in the Observatory and Roof area. It is a little sad to see this part of the movie where so many people died because of evil in the world. This is not a very good movie, except that Tom Hanks is trying to keep the film over the descending level of entertainment.
