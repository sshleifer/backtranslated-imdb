"National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is simply the worst movie ever made, far lamer than even the outrageous "Plan 9 from outer space." <br /> <br /> The lampoon film is told in three segments, each probably a spear on a conventional movie genre, but each lands at our feet with a morbid spout. There is no rhyme or reason for these executable vignettes, and no traceable stories. Another reviewer on this page has written that the only good points about the movie are the naked scenes. True, Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry miss a bit of meat, and it is also very nice. But the directors do not seem to realize that even T&A needs a good story that surrounds it. There is nothing here. <br /> <br /> Probably the worst of the three segments is the last one with Robby Benson and Richard Widmark. Here we see Benson as a young, avid-beaver policeman who is mated to a cynical old-fashioned game by Widmark. And for a moment, those of us who still look at this bad movie experience are encouraged by the idea that we are seeing a perpetual tale of how the young idealist policeman brings about a cleansing change in old-fashioned approach to police work. But not such luck. As we have said, this film has no redeeming value. It's sickening all the way to the final fade-out - which perversely stretched out longer than it should last on the screen. Apparently the filmmakers knew they had a bad thing and wanted to do it mildly.
