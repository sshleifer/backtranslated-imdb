I doubt that Jigsaw was hip even at the time the whole LSD theme married to a murder mystery is an obvious obvious attempt to grab a young audience in the era without at least really showing any understanding of the 60s counterculture . The dated aspect concurrently, Jigsaw suffers from many problems, including overwhelmed action, silly and stalked dialogue, LSD flashbacks, which continue infinitely long, even after the point has been hammered home for the first 60 seconds, a failure to create a true excitement though The real plot is on paper a large vehicle to do just that, and one end that is so tired and predictable (not to mention the reminiscences of many bad TV shows), that the climax is actually an anti-climax. If it were a better movie, we might be able to suspend disbelief in a few things where it would help enjoyment, but the weaknesses are so brilliant they serve only to highlight the unlikelyness that the viewers might otherwise overlook. I saw Jigsaw on television and it is definitely late night TV ticket intended to fill the airspace and pass the time to kill a person's insomnia rather than something someone should actively seek. At best, a three out of 10.
