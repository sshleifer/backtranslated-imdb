I am meanwhile people call kamal hassan 'ulaganaayakan' maybe for them ulagam is tollywood! Comeon guys.This movie is a thriller without excitement. <br /> <br /> Get out of your ulagam and just see some high-class thrillers like the usual suspects or even the silence of the lamb. <br /> <Technically good, but style over fabric Kamal doesn't look like a cop, there's no excitement, anything that pulls and bores until you can save 3 valuable hours in your life if you skip watch this movie. <br /> <br /> At its best, Kamal is the best in tollywood
