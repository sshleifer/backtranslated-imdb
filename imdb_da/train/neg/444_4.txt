(SPOILERS IN THIS) <br /> "Rosenstraße" is a film about heroic women in German Nazi time. But it is too long, it does not touch and sometimes even boring! There are too many clichés and not enough good plays. <br /> <br /> The story story (story) is bad. As in James Cameron's Titanic, an old woman remembers events of her life. Well, now we have a point of view. There is another woman introduced who does the same. Confusing is that they both resemble events of other people's lives! Come on! This is a lack of knowledge of basic storytelling ... How can Riemann know about the little girl's fate and her interrogation for example? The scenarios appear in the wrong order and you rarely know when it happened. For example, the stage when Riemann suggests Fabian. When did it happen? The scene looks as if it's in the twenties ... <br /> <br /> Riemann's character is, of course, a talented pianist, yes she's even a baroness! Wow. Her brother returns from the eastern front, he has received a "Ritterkreuz", which he shows in some scenes. So he is a war hero and still a fine man who kept his conscience. And he got to know massacres committed by Germans. He even made some pictures! And then it goes, cliché after cliché is poured up, and that's why the film doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Basically, von Trotta has made a chick flick out of something that could have been a decent movie. And in the end it is quite simple. Riemann finds a way to get Goebbels in bed and - then! - All are free. Which is not a historical fact, but pure imagination in spite of the "true history" claim in the beginning. As a "Sass", there is vague starting point in a true event. It's sad, but true, it's the typical German movie these days. It's bad! Macaulay J. Connor <br /> <br />
