The problem with family dramas is that outside television movies on channels like lifetime, most will not see them. And those who are seen tend to be sensationalized and current or current issues or issues in the news (or recent news). Movies explaining or exploring the human condition are not popular. Especially with the young crowd who would be Miss Lohan's fan base or the younger crowd who tend to make movies, not just popular but financially successful for studies. The specific problems I had with this movie are the comic book of some of the characterizations. It was a bit much to blame all Lohan's character effects (ruin the car, drug abuse, etc.) on what her stepfather did for her. Even though it's not unlikely, it's just a little to expect the audience to revel. In addition, other elements that she has given the young Mormon boy, oral sex, or that she would actually make a good assistant to the vet, who happens to have a thing for her mother, etc. really help this movie together. It added more to the element of a comedy that tried one of their "special dramatic episodes", so did it for a fully realized, well-written feature film. <br /> <br /> When you watch the DVD and listen to the comment, especially for the various alternative endings, you can really see all of this is the focus.
