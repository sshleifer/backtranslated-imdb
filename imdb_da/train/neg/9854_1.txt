This documentary (or I should say mockumentary) is the perfect example of how ridiculous the people can be when they have full enthusiasm for something like that. Honestly, I hate Cryptozoology. It's science, it just destroys it. But something positive about this was the visual effects (dragons were beautiful), but some of the information in this mockumentary was completely fake and it is really disappointing because it comes from researchers, so that's why it deserves a 1 out of 10 and not a 0. An example of false information would be the hydrogen idea: It is true that according to Chemystry the hydrogen is produced in the stomach, but it is impossible to be produced in these proportions, so in that case you need a good explanation. What really happens in a dragon belly. There are many substances that are hydrogen in nature, but not necessary to raise such an animal to fly, and the hydrogen does not come out of nowhere, so it is impossible. Nevertheless, there is actually something worse, the idea of ​​platinum: This element is more difficult to find than gold, and I cannot explain to myself how dragons survive depending on it. It's ridiculous, they present dragons as creatures with low chances to conquer planet Earth, but of course it is at least there that explains why they were extinct. Probably cryptologists are even scientists, but they are not. People like them say lies like in this mockumentary, and what's worst, some people buy them. But I don't think a person who cares about science would believe in dragons after seeing this. The false scientists are wasting their time.
