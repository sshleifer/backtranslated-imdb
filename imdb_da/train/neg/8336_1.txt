How the hell did they get it? Presenting as a caper comedy, the misguided "$" is essentially two hours of people mumbling sentence fragments. The usually reliable Warren Beatty looks full and the usually hilarious Goldie Hawn seems like she's on depressive. As for Gert Frobe, his most famous role - Goldfinger - was infinitely more admirable than his character here. Not even the guy with the champagne bottle LSD can save this litany of worthlessness. <br /> <br /> Do I compare this movie to "Plan 9 from outer space"? I wouldn't do such a thing even if someone paid me. "P9FOS" was idiotically made, but ended up being fun; this was made idiotic and makes you feel that your brain just melted out of your ears. Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn did this as they starred in "Shampoo", but then they joined the star in the terrible "Town & Country". Maybe they just don't co-star in movies. All in all, I'd rather have my skin turned away than to see it again. Terrible. <br /> <br /> Maybe they should recreate it with Jackie Chan. Then I would pay to see it.
