I've heard about this movie for many years, and finally I got a chance to see it. A massive murder of cheerleaders back in 1963 and 1969 eventually causes a cheerleading camp to open. Fast up to 1982, and former bambi, Bambi, opens it with new recruits, among other things. Candy (Carol Kane), Glenn (Judge Reinhold) and Sandy (Debralee Scott). One by one they are murdered by the killer until only one is left. That's when we find out who did it and why. Also in the movie is Tom Smothers making a horrible accent as Canadian Mountie, and Paul Reubens makes his Pee-Wee Herman schtick. The overall plot is not very well developed, and rather paralyzed, but some fun scenes occur, namely the House of Bad Pies and the strip poker scene. The ending seems to be thrown together, which is a shame. Overall good for approx. Ten or fifteen minutes in total, the rest you can just fast forward. Maybe catch it on TV, but it's not worth buying.
