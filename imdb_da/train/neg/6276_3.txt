BROKEN is part of After Dark Horrorfest III. Not a slasher or filled with gore. Lots of broken glass and mirrors in this exciting thriller from France and author / director Sean Ellis. A successful radiologist Gina McVay (Lena Headly) is a strange world as her life seems to be spiraling out of control. While participating in the Father's (Richard Jenkins) birthday party, guests are stunned when a mirror goes down into the floor for no apparent reason. Things get really strange when she testifies to a woman who is the spitting image of herself driving down a London street in a car that is identical to her own. Gina sneaks to her doppelganger's apartment and finds a picture of herself with her father. She runs away and is involved in a head on collision. Then, her boyfriend is mysteriously not the same; Being precise family and friends is not easy for her to trust. Is Gina next to herself? Is she in a parallel world? Her nightmare becomes more horrific ... is she broken? <br /> <br /> Kudos, if you can figure out one ... it won't be easy. Editing couldn't be any tighter. Lighting is questionable. Other players: Melvil Poupard, William Armstrong, Michelle Duncan and Ulrich Thomsen.
