While counting myself as a fan of the Babylon 5 TV series, the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start. Although many of the elements that will later mature and become much more convincing in the series, there is the pace of The Gathering slowly, making something insufficient, and the plot confuses. Worse, the characterization of the premiere episode is poor. Although the scorecard shows that many fans are willing to overlook these issues, I remember The Gathering almost struck me off what soon grew into a spectacular series.
