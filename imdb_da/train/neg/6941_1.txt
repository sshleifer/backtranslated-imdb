This movie is not only boring, it is also very badly done. The graphics are so bad they are not even second rate - they are terrible. The characters do not show any facial expressions, the voice action is empty and without soul, and the plot definitely lacks .... well ... everything and everything. My 5 year old likes it - but thinks it's a bit boring. I agree with him.
