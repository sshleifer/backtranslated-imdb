Will Farmer (Lanter) plays a computer game that simulates a terrorist attack, and Ripley, the super-governmental computer designed for profiling potential terrorists, traces him because he borrows (by hacking) some money from his neighbor's bank account to pay for a class tour to play chess in Philadelphia. The next door neighbor, whose computer Will was fixing, has family members in the Middle East who via their bank send money to the neighbor's bank, and Ripley sees a terrorist connection. Ripley has the power to call up missile strikes. Oh, oh! <br /> <br /> This version of War Games has a much faster pace and more aggressiveness than War Games movies in the early 1980s. Well, the electronic industry has so much more to work with these days. Makes sense. So the movie dazzles us with amazing CGI on computer screens, and when Joshua, the forerunner of Ripley, is found operational, we're back to see the computer against the computer, and humans are cringing, hoping, asking. oh-ing, OMG-ing, and more cringing hope things will go their way. In other words, we are now experiencing a movie made for TV, and that is Oh Hum Time. Go back to the 1980s and watch the original War Games movie. That is much better. <br /> <br /> But we really have to ask ourselves: Do we make computers intelligent, where one day we will manage? Hmmm ?????? .. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Emergency: No. Language: No.
