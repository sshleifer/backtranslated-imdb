I must say that this movie is a Mork and Mindy knock out when I looked at it, I got chills, myself a little bit. When the Korean guy with the spiders in his neck started to kick people, I was like oh, my lord, Asian people smelling and sucking because they eat dogs all the time. Somehow back on track Chuck had some horrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non-robotic person. Some people would compare it to his earlier days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of Christmas. This movie is so bad I put my newborn baby in a box and left it in Mr. Norris mailbox. He can raise my child, I don't let him into a world where he thinks chuck Norris is a karate expert. Let him see what that hack is like in real life for the rest of his life.
