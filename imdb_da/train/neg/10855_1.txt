This is definitely a comedy that I will probably not forget for a while. Usually would not bother to comment on this movie: it is so small that no one will see it anyway, but as it does, it is a little popular in p2p sharing networks like Kazaa, and then this seed production must be exposed to what it is. <br /> <br /> So what is it? Well, of course it's not a comedy; instead it is the meaning of a horror flip - "calculated" very much as the keyword here. The scripture is a completely incoherent and unbalanced mess, special effects are only special because they are particularly pathetic, and as far as the play is concerned, let's just say that if this had been my bachelor in primary school, my teachers would have cried out on our talent. Of course, I am aware that this is a very low budget film and that in these cases you have to lower your expectations, certainly with regard to special effects. Although I'm a big fan of the horror genre, I'm aware that these movies are only rarely places to look for interesting scripts and top notch act. <br /> <br /> But still. <Br /> <br /> B movies often have some redeeming features to compensate for lack of funding, such as humor. The only laugh in the cradle for fear lies in the ridiculous notions. If you can find humor in it - and I could gradually turn it off after the first 20 minutes or so - then it will be the only thing the film has to offer. Oh, there and two or three pairs of breasts. <br /> <br /> Woohoo, how exciting. <br /> <br /> As far as history is concerned, it is not even that it does not attempt to convey anything: the victims use either drugs and / or are involved in serious crime. The Doctrine: Beware, Naughty Boys and Girls, for one day you are made to pay for what you have done. <br /> <br /> I rest on my case. <br /> <br /> All in all, little sex, a lot of drugs, but absolutely zero rock 'n roll. I rate this 1 out of 10, but will go to 0 if I could. Or maybe I wouldn't: it deserves a 1 to spell the actors' names correctly in the titles. I mean, is that something?
