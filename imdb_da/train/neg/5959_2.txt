A spoiler. <br /> <br /> What three words can guarantee you a horrible movie? Cheap Canadian production. BRAIN fits these words perfectly. Terrible script, idiotic plays and hilarious special effects make this a must for any BAD movie fan. Horror is fun. The post production team looks like it gave up. What makes BRAIN admirable is in the second half, it actually tries to be good! Can a bit of ingenuity and consistency save what is already a joke? It is around Christmas time. A mother and a daughter are murdered by one of the funniest villains ever. The following day, a rebel teenager comes into trouble, that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis. <br /> <br /> If a policeman is cut off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody ax told you some children did, who would you believe? What begins as fun becomes boring and tiring towards the end when BRAIN tries to be serious. A child cannot be afraid of the scary moments. BRAIN is a fun concept for trying to be gritty. Psychological research institute is larger than larger production facilities! Our ugly villain and its cohorts are honored to draw some of the worst plays I've seen. The viewer estimate prevailed.
