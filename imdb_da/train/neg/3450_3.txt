Someone here actually compared this movie in some ways to High Noon. Now it's a real stretch! I'm a big Sinatra fan with some of his plays, but maybe the only one who could have played this part was Don Knotts. First, as someone pointed out, Sinatra just doesn't have the building for a western poor guy wannabe. He is just for 'little' at this point in his life. Perhaps he was about the same height as Audie Murphy said, but Murphy had a rather solid construction. Sinatra comes across as the big talking little child that no one should take seriously. The story is uninspired and really not credible. I don't want to spoil it, but I think the end and how the cities react in this story makes no sense. Another thing that these people constantly allow themselves to be completely superior to some 'bad guys'. This is just a small town, so I don't get the ride or understand why the people would be dominating that way. <br /> <br /> There is a "love interest" in the story and if I followed it right, she was sad when the protagonist refused to admit who he was so another bad guy wouldn't kill him. Now there is true love for you. "Get up for yourself! Tell him your name so he'll kill you!" LOL. Stop, you kill me. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the basic premise of the movie is not good enough, and no matter how they tried this story, it did not have a logical path to follow other than in the waste bin. Want to know why it's not on video and never shown on TV? Critics apparently shot it in 1956 and they were right - this movie is pretty bad. I would almost bet Sinatra paid someone to deep six things as much as possible. <br /> <br /> Do you want to see a good western, where a city faces a bad guy? Try Excitement at Table Rock, or at Gunpoint - two really really good westerns with that theme. Johnny Concho is Johnny Stinko. Frank, you were the greatest singer ever - but you didn't belong to a movie like this.
