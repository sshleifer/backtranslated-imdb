Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy are both excellent actors who can surely rise to any play challenged. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' offers only one to both actors and audiences: not to fall asleep during a thought-out boring, highly predictable, and imaginative story. "Watching the Detectives (2007)" tries very hard to be fun, but the comedy is forced, extremely poorly directed and shamefully on the verge of utter ridicule. After a third of the film, there is even nothing to mention that nothing that can capture even the most willing audience, like the director's friends and family members. . <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure that anyone who liked it, phoned it or had to fake what Neil's ex-boyfriend did when he showed her an old B&W movie she couldn't fit less about. 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' is not near category B, does it fall somewhere between Q&R, like -Questions? and -Repress the questions! The director knows what he's doing! Well, if his goal was to drill the viewer to death, he has done a very good job! <br /> <br /> 'Watching the Detectives (2007)' was a complete waste of time for Lucy Alexis Liu and Cillian Murphy, cage PLEASE don't let it waste your time! <br /> <br /> Rating: 0 out of 100.
