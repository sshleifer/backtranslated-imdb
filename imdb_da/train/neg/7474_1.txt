This program didn't do it for me, even though I'm a fan of the genre. The most important factor that disappointed me was that there was not a single scene that was not dominated by the protagonist. It made it a little two-dimensional and I gave up before the program was over. I was hoping to leave my criticism there as I am not a film critic, but the guidelines on IMDb say you have to insert 10 lines of comments. It reminded me of the Hudson Hawk in the way the protagonist is in each scene, and I hope the authors of this program could use some diversity to engage with the viewers. I have no doubt about the talent of any of the cast and crew, it's just that after seeing things like "wire," I have come to expect great things from cop drama.
