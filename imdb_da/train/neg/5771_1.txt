I start by apologizing to film developers everywhere to use the terms "movie maker", "movie" or "movie" in this regard, but "criminal" and "crime against humanity" seem a little harsh. Scripture: Pathetic. <br /> <br /> The Governing: Pathetic. <br /> <br /> The play: Pathetic. <br /> <br /> The cinematography: too tenacious for words. <br /> <br /> The technical skills used to assemble this cruelty: NOT WHY. <br /> <br /> This clump of waste could hardly be called a cinema. The majority of family home movies come closer to earning this distinction than Revenge Quest. No, it's just a 10 car jump caught on video. <br /> <br /> We skip the plot in this review because there are too many holes to cover at once. Let's just say it stinks worse than the rest of this movie. Calling the acting one-dimensional would give them credit. How little there is, is terrible at first and much worse at the horrible video and editing. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this cruelty, but apart from the plot, should be the effects ... or rather the disturbing lack thereof. There are no items in the guns, no flashpots, and how few sound effects existed, either the stock "gun" sounds or they were generated by the mouth (yes, you read it right). The filmmaker actually had the arrogance to record a "shh" sound to the elevator doors; I think he felt it made them more futuristic. It is supposed to be suspended in the year 2031. However, it does not explain the sounds he created with his mouth to the fist fight scenes. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't bad enough that the sound quality is awful (he just used the microphone that was mounted on the camcorder and it shows), the use of storage gun sounds almost worse than not using no sounds at all. The sound effects stand out from the rest of the soundtrack as a drunk yak in a flock of sheep, and they are just as clumsy. Picture this: The bad guy enters an office building looking for his prey. A lady begins to run in fear. He raises his gun (a uzi) and shakes it. We hear a sound that is clearly not an uzi. The woman runs away from the camera, and suddenly a single blood pack (only 1) explodes on her back (looked like she was hit by a paintball) and she falls flat on her face. <br /> <br /> Bear in mind that my description makes too much justice to the incompleteness of the actual sequence. <br /> <br /> In another order, a movie that almost - but not completely - finds the movie fun enough to see in a staircase. The bad guy shocks the good guy and the lady he protects down the stairs and pulls his plastic uzi all the way. You may want to show there are poor timed sound effects flying everywhere. <br /> <br /> I assumed Alan DeHerrera can't be locked away to perceive this train wreck, but he went all the way to edit and release it. If there is any justice, there must be some karma out there with the name of it. <br /> <br /> If you decide to see this clump of industrial waste - and I strongly recommend it - be sure to watch the whole scene lifted virtually from Bladerunner, and the AM radio doubles as and walkie-talkie. Do not try to focus too hard on the plot; It will only hurt you more if you do. <br /> <br /> 0 stars out of 10. And it's generous.
