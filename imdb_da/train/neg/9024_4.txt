"Shinobi" is one of the films that seems to the mere act of killing a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or feelings to the story. Unfortunately, for the audience to actually care about people dying, you need to develop the characters, otherwise everything you have is a lot of random acts of violence. The problem is especially aggravated when you have tons of characters that everyone dies. <br /> OK, so if you can't be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way, can you at least make the reasons why they are likely to die? Nix. Here we have a war between two ninja clans, where none of them really know why they are fighting each other. They kill each other because the emperor says it. But even after it becomes clear that the emperor wants everyone dead, they still refuse to give up their meaningless missions. It's not stubborn ... it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> Nice, fine! There is no sign development and the plot gives no reasonable justification for the fighting. At least they die in huge action scenes, right? Once again, no! In fact, many of the battles are not even battling at all: super ninjas, the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly (and lamely, in my opinion). I'm talking about things like, "Lalala, I'm walking together and I'm being twisted *." END for that character. Not even halfway through the movie I threw my hands up in frustration at the ridicule of it.
