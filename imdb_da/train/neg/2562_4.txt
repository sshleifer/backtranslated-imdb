Let me start by saying that this movie has a fun point at the beginning with the exchange between the narrator and George: Tells: Huh? Please wait! Who do you think? George: New George. Studio for cheap to pay Brendan Fraser. Tells: How did you get that part? George: New George just lucky, I think. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's the only fun part in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was still entertaining ... But then again I am easily entertained ... <br /> <br /> I wouldn't say this is the worst movie I've ever seen (the title goes to the terribly eerie Disaster Movie ...), This movie falls # 7 on my bottom 15 list ... <br /> <br /> If you are a small child who can easily entertain, you will enjoy this movie. If you are a movie guard who wants a good, funny movie, you will end up shooting yourself halfway through it.
