Stewart Moss stars as a scientist working with his wife, and you get the feeling that he was chosen for this role for his ability to roll his eyes back in the head ... imagine the auditions for this ... "you can. .. no it's not quite that, thank you next! ". Anyway, he's bitten by a bat, and then he either turns into a kind of bat and kills people or .... he's not. For no one else sees his peculiar transformations, but he thinks himself thinking that he is changing because his wedding ring turns out when his hands turn into claws, etc. For his credit, the film holds back a little whether he is just a nut or whatever In fact, turning into something to almost the end. This has some good locations and kind of a decent atmosphere at times, but unfortunately none of it can cope with the somewhat lame story and the wonderfully bad play. It's fun in a "so bad, that's good" way, but leans more towards simply bad. 4 out of 10
