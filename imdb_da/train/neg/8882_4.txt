Calling a movie about a shrunk ghost that rages beyond the crippled and lifeless would be too ironic, but this is an undeniable combination of GASLIGHT (1939 & 1944) via LES DIABOLIQUES (1954); While it is still possible to look at it, it is so clich√©-ridden to provoke chuckles instead of the intended chills. But thanks to the serious features of the British film industry in the late 1970s, even a mediocre script like this could be able to attract 10 star names - Cliff Robertson (as the devoted man), Jean Simmons (in Jenny Agutter (as Robertson's artist half-sister), Simon Ward (as the enigmatic driver), Ron Moody (as a fake doctor), Michael Jayston (as Robertson's business partner), Judy Geeson (as Simmons best friend and Jayston's wife), Flora Robson (as housekeeper), David Tomlinson (as notary reads Simmon's will) and, most surprisingly, Jack Warner (as engraver sculptor) - although most of them don't actually have any parts, I'm sorry to say!
