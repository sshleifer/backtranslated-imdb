Alan Alda actually plays "Sports Illustrated" author George Plimpton, who was once invited to participate in the Detroit Lions football team as honorary member. Rather, uncomplicated drama curiously tempered with imagination. Director Alex March takes an interesting thank you to this material and shoots it in a quasi-documentary way (with macho commentary) and yet gives the tale a touch of Capraesque whimsy; Still, by bringing the cinematic flashiness into this set-up, he turns the main story into a jumble. Alda's alley, uncharismatic performance is another handicap, although the offensive throw is filled with real pro athletes (and scintillating Lauren Hutton as Alda's boyfriend - how's that fantasy?). * 1/2 from ****
