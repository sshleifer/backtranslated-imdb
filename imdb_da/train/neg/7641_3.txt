This is one of the films that are trying to be moody and excited, and instead end up stumbling upon themselves. Having seen it at a queer movie festival, I was intrigued by the "young college triangle gone wrong" appreciation, but everywhere ended up quite disappointed. It is difficult to criticize a "true story" as there is not much that can be done about the plot - but I found this to be uneven, melodramatic and totally depressing. It is dark and almost malicious that paints a fun fun fun glamor with impressive music and jerky close-ups. It just doesn't work - some scenes where so cheesy that instead of mocking awe, my audience suppressed snickers and rolling eyes. The story has an interesting premise, but it just spins down in a dark, miserable spiral.
