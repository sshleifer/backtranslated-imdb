Extremely thin 'plot' of satanic rituals or some of these mumbo jumbo gives the excuse to cheat large amounts of sex scenes. Straight vanilla sex, masturbation, lesbianism, S&M, bestiality, incest, and a few other sexual spreads have all come their time in the spotlight here. The problem is the story is so boring that the violent sexuality gets pretty boring after a while. Who knew that a movie with an intimate goat / girl meeting could be so smoothly boring? Well now I do. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Venessa Hidalgo shows everyone; Helga Line delivers T&A (both are shown quite often); Women's viewers occasionally get the penis. <br /> <br /> My character: D + <br /> Region 1 DVD Extra: Trailers for "Pick Up", "Legend of Eight Samurai", "Do Not Answer the Phone", "Prime Evil "and" Sister Street Fighter "(also the same DVD has another feature movie" Evil Eye ")
