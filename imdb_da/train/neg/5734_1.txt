These are the kind of movies that are so extremely bad that you can't stop seeing it because you tell yourself that 'it can't continue to be this crappy all the way to the end. It just can't '. You know, 'worse than the Jaws 4' kind of bad. I honestly think I've only seen a movie that was worse than this, and then we talk religious boys about how to end up in hell lying or watching football. <br /> <br /> Gore? Actually and lots of it. Well done gore? No way. <br /> <br /> The play is beyond bad, and all lines are miserable clich√©s. The same goes for the story, which consists only of sex, blood and violence, like so many other gore films. <br /> <br /> If you are hoping for a mix between Ichi the Killer and August Underground ?? Lead on. You will not find it in Live Feed.
