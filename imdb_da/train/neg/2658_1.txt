Watch CBS 'Surrender, Dorothy, I was wondering why Diane Keaton would be in it (not because it is a TV movie - with the lack of alluring roles to slightly older actresses, it's no wonder why the Academy Award winning artists like Keaton turn to television - but because it does not allow Keaton to shine). A single mother who cares for the sudden death of her widowed daughter imposes - and eventually becomes friends with - the group of youngsters her daughter was close to at the time of her accident. Adapted from the novel, this teleplay gives us a group of self-absorbed characters that you would cross the street to avoid. Apart from being rough and weak, these fake people are incredibly convincing, just like the tidy scenario and bungalow near the beach, where the kids reside (a young man wearing muscular shirts to tell us he is gay, hears Diane Keaton, says "Surrender, Dorothy" and actually asks, "It's from" The Wizard of Oz ", right?" ... no, genius, it's from "Citizen Kane"!). Keaton may have wanted to make this material based on the subject to confront death. She tries to make this very invisible woman a shadow of her own personality (lots of boiled clothes), but it does not fit well with the viewer, as Keaton has always been very sympathetic and flexible in a flaky way. Here she is a gallic harpy who does not learn many lessons about her self-exploration (the film quickly signs that it is a dead young woman and becomes an odyssey for a mother's nervous wreck that seems to be a superior hippie who has never lost anyone close to her). These are the kind of film actors who promote talk shows with the warning: "It must help many grieving mothers out there". I can't imagine it helping anyone as it is inherently a downer, muddled and confusing. It's scared.
