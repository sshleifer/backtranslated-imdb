This movie should be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. The action was horrible, horrible and cheesy and talk about a predictable plot! I will never watch this movie again or I would recommend this movie to anyone. What a waste of time! First, as soon as the movie began, I realized what I was getting into. Everything they did for this movie was copying scenes from many other horror movies out there and bunched them all into this one movie. Prank phone calls, halloween night, a psycho and a knife! It's totally ridiculous. I was not scared at all during the movie, which I thought horror movies should do. As for the film, it is very hilarious how they all talk about how this film was so big and so scary. I mean, how do you not understand that movies are a cheap rip off of "Scary Movie" for example. Get at least some good actors in there, and maybe it would have been drawn as a good scary movie.
