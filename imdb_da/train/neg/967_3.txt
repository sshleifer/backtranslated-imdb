You will only laugh at its cheap effects and yearn for a show of Leprechaun 5. The story involves a girl with glandular fever escaping in her dreams. What you get is not good scare, art house or even a decent after school special. I found myself after two hours point says .. where did my two hours go. <br /> <br /> The direction is uninspired and I wanted it to be even pretentious ... something interesting. It seems like the producers were on lithium. <br /> <br /> Even in the dream world, things are boring. <br /> <br /> A short no on this one.
