James Gandolfini is a good actor, so what ever he took a role in this piece of unfunny rubbish. Affleck is just a lightweight that just can't cut it, the rest of the molding is truly unforgettable. I saw this in the US in an empty theater, I knew quickly why the place was empty after approx. 10 minutes. I went to the end, it was so bad, so imagine my surprise when I was back in England, so I had a glowing report from the yoyo "Paul Ross" in one of the Sunday markets. I always trust Ross to save me money on movie tickets, if he says the movie is good, I'll be right on this very site to check it out. This movie should have gone straight to Â£ 1.99 in a supermarket near you.
