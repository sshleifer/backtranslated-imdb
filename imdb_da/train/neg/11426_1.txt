Heather Graham couldn't play a compelling lesbian if her life depended on it. Who does the film producers think they are? the ABSOLUTE WORST, most unrealistic movie I've seen in as long as I can remember. This movie is so bad I felt compelled to sign up for IMDb and make sure that the "movie" rating falls. <br /> <br /> If I'm Heather Graham, I just kissed a full chick, so while she's gone out, I'll really walk around in my room in HOURS and ask me nuts: "What have I done? " ... Jesus Heather, come over it and grow up ... and I would like to send the same mood to the idiot producers ... and while I am in it, instead of this movie, it would be a pathetic excuse for a forthcoming story, It might have been more appropriate to focus the plot on a sign that is mentally unstable. .. like your so-called "lesbian" character ... after all, I know the first time I had gay sex when I left the next morning I jumped to heaven in excitement in the middle of the street ... honestly b * tch, grab .. . <br /> <br /> WHAT A JOKE! And be aware that there are many many many more errors and scary silly aspects to this lame flick, but I am so sick of thinking about it any more. bottom line, if you are a smart person, you will hate this movie and if you are not a smart person then you will love it ... it's as simple as that.
