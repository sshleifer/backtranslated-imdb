Black Candles is rather a confused mess from the same director who brought us "Vampyres" and much later, "Rest in Pieces", among others. I only notice those I have seen. At least we have a couple to love, and so a place near a pin is aware of a voodoo doll and then pierces it and the man suffocates. Not sure if it was good for any of them at the time. Fast forward to where the man's sister has come to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will or something in that direction, and of course, everyone else, except her, is about something that happens to be devilish worship. It is really hard to say who is currently under the film and it is sometimes confusing. To spice things up, there is a simulated bestiality scene (I hope it is simulated) with a black goat, sure to be a crowd pleaser. Ugh. At times, this "Rosemary's Baby", minus the baby, spans the hostess always giving a woman's herbal tea and the place series of scary satanic herbs, too, for it continues to be noticed. But the herbs are not the only thing about this movie. The ending seems to be back to the beginning again, and many viewers may wonder where they have been in the middle. It's not useless, it's just not that good, and I think it all depends on what you like to watch in movies, and there wasn't much here that did anything to me. 3 out of 10
