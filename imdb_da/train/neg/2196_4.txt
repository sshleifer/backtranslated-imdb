The brain (or head) that would not die is one of the more thoughtful low budget utilization films of the early 1960s. It is very difficult to imagine how a script that this repulsive sexist could have been written without the intention of self-parody. And the themes that are repeatedly expressed by the woman's leaders appear to be Ginny Leith - a detached head kept alive by machines, I-Vs and clamps - confirming that the film was intended to simultaneously exploit and criticize gender stereotypes. Shadows of the undervalued Boxing Helena. <br /> <br /> The sexes are abundant and as annoying as an army of angry ants. The dialogue is hyperbolic, over-dramatic and incredible, and the play is only OK (but not consistent). Why did I give this movie a 4? Because some thoughts clearly went into it. I'm really not sure which point the movie really was trying to do, but it seems clear that it strives for an unusually edgy and raw kind of horror (without the blood and intestine of today's audience expecting). <br /> <br /> Another unique and interesting aspect of the brain is that there are really no heroes in this movie and none of the characters are particularly sympathetic. All in all, this is a rather painful and disturbing look at the early 1960s American pop-sexuality, from a woman's point of view despite her missing body after what should have been a deadly car accident. Her lover threatens to put a fresh high-quality body on her and force her to continue living with him. She is understandably non-plussed by all this and forced to be friends with a creature who is almost as monstrous as her boyfriend. Oh, there are also some vague references to the 1950s / 60s clich√© on the ability to run amok. <br /> <br /> Recommended for B sci fi buffs and graduate students in gender studies. O / w is not recommended.
