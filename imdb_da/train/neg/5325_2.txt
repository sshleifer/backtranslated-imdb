The critic from Poland must be feminist, because she finds "Young Catherine" to be a good movie and historically accurate. Nothing could be further from the truth. As a practicing Russian historian for many years I took exception with YC at almost every turn, and especially the politically correct portrayal of her as the boss, who single-handed moved Russia to a direction of domination. The truth? She was only brought to St. Petersburg to be a wife and mother and found that she should "tie" with the dvorians, boyars and the military to survive. As long as she didn't challenge them, she was able to pamper her cultural desires (fill the Hermitage with art treasures, etc.). There is so much evidence that she was not "big," but in this area of ​​postmodern revisionism, evidence is not very popular. YC is just a costume drama, a bit fluff from Ted Turner, which, like "Peter the Great" in 1986, is an example of how much Russia is portrayed in the West.
