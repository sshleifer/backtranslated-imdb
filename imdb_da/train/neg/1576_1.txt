this movie has it all; the bad camera work reminiscent of martin scorcese or oliver stone, the tight act of 'heat', the explosive act of a jerry bruckheimer movie, the female dialogue of a tarantino script and the epic sense of saying 'godfather' br /> <br /> The judge recreating signs shows a burning temper, but also shows true emotional depth and intensity. His performance reminds me of Robert De Niro's portrayal of Jake La Receive in Raging Bull. The action scenes are truly breathtaking, not since bullit has a movie depicting such high-octane but stylish car scenes. The special effects push the boundaries of technology and filmmaking to their limits. Independance Day set the standard that this movie clearly matched and surpassed much. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is great to perform from a list cast (like an oscars night party invitation invitation!), classic sites, poignant actions, and a tight script.
