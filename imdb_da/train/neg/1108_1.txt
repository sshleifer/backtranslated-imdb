A dull and pointless piece of fluff (bloody fluff, but fluff). Poor scripted, with inane and wood dialogue. You don't care if the characters (yes, even if the actors themselves) live or die. Little grace or charm, little action, little point on it all. Perhaps some of the set and setting will interest - these gaps between the boards of all buildings can be true to life lived. The frame process is unnecessary and distracting, and the Hoppalong Cassidy character is both boring and unobtrusive.
