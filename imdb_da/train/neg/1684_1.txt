*** spoilers *** spoilers *** spoilers *** spoilers <br /> There are bad movies, and then there are movies that are so terrible that they are lovingly comical in their ineptness. Such is the case with Columbia Pictures' The Grudge. 'This cinematic cruelty began when an otherwise well-meaning American saw a Japanese made for television film' Ju-on 'and was inspired to resume the film in English. This began a virtual tsunami with bad decisions that encircled the earth until it was washed ashore in Orlando on October 21, 2004. The premise, and I use the word loosely, involves a house in Tokyo haunted by a skinny Momma ghost who looks like a cross between Margaret Cho and Alanis Morrisette, along with his horrible sidekick a shabby, rambunctious but evil second degree. Is there anything scary than an eerie 8 year old Japanese boy? Sure there is! Count Chocula comes to mind. With this whimsical pile we have to add a mysterious black cat that I have affectionately named Chim Chim. (Remember Speed ​​Racer?) As you have already guessed, they were murdered in this place of death and now want to kill everyone who enters the premises. You see, as explained by a Japanese detective when someone dies in anger, seeking their ghost revenge on anyone who steps on the estate lines as defined by the county commissioner or something I forget. <br /> <br /> The story begins innocently with the acclaimed Thespian Bill Pullman, who jumps to his death from a balcony. My guess is Bill Pullman got this job because of his kids asking him for a trip to Tokyo Disneyland. Then we endure the mildly interesting saga of nurse Yoko, "Oh no, don't go in there" screaming crowd, but unfortunately she doesn't hear the expensive warnings and predictably sniffing like a magical lantern. Ca. 30 minutes in the movie we finally see his American heroine Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen. Sarah Michelle Gellar may be a competent actress, but I couldn't help thinking of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so much so that it was distracting. It's like having Jennifer Anniston star in a movie about six friends in New York. Try as possible, you just can't stop thinking about the other project that made her famous. But I go down, Karen, the nurse is employed as a replacement for the original caregiver who disappeared by ghosts. <br /> <br /> She lashes around, meets the ghosts, coma lady dies, and some other things happen. Look at the fair haired vixen looking for clues I halfway expected her to find the ghost and pull off her mask to reveal that it was actually old man Gower, who owned the abandoned amusement park! "I would also be away with that too, if it wasn't for you to mix children and your dog!" <br /> <br /> Director Takashi Shimizu, who turns to be Ed Wood of Asia, made two unfortunate decisions involving sound. First, he only chooses to use a soundtrack when someone is being killed. This is an excellent design to wipe out any excitement because the audience gets a two minute warning to prepare for another miserably predictable murder. Second, he gave the ghosts a bizarre guttural noise resembling a gurgling gopher. After the film, I heard that more people left the theater that made the sound and laugh. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar ends up being the only survivor. And of course, we learn that the fire she set to burn down in the house was extinguished in time for the mandatory next chapter. But in view of the humorous reactions of the audience, they did not want a successor, but an excuse. 'The Grudge' could easily be edited for a comedy, perhaps it will be appreciated for its camp value. Baring it, this will go down as the biggest cinematic thriller since 'Godzilla vs Megalon.' I would suggest waiting until the movie reaches your local discount theater where it can receive the publicity it deserves so right.
