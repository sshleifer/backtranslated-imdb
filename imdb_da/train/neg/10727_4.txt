The movie is worth seeing only if you stop it after half an hour. It starts with fun conversations in a bar and one gets to expect a good, fun story is coming. Well, I can tell you, it doesn't come. It will worsen in minutes in a movie that challenges your patience as well as your feelings of shame for the actors in an extension, you probably won't be happy to witness. <br /> <br /> In an interview, I heard that the director wanted to express in this movie the feeling of a loss of identity, which, according to him, shows the majority of the population of this globalizing world. I was amazed to hear it. Do I live in the same world he lives in? OK many people walk around in the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music and everyone, but it doesn't make me feel like I'm losing my identity. What does Khrzhanosvky think we are no more than the clothes we wear and the movies we see? Am I short-term or is he? Well my vote: The good start of the movie saves it from getting a 1, a decent 4 is my conclusion.
