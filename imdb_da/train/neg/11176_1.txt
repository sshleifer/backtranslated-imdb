Saw this movie in an early example, and I can't stress enough how bad I thought this movie was. From the beginning, the audience stood over Pacino's terrible southern accent. Poor Al really looked really haggard, and I can't tell if this was rightly part of his role as a drug-abused publisher, or maybe he just didn't sleep before he came to the set. However, much worse than Pacino's close-ups is the miserable excuse for a plot. Early in the film, we are told that Pacino's character is gay, and I suppose that was what the scriptwriter originally intended. Later, however, we should suspend our adultery and believe that both Tea Leoni and Kim Basinger (both are lame roles sleep) lust for this older, half-dead-looking, ornate man with the ridiculous accent. The worst part in general was the main plot thread that had to do with some corporate espionage that has never been fully explained and we never ever care about at least. Because this was a preview, I will reserve my final judgment due to the possibility of resumption and editing, but you can bet that I do not pay a cent to watch this in theaters.
