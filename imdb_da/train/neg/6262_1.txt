I agree with the reviews I have read here and I have no words to define such turkey as this, but in spite of everything, I can still find a reason why movies exist here. Do you repeat the good days when the video was a prosperous business, and many movies were made with the only reason to fill the shelves in the video stores? This film comes from that period, and I can imagine that it was the only reason why it was produced, and so did many, many, many other stinkers. Do you remember "Rambo" imitations? And so many slashers of Z grade, I still feel nostalgia for that period. About this movie I can say that I did not waste my time watching it because I quickly pushed forward the button after the first fifteen minutes, just to find a very fun scene where a guy pushed an ax against heads that exploded because they were completely discovered, they were made of plastic. And at the end, yes, it was so badly filmed that I couldn't understand what happened. That is the same, I had not followed the non-existing piece at all. But boy, the video age was a great age despite movies like this.
