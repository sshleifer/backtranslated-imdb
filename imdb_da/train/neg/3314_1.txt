Reading through all these positive reviews I find myself amazed. How is it that so many enjoyed what I consider to be a bad bad fit for my second favorite Jane Austen novel? There are many problems with the film already mentioned in a few reviews; Simply saying it's a hammed-up, over-acted, chintzy mess from opening credits to butchery ending. <br /> <br /> While many characters are mis-cast and neither Ewan McGregor nor Toni Collette put in a performance worthy of them, the worst is by far Paltrow. I have greatly enjoyed her performance in some roles, but here she is disgusting - she is self-conscious, nasal, slouching and completely disconnected from her characters and those around her. An extremely disappointing effort - although a perfect Emma couldn't have saved this movie.
