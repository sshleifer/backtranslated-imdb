Disappointing movie. The performance of the players is weak. Set is fine, could have been better. The story is also weak. Sequences are awful. Sound and quality of film is unclear. The history of the Kazakh people was told very badly. This film should have included several Kazakh actors, in leading roles. And should also have been in Kazakh language. Kuno Bekker and Jay Hernandez are Latin American origin. I do not understand it. Since then, Spanish-speaking people play Turkish-Mongolian people. This movie is shamed by the Kazakh cinema. Rustam Ibragimbekov disappointed me. He is one of the finest filmmakers in the world. Czekh's director is excused as he is not nomadic in origin, he cannot know the true spirit and history of nomads.
