I will not mention anything of the plot, because although it would be very predictable anyway, the one remarkable plot twist is given everywhere, in the movie commentaries in the plot overview here and even in synopsis on my Netflix envelope. I could have had it more if I hadn't known it. Maybe. This movie has an erroneous good casting, most of which have fair actions with the rather limited material at hand, including Donald Sutherland, Lesley Ann Warren and Tia Carrere and Rosemary Dunsmore in smaller portions. It was impossible to like William McNamara, but it was clearly of design. And there were a couple of quick naked scenes by callipygian Lenore Zann. But none of this brings the least recommendation from me. Do none of these fine actors actually read these scripts before signing up?
