First, this is a very dated film, non-focussed in its exhibition of leftist political revolution. Honestly, when someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to cease to be intellectual (which in itself is quite unnoticed when the answer was arrived at just being intellectual), it reduces me to despair; as if we were all to return to being monkeys in the name of equality - that is simply ridiculous. Our intellectuality is only one of many human qualities, but that does not mean that we should not educate ourselves to the highest degree. But undoubtedly this non-educational message is linked to Godard's use of rock music; thus The Rolling Stones. The song 'Sympathy for the Devil', whose creation we witness and from which the film takes its name, is actually nothing special. The chord sequence, which is not particularly original, was used for much better effect in Led Zeppelin's 'Thankyou' (Led Zeppelin II). Apart from that, 'Sir' Mick Jagger declares in his usual nebulous way (rather than Bob Dylan) - noting how the first melodic phrase is unimaginatively re-emphasized again to form the verse. In addition to the fact that the black panther depicted in this film does not seem to know what they are fighting for, the most interesting scenes involve the equation of fascism with pornography; a message that actually undermines the sexual liberation of the 1960s and today (in fact, a message that would believe in The Rolling Stone's behavior around the time the movie was made). No wonder the DVD was released with The Sunday Times! For a truly deep historical exhibition of left-wing sympathy, listen to Luigi Nono's masterpiece, 'Al Gran Sole carico'd'amore'.
