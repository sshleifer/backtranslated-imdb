That's good, I didn't look at this while I was pregnant. I would definitely have cried my eyes and / or vomit. It was kind of cruel that mainly disturbs. Personally, I thought the child was sweet in his own, twisted way. But as a mother I was frightened when Beth piled up in the stomach, and when Virgina interrupted the baby during her third trimester with rusty tools, no less. Also as wildlife I almost cried when she scratched the cat to a bloody pulp. But as scary and scary as the child, I was rooting for living. And as twisted as the film, I was extremely fascinated to see the sequel ...... ......... ....... ......... ......... ....... ...... ... ..
