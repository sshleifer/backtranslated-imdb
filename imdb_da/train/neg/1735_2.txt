I get the feeling that the producers of this mess were out to make the most painful, ridiculous Western ever made. "PAINFUL" is the best word I can think of to describe it. <br /> <br /> On the plus side you have lovely color photography and beautiful and well-chosen Rhonda Fleming. My sympathy goes to Jacques Aubuchon (who played the crumpled) who acted well enough in an annoying role, written so horribly that no actor could give an enjoyable performance. The production values ​​were quite good, which only served to highlight the horrible story and script. <br /> <br /> Things I hated: Stewart Granger looked a bit like a western figure, what with his British accent, nicely tailored outfit, and stupidly immaculate, always white carpet tied around his neck. It became tedious how the townspeople and his son had been harassing and insulting Granger at all times, and he never spoke or replied. I know we should suspend unbelievers and appreciate Western as symbolic moral plays, but this broke it with ridiculously unrealistic and predictable scenes. The worst is at the end, when Granger miraculously and single-handedly plants dynamites around a canyon pass, the bad cattle will pass through, and so granger plants themselves in the perfect place so he can shoot the dynamite from a very long distance for Creating cliff rails to bury and joke the cattle and evil guys, who apparently destroy them all, save the two main evil. Next worst is all about the plot, which is filled with soap opera scenes. Nothing in the movie seemed credible: I couldn't believe what the whole conflict was about. The bad guy drove his flock through to the market and wanted the cows to chew some grass along the way; I can't see why something couldn't have been prepared. Need a landslide battle for that? Don't see it.
