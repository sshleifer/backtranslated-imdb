Writer director Tony Piccirillo adapted his own game of a straight man, recently widowed, and learned in the last three weeks that he is HIV positive; He tracks down one gay partner he has ever had, brings him to an apartment and binds him up, forcing a blood test on the guy and promising bloody revenge if the results come back positively. The needy idea sounds better on paper than it plays out. James Marsden's catch is realistic cynical and snotty, but the actor's own artificial way is disturbing - it's like seeing a roadshow version of Tom Cruise. Scott Speedman has to work harder with the more challenging role, but his personality - turning from shy guy to kidnapper is not convincing, and neither is the conversation the two men have. Marsden's gay boy is not apathetic, of course - he is immediately sympathetic to Speedman's guilt - but he doesn't respond or behaves like any gay man would in this situation. The movie is not a copy, exactly, but it is a scam, handicapped further by the bad editing, the poorly-thought-out flashbacks, the low-budget production and the grand finale that tastes of silly pretension and soothing melodrama. * 1/2 from ****
