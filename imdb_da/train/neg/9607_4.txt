Don't listen to the misleading title "Werewolf Woman". Europeans are well-known for emphasizing sex and nudity over the actual scarecrows in their horror movies, but this one is just a little too much. "Werewolf Woman" seems to have a blurry sex scene cut off with the title character being crazy and brutally killing his partner. Fun the first few times, but a hundred minutes of this gets very monotonous quickly. Is not even a werewolf, but a schizochick whose ancestor was hanged by lycantropy. The movie can't even determine its tone, with the first ten minutes (a flashback) being legitimate supernatural scare (I thought I was in a classic leaving classic) to a pretty bad character study of the woman who was repeatedly abused and tortured to a revenge thriller. In the end, the instructor insists that this is based on a true story. Yeah okay. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there are a few entertaining aspects of production. The title waswolf is a look, and there are a few good things and naked scenes. But these get pretty monotonous fast. The duplicated dialogue is also quite hilarious in a rental fashion, especially the world's most fluctuating doctor (he drinks at work). Unfortunately, the movie gets rather annoying quickly. There is no real plot or anything else really. It's a shame because I read a description, I felt the movie had some real potential. "Werewolf Woman" is far slow, slow moving and a little meaningless, even by the standards of exploitation. (4/10)
