Two years ago at Sundance, I loved Josh Kornbluth's direct debut Haiku Tunnel. So I was looking forward to his brother (and frequent partner) Jacobs, The best thief in the world. This is a drama about a seemingly good child growing up in a lower class area in New York. The film is not without its exciting moments. But at times it is as if Kornbluth is working too hard to say the obvious: Life can be very difficult for some people. And life is not fair. <br /> <br /> More subtly and more importantly, our understanding is that, despite all these slightly abominable cultural support and the antisocial behavior they can spawn, these signs have no shortage of goodness and humanity. We can recoil in their language and their living conditions, but we cannot discount their intention. And their struggle to maintain a family during such adversity actually has some nobility that most of us can hardly appreciate. Kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood, and his compassion for the people is evident throughout. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, the best thief in the world suffers from many painful mistakes (including the title). The signs are not very credible. Scripture is uneven. And the plot line is hardly visible. And for many it is most worrying that Kornbluth uses two young black boys that mimic gangsta rap between scenes. For each of its own: But while I do not question the potential realism of this phenomenon, it makes me difficult to see 5-year-old children mf'ing and talking about having sex with a line-up of women. It is unnecessary shock value and is a forced bit of borrowed interest.
