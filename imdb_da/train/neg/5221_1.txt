Hi I'm from Denmark, and one day I had a movie evening with my friends. You brought this movie with him "Russian terminator" and it was extremely terrible. Having seen less than half a minute, we decided to fast forward only at some ridiculous "highlights" or should I say "lowlights" in the movie. I was actually most surprised to find out that this film was produced here in my home country Denmark ... it must have been the biggest mistake this country has ever made.
