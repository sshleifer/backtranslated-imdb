I would love this movie. How could I not love it? Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Stanley Donen; all icons in their own way. However, the train wrecked that was Suzy Parker ruined the whole experience for me. Her plays were so appalling that I sat there with my jaw hanging open and not believing my eyes or ears. I could hardly make it through a view, it's so embarrassing that she's in this. <br /> <br /> Cary? Beautiful and in a nice dramatic shape. Jayne? Adorable, endearing and of course having a ball. The support cast makes it okay, and the city of San Francisco is trapped in all its amazing retro elegance. <br /> <br /> So you see Suzy Parker trying to speak her lines with a tree, a mortality, a cluelessness simply speaking the faith. Who told this creature she could ACT ?? Oy VEY, people.
