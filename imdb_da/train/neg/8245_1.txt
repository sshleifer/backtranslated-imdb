I can't believe anyone liked this movie. I've seen a lot of low-budget indie movies, but this one sucked completely. Low budget does not mean that the film should be denied. Horror does not mean that the film should be denied. There was nothing scary about this movie at all. It was just a gore party and a particularly disturbing thing about it. The action was average as they were all unheard-of actors, but the story was pathetic, the dialogue was pathetic. The film tries to come out as "artistic" or something. This is not one of the truly amazing indie films that only cost thousands of dollars to make, but are incredibly well done. This was nothing more than an excuse for some extremely ill people to film their perverted occupations. Other reviews here also said that the soundtrack sucked ... that's because most of it was written by the same person and some of the songs were written by one of the film's authors. There were no redeeming qualities for this movie at all. A complete waste of my time and money.
