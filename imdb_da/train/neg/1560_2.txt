This movie can't even be said to be bad, for it is unfortunately just painfully mediocre. Lack of genuine joke or imagination stretches a thin plot to the absolute limit, and the "jokes" (which are predictable and worn) are spun out to such a disorderly length that boredom and yawning quickly overtake the viewer. Another notch to mark the sad decline of John Waters and a reminder that what "shocked" or amused us 30 years ago does not work quite the same now. We've seen everything before, and it no longer breaks taboos because they have long since evaporated. A big lady.
