Pathetic is the word. Bad plays, pathetic script, cheezy dialogue and hip hop music and fashion ... what the hell was that about? The director of this movie seems as bad as the movie he made. If someone would have taken some time and effort to rework the whole thing, it might have had a chance. Bet that the studios are still trying to figure out how to screw up so much. <br /> <br /> The absolute best thing about this movie was Stacey Dash ... the Asian chick wasn't bad either. These also gave the whole movie. If it wasn't for them, I'd have ruined my copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> If any of those who haven't seen this yet and had an idea that, don't waste your time ... you'll only regret it later.
