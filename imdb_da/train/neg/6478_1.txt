I'll say it again: this movie was completely paralyzed. Children like it, of course, but adults ... dubious. The whole thing was basically a rehash of the original, as one might expect, as they largely explored the whole concept in the first film, but did they still have the whole rehash whole movie? I mean, everything is re-done from the little mermaid. The worst part of it is Morgana "Ursula's crazy sister" who comes out of nowhere and threatens Melody, which is ridiculous when Triton is there with his magic trident. Why didn't Triton know about it? Because the plot required him to do nothing. I could go on, but I won't. The whole thing is a shameless attempt to rake in more money from the little mermaid and was, of course, thrown together without any thought because they knew it would sell. Overall, it's a terrible waste of time.
