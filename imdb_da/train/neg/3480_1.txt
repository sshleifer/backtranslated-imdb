This movie is horrible. TERRIBLE. One of the worst movies ever. I can't even imagine that Gigli is worse than this. Previews made us say "NO", but looking for something in the middle of the dreams out there right now we decided to go ahead and give it a shot. <br /> <br /> STUPID US. <br /> <br /> Affleck is NOT an actor. He is a picture and can look good with explosions, but not even that kind of Bruce Willis got in "Die Hard". If he removed his shirt and ran around fighting evil guys, it would be a comedy. <br /> <br /> The best part was Catherine O'Hara - she's always good. Gandolfini flops again (if it wasn't for the Soprano, he would be washed up) as he did in "The Mexican". Affleck hogs every scene and as others have said - no character has any motivation whatsoever for their actions. <br /> <br /> AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS.
