This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not making fun. The next time it comes, I'll just run my head on a wall. It would be more comfortable to sit in an emergency room trying to explain to a doctor why my brain is raised than trying to do it again through this movie. I hope that black and never works together on a project this badly again. they are both good comedians, so I was shocked that it was so awkward. <br /> <br /> If they were to do it all over again, I'm sure they'd decide not to. The people who fronted the money must have lost a ton. Not really - because the special effects (all 2 of them) were terrible.
