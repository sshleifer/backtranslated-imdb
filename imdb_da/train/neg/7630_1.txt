A boring movie about a boring city in the 50s. How can anyone believe it's a classic? The producer almost finished her career by pushing her girlfriend, Cybil Shepard, into several films that were far beyond her skill. I think this film gives an insight into how little Peter Bogdonovitch's future films should be. Cybil Shepard's career dived after being in several films produced by Peter Bogdonovich. It was only until "Moonlighting" that her career began to come back. I thought the play was a bad transfer of "Graduate". I noticed that this movie has not been shown in the United States. The only place I've seen it was abroad in Europe late at night.
