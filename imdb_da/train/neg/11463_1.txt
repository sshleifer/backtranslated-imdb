This is just an answer to yahoo that says this movie is more realistic than the classic genre that defines MASTERPIECE, Jaws. Yes, brainiac, big whites (and other sharks, bulls, roosters, oceanic whit tip, tiger) have been known to populate areas where easy prey is found. People do not often do that on the menu, but it is repeatedly pointed out that the shark in the film shows abnormal behavior. It's not as if it never happened. The odds of a killer whale destroying almost an entire city designate a human nemesis, sink several dozen thick hulled North Atlantic fishing boats and know when certain people, all friends of the above "nemesis", are close enough to the water for it to reach , is so slim as being ridiculous. Much like this dared by a jaw knock-off. Ridiculous. Large white sharks are also known to chew often on boats, protective underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards as they resemble seals below. A shark Bruce's size (if you don't know it, look it up) would be more than able to sink a boat like The Orca (hi! That's the name of the blatant rip-off we're discussing!) As it would weigh up to 6000 lbs. I could go on, but I don't have to. Jaws are great (better actors, better effects, better music, better writing), Orca's crap (BLATANT rip-off of Jaws, lousy writing, abominable effects, most ridiculous plot this side of an Olson Twins flick). It doesn't take a master from Columbia University to see it. See better movie.
