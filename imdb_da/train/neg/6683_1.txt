I am glad that the people at IMDb could decipher which genre this movie falls into. I suspected it was a comedy, but as it also seems to be a dark and solemn melodrama, I was not sure . For a comedy, it is astonishingly deprived of even the smallest venture in the realm of humor - until the ridiculous "twist" ends, confirming what a complete waste of time the entire movie actually is. It's hard to describe how amateurish THE FAZING really is. Has anyone involved in this movie any idea what to do? In fact worth looking at, so you can stare at the screen in the unlucky disbelief of how terrible it is.
