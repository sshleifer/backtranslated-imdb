This movie is really incredible. I've seen so many cheap trash bins, especially a lot of 'Full Moon' Pictures, but 'Dollman' is really hard. So much comes together: the ridiculous story, the actors always in the parody's edge and the special effects! How long I could talk about them! It's a really bad movie, but also one of the most fun. If you are a fan of bad movies to laugh about, you should see it. And don't miss the 'Dollman vs Demonic Toys'. It's really fun and worse.
