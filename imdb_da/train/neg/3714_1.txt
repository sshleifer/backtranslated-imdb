This movie is a rewriting of the 1978 Warren Beatty movie, "Heaven Can Wait", but it is written for the Rock-Stand-Up Comedic style. The premise remains the same: Lance Barton (Rock) is taken before his lifetime is up and works with God's representative, King King, to come back to earth as another. As in Beatty's movie; He chooses the murdered Charles Wellington, a rich white man, all because he wants Sontee Jenkins (Regina King), who happens to be in Wellington's house under the murder. The role of Mrs Wellington and her lover suffers from this remake, and the idea of ​​turning an old white multi-millionaire into a stand up black comedian trying to woo Sontee simply doesn't work. Also, the intercuts used to display Rock as Wellington and then as the real 'white' Wellington, miserably fails. Improvements could have been made on the original Beatty plot - which in itself does not master the idea of ​​life after death - but they certainly should not be in "down to earth".
