One of Scorsese's worst. An average thriller; The only thing to recommend is De Niro playing psycho. The final is typical of this genre, ie over-the-top, with yet another almost invincible, painless pain. I didn't like the 60's original, and this version wasn't much of an improvement on it. I have no idea why Scorsese wasted his time on a remake. So again, considering how badly his latest movie has been (I refer to his boring Buddhist films and all those with his new favorite actress, the blonde girl Di Caprio), it's not that bad to compare. And considering Spielberg wanted to do the remake ... could have been far worse.
