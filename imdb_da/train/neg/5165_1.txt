I was looking forward to this trip and was terribly disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I am very easily nudged at roller coaster and amusement parks. <br /> <br /> The slide part was just okay - and it was about 30 seconds of a 90 second ride. <br /> <br /> It was visually boring and poorly executed. <br /> <br /> It was desperately trying to be like a mix of the far superior Indiana Jones and Space Mountain rides and Disneyland and failed in all aspects. It was not exciting or exciting at least.
