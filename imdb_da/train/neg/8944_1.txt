I watched this movie last year in the Media Class, and I have to say that I really hated it. I was in year 10 (and 15 years) so it may have something to do with it. But for English this year, year 11, we had to read Animal Farm, also by George Orwell. Apart from the fact that the book is based on the revolution, my view is that it is a terrible book, and I also hated it. <br /> <br /> But in 1984 I think it was the most disturbing movie I've ever seen, and I think George Orwell is one of the most horrible people ever to live on this planet. I'm sorry for everyone who loved her work, but unfortunately I didn't. The themes in the movie were well portrayed, but the way the whole movie was put on and the events that took place within it were not my standards. It's just my opinion, and I'm sure many many other people thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
