Casting is ok. The script is awkward at times, and it takes a while to find out what the meaning of the movie is. I found myself looking forward to doing the dishes. The Shehan bit is a cheesy statement about the war. I suppose we shouldn't notice it ... we did. It's a house you did no more than kill 45 minutes. Bruserdelen ... hey? What was it about? Literally, I have a client, "Ok you can use our shower." Yawn. The angles try too hard. There was a set of forests, suddenly it is gone because you can see right through, so the next is deep, and animals are dying. In the end, it's a horrible movie with boring proportions.
