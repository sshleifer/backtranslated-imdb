I have just realized that seeing this movie has lost valuable precious moments in my life, I will never come back. This movie is not just poor its crooked. It reminded me of any stereotypical black sitcom ever made. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Flixmedia expects a race problem, apparently "white" people don't like it because it doesn't have white actors. Comrade, I think you find the reason no one liked this was because watching paint dry is far more entertaining and more fun then this pile of drivel. Stop making crap movies
