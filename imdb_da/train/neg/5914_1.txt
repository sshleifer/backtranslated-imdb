This movie is really boring. It was banned in Chinese cinema and I can see why. It is not because it is critical for the communist regime, but simply because the film is of such low quality. I would never like to pay money to see this. I love movies from Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou, and I am disappointed that such a bad movie could come out of China. It seems to ignore the audience and the director seems to have made the film for himself. The shots of a person standing there doing nothing for up to a minute are fun and there are plenty of them. The camera and video quality is incredibly poor. I watched this movie online and it seems that people actually like this movie. The only explanation I have for this is that some movie buffs think that if a movie is not in English, it is automatically good. I don't see any reason why people like this. This is not an art film, it is celluloid waste. (That's if they actually shot it on movies they didn't do)
