It's a ghost story. It's a cannibalism story. It's a revenge story. It is a very badly made movie with much violence. I suppose it follows cheaply in line with all the slasher movies you've ever seen. It has the usual, isolated place, the cuddly campers going out to the desert. Granted, there are some rather intense scenes. It's just so boring. Poor editing and the whole work. There are ghost children who sound like they are talking in a waste bin. I'm not really sure what regulates the ghosts and the psycho with the seed hood plays on. It also has the gross out scene where a man eats a piece of meat that is actually what is left of his wife. A friend of mine once asked me why it was necessary to show this kind of free and ill violence. I am afraid that this is only another step in our desensitized development. Three are no wisdom here, no tongue in the cheek, only a dull waste of time. Lots of blood; small plot.
