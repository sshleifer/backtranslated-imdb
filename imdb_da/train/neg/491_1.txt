As others have noted, this film is criminally inaccurate in its portrayal of the artist's life, and I for one was very annoyed and offended ... by its transformation of her rape into a tragic love affair by the influence that her rape was responsible for " awaken her talent "by her complete disregard of her work as it made it a gender object, you get back and forth at that time. Also, I find it disturbing that people who are not familiar with Gentileschi will watch this movie and walk away with that kind of impression of her.
