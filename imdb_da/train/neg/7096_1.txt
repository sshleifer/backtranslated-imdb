It is amazing that it has been so terrible at so many levels. The writing, the play, the steering and the choice of cast are all terrible. Costumes, sets and pseudo-medieval languages ​​are also horrible. In a strange way, I actually enjoyed this movie when I first accepted that it wouldn't be good. It seems a pity that people will spend so much time and effort producing something so poor, since they really could have made something pretty decent out of the premise (albeit not very credible!), But instead we are treated to a rather nauseating and cheesy tale of dragons and knights lacking any of the charms found in other such fantasy films. Let's just hope the Lord of the Rings is a little better! Oh, and David Thewlis' haircut makes him look like He-Man. It does!
