Tough guys, sexy women, lots of swords and a most convincing monster rising from the depths of a polluted lake. You'd think "Monster" would be fun ... but that's not true. It makes the star Tony Eisley and John Carradine, and in my book that makes it worth seeing at least once. In an interview with "Fangoria" in 1987, Eisley recalled that Herbert Strock had directed the bulk of the movie, but somehow Kenneth Hartford - who only controlled the footage with his children Andrea and Glenn (depicting characters called Andrea and Glenn , in a particularly inventive trip - received full credit. Considering how terrible the end result was, Strock was probably glad he hadn't been credited! "Monster" has the look and feel of a TV movie from the mid to late 70's, which is why I like to leave it in the background so often. As entertainment, it falls flat on the face, but as a reminder of another age and a disappeared type of film making, it is very effective. The only thing missing is a car chase.
