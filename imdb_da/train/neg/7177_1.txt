Being that I loved the original "Caligula", even with all its flaws, I must say that this remake trailer was immense. <br /> <br /> Listening to Jovovich says in the lazy American accent "Mmm cuhligyooluh ..." makes me feel sick. The set doesn't seem to be Roman ... it looks like a rich actor's Hollywood house farmhouse, and the Roman costumes look like cheap crap you buy in a suburban costume store. <br /> <br /> The "charming" Adriana Asti looks like a fifty-year-old Hispanic woman who is totally scared out of her heart as if not knowing it's a movie trailer. The play must be some of the worst I have ever seen, with most lines being random actors screaming "CALIGULAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!" as loud and uncomfortable as possible. <br /> <br /> The random sex scenes also followed a good 40 or 50% of the trailer, and the scenes of remarkable actresses / actresses like Gerard Butler (who puts the screen in shadows in all three and a half seconds) do nothing but To look uncomfortable or go all over the top with their minimal lines, just pull it down with the ridiculousness of their delivery. Courtney Love's part consists of her resembling her usual dumpy crack whore even leaning against a door mumbling about the moon or something. You can't tell because she's either full or tall or just mumbling idiotically. <br /> <br /> Karen Black is just annoying ... randomly laughing and screaming in such a way that it annoys you. <br /> Helen Mirren ... she was in the original and her back to "Caligula" consists of ... "CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!" I am especially "love" (and by love I mean hate) Ennia's line, "Caligola ... yes nothing me something incoherent * .... * something similar to j00nalo *" It's also insanely arrogant to say Caligula's four annual government was greater than the birth and death of Jesus. In fact, this should be the worst, most exploitative, self-reliant arrogant body that is labeled "art" I've ever seen. Though Gore Vidal hated the original Caligula, he should not have appeared or given his name to this crap pile, no matter how much they paid him (unless it was a billion trillion yen). Worst trailer ever.
