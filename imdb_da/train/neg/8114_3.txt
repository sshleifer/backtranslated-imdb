... primarily because Ju-on 2 boasts a monstrous FORTY minutes of material that is literally taken straight out of the first Ju-on - and when you think the sequel only runs for 76 minutes, you leave 36 original minutes' worth the film. Ho-hum. I found it deeply annoying - as if the viewers simply wouldn't remember the same thing! - Not to mention boring, to see it all over again. <br /> <br /> OK, the complaint aside, the Ju-on 2 city line was that it should explain many of the unanswered questions from the first movie, which honestly, over 36 minutes, simply don't go far enough to do some kind of sense of the original story's highly regarded story. However, there are some really good new horror sequences that show how well the movie could have been if it had some time to develop; and some of the questions raised by the original - some but not all - are answered. <br /> <br /> So concluded - if you loved the first original movie and want to see some further developments in the story, go for it - but just keep your remote hand with your finger on the fast forward button for forty minutes.
