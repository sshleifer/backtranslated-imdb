The main reason for writing this review is I found this "review" of a great game and worthy 1972 movie, a horrible movie experience. If I can save someone from seeing it, I've done a good thing. <br /> <br /> This "new" version is full of talent and everything goes wrong. Kenneth Branagh OK is a nasty, sterile, a note set. He continues to film the film from every arty, distracting, self-centered angle possible. We see reflections from the stainless steel actors, on safety screens, shots of their heads from 200 ft above, close-ups of eyes, chopped, and over and over again. The play, by a Nobel laureate, introduces long stretches of unpleasant gay quarrel that is falsified by both parties .... I think ?? Given the character "twists", how would I know? The characters themselves, so properly drawn in the original, are crass and unsympathetic. The maturity has been cut by one hour, which is either the real problem or the best thing the director did for us. The actors perform their lines effectively, but nothing they say or do is externally credible. Jude Law is over the top more than Caine, but as the credited producer must have had Branagh's blessing. All in all, I found this to be an ugly look, a compelling shell of a former classic. Why was it even made ??? The paying public spent less than $ 4M worldwide to see it! A vain piece of work that fails at every turn.
