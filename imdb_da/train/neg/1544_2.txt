I think I laughed twice. The line where the protagonist says something about being from the streets. And then I forget the second time I laughed. It was probably in the beginning. <br /> <br /> This should be one of the thinnest movies ever. Isn't Hollywood aware that this kind of humor is degrading and sad, really. You can only insult yourself so many times. <br /> <br /> 2/10
