It was Jon Pertwee who said "It's very hard to be fun, but very easy to be silly". Well, if so, PASTY FACES is "very easy". David Baker (as instructor / screenwriter) and his cast seem to be under the impression that comedy involves stealing scenes and style from superior Britcoms as LOCK STOCK .. and TRAINSPOTTING, using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping up and down speeches very quickly vote very loudly. Alan McCaffrey suffers from this type of OTT performance, but not enough to destroy the movie because there are not enough movies to destroy. PASTY FACES is terrible on all fronts, especially scriptwise. I couldn't understand why it ended with how it did, it just seemed to stop in a very abrupt and stupid way. Oh and other clear mistakes are that you need a visa to visit the United States and a green card to work there - This movie wants you to think you can get out of a plane and start a new life in America without any permission - that you are still being paid to donate blood in America. People I know in America who donate blood tell me donations for donations stopped several years ago - and that you can buy any kind of weapon from a gun store. As far as I know, arms law in America is different from state to state, but no arms stores sell anti-tank weapons over the counter. So we have got a very wrong view of America from a very unreal and oh so unfunny movie. Maybe this vengeance for BRAVEHEART is a very Hollywood show of the Scots? Maybe, but it doesn't stop PASTY FACES from being a crap comedy
