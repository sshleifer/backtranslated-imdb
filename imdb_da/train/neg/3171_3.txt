Was it the biggest movie I've ever seen? No. Was it the worst? No. <br /> <br /> As a mother of four children, it's nice to see something that was light and entertaining. It was amazing, but it was sweet. I think it certainly had some room to improve, but it was trying. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if this movie deserves the extreme level of abuse from the other reviewer. Of course they don't care about Eva Longoria. I think she was better at this than in The Sentinel. I think movies are a matter of meaning. The actors play a major role in whether it is a hit or a flop. <br /> <br /> Maybe they didn't play out. Maybe there were too many things going on. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to speak for an average movie, not a horrible one. It could just be a chick flick. Such as the movie The Split-Up or French Kiss. My husband is still talking about them. :)
