I totally agree with jamrom4 .. this was the only most horrible movie I've ever seen .. holy crap it was terrible .. I was warned not to see it .. and stupidly I saw it anyway .. approx. 10 minutes in painful experience I totally abandoned to see cruelty .. but sat through until the end .. just to see if i could .. well i did and now i wish i didnt .. it was disgusting ... nothing happened and the end was all preachy .. no movies that are bad, have the right to survive. I urge all of you to save yourself the scared busts of fat busts. If only I had warned the same warning. please save yourself from this movie .. i have a feeling of those who rated it a lot, was involved in the movie .. and all must be deleted from the planet's surface.
