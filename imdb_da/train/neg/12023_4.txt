Reed Diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia who has been in a mental asylum for over a decade after being found wondering on the roads with blood on his hands. Doctors will test an experimental new drug that will return its lost memories if it works. But when the fabrics give him hallucinations of a demon, he chooses to flee instead. Outside, he is friendly with a young boy whose founder (Greg Grunberg) mistreates his mother, will not let her get near the darkroom in the basement and seems suspicious in general. <br /> <br /> While the general "mystery" movie is a bit easy to identify way before it is revealed, I found Mr. Diamond's play to be exciting enough to keep my attention all the way through. (In light of full disclosure, I have been a big fan of his homicide and his short but extremely crucial role in The Shield through Journeyman & Dollhouse). Not a good movie or good, but serviceable enough. Although I liked it better than the previous movies I have seen from director / writer Michael Hurst (Room 6, Pumkinhead 4, Mansquito).
