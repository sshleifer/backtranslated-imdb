Yes, this movie has the kids going into space camps and it probably starts in order when the kids meet and learn the ropes. Then they introduce Jinx, a robot that couldn't exist in 1986, as they have nothing to do with this kind of artificial intelligence now. Kid becomes buddy with robot and robot repays child's kindness by shooting him and a group of other children in this camp into outer space with a very limited supply of oxygen and radios that do not have the signal to reach the room. This camp is also not much fun as these kids are put to real training and the instructors get them over to fail missions or do the right things. Give it peace, they are there for fun, not to become astronauts yet, just give them the experience of spaceflight, not a military camp. However, you will see Joaquin Phoenix in a relatively early role. So in the end a movie trying to be realistic in some areas, but with the introduction of Jinx and other factors, you might as well get the kids to fight space aliens on everything else that happened in the movie as it would have made the movie a little more enjoyable at least for me. Probably for a few others too, who else would like to see Kate Capshaw's face ripped apart at some strange super alien creatures.
