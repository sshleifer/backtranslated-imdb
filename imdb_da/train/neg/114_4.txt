It's not thrown. A finer group of actors you couldn't find. It's not the setting. The director is in love with New York City, and at the end of the movie we are all together! Woody Allen couldn't improve what Bogdonovich has done here. If you want to fall in love or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is no. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the instructor's own experience in Hollywood, what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality for him and his colleagues, but it is a fantasy for most of us in the real world. So in the end, the film is hollow and low and modest.
