Can fake scenes ruin a picture? You wouldn't believe it, but it's actually for me in here. Listen, I have many classic era movies, and I know pretty much what to do without, for example, the drivers control immobile cars in front of a screen etc. But much of the hokey business has to do with action scenes. To have false nature, fake mountains and flowers shot after shot as seen in "Brigadoon" become insulting after a while. <br /> <br /> As far as music entertainment went, this is always subjective. Which songs a person likes, another can't so it shouldn't be a big part of judging a movie (if anyone likes the songs). I could blow this movie to its corny 1950s songs, dances, romances and characters, but it was the 50s and many people liked this kind of thing. Musicals did very well in the 50s. Me, I liked the '30s and' 40s with the big taps. By the fifties he was out and this new thing - which I can stand - was it. Does it make a miserable movie? No. It just does one I didn't care about. <br /> <br /> Despite the good cast, good director and high expectations, this movie bombarded at the box office and with me. I should have liked it more, to be a dreamer myself, and that is a good part of this story. I am not the cynical type and a lovely city and nice people who make me feel good sounds awful appeal. So why couldn't I connect with this movie? Part of it was also the dance. I don't care about the things that replace tap dancing on the screen. But - no - it really made me what happened. There was no Scotland, no highland, just a hokey-looking background to make it look like this, and it almost happened to me from the start. Score a point for today's realism, where they "go on the spot" most of the time.
