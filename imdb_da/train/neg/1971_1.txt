This movie is deeply disappointing. Not only does Wenders only show a very limited musical spectrum of Blues, it's his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings to movies that make watching and listening dull. The only highlight in the film is the interview of a Swedish couple who were friends with J.B. Lenoir shows their private video footage and tells stories. Wender's introduction of the cinematic topic begins quite interestingly - referring to the world's culture (or indeed American culture) traveling in space, but his limited look at the subject, as well as the neither fun nor completely fascinating reproduction of stories from the 30s does this movie as a pure sleeping aid. Yawn. I had expected more of him.
