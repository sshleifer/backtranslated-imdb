This typically melodramatic Bollywood movie has inexplicably become a favorite with Western critics. The script is ridiculous, the play is over-the-top, and it seems cheesy. The only reasons to see this soap opera are the wonderful songs sung by Mangeshkar and the curtain call of the legendary Meena Kumari. Seeing the actor, who was ill during the shooting and wanted to go to death aged 40 shortly after the film was released, has the same fascination as seeing a train wreck. Her former husband, Amrohi, wrote and directed, but lacked the competence to perform both tasks well. Bollywood has produced much better movies.
