1. watched 12/24/2009 ?? 4 out of 10 (Dir-Robert Ellis Miller): Emotional Christmas fluff that doesn't really get exactly enough to explain how the real story happened in this fact-based incident of a man mistakenly put in prison trying to get a job for his family to have Christmas happen to them. The three children in the family then run away from home on a trip to Washington D.C. to exploit the then president of the United States, Herbert Hoover. This trek gives some side stories like their positive encounters with a hobo and a puppet theater, making the story a bit like a Disney "on the go" movie and not quite right here. At the end there is no information on how the president helped the family, and that is another downpoint to the movie, in my opinion. The movie eventually leads to tears, but it takes too long to get to this. The movie should not have been an original TV movie (according to IMDb), but it has the obvious fade-outs that make it look this way ?? so I'm not sure their information is correct. All in all, this is a simple movie (which could have been more complex) with a happy Christmas-like story, but gentle play and without much substance.
