this movie was banned in england? Why? tom savini, george romero, dario argento, lucio fulci and others had done much worse before and still have since ... <br /> <br /> this movie has all the basics of a decent 70's or early 80's 's horror movie. nice girls (who can't act to save their lives by the way), a horrible lightning with a violent downturn, a scythe, a crazy brother who walks around the family's property and actually a pretty crooked twist in the end. but forbidden? seriously. when the English parliament banned this film, the Italians probably skated their collective donkeys out of how backward and prudish the British really were. <br /> <br /> there were maybe two minutes of total screen time for violence and gore (which was very underdone). there was nudity, but no sex, even though allusions were made for sex, of course. But absolutely nothing worth getting banned. <br /> <br /> I would like to see what could have been done if the filmmakers had a decent budget to work with. as it says, the movie is entertaining, but the lack of image and sound quality goes away from the end result. <br /> <br /> forbidden ... what a joke ...
