.. Wait, I can! This movie is not for the typical movie snap unless you want to brush up on your typical movie definitions, such as "continuity editing" and "geographical match". I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One second they are in the present, the next moment they allegedly in the 70s are running a modern SUV and wearing what looked like me 80s style clothes. I think. I couldn't pay enough attention to it since the action was just awful. I think it has only received attention because it has a 3d that I didn't look at. If you're a b-movie buff, and with b-movies I mean BAD movie, then this movie is for you. It's home theater and any non-sensed style will keep you laughing as long as you stay awake. If your taste is more for Goddard and Antonioni, just skip it.
