This movie is really one of the worst pieces of waste ever. It is really surprising that something so horrible could be done. But if you can stand in the mindset, character development and direction, you can get a kick out of the soundtrack that is so appalling that it is fun. The movie begins terribly and quickly becomes uatches. Someone should give anyone involved in this movie any kind of comfort because their career was probably destroyed due to involvement in this movie. If you end up watching this movie or have seen it already (I feel your pain), these words are too late. For anybody else, stay away at any cost or realize that the movie is so bad that it will waste 2 hours in your life. So at least you can clean up or something while you see it.
