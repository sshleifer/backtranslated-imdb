Well ... tremor I, the original started in 1990, and I found the movie quite enjoyable to see. But they continued to make tremors II and III. Believe me, the movies started to go downhill just after they finished the first thing I mean, ass blowers ??? Now only God himself is able to answer the question "why in the name of God would they create another of these dumpster dives in a movie?" Tremors IV cannot be considered a bad movie, in fact it cannot even be considered a sign of a bad movie, because it lives up to more than that. When I tried to sit around it, I noticed that my eyes began to bleed, and I was hoping that the little girl from the ring would crawl through the TV and kill me. did they really think that the people who had stared in the other movies as if they were out of the wild would make the movie (with exactly the same events) better? Honestly, I would never suggest buying this movie, I think there are cheaper ways to find things that are burning well.
