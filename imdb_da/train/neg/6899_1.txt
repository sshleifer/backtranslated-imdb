Ever wonder why Pacific Islanders apparently automatically assumes the sense of humor of black Americans? Whatever their ethnic origin? Now, this movie won't give any answer to this often-considered issue - but it will provide an excellent case study. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, this movie is a kind of "Old School" for Pacific Island New Zealanders, who immediately raises the question of what exactly is the purpose of such a task. Is it supposed to continue ingrained stereotypes of Pacific Island New Zealanders? or is it supposed to exploit this potential market? The story is weak, jokes humorless, and the ending is expected. This movie has not done anything for the New Zealand cinema as it is only a granted romantic comedy that lacks any kind of profit.
