I see lots of scary movies (or at least they're trying to be) and it must be the worst, if not the 2nd worst movie I've ever had to try to put me through. I never knew the depth of masacism before I rented this piece of mold cheese covered with a used latex contraceptive. I'm a fan of Julian Sans, but it's worse than I would hope for. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the story was promising, and I was fascinated ... in the first and a half minute credits rolled and I had not yet seen which pain looked like first hand. Maybe there are some viewers out there who enjoy it and can point me in the right direction, but then again I know of the viewers who understand whether or not to remember me, especially when we were to turn off the video, and that is simply NOT done with our watching (we had to make an exception of course). <br /> <br /> If it were a remake, I would give it a try as long as they had at most 1% of the original incorporated into it. That's all.
