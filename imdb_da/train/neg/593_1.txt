It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Worse than the most abominable American dross; worse than Glitter - Mariah Carey in American dross par excellence. I can only imagine that the author and the producer took huge amounts of recreational drugs, and when you discussed the plot, it actually thought it was a good idea. it is not. It is rude waste from a lot of toes by Satan himself (who probably could have written a better script if he had thought about it). Robert Jones as Exce Producer, using our taxpayer money (lottery money people) at this piece of nonsense, should be responsible. Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to recreate deaths ??? I ask you - camp like a Christmas tree, death ... 'Mind the doors' is classic of really bad British film, we really don't need a reminder. And we certainly don't need a bad second rate, bad script, poorly developed and bad piece of waste like this. All this from the UK finance agency that brought us Sex Lives of the Potato But ... I rest my case. <br /> <br /> DO NOT pay any money to see this. It's absolute and complete crap - the only saving grace for the producers is that they got a huge source of cash ... our money ... to do it. They were to hang their heads in shame. I'm staggering on the low, low standard of this movie. It makes me Mgr that our national film support agency actually thought it was worth supporting. There is no hope for the British film industry while idiots are running the show. Harvey Wienstein, where are you? Come back, we forgive you !!!
