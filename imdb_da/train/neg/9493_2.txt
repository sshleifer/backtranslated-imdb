This ridiculous movie offers the standard 1970's "hippie mentality" in a nutshell and drills us in the process. It is an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young, innocent women of ancient sex enemies and dishwashers. A na√Øve young hippy played by the waif-like (Kay Lenz) hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys, and one day she meets the ridiculous (Holden) who, already in old age, drinks hard liquor and rinses as actress and she decides that she is in "love" with him. If you think it's superficial, the whole movie encapsulates such scenes. She still says how much she "loves" him, and she only met him, it has thin and very fast. I couldn't help laughing the whole movie. It is obvious that she is just using him as a meal ticket, but the director is immature enough to believe that we should buy that there is actually love that takes place. A disgusting scene is where the two are naked and have sex, I had to speed it up because it almost inspired me to vomit. A corny offering of music from the 70s is also spread through the film. Avoid this if you can. Class D.
