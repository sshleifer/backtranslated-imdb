Gwoemul (Host) - Due to pollution in the Han River, a mutated animal goes on the rampage. The youngest member of the park family is shaken by the animal, and it is up to the rest of her family to find her before becoming the animal's newest meal. <br /> <br /> First, I love monster movies: mutated bears, exaggerated alligators, packs of ravage Komodo dragons, the whole party. The creature features are my favorite kind of horror movie. So I really wanted to host The Host, but it wasn't. <br /> <br /> There were three major issues with it: <br /> <br /> The first can be seen with a quick look at the IMDb page <br /> <br /> Genre: Action / Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Horror / Sci-Fi / Thriller <br /> Too many condemned genres. It took itself too seriously to be a comedy, yet was too light hearted to have any real message (although it apparently tried to make some kind of statement. Anti-pollution, anti-American or anti-government). The drama was displaced and mixed in a confusing mish-mash with all the other styles. Secondly, after the first monster attack, nothing happens for almost the entire movie. The central family walks to look for one of their own, while the governments of Korea and America do not seem to do anything. And that's what they just walk around, occasionally hitting each other, presumably for a bit of comedy relief. This lack of action made my attention wander, and apparently did the same for the director, as the whole plot threads go undissolved (a mystery plague invented by the evil Americans is completely forgotten and never solved). <br /> And finally, the movie is lumpy political. It paints the Americans as stupid and evil, but gives us no American character with more depth than a comic villain. The opening scene has the most obvious stupid American vs wise Korean moment. With a Korean breakfast assistant, his boss, the scout, doesn't ask pouring chemicals into the Han River. The American rejects everyone, but cares maniacally as he instructs the assistant to continue. Besides being racist, it is lazy film making, and there is no excuse for it. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, the monster is good, a mix of The Relic and Deep Rising. Some of the movement effects are pretty cool, and the first monster hunting through the park is very fun. There are also some good shots in the movie. Some of them remind me strangely about how Firefly was filmed (shaking cameras, with no focus pictures, etc.). There is also a good scene at the end, where the hero and a little boy he has saved sit in the family's mobile food stall. It is at night and the snow falls, the street light gives a cold light, but the food stall has a warm glow from it. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was really disappointed with this movie. I was looking forward to a decent creature movie, and instead I get some pseudo-political, horror comedy little. Looking at the comments on IMDb, I can't help but believe that if it had been an American production, it would have been slated. Just because it's a foreign girl doesn't mean good. There have been some amazing films from Korea in recent years (for example, the revenge trilogy and the fraternity), but it is certainly not one of them. <br /> <br /> For once, I am in favor of a remake. Tighten control, improve scripting and this could have been a good movie. As it is, it is not worth a few hours of some time.
