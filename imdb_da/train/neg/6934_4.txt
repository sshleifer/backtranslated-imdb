OK, so of course ppl thought it was a good movie in 1955. <br /> <br /> I sing those fools who still believe it ... It's absolutely rubbish. The story is just. .. ridiculous. The characters are absurd caricatures - but this movie is not for satirism, I'm sure it's a serious drama, isn't it? People say that Dean is great in this movie, and well, maybe he has played his role as well as he might have. His character is supposed to be 16 or 17 or so. But Dean was a 24-year-old man when he made this movie. See that he is agonizing and throwing small tantrums like a 4 year old boy ... it's pathetic. Natalie Wood is beautiful, but the early stages in the police station where she is crying and whining are very convincing. It sets a bad precedent for the movie ... and for the rest, you want to cringe every time one of these ill-acted emotional scenes comes together. <br /> <br /> It may have been good for its time, but in reality its drift is. It may just have been a hype about the dean's death, which has over-inflated reputation for this movie.
