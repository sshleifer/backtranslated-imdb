When I hate to read long essays in the hope of finding a point and being disappointed, I will first tell everyone that this film was horrible. Just awful. And not surprisingly for the reasons mentioned in the first review. I thought I could agree with him when he gave the film the rank it deserved, but was sadly accused of reading what he was saying. I am ashamed to take the same page as someone who commented that the movie "absolutely lacks beautiful women." Let me be the first to say, "Wow! It was certainly some serious in-depth review there. My mind can hardly understand the philosophical musings about this movie." Nevertheless, a lack of "beautiful women" should not be considered crucial to a movie. If you are desperate for "beautiful women", you really have to see other types of movies that do not necessarily fall into the sci-fi category.
