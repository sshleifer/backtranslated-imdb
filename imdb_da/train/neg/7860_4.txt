Martin Weisz, who ruled the solid "Rohtenburg", takes the heat with Wes Craven, for another shabby "The Hills Have Eyes 2". The memory of the legendary original that boasted an incredible story and a dog that has a flashback will be deleted forever by this more technically polished remake (in name only). A bunch of national guardsmen (and women) are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills filled with mutants. One after the other the soldiers are picked. That is it. There is some hardcore violence and a reasonable brutal rape scene, but there is little else to be excited about. The movie's "heroes" are the usual bunch of clich√©s, and the mutants, which are far from Craven's original "family", most closely resemble Brian Thompson of "Cobra", along with some creatures Stan Winston had left from the "Wrong Turn" shooting. Much of the action takes place in caves, ala "The Descent", and is well shot by Sam McCurdy. A ridiculous aspect is Wes and Jonathan Craven's addition of a sympathetic mutant that curls around its hole as Leatherface in Hooper's original "chainsaw". Weisz is being blamed for this tedious debacle, but he is not really guilty because he does his best to maintain excitement and push freshness out of the constructed situations. Not a fan, unfortunately.
