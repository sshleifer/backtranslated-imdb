Visually, this movie is fantastic. It has some lovely black comic moments. But on the whole, the plot is very clich√©, like its apparent message. If you're a fan of over-the-top violence in ordinary movies like hostels or so, you'll love it. If you're looking for something at all, steer away. I saw it as part of edinburgh's film festival 06 and I only chose it because I was looking for something disruptive. In the end, it is not disturbing. Just grinding and uncomfortable to sit through. If you really want to be challenged, see something like The Lost. If you want to be exaggerated or tell your friends about a really shaken movie, then that's for you.
