I give this pretentious waste a 1, simply because I don't think there is a worse movie in the world. I hate this movie, I hate acting, dialogue, attitude, writing and leading. I hope that everyone involved in this movie burns and rats in the darkest circle of hell. <br /> <br /> Amazingly this nasty waste of time. <br /> <br /> I pray every day that this movie is just a fantasy of my imagination. I ask that I dreamed the movie and that I never have to watch it <br /> <br /> my local video store again. <br /> <br /> USING HELL
