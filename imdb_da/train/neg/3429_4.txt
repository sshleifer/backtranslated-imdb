I got a copy from the author of this movie on soulseek. I have to say that it is pathetic and simply painful to see the two cops' actions, but I saw the movie as a joke, and as it is a tribute to August's underground, which I happened to have seen, it is in my book as a fantastic movie . Its quality and everything about it is pretty bad, but it's entertaining and something to talk about among your friends. Reminds me of troma but good things. I recommend seeing this under two conditions if you are bored and need a good laugh or loud, otherwise just let it be. Recommended download certainly. o and the killings are pretty funny. as when the zombie rips, Satan runs worshipers and sticks someone in the head with it.
