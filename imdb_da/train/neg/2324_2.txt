I agree with other users' comments, as the two main roles were successful, that was the guy who played Gary Gillmore and Giovanni's role. Too bad the story was so boring. Don't hear about the story I didn't know anything about Gary Gillmore before the movie, so I didn't know what to expect. I thought it would be something like Dead Man Walking or The Chamber, but how wrong I was. The whole movie just spoke and spoke and talked about their mother and father. The only cool scenes were flashbacks where Dad would lose his mood. It was the only interest I got from this drill party.
