First of all, the reason why I give this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least Peter Falk gave his usual amazing performance as Lieutenant Columbo. He alone can get 10 stars to try to save this otherwise completely worthless attempt to make a movie. I was initially fired by reading a poster's comment that Andrew Stevens in this movie gave "performance of his career." To me, it was the sinister performance of Stevens who completely destroyed this movie, and then I was all ready to throw all sorts of insults on the person who made the above comment. Then I thought of myself, what has Stevens done more? So I checked and you know the person was right. In the 17 years since this Columbo movie was made, all 33 projects that Stevens has been on since then have been quite bad, so it is doubtful that anyone has seen the rest of their career. <br /> <br /> If you like Columbo, see all of the 69 titles before you see this. Do yourself a favor and save the worst in the end.
