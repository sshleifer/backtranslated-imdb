I understand that this film is made for children and as a parent, I have put in many films that do not really hold my interest, but I can appreciate constructive views on how it is received by my children. Parents should be encouraged to participate in their children's activities and monitor the quality of the entertainment they see, so there should be something that appeals to an adult audience at some level, even in the children's movie. Disney has always understood this, so it is so hard to understand how it could allow such a complete dragon to carry their name. Technically, sound editing is horrible, and all dialogues sound overblown and unnatural. Personally, I hate it, but it was twice as horrible considering that the dialogue itself seemed to be written by a 12-year-old for a school project. The "actress" reminded me of a school game, and none of the children's actors had any sense in their voices. Fortunately, it was a very short movie. <br /> <br /> Now, before I come out as a video geek that measures a children's movie with an adult yard stick, the only thing that can save even the worst child's movies can be a positive message. It is far from me to decide how a message should be delivered as long as the right one is. Let's take a walk through this movie to see which messages are being given: <br /> <br /> If you get lost, calm down, you'll inevitably find your way home. <br /> <br /> Approaching wild animals without fear. <br /> <br /> You can win any competition just because you "know" you can. <br /> <br /> And my favorite, the final message left in the movie: <br /> <br /> It is okay to obey authority figures and do what you think is right.
