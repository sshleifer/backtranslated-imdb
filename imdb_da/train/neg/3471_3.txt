This film had more holes than a piece of Swiss cheese. Ben Affleck did not try to act in any way, shape or form. He immediately sucked. Nothing about the movie was credible. The first problems were in the introduction, where the man gives everything of value to the Savior, Santa Claus, but it doesn't show why. And then the grandmother throws his head in the oven - really beautiful and has absolutely nothing to do with the movie - it's not even in the same tone as the movie. There was no explanation for the motivation for Ben Affleck to choose the house he chose; there were no credible reactions of the family he chose; and people are hovering here and there without any reason to be swayed (Example: Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck's characters slam down a steep slope - that's the incident that makes her fall in love with him. Riiiight ...) Anyway, there was a fun moment or two - but they were a rarity in the movie. It seriously needed another rewrite (or 4). Hope you enjoy it!
