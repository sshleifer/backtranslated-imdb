This would be a clear Hollywood mediocre if it had a good edit. It is dependent on the typical American thriller plot - "who should throw everyone together". Action is below average but with the shining appearance of the detective, the best actor in the movie, and he is most responsible if the excitement of the movie increases. Films were completely suffocated by shiny video and audio images, and mostly resembling raw film material. All in all, if you don't mind watching a movie that looks like a student movie project, it's a movie to watch. I think it would be enough to say on this movie, everything else could really spoil the excitement that is probably low enough.
