The plot is rocky. The action is somewhere south of a Jr. High School game. The cinematography is not bad, but it looks like it was cut with a machete. I couldn't decide that this was an intentional hokey-flick or if the people behind it actually thought they were making a good movie. Think Death Valley Days meets Mayberry RFD. People running around in a "lawless" modern city carrying fast-paced 6 gun rigs. It has more than its fair share of 'cutsey' stuff. Picture the good boys pulling up to an old farmhouse and park the Ford Mustang right in front of a hitching rail. The image consultant at a hotel sees a naturally western (hemisphere) film that has a Japanese soundtrack, but with English subtitles. It is all very strange, but can be improved if you see it while participating in a small peyote. It's a real curiosity with modern parallels to all Western movie clich√©s you can think of. There is even a modern version of the good-hearted dance hall girl, and a twanging Jews harp in the soundtrack. Really! If someone brings this to your home for a Saturday night movie session, tell them your DVD player died.
