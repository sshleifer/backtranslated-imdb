he was my hero until he went along with {if you can call it a movie} i went to the show to watch it and came out and not just ask for money back but asked for twice as much money hero play and hole stuff was ............. I can't believe Steven Segal's career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th-rate movie with 5th grade secondary actors. I saw this movement expecting to see him, asking the scream out of some people as he usually does. When he is reduced to using a single judo notch between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of brick, there is something wrong. The plot is incredible as a movie and even if you apologize for the visuals and read this story as a novel, you would wonder why you had downloaded the book yourself. <br /> <br /> Steven Segal goes through the moves and seems like he's doing this only because he's committed. He shows no effort and no enthusiasm, and in some scenes he is not seen at all. <br /> <br /> I hate repeating other people's comments, but the use of storage shots for images and visual images of the airplane in the flight is pathetic. The state of the scenes that have been carved is shaken and the scenes appear to have deteriorated over time. The zappruder film showing that President John F Kennedy is being murdered is dustier and cleaner. My honest opinion is to tell you that you are not wasting your time watching this movie, it is not up to the standards of his work in the mica man or exit wound. I read a review that said the film had a budget of $ 12 million (Segal was paid 5 out of it) and that the film still came under budget. I have to agree. <br /> <br /> It is no wonder this is a direct DVD movie, as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie.
