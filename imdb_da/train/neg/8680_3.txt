I just finished watching this movie and WOW was so bad. In fact, the only thing that kept me from seeing was that it was so MONUMENTALLY bad it was sweet entertaining. The action of the characters is fun, from the hyper-dramatic way they fall into war fire, to their incredibly bad plays (were the bad ones just pulled out of the street or were they actually actors?) To the incredibly poor delivery of lines, for their inexplicable actions (if you want to try to shoot someone through a doorway when they enter, it is, of course, the thing to do, shoot directly on the door handle !!). This movie will destroy the worst written and delivered lines. <br /> <br /> Camera work was also very poor - you can hardly see what's happening in the battle scenes due to changing camera angles and shakiness. <Br /> <br /> I would have voted "1" except I like Chiba and sidekick Sue Shihomi, and I was entertained by a couple of scenes: 1) breaking a crook's arm so the bone pops out of the skin (It must be hurt) 2) A medical kingpin eating a brown furred animal (a monkey?) by hacking off the carcass with a meat split 3) Sonny Chiba performs an impromptu eye operation on a guy with his fingers. <br /> <br /> I'm actually a big fan of Sonny Chiba, but this one really isn't worth it for some time. I've seen about 7 or 8 of his films and have come to the conclusion that the only ones worth seeing (and they're good!) Are the Street Fighter series and The Kill Machine. I have also heard Executioner and Golgo 13 are good. I recommend sticking to them.
