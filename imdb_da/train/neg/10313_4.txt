This movie was hard to grasp, and as I finally saw it was the disappointment overwhelming. I think this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century: An unknown man exploits the unsuspecting airline industry and GETS AWAY with millions in ransom without harming anyone or bungling the experiment. With all these built-in interests, how could anyone make such a noisy, talkative lunatic of this true life's event. While Williams is always interesting, the authors assumed that D.B. Cooper persona was stereotypically heroic as a movie star. What we get is a type without any inviting details or insight into a person's skillful skill and clever enough to have pulled it off. Harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and sheer beauty, but the real letdown was in handling the plot and lame direction. Shame on this movie for even existing ones.
