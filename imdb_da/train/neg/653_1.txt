If I could give this movie a real rating, it would probably be in minus numbers. Although I respect the fact that someone must continue to make these horrible "horror" movies, it seems serious that people who buy a ticket for this movie are a waste of money you can spend on something much more Worth your time. <br /> <br /> Despite being a scary movie, there is nothing scary about it unless the idea of ​​seeing how many horror cliches you can fit in a movie scares you. If the score was higher, it would probably have made for a better movie in the long run. <br /> <br /> Who made this version of "Prom Night" you turned up. The actors might have done a decent job if it wasn't for the dubious scripting. This was a terrible waste of a movie tour. I will soon go see "One Missed Call" again, at least it had some plot.
