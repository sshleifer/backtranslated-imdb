The man's end of this movie is so terribly unmatched and dated that my whole movie aesthetically grinned as crazy. Now most of the rest of the movie was okay. It had a couple of unintentional fun scenes, but had a couple of really good camera shots and editing. Yes Alderich is a fantastic instructor who made FLIGHT OF THE PHONE and whatever might happen to Baby Jane among others. The problem is not with direction, action or anything technical. The movie is just destroyed in the third act. Why? The murders, twists, turns and figures have all been revolving around NUCLEAR MATERIAL? What was the author smoking when he came up with it? The way it just comes out is perhaps the greatest Deus Ex Machina in history. For everyone complaining about Burton's Apes Planet, David Gale's life or Notorious, I think this is the worst end ever. What a disappointment.
