This movie was probably the biggest waste of my life ever. The action was pathetic. Jordan Hinson couldn't show any disturbed emotions. At the start of the film, she had to be discouraged. Instead she bubbled her head out with the bottom. She slipped miserably without tears for the crying scene. I was almost angry that out of every girl who would be actresses, they had to pick her out. All others also suffer overactive. It was flat out annoying. It was also an insult to art skaters. Jordan took a month to train, and they threw her as a person doing the Olympic team. It practically jumps on the exertion of real artisans put into their work. A pitiful excuse for a movie and a miserable attempt to link hockey and skating. Don't waste your life. It doesn't even deserve a star.
