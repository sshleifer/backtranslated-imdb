Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes hold up as hustlers on the basketball court. Okay, that sounds okay there. It gives plenty of room for good comedy and a good story. But no such event took place in the many subsequent boring minutes of this pathetic attempt at a movie. This movie was redundant, retarded and ridiculous after the first 20 seconds had passed. Woody Harrelson played one of my favorites t.v. characters, Woody from Cheers, and I was looking forward to seeing him in this movie. But after seeing his "acting performance", I have come to the conclusion that he should continue to play stupid country hicks as bartending. His performance was as boring and poor as the film. Another actor in this unreal movie was Rosie Perez. I've seen movies with Perez before, but I decided that the reason I had other works in her career was that she wasn't the protagonist and didn't have so many talking lines (doing the right thing). But now in white men can not skip she was made a central character with many lines, which means that the audience has to put up with her incredibly annoying and mocking voice. So after watching this movie (the term used loosely) and hearing Rosie Perez much more than appreciated, I can now say that I am a white man and I am getting ready to jump. . . out of a twenty-story apartment complex.
