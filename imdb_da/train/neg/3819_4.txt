T.Z. Post, college professor, receives a false letter stating that he inherited $ 750,000. Now financially, he deducts his $ 4,000 life savings and finally decides to go out and live. After getting his luggage sent on a train to Chicago, he meets a travel vaudeville troupe and decides well enough for him to put a show on Broadway. Night on the show, poor Prof. Post must hide from its creditors, settle the relationship dishonesty between girlfriend Pansy and & floozy diva Eleanor, and still make sure the show continues. Having seen many of Keaton's silent pearls, this is a pain to sit through, but I felt it could have been much worse. Supportive cast Durante, Todd, & Selwyn come from very annoying at times, but still sympathetic. A pre-Charlie Chan Toler is good as the frustrated show director. 90% of the script is poorly written, as MGM tries to transfer it as a poor man's Marx Bros. movie, where many of the sight gags fall flat from the beginning. Summarized with Keaton's drinking at that time, this movie is just a sad moment in Buster's life. Rating-third
