A mistake. The movie was just not good. It has humor like 5-year-olds who don't even giggle on. I think some parts were fun, but most of it is not. Lindsey Lohan is a great actress (and a bad singer) and she has to work on better movies. The movie should have been sent as a Disney Channel original movie, it's free. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this movie was the music. Nothing like a remade rock soundtrack to light up your day. These songs are so good. Especially Alyson and Amanda's Walking On Sunshine and Caleigh Peter's, Beach Boy's song, Fun Fun Fun. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10. If I gave it a ten, 9 of it would be the music and 1 would be the movie. Not worth your money, but the soundtrack is.
