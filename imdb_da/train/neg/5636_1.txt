This movie was the worst I have ever seen. It doesn't seem to have a plot, but the time you realize this is far beyond the beginning of the movie, so watch it shut for too long to recognize the director's total incompetence, including the sloth playing the tampon ticket in the movie, and we do not believe in Willem Dafoe in this movie, he is a clone, because the real Dafoe we know from "apocalypse now" and "boon dock saints" would never agree on such a script. Duh, (Da) enemy wrote this bill closed with his twenty years minus baby. This movie starts with the credit of the two main characters, Dafoe and Colagrande, and then the two screenwriters, Dafoe and Colagrande, and then the director, Colagrande. <br /> <br /> Bottomline (story); Widow meets guy, man smiles widow, widow smashes windshield with guy who smashed her. <br /> <br /> Title in Holland; The black widow (different title, same villain). <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE !!! It's a total waist of time !!!
