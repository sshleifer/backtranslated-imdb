You get 5 authors together, each writing a different story with another genre, and then trying to make a movie out of it. It's action, it's adventure, it's sci-fi, it's western, it's a mess. Sorry, but this movie stinks completely. 4.5 gives it a high degree of assessment. That said, it is film like this that makes me believe I could write movies and I can hardly write.
