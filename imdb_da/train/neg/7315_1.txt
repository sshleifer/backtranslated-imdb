Okay, let's get right to that point. We have five recent college degrees (must have majored in F words) going on a weekend camping trip. They run into someone who needs help, but instead of trying to help him, they decide to set him on fire instead. Beautiful bunch of people. Then some of them start to get sick - have something in the water at the cabin they live on. But the neighbors seem to be OK. Oh yes, when things start to get really bad, they unlock their companions instead of getting help (try the neighbor by the way). Some locals do not like them. They chase one on high-speed trains through the forest for many miles until the truck goes down. Somehow ten minutes later he shows up in the cabin (how he could find it and how he could travel at the speed of light to get there is a mystery). Another of the brain surgeon type at the cabin realizes that something is wrong so he hides in a hole to let this blow over. He then decides the next day to return to the cabin because it must be a kind of sanctuary. He is relieved with relief that he survived (he must have thought it was a 24 hour mistake). Unfortuneatley he is greeted by some not so friendly police officers. Another couple decides to have sex while the meat eater's insect acts on magic, and then the women realize that she needs to shave her legs (takes a lot of the sick skin with shaving cream). Anyway you get the idea. Nothing makes sense here. It's five people I don't want to be friends with. I messed with the carnivorous bacteria. Other characters were introduced, which were also entertaining, but totally unacceptable. Ninety minutes of good life wasted here.
