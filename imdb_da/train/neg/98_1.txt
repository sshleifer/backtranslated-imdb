I received this movie as a gift I knew from the DVD cover, this movie is going to be bad. After not seeing it for more than a year, I finally saw it. what a pathetic movie ??. <br /> <br /> I almost didn't finish seeing this bad movie, but it would be unfair for me to write a review without seeing the full movie. <br /> <br /> Trust me when I say "this movie stinks" I'm really shocked that some bad filmmaker wane bee was just funded to make this pathetic movie, but it couldn't have cost more than $ 20,000 to produce this movie. All you need is a cheap camcorder or cell phone camera. About 15 people without action skills, a scrip written by a couple of drunk people. <br /> <br /> In the fist part of this ultra bad move a reporter (Tara Woodley) has a presumption of being full of man on his way to reporting a hunting city. He is completely unlucky. They went to one presumably to leave the house, but fortunately for it almost completely furnished and a bottle of drinks on the door step happens to be there. just for the supposed to be full man, but everything is not what it looks like. <br /> <br /> Then the supposed, stupid man begins to tell Tara Ghost / Zombies stories. <br /> <br /> The stump of his stupid Lame stories must be the worst in history. <br /> <br /> his story <br /> <br /> Sgt. Ben Draper lets one of his soldiers die from complete exhaustion (after getting the poor soldier privately Wilson to sit up), he let him dig a grave, and saw the soldier collapse, Ben Draper <br /> <br /> bury him in a low tomb. <br /> <br /> But Sgt. Ben Draper is in for a great surprise. his wife / girl fiend knows about this and she and her lover kill sgt. Ben Draper takes revenge on private Wilson. (Next to the soldier's grave he sorts himself). The soldier wakes up from his grave in the form of zombie and kills them to avenge on his behalf. <br /> <br /> The twist ending was so boring. <br /> <br /> Although you like B HORROR movies, don't watch this movie
