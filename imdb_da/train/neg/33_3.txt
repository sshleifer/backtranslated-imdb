This is the worst ever the TMNT franchise has ever created. I was a kid when this came out, and I still thought it was deuce even though I liked the original cartoon. There is this scene I remember when the Mafia guy explains his minions' rhetorical questions. It's terrible. Many fans hate the series to include a woman turtle, but it didn't bother me. So much so that I didn't even remember her before I read about the show recently. All in all, it is miserably forgettable. <br /> <br /> The only okay thing was the theme song. Guilty pleasure they call it ... Nananana ninja ...
