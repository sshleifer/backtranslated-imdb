This was terrible. Andie Macdowell is a horrible actress. So wood, she makes a rocking horse, looks like it could do a better job. But remember to turn into four weddings, just as rude. Another film depicting England filled with chocolate box houses and village green. I mean the school, how many schools besides maybe Hogwarts look like this? Two police stations looked like the set from Heartbeat (a nauseating British series in the 60s). This movie just couldn't think of what it would be like a comedy or a serious study of the undercurrents of women's friendships. If it had attached to the former, then the cemetery's sex scenes and the very stupid storm of the wedding could just have worked (I'm just saying). But these scenes just didn't work with the tragedy in the other half. I also find it incredible that Kate would ever talk to Molly again for her terrible behavior. A final note - what is a decent actress like Staunton doing in this pile of poo? Not to mention Anna Chancellor. Macdowell should adhere to advertising wrinkle cream.
