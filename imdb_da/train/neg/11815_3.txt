This scary mini-operetta with an Eddy-McDonald prototype in a Valentino scenario is so bad that it becomes an endurance training after five minutes. It is foolish when you get started, as this letterhead opens two military men who discuss the lack of masculinity in an officer's son. In a moment he will be packed to Morrocco, where he lives a double life as the red shadow; the leader of an Arab tribe who would rather sing than battle. <br /> <br /> Alexander Gray and Bernice Clare possess fine light opera voices (with small-acting ability) and there is also a decent base in there, but the play is so random scenes so poorly prepared that you get the feeling that they Do things up while walking together. <br /> <br /> This two grooves was part of a major stage production listing six authors. With more space for spoof and warble, the show may have had some entertainment value, but this hasty quickie is a bit more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature to appear.
