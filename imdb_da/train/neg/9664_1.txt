This book based movie is really awful and a big disappointment. We've been waiting for this step for a month. Many movie reviews were hoping for it. Also in newspapers and television, it made great sense. When April 29, many people honestly noticed that the movie is really awful. Why? First of all, the story was so monotonous. There have been many indefinite scenes, sometimes it is difficult to realize what is going on. The actors, out of Hulya Avsar, were not harmonized with their roles, especially Vildan Atasever. She works better in comedy movies. In this movie, a kind of drama, she could not dispose of her former role. And finally Film is too short, only 66 minutes.
