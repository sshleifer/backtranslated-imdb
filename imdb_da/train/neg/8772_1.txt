There is nothing new to me to say: 4 hours of people die again and again on the same hill. The cast was a star, but unfortunately the producer / director / editor / god produced. He should have eaten humble pie (if not for his own sake then for the men who died in Kargil), hired one of these brilliant Bollywood directors, hired a real scriptwriter, hired a real editor, hired a musical, was not related to him in any way (and who seemed to have listened to a bad version of "Apocalypse Now" on some cheap Indian fabrics), hired a real professional crew, threw all the fireworks and told a real story. Unfortunately, like the Indian Army's bigwigs, he made decisions that were horrible to his actors and horrible to his audience. We all died again and again. <br /> <br /> Don't let it be done again, Mr Sushma Kathmandu, Nepal <br /> <br /> ps: Next time an Indian director decides to glorify the Gurkha regiment, I suggest he hires more than a Nepalese to represent the team. There are probably plenty of Nepalese men working in Bombay - the last count was 40,000 to half a million.
