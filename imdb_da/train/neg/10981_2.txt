Or listen to it for that matter. Even the soundtrack is a bore. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this is not the worst gay movie I've seen (it would be Billy), but it's down there very close to the bottom of the barrel. <br /> <br /> This stuff pulls and pulls and pulls. It's not that the plot is inan - in the hands of a good writer it could have worked. . . It could certainly have been much more entertaining. There is not a plot point you cannot see coming in ten kilometers down the road. The dialogue is flat. The wit is old. To add insult to injury, it is full of one-dimensional stereotype homosexuals. <br /> <br /> Nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or relationship between the two drivers was possible, much less real. There was no chemistry, no dynamic, in fact no sign of why the leaders love each other. . . we just said they are in love. Hard to figure out when they have nothing in common and are not compatible sexually. They like the same book? Huh? The action is not quite bad, but the pacing is terribly slow. I mean almost Jarmusch slow but without Jarmusch quality. In fact, it would be a good barometer for you. If you like Jarmusch film, avoid this.
