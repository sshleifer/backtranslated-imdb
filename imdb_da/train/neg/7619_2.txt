As a Mystery Science Theater 3000 fan, I can resist any movie that can be foisted on me, but there is absolutely no reason for it. <br /> <br /> Rating "Super Action" in the Blockbuster Video section and given the dreaded "Limited Viewing Declaration" I assume these are the only methods that filmmaker (HA!) Robert Napton could use to get at least 4 , 50 from an unsuspecting person. Shame on you Robert Napton! Shame on taking advantage of these poor Mexican actors as you probably promised hope to make it big in American cinema. You're a disgrace! <br /> <br /> There is no moment in this movie that has the slightest action. Did you use snot on these people? Oh, see, they have a rave in a field! Like all 6 of them. And isn't it an Asian guy in the background? Why is it always daytime? Why did it take 1/2 of the film to show something .. and more importantly why did we look at the other 1/2? PS: You owe me 4.50.
