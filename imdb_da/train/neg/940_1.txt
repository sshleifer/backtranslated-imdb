Okay the guys, we know why we see movies like "The Invisible Maniac" (just look at the cover, man!). T and A everywhere (with much more T than A). But ... shouldn't there be a story to go with it? <br /> "C'mon," I can hear you say "" It's just girls who are naked! Who needs a story? ?! "<br /> <br /> Well, if this was called" The NAKED Maniacs ", I wouldn't have a problem. But since these guys cheat from" The Invisible Man ", they must have a little bit of history about this. , to keep an eye on you. <br /> <br /> But all they can do is how this crazy doctor creates an invisible serum, and when he cracks, he uses it to spy on naked women and ends up Kill Many Teenagers And And When You See The Smiling Teenagers He Is Going For You'll Be Grateful. <br /> <br /> A star for T and A, but there is a little too much to do for your skin lovers, so keep going caution. <br /> <br /> TIME - yes, that's Savannah.
