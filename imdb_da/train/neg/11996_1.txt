I've been waiting for this movie a long time. Especially because Juhi Chawla is in this, she is a great actress. <br /> <br /> This movie features six stories. It's a new concept that flew from Hollywood. So it's not new. <br /> <br /> 1. Khamini (priyanka chopra) is a dancer. She wants to become famous and make a boyfriend to let the news reps be interested in her. But then Rahul (Salman Khan) appears and he claims to be his girlfriend. Priyanka Chopra is still not a good actress. When she shouts, I get annoyed. Salman Khan can't play cartoons. But in his serious parts he is fantastic. <br /> <br /> 2. Vinay (Anil Kapoor) is married to Seema (Juhi Chawla). He comes in a midlife crisis and is attracted to a much younger woman forgetting what he really has in life; his wife and children. <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor and Juhi are natural-born actors / actresses. They are good. But this story is thin for them. <br /> <br /> 3. The Shiven (Akshaye Khanna) is getting married to Gia (Ayesha Takia), but he gets cold feet and turns off the wedding. <br /> <br /> 4. Ashutosh (Joh Abraham) is married to Tehzeeb (Vidya Balan). She gets an accident and suffers a memory loss. Now she doesn't know she loves her husband anymore. <br /> <br /> 5. Raju (Govinda) is a taxi driver. He meets Stephani (Shannon Esrechowitz), a white woman who is in love with an Indian man, but he is getting married to an Indian woman. Raju must bring Staphani to that man, but fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> I've never seen Govinda's movie. He is very annoying, not funny. But in this movie I liked him a lot, just as he has grown up in recent years. <br /> <br /> 6. Oh yes! There is Sohail Khan! He plays Ram Dayal, who is just married to Phoolwati (Isha Koppikar). He wants to get something serious with her, but every time his family comes in between. <br /> <br /> Sohail Khan is not a beautiful actor, but he is fun! I like his movie. <br /> <br /> Now the problem is here. All these stories are not interesting. Making a story from six non-interesting stories does not make the whole movie interesting! Here and there the stories touch each other, but are not significant to the characters. My conclusion; Priyanka cannot act! Solve the woman in the Bollywood industry. Sohail Khan had to make more films, this role for him was too small. Salman Khan can't do cartoons, but real serious movies. It is written on his life as an actor. This movie sucks and is a waste of a play by good actors and actresses such as Anil Kapoor, Juhi Chawla, Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> It's like you have the ability to make a movie with Amitabh Bachchan, and you only let him sing a cradle.
