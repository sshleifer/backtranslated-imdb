A badly written script without similar characters. Because it was a comedy, I forgot to laugh. It is about two astonished friends who fuple to get women in bed with them (no sex scenes) and another friend (who is semi-discustingly weird) who sometimes also fades, but is mostly considered the guy who master bathes. The 3 friends meet separately and fall for the same woman (Amanda Peet). Somehow this is done without really any romance. The 3 guys stop being friends as they date separately. She scammed them out of their friendship because they scammed women. - A bad movie
