This movie is really silly! I saw it as an 11 year old, and even then I thought it was pretty ridiculous! I would only recommend this movie to children under 12. I really didn't care about that, but I think it corresponds to some very good questions that children should be aware of, such as: 1) Buying money happiness? 2) Should I lie (to my parents) about things that I think they would not approve? 3) Buy Money Friendships? 4) Is Money Everything? 5) Shouldn't I tell my parents when someone tries to hurt me? Granted, it's very unrealistic situations, but I think if parents discussed these issues with their children, they might also have to watch this video to show / scare their children, as lies have the potential to hurt you.
