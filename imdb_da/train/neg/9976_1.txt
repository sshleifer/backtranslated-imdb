The first scene in 'Problem Child' has a baby look into a nun's face. For this movie it is witty. An eerie, medieval "comedy", it is inept at so many levels, it begs faith. John Ritter is the kind father who adopts the child from hell and kudos to him to maintain his dignity in the surrounding attack of one-note, annoying notions and puerile humor. And what the hell is Jack Warden doing in this mess? Very directed by Dennis Dugan and unpleasant in his attempts to think of sentimentality when done with injustice, the film is made so bad, it is quite a bizarre experience. But don't remember all that. Low light of it all is Michael Oliver, the most repulsive and unlikeable kid actor ever to hit the screen ?? believe me, you want to beat him right in the mouth.
