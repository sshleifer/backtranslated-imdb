I was always curious about this movie because it's so hard to find, so when I stumbled across it on Ebay, I forked out over $ 10 and bought it, now I understand why it's so rare! This movie is so bad, so terribly written and hopelessly low budget, that the final credits showing all the cut scenes where they fumbled their lines are literally the highlight of the movie. The film is about a psychic (Pettyjohn, thrown by an obvious reason, his topless scene), who uses his forces with an experimental machine to draw objects from another dimension into this reality. When she pulls in a box like an object, the military unlucky it in a truck's open back with a soldier to protect it and give what do you know? SURPRISE! A child in a foam rubber monster costume jumps out, immediately kills the soldier with a scratch over his face and then escapes to a nearby town. But rather than deploying half of the county armed forces to find it and protect the public those responsible, just be Pettyjohn and Ray to find it alone, but regardless, this movie blows all its credibility long before then. This escapes being voted 1 for me only because of unintentional grin, someone must warn the producers of the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" if they don't already know it! 2 out of 10, really, really bad!
