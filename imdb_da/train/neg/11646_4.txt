Kojak meets the mafia. Telly Savales is one of the guys of the past who seems pretty forgettable. I never thought his show was so big. This is his one-dimensional characterization of a crime commander, with very predictable results. If you take the car chases and the general rambling out, there is not much plot development or action. I find mafia movies to be boring because I have no respect or interest in common criminals and their actions. Hollywood, and in this case the Italian cinema, treat these guys as heroes. I saw the movie, and in a few days I don't remember much about it. Lots of shooting, innocent spectators who die, treason and the sick loyalty. The film is photographed quite well and the play is decent. But the duplication is so bad (because of voices that just couldn't get out of these bodies) that I almost started looking for Godzilla approaching the bay.
