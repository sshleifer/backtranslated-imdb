Going into this, I expected something really good, but after the injury that was inflexed on me, I am just happy to think of the strait. It's hard to think about what the filmmakers (HA!) This was a good movie. The stories, and I use the world loosely, are incoherent and make no sense at all. There are just stupid things that happen randomly. the actor, if you can call acting, is horrible, i have seen blacksmiths working in toy ads! I know it's a low-budget video bin waste, but still it's not as they tried. Will after stetting thought it, I feel very sleepy and still do # yawws #, I'm going to lie down. <br /> <br /> WARNING: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO RUN, BE, READ OR MAKE WHEN AFTER LOOKING COOLING SYSTEMS.
