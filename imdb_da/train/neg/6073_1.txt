* VERY MANY SPOILERS IN THIS AUDIT * This movie was horrible. I'm a big baseball fan, so I thought I'd see it and I was very disappointed. It started okay. When I saw the bad influence DeNiro had on his young son, I hoped he would be a better father in the whole movie or something. Anyways, at first it seemed like DeNiro was the main character. He was the only one who believed in Bobby, and he had his sweet son that he lost custody, giving me a reason to feel bad for him. He wanted to help Bobby by talking to Primo when he didn't break at first to death ... not to mention the outlined song "I want to **** you !!!!" randomly inappropriate moments. <br /> <br /> Later, when DeNiro rescues Bobby's son from drowning, I hoped that the movie could solve itself. He could forgive himself for killing Primo if he saved Bobby's son. But of course, this is far beyond the depth of the film, because all he cares about is getting CREDIT into the murder and doing it by stealing Bobby's son, car and dog and holding them hostage. Bobby just has to go home and announce that DeNiro is a "true fan" while showing a picture of him attaching a knife. <br /> <br /> Now we come to the completely unrealistic scene at the end ... It is pouring like hell and we are expected to believe the game has not been called. Then DeNiro somehow comes magically on the field in a jersey suit and calls Bobby at home, continues to pull his knife and starts stabbing everyone running on the court. There are apparently no officers on the pitch (but the police are on their way), so DeNiro is stepping up and preparing to pitch a knife to Bobby when he is shot to death. But quiet, this cheerful and comfortable movie has a good ending because Bobby finds his son. <br /> <br /> This is NOT a sports movie. It's not about a fan. As far as I know, fans are not healthy psychopaths who threaten, rob and throw knives on their admirers. This is probably the worst movie I will ever see in my life. The reason was low, the soundtrack sucked, the film had no purpose at all. I warn you not to waste your time on this vile excuse for a movie.
