I just haven't got this movie ... Was it a musical? no .. but there were choreographed songs and danced in it ... <br /> Was it a serious drama .... no the play wasn't good enough for it. <br /> <br /> Is Whoopi Goldberg a quality serious actor .. Definitely not. <br /> <br /> I had a hard time keeping awake through this incoherent movie. The announcement of apartheid and "tribute" to students who died during an elevation process is noted. But as entertainment it was very poor and as a documentary film it was worse. See for yourself, but in righteousness I hated it
