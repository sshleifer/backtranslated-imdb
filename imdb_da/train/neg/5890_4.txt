This romantic comedy is not that bad. There are some fun things happening here and there and there are some pretty memorable characters in it. <br /> <br /> However, the action is amateurish (with the exception of the banker). While some scenes are fun, others are simply embarrassing. In particular, I found the "romantic" part of the story poor. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think it's worth seeing if you like football and romantic comedies. It's not really a bad movie, and the end felt quite good. Don't expect anything out of the ordinary. Fair enough if you have an hour and a quarter to kill.
