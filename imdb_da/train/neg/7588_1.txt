A warning to potential viewers: If you are looking for an adaptation of the classic story "The most dangerous game", look elsewhere. "Seven Women for Satan" only superficially addresses the original work by using the name Zaroff and having said character killers. <br /> <br /> Some of the following may be considered by some to be spoilers. Or not. <br /> <br /> Boris Zaroff is played by author / director Michel Lemoine. While his ancestor chased men because they were the only prey that was really challenging, Boris's victims are usually in a position where they cannot defend themselves. The movie falls from stage to stage with an almost total lack of clarity. The director seems to have completely ignored the pacing and left the viewer with an exhausting boring movie. A few individual scenes are mildly interesting (such as a torture series) but as a unit fails to entertain the movie. Viewers who are more <br /> <br /> interested in a selection of attractive and semi-attractive actresses at various stages of clothing may see the movie. Most people will probably find that their time is better spent watching Mento's ads. <br /> <br /> In a page message, the DVD's extra information included the story of the movie. Apparently, it was banned for several years in its original France, which virtually destroyed any chance of widespread distribution.
