Just another movie that utilizes gratuitous frontal male nudity; horrible plays, plus, the beloved scenes are the most sexy I've ever seen (and it's not about me that I don't associate the idea of ​​two young men who love because I'm gay). <br /> <br /> As in Mil nubes de paz, Julian Hernandez directed an incredibly pretentious movie with a story that gives enough argument for a short movie in about five minutes, but manages to make a 2 hour movie with it. And this time, there's not even the issue of racism and commodification in the Mexican gay community talking about! God gracious to us!
