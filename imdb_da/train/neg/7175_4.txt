This may have been based on historical events, and we know that the decision makers in this television documentary took liberties to make it more dramatic - I can live with it - but it was just so badly done! I was amazed in the case of a developed mid-air crisis, how calm everyone seemed, probably someone would have panicked and what a smooth flight, no passenger discomfort apparently - come again! Not sure about the rules, today some of the aviation security products seem to be unclear, but why take your shoes off before the emergency landing, common sense tells me, it's not a good idea! The shots on this massive plane line coming down on this remote were convincing and false. In fact, it would have been a fantastic sight from the ground nearby, in this movie it was disproportionate and looked like the model it probably was. Floating glides appeared in front and in the middle of the emergency doors, but no one seemed to leave the front, even though the drop was much smaller. The captain returned to the plane after the landing - why? this was never explained. We know that the emergency landing was due to being out of fuel, but even then there must have been some fuel that winds around the bottom of the tanks, and the risk of explosion must have been a very real danger, but the evacuation seemed almost leisurely, and everyone is standing at the foot of the flight picture instead of getting as far away as possible, as I am sure I would have done. There were too many inconsistencies, errors and false actions in this. I would have preferred to have seen the play of the drama in real time and with realistic movement of the plane portrayed. It had the potential to be quite exciting, but it was undoubtedly unsuccessful due to budget constraints, and it made one feel that a plane that lost all engines was nothing big and you would probably slip down to a a bit uneven landing, but no real danger! - The reality is of course something different!
