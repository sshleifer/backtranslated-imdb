Suffice it to say - in spite of the odd ridiculous panegyric to his soy "abilities" sent here - the director of this inappropriate, evil tosh has not made a movie since. Well, it's good news as far as I'm concerned. Dead Babies have the whole of their creator's bile, but lack the knowledge and technical skill that makes Martin Amis readable to the Romanist. <Br /> <br /> When will the UK film industry wake up and realize that if it wants to regain the status it once had, it should stop producing waste like this and do something real people actually want to see? <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague.
