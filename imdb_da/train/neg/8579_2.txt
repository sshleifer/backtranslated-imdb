I'm afraid this is pretty awful, despite several good ideas and generally competent action for the camera. It is a first and last attempt by author director Soo Lyu. "Rub and Tug" (2002) is one of the unfortunate by-products of Canada's home-grown film production program. While the program encourages valuable efforts such as "New Waterford Girl" opens the door to untalented novices such as Lyu, who did not have to aggressively pitch this project, but were green-lit without a sufficient study of her script or her credentials. <br /> <br /> You don't mind the low budget because it shabby production design, poor lighting, poor sound and boring docu-style shot choices are in line with the subject; workers in Canadian massage parlors. But the dialogue and plot do not give the actors anything to work with, the editor much to collect, or a viewer any other mental challenge than the suspension of disbelief. When your story is this simplistic, the last thing you need is a confused storytelling technique; Although nothing happens, the movie is difficult to follow and the point of view is impossible to do. <br /> <br /> Don McKellar's achievements as Conrad are several notches under his similar characterization in "Exotica". Lindy Booth's Lea is her standard quirky airhead; as always she is sympathetic, but here she is a little different. Kira Clavell's Cindy is a pleasant surprise, a kind of Asian Shelley Duval. The only other role, as any consequence, Tara Spencer-Nairn's street-wise Betty, more than cancels her outstanding performance in "New Waterford Girl". Her superficial notion in "Rub and Tug" should limit any tendency to seek other movies where she has appeared; unless you need further confirmation of "Waterford" director Alan Moyle's skill in working with young actors. <br /> <br /> You quickly conclude that Lyus reptile brain cannot understand concepts such as plot complexity, so the need to insert a lazy and paralyzed "deus ex machina" unit toward the end is hardly a surprise. Nevertheless, it may be worse, the listless story has so little internal logic anyway, that the unlikely end is not as painful as would normally be the case. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
