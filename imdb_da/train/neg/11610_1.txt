Frank Sinatra was undoubtedly a talented actor as well as a talented singer. After all, very few players today can get a scene just in one roof, and it was pretty much Sinatra's modus operandi on the set. I feel that as the 1960s wore on, the quality of the man's films really started to ponder. The Tony Rome detective series was nothing short of trying to compete with Dean Martin's Matt Helm series that came out at the same time. Maybe even a James Bond competition, but nothing really worked for Frank these years. His personal life in shambles, his music fades out ... Sinatra appeared more like a setback to the 1950s. The last big Sinatra movie during this period was probably Von Ryan's Express in 1965.
