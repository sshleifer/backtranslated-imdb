The comic power of Pryor and Gleason could not save this dog from the tissue-thin plot, weak scripts, gloomy plays and ridiculous continuity in editing this mess together. It has very few memorable moments, but the well dries up quickly. As a child, I remember it as a Luke-hot vehicle for the two actors, but there was always something strange about the flow and the feeling of what was conveyed in each scene and how this ties to the plot in general. When you see it again after many years, it screams the watch-a-mania. I'm not so concerned about the racist controversy as I wouldn't mind watching a movie take that issue up with a little levity. The most obvious mistake for me is that the scenes are laid out as a shaky, unrelated series of 2 minute situation comedy bits (some not very good ones) that were joined by the editor after an all-nighter at the local watering hole. Characters change emotions and motivations on a crown, without rhyme or reason, between scenes and scenes, making this sensation as if no one had any idea what to get out of the manuscript. Not that it was any gem to start with. I feel bad for the two actors whose legacy is horrified by this disaster that should never have been done. Maybe my sense of humor has been refined ...
