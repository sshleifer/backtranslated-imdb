This is Peter Falks movie. Period. <br /> <br /> I was 10 years old when this movie came out; I was already a filmmaker at that time. Of course, my parents or I didn't even watch this movie when it came out, but I was in love with the typeface of its ads and the aura that this was an important movie. Okay, 34 years later, I've finally seen the movie - never seen any Cassavete-directed film before. He is a hack as a whole. Zero sense of timing, editing. Genes performance reminds me too much of Dustin Hoffman's stint in "Rain Man": Technically on equal footing, but completely one-note. When Tom Cruise stole "Rain Man", Falk takes the cake for this movie. I was annoyed by Gena's performance, really throughout - it seemed better suited to "Awakenings" (blecch!). It's not all her fault: she is a basket box from the first scene to the last. We never find out why ?? But Falk's character seems real and executed FANTASTIC by Falk as a seriously flawless man. Shaves for at least an hour (an editor needed!), And it would have been an arrest portrait, not of a woman under influence, but a simple, Cro-Magnon, the man will grab with a wife who does not work and yet can handle her three children and her husband's long working hours. <br /> <br /> Remember more Cassavetes for "The Dirty Dozen" or "Rosemary's Baby." He would have been a better director if he had exceeded his own tendency to excess - which he basically demonstrates with this movie. <br /> <br /> Bob
