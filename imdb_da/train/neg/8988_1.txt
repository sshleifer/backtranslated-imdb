So far, the worst movie I ever saw was Ben & Arthur. You really should check the reviews for that movie instead of this one. The review statistics for this movie have been skewed positively by a relentless and unscrupulous push from some of the people involved in doing so. Evidence that it is quite easy to uncover online. At least, the people who did Ben & Arthur were reverent enough to let it stand on its own shaken legs, rather than rudely promoting it, so suckers like me would buy it. Everything about this movie is terrible, the script, the story, the casting, the play, the direction, the photography, the editing, the music ... what goes into a movie? Whatever it is, here it is as bad as it gets. If it wasn't that unpleasant, it would be ridiculous. I kept an eye on thinking that it would be better because I had not yet discovered that none of the positive reviews for it is reliable. Making a good movie doesn't take much money, nor does a low budget mean that a movie should be bad. My favorite example of a shoestring budget masterpiece is Gus Van Sants amazing Mala Noche, but there are many others. Sideline Secrets Director Cut or Original is bad, not because the people who did it had no money but because they had gigantic egos and no talent for anything except self-promotion.
