Madhur has given us a strong film Chandni Bar in the past. His next movie was one of the worst movies all the time. It apparently tells the story of some high-class people in India. After watching a scene where the man strengthens another man for sexual reasons to Star in a Movie. I want to spit and break the DVD. Randomly, I did. The reason was that the film contains scenes of child pornography and molestation. I literally vomited and was shocked to see a movie of naked children. Very disturbing things, there was no need to show the children completely naked. One of the rich guys likes to kidnap poor children and sell them to foreign people, British men in this movie. I'm shocked to know that this movie was a hit in parts of India, otherwise Super Flop in the UK, USA and Australia. I'm from the UK and this kind of thing makes me sick, shouldn't have been released in the UK.
