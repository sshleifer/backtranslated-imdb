I'm sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie "rocked". It's pure CG handed over CRAP! Don't send an Assassin, it's much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of colorful, aggressive, poisonous snakes on a plane! The only reason people like this movie because they feel they need to. It's not that bad, it's good. It is so bad that I would rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick, then expose it to it. I honestly thought to be a KOMEDY as an AIRPLANE! And spoof! Was I wrong It is all "It sucks, get it!" Or Samuel A. Jackson yells "Snakes on the Planet!" I'm sorry, I don't understand. It looks like a bunch of wimps gave the film industry more money to make more films like Triple X and Die Hard. If you're spending money watching a movie with the same people who bought William Hung's CD, they still live in their mommies basement and stink of plastic chairs sweat from days on the computer playing online games and watching porn, so rush to the theater and ask for one (since I doubt you have a boyfriend) ticket to snakes on a stupid-butt-plane. To hell with movies like Full Metal Jacket, Pulp Fiction, True Romance, 12 Monkeys, Clerks, etc. There is no irony in watching good movies. The true decline of Western civilization. Calling this a cult movie is an insult to true cult classics like Repo man or even Orgazmo. I've said enough here.
