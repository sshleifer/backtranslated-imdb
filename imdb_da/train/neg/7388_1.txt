drss1942 really took the words straight out of my mouth. I loved Segal's early movies and feel like the only one still faithful to him. I just watched this movie (ok, fell asleep about 90% so I didn't see the end). When I woke up and saw that I was on the DVD menu, I was grateful that I didn't submit myself to that movie and didn't dare find out what happened at the end. There was something strange about Segal and others. Kinda reminded me of the original Mad Max, where the voice was called, but in the same language (Australlian is English, not?) Anyway, if I had 10 thumbs, they would all point out right now for this Segal injustice.
