"Fever pitch" is not a bad movie; It's a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Is it possible American filmmakers and critics are so numbed and lobotomized by the excitement that Hollywood churns out that they will praise heaven even a mediocre movie with almost no laughs? That's the only reason I can think of why this horrible romantic comedy (and I use this term loosely because there's no fun in this movie) gets good reviews. I sat through this movie stunned that scriptwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel would even think their script was fun. <br /> <br /> The brilliant Nick Hornby usually translates well into movies. He adapted "Fever Pitch" to a British movie with Colin Firth and Ruth Gemmell in 1997; Peter Hedges found Hornby's voice for "About a Boy" (2002), and when "High Fidelity" became American for a film in 2000, authors D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, John Cusack and Scott Rosenberg did not go wrong because they kept the core of Hornby's humor and humor. They made one of the best films of that year. So why does the American version of "Fever pitch" go so painfully wrong? The British version was not a masterpiece, but it was charming, fun, unexpected and gave us two characters we liked, respect and understand. <br /> <br /> But Ganz and Mandel have carved out all the fun in Hornby's work. In the Americanization of history they have slaughtered it and removed everything that was good and unique about Hornby's work and replaced it with conventional drivel. They have transformed a fun story into a formal romantic comedy, never even turning away from the miserable formula. Lindsey (Drew Barrymore) has three girlfriends, each of whom has a separate function. It is overweight, the other is cynical and ambitious, and the third is a romantic one. Would you guess how many male friends Ben (Jimmy Fallon) has? <br /> <br /> What made "High Fidelity" such fun was not only a good leading man and lady, but engaging supporting characters. In this "Fever Pitch" they make six supportive friends or say nothing special. They are so insignificant, they are not even decorative. The only reason they are in the movie is because the formula requires it. Poor Ione Skye wins up as a Lindseys friends in a ruthless role. The lovely Skye must have wished Lloyd Dobler would swing in and take her away. Come to think of it, Cusack would have made an excellent leg. Of course, Cusack is too smart to associate with such a completely boring script. <br /> <br /> There is no single lonely moment in this movie that seems original or undisturbed. Each plot trip is predictable, every lame joke telegraphed. Ganz and Mandel work for laughs. The first 45 minutes are so rude slowly, you wonder if these chaps realized they were writing a comedy. You can mark the plot wings of this movie by your watch. It's almost as if Ganz and Mandel wrote this with some screenwriting guru's formula glued to the wall. When they came to a certain page, they looked up at the formula and said, "OK, the guru says it should happen now." And presto! <br /> <br /> Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly do not help the movie anyone. They have no concept of how to introduce their story and characters (they do not hand over the story to V.O. but to another guy sitting behind Ben at Fenway Park). Thanks to some extremely lumpy letters, we must see Barrymore and Fallon stumble through their unfunny initial meetings. <br /> <br /> Barrymore makes sweet and cute better than most. She is as good as Goldie Hawn in her thriving days. But even her audacity can't save this exceptionally horrible movie. She tries hard to twist some energy and humor out of this story. About 30 minutes in the film, Lindsey tells Ben, "You're fun." The only explanation for her remark is that it was in the script. For Fallon's Ben, nothing even says extremely funny. Fallon is neither witty nor funny; When he does comedy, he overcomes. <br /> <br /> Fallon was never good at "Saturday Night Live." He might have been the least fun person on that show. Remember to make sketches of a radio DJ that did all the voices? The only reason why "Weekend Update" worked occasionally was that Fallon's cohort, Tina Fey, knows one or two things about comedy. <br /> <br /> Actors who think they are fun and rarely behave if ever they are fun. That is the case with Fallon. He thinks he's hysterical fun when he hardly travels a chuckle. His stuttering, insecurity about himself did not work on the small screen; It's lousier on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for Fallon, his role in this image also requires a few dramatic moments. If you thought his comedy was bad, wait until you get a lot of his dramatic stuff. Two scenes in particular - the first in a park, the other in front of Ben's school - are painful to see. The scenes require an actor with a forge of dramatic ability, but Fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work. His range of emotions does not even lead the gamut from A to B. <br /> <br /> Ben has no personality or depth. He often comes across as an oaf. And not a lovable one in it. That scares the mind what Lindsey would find attractive about him. Compare Fallon's achievements to Firth's in the British version and you will understand how terribly flat, unfunny and forced Fallon's Ben is and how wrong he is to this role. Seeing Fallon in "Fever pitch" makes you long after Ashton Kutcher's dramatic depth and comic nuance! <br /> <br /> Like "High Fidelity", an American "fever pitch" could have worked great. It just needed better writers, more competent directors, and definitely a stronger, more fun, and smarter leader. Do yourself a great favor: Avoid this rotten film; rent the British version of 1997 and read Hornby's book instead.
