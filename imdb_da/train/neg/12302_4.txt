An Italian / American co-production with starring Linda Blair and David 'The Hoff' Hasselhoff: How could any fan of blurry horror resist such a treat? Well, based on the unintentional, extremely boring, and completely obscene first forty minutes or so, I would have said 'very easily'; Fortunately, however, things become a little more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes, and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy, a twist of nudity too (unfortunately, my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive material). Hoff stars like Gary, a photographer accompanying his beautiful girlfriend Leslie (Leslie Cumming) to a worn-out hotel on a seemingly deserted island for taking pictures of her latest project, a book on witches while, frustrated Gary is trying to cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving Leslie of her virginity. His plans for nookie are however scuppered by the unexpected arrival of property developers Freddie and Rose Brooks (Robert Champagne and Annie Ross), their pregnant daughter Jane (Blair), son Tommy (Michael Manchester), the beautiful nymphomaniac architect Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) and real estate agent Jerry (Rick Farnsworth) who has come to inspect the island's hotel. Having explained their unexpected presence on the island, Gary and Leslie are welcomed by the property's new owners, and when a violent storm suddenly picks up, it makes it dangerous to return to the mainland, everyone agrees to stay in the old one building. Unfortunately, it is not known to the hotel's new guests, it is also home to a wicked witch (Hildegard Knef) who requires human sacrifices to return to life. One by one, victims are drawn into a swirling red vortex (which guarantees to give unintentional grin) before they encounter a terrible fate. None of this makes much sense, and the play is terrible (Manchester as Tommy is particularly bad, while Hasselhoff turns out to be one of the better performers who speak volumes about the others), but the viewers who do it past the sad first half, rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore: Rose has her lips sewn together before being burned alive in a fireplace Jerry is crucified and burned alive; Linda is tortured by hags and impaled on swordfish (!!); Freddie veins pulses and goes into the blood geysers; and Gary gets stuck in the back. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Leslie is raped by a guy without lips, and Blair gets obsessed (again).
