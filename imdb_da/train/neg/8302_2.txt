Fun, how a studio believes it can make a sequel to what was a classic Christmas story with a brand new cast and expect it to flow. Sure they used different actors for Batman, but in that case Batman was a classic before any of the actors drank their cape. In this case, you had a classic character in the blonde head horns rimmed glasses wearing Ralphy who wanted a red ryder bb gun for Christmas ... Somehow we should forget him and accept another little boy who doesn't look like the original. If I had not known that it was a successor, I would not have guessed it from the cast ... except of course Charles Grodin tries so hard to imitate Darrin McGavin that you are constantly reminded that the original was much better .. <br /> <br /> Eventually, it might work if they had played the movie better. They should have been looking to see someone likes or simply ignored the original and did not try to copy their appearance. This one is just a cheap imitation. Ralphy evokes no sympathy just a desire to think his character shoots his eye out or dies.
