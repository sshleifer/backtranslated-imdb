I was going to review this for a site and I saw this with optimism that it might at least be a cheesy but entertaining rip off, and it didn't even do it enough. <br /> <br /> "666: The Child" is one of the worst supernatural thrills I've ever seen (even worse than "Godsend") with scenes ripping from "The Omen" without shame. The end is even very similar to the way "The Omen" ends. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that the play, the writing and the story are all just hackneyed. If these movies make money, I'm sorry to see where asylum is coming. It is embarrassing.
