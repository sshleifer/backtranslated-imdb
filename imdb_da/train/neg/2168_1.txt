After reading another review, I thought this movie would be good. I enjoy the "B" movies, but it couldn't even be classified as such. The photography is probably the only half-decent thing in the movie. But the editing left much to be desired. It was very choppy and staccato. Anyone who chose music and sound did a terrible job. The music was horrible, especially something atmospheric or scene setting. If the actor had been better, they could have pulled the film off. Unfortunately, I have seen better performances in porn magazines. If you want to see a "B" vampire movie, check out 'Blood Ties'. You will be much more entertained.
