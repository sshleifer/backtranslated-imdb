The title of worse movies from all the time is one that is released quickly and often. Most of the time it is exaggeration of fact, but I would like to welcome Alone in the Dark to the short list of real candidates: Plan 9 from outer space, Battlefield Earth and Adventures of Pluto Nash. <br /> <br /> As I watched the 90 minute drive, I found it difficult to even wake up even though I tried so hard to laugh at the movie. But unfortunately I felt alone in the dark (I would try to avoid the pun, but I couldn't resist) when I looked around and hoped to see Mike Nelson and his two robot friends. Unfortunately, my friends and I had to give comedies throughout the film. <br /> <br /> So ... about the movie itself. Let's talk about the action and the effects, as it should be the only positive part of the movie. The film contains evil creatures, a cross between Xenos in Aliens (they even call them Xenos) and the creatures in Pitch Black. It can become invisible by chance (and I assure you it is random) and be damaged by light. Also present are small daisies creatures used to control people who transform them into something that resembles a zombie. All of these are shown with outdated special effects that would have been mediocre in 1997. The action scenes are chaotic and impossible to follow. People randomly shoot on a blue screen or a blank set of monsters that were inserted in the post. The light flashes quickly on a dark screen where your students are passionate about overtime, while bad rock music blurs in the background. <br /> <br /> And those were the high points. The story is about a paranormal investigator (Slater) whose idea of ​​looking hard, wearing a black wife's t-shirt with a trench-coat and not shaving for 2 days. An archaeologist (Reid) who is quite unlucky. And a government agent (Dorff) whose lines involve the barking order. All three must be ashamed of their performances (not that they really have ever done a good job before) and the casting director should be ashamed. Reid and Slater should be lovers of the movie I guess. The movie contains the most unpleasant love scene I've ever seen in movies between the two. <br /> <br /> Then comes the plot. Quite honestly, the parts that make sense are nothing interesting. The rest is illogical at best. The plot holes could contain the collective egos of all three stars. The film begins with text and a voice explaining the back story. This opening lasts for more than a minute and already the viewer knows they are in something terrible. This opening story is later repeated adnausem in the unpleasant dialogue in a very clumsy and heavy hand way through the rest of the film. And the end didn't give an ounce of meaning. It was not only sensible in the film world, it was simply not sensible. <br /> <br /> Finally, the direction of a Uwe Boll. Disgrace, that's all that can be said. His use of shaking the camera to simulate voltage. His lack of direction with the actors. Just see Reid in scenes where she is not the center focus of the shot. The complete elimination of special effects money for ball-time effects. And finally, I choose to use voice over to explain something that should be painfully obvious to viewers. <br /> <br /> I paid a $ 1.50 to see this show at another round theater. And while they laugh at me and my friends provided it worth every quarter, I would advise people to avoid paying more for this movie. Grab 3 friends and split the rental price and grab this movie for a new one. <br /> <br /> Shame on Uwe Boll. Shame on you, Tara Reid. Shame on you Christian Slater. Shame on you, Stephen Dorff. Shame on everyone who was connected to this movie.
