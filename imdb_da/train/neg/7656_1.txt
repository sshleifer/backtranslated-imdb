The Dark Alone alone is one of my favorite roles all the time. I remember spending whole nights on the PC screen, trying to escape this mansion and actually being scared at times when monsters came up surprisingly. Now, remember - I'm tired of "computer-game-generated" movies. I can't remember a single success story in this new Hollywood genre, though some are entertaining enough to be watchable. And yet I'm such a big fan of the game that I couldn't resist. My reason was that if the movie had a plot that looked so much like the game, it would be ok. <br /> <br /> Man, they were 90 minutes (which seemed like 300) of my life that I never come back. If I had that chance, I'd have used them to reposition my sock tray instead. This is not even in the "so bad fun" category. You would think that even Christian Slater had a bit more meaning than joining this stink bomb. Now, Tara Reid ... I'm not complaining about her presence. But if the purpose of putting this chick in a leading role is to have a sex scene - which I fully understand and support (hi, I'm a guy!) - I've seen more of her body at press conferences. <br /> <br /> There is no plot to talk about. Will not waste your time throwing it to you. The credibility of the story falls below 'I didn't have sex with Mrs Lewinski'. The action is just a few notes of 'Street Fighter' which, by the way, is one of the worst movies I've seen, I'd recommend over this. Kids, I recommend Video games. It has much better history, plays and much more excitement. As for the film, here is a spoiler - it STUNKS! Wait for the porn version.
