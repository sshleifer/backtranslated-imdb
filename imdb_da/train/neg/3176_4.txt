The lovely Eva Longoria Parker plays Kate who dies after an ice angel crushing her before "I'm" with fianc√© Henry (Paul Rudd). After two years, Henry has not yet moved on, and his sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) is very concerned. Chloe arranges for Henry to speak to an attractive psychic Ashley (Lake Bell). Ashley will contact Kate's spirit and hope to help Henry move on with his life. When the psychic begins to be attracted to Henry, Kate's ghost seems to sip the romance of the bud. There are some fun situations; But if you've seen trailers, you've seen the movie's substance. Also in the cast: Stephen Root, Jason Biggs, William Morgan Sheppard and Wendi McLendon-Covey. Personally, I thought Bell stole the show from Parker. And Biggs as usual a pain in the butt. Nevertheless, this film was overheated.
