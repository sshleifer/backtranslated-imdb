I have to say I'm really surprised at the high ratings for this movie. I found it to be quite idiotic. Mother gets "visions" when she touches certain things or people? And one thing she touched twice made her vision continue ... Just seemed so ridiculous. Deedee Pfieffer's performance was terrible, I thought. She was very annoying. The girl who played Lori did a good job, and it made most of the support for what they were working with. <br /> <br /> I usually love the LMN and are very outspoken when it comes to movies, but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top play, and it just wasn't for me.
