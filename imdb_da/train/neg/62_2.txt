SWING! is an important film because it is one of the remaining black-produced and traded films from the 1930s. Many of these films have simply deteriorated so much that they cannot be retrieved, but it is in a pretty good shape. It is also a good chance to see many of the talented Black practitioners of the period right after the blooming of the old Cotton Club - a time but forgotten today. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while the film is historically important and has some wonderful performances, it's also a mess. The main plot is very similar to Hollywood's music age in the era - including a fine donna who will ruin the show and the surprise that is not known by no, where to save the day. The script, however, is only god-horrible and a little sweet at times - and designs pictures of black America that some might find a bit of dulling. This is because before the plot really gets started, you are treated to a bum without account that lives on its hard-working wife (a popular stereotype of the time) and when caught by a hussy (who, by the way, totally overplays that role) , they have a battle that looks like a scene from WWE Smackdown! And one lady will cut the other lady with a straight razor - a rough scene indeed! Later in the movie, when the fine donna behaves abominably, her husband hits her face and everyone welcomes him! It seems that the film sometimes wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience, PLUS they can't even do well - with some of the worst actions I've seen for a very long time. <Br /> <br /> But if you can see past a miserable production in almost every way (with trashy characters, bad acting and direction and poor writing), this can be a look so you can see excellent song and tap dance - as good as getting a glimpse of the forgotten black culture. Just don't say I didn't warn you about the actor - it's really, really bad!
