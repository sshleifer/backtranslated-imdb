Another colorful excuse for men in rubber boots to fight with each other. This time, the future arrives travelers from the future in 1992 and recruits a few people to go back with them until 1944 and prevent the creation of Godzilla, thus saving a future Japan from destruction. But having accomplished this task are the time travelers who appear to be a bunch of double-crossers whose own creation goes on rampage and without Godzilla to stop it? Eek! It all sounds very stupid, and that's enough, but the plot is surprisingly decent and the final battle also looks good. Unfortunately, the rest of the visual effects are just nonsense rather than pleasant nonsense, and the film turns out to be as boring as its predecessors. Look out for the shaky Spielberg in-joke.
