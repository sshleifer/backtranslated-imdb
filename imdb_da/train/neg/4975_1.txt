After seeing the Canadian / Icelandic / British 2004 production of "Beowulf & Grendel", which I believed brilliant and amazing, I turned to this - the first of 3 newer Beowulf films to expire this year - with enthusiasm. As soon as I heard "Viking" and saw the horned helmets, I moaned. These were Migration Your Swedes and Danes, not Vikings (they came later). And even the Vikings never carried horns on their helmets (horns make it easy for your enemy to turn off your helmet and then brain). Then there is Hrolfgar's Palace, which looks like a set for a film about Greece or Rome, not Denmark from the 6th century. Swords and armor look like props back from previous films set in different historical periods. I mocked weapons that could have been used by Crusaders in the "Kingdom of Heaven" and even a sign was using a Windlass Steelcraft's "Beowulf & Grendel" reproductive movie host! In addition to the basic plot of the original epic poem, the writing was gloomy and the reality completely wood and convincing. The biggest yuk was a secret weapon crusher, complete with observation channels and exploding projectiles that resembled something bought from Iraqi rebels. The special effects monster and his mother looked at steroids that Beowulf could never have torn an arm as he did in the poem. Take the gods of bazooka crossbows! I could go on, but I won't.
