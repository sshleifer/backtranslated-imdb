To this day, when you talk about the Japanese cinema, most people will not talk about Rashomon or Seven Ronin or Ran. For the masses, the Japanese cinema means all the monsters we have grown to love to destroy the Japanese cities over and over again, many times in battle with each other. The first and greatest of these is Godzilla, who has come back a dozen times or more and in a couple of films facing the three led hydra as a monster from outer space, Ghidrah. Oddly enough in time, the special effects were slightly better. But part of the charm of the old movies was seeing the broken papers in the Mache City sets, they looked so fake, maybe three steps over Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> Some future visitors have traveled to Japan to urge Godzilla to be destroyed when first discovered. And in fact, he was first discovered as a surviving dinosaur during World War II when he protected the Japanese garrison on a Pacific Island from the US troops. But later with a nuclear test on bikini, Godzilla became the friendly dinosaur like Barney the middle machine we've been told in the cinema. Of course, you eliminate Godzilla than you give Ghidrah a clear field to destroy Japan, so it won't be the economic colossus it was in 1991 when the movie came out. More I don't want to say, but we all know that Japan is doing pretty well as 2010. <br /> <br /> Like all the other Japanese monster movies, just sit back and enjoy the chaos.
