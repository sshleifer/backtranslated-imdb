I'm a lover of B movies, give me a genetically mutated bats and I'm in heaven. These movies are good at making you stop thinking about everything else going on in your world. Even a stupid B movie will usually make me laugh, and I still want to consider it a good thing. Then there was Hammerhead who was so horrible that I had to register with IMDb so I could warn others. First, there was the science of creating the shark man, which the film hardly touched. To keep the viewers interested, they made sure that there was blood every few minutes. During an attack scene, the camera moved away from the attack, but you saw what was apparently a blood clot thrown by a stage hand to tell you that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead (what amazing special effects). Back to science, I thought it was very interesting that the female test subjects were kept naked and the test equipment required them to be monitored through their breast tissue. Anyway this movie had poor plot development, horrible story, and I'm sorry to say pretty bad acting. Not even William Forsythe, Hunter Tylo or Jeffrey Combs could save this stink.
