I read the novel Jane Eyre for the first time back in 1986. It was around then, I saw the BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was an excellent version and much like the book. Years later, I watched this version and was horrified. William Hurt is completely dissatisfied with Mr Rochester. Sir. Rochester is a passionate character, in which William Hurt portrays him as an ice block. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like seeing two zombies together. This is the story of love and passion, but I couldn't see it in this version. No, back to the BBC version. A wonderful time is guaranteed.
