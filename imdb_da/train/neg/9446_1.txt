An absolutely terrible adaptation of the wonderful children's book. Raw and inappropriate humor, some scary parts and a boring side story about the mother's boyfriend who wants to send the boy away to the military school to get him out of the way makes this totally inappropriate for the kids who are likely to see it because of the book (3- 8 years old. Don't waste your money, your time or your good judgment.
