I missed the first 10 or so minutes of the movie, but don't think seeing it from the beginning would have made any difference. I found the movie extremely boring and was disappointed with the actor. I remember Patrick Swayze and some of the other actors (Roy Marsden, for example) in excellent roles, but they all disappointed here because of a very weak script. "Kind Salomon's Mines" ... the very short part of the movie within the "mines" was as exciting as watching paint dry and I doubt even a preschooler would have been spelled bound to see the fight for the warriors ". The whole movie is reminiscent of a cheap American television series, give me Indiana Jones some day!
