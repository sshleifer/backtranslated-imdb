I got this DVD well over 2 years ago and decided only to see it yesterday. I don't know why it took me as long as I look like Inspector Gadget Show and even the new Gadget and Gadgetinis. Although it may have a light color palette and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie, there are some old things that lack the bog this gadget just down the toilet. First of all, the classic Inspector Gadget theme song and music is completely absent. The composer tries to compromise by making a similar score, but it's still just not good enough. The gadget mobile is now a car, not a car that can become a van. Plus it looks much shorter and rounder instead of being plain cool. Penny no longer has her computer book, and she and Brain hardly have any appearance. <br /> <br /> The reason is non-existent. There is something about a transformation formula and Dr. Claw never used to reveal evil to anyone, but that's all I got. What the deal was with the short / giant Italian guy, I will never know. It had nothing to do with anything. <br /> <br /> And if the title is something to pass by, his last case is by no means wrapped at all. And he stays on the strength, so why it's called "last case" is also a mystery. I was not at all impressed. This is a front end to a fantastic animated show that is oddly absent on DVD, but don't let it ask you to buy what Inspector Gadget DVDs you can. I sold this a few seconds after finally seeing it. No child will suffer or appreciate this and no fan of the old show with tolerate it.
