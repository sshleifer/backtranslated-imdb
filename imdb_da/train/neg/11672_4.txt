Three authors made a hard effort to adapt Jane Stanton Hitchcock's novel to the tube, but this television movie has ultimately been injected with too much melodrama and just doesn't know when to stop. Diabetes Meg Tilly suddenly finds himself in the rich, enigmatic Ellen Burstyn, who wants a mural painted on the walls of her unused ballroom. After learning about the last collection held there - Ellen's daughter's upcoming party - Tilly decides on her artistic theme that she never dreams of the daughter dying mysteriously before the function itself began, nor that she and the deceased had a striking resemblance together ! Two amazing actresses lend their services to an incredible yarn that does not carry tight studies that do not match every lady in emotional intensity. Burstyn's role can endure on the camp, while Tilly gets stuck in the dreamy-eyed-waif routine. Only one sequence late in the movie (the morning after the mural is finished) is charged with honest feeling, anger and fraud. The rest is piffle.
