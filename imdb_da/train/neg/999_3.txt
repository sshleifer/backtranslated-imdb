I saw 'Descent' last night at the Stockholm Film Festival, and that was a big disappointment. Disappointed because the story was potentially powerful, the prospect of seeing Rosario Dawson in a less intimate movie, was exciting, and I was a fan (sounds pervy, I am not!) Of the rape withdrawals of the 70s, I was unnecessary say very curious to check out this movie. My conclusion: Let's stick to the classics! Yes, the story has potential, but the dialogue is flat, the actors are not convincing. Even Dawson is empty. Some say that it is a real portrayal of the university college in the United States that the emptiness of the characters serves a purpose and all that jazz, but it just makes the whole movie insignificant. Like the scene where Dawson is raped: it lacks serious intensity! I didn't expect something 'irreversible' style, but we don't think we feel compassion for her? I did not do it. Not a moment, she was so paralyzed all the way ;-) And I read that the photography was impressive. Well, that's good, but not groundbreaking either. I have to admit that the screening at the festival was not so good, so maybe I missed something here, but at the end of the movie I couldn't help thinking 'I want to see Argento's' Inferno' again. laugh out loud. More seriously, the first scene in the club is beautifully shot and anything but I had the bitter feeling of seeing a longer and more boring version of the scene in the dirty bar near the US-Canadian border in Lynch's Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with I "... the red red and blue lighting, the heavy bass music, the general vast / decadent atmosphere ... No, I just couldn't get into this movie. Too bad.
