I can't believe I wasted 80 minutes in my life and looked at this horrible movie I was hoping it would get better at the end, but boy was I wrong. The reason was scary, the play was extremely poor and the special effects were terrible. Not even the two beautiful girls could revive my interest in this dull and bloody mess. But I can't lie, some of the lines in this movie were quite memorable, as when the Asian boy says '' I lost my virginity to the babysitter so f **** stereotypes '' <br /> <br /> please do not waste your time with this collapse unless you are prepared or want a good laugh .. maybe that way you can see it to tear this movie with some friends
