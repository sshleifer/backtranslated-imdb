Typical Troma garbage, this smutty 80's flick is considered one of the "highlights" of Lloyd Kaufman's infamous production study, along with "The Toxic Avenger" released a year earlier. "The toxic Avenger" is far better if you ask me, but this demented splatter-flick is nonetheless durable; Just make sure you leave your full brain capacity at the door. The events take place in Tromaville, a small town that proudly claims to be the world's toxic chemical capital, and they certainly do not sound. The security measures in the local nuclear power plant are unstoppable, at least (even Homer Simpson was never this obscure) and toxic waste leaking through to the nearby high school. The first intoxicated victim is the stereotypical geek who starts spitting green things out of all his body cavities, but his death is believed to be an accident because he did not have at least two microwave ovens in his house! Oh, humanity! Shortly afterwards, the nuclear source also affects the school's grassland, and things really start to get messy. After shaking a joint at a party, the sweetest couples in the school produce a giant snake monster lying in the basement and feeding on teen foam. "Class of Nuke 'em High" is the bottom part of the horror film production, with dialogues so stupid that they hurt your ears and makeup effects, giving a whole new meaning to the word tasteless. If you enjoy seeing faces melt away, get crushed or split in half, this is definitely a must-see! Unlike the "The Toxic Avenger" mentioned above, this movie is suffering from a couple of really boring and long-lasting moments where nothing really is significant, such as when Chrissy and Warren are trying to figure out what's wrong with their hormones. The raw humor is not as effective as in "Toxic Avenger" and the imagined notions are unforgiving amateur. Continue only if you are an avid Troma fanatic.
