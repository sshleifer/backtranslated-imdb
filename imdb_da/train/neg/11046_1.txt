This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. Bad plays, bad special effects, bad plot, bad everything. In the last 15 minutes, a cat-cyborg has been introduced that confuses everything. Malcom MacDowell should have needed to pay the house because otherwise he would have had to sell himself on Hollywood Blvd to pay the bill. I just don't know how to go from Clockwork Orange to this shit and be able to see yourself in the mirror every morning. I could have done better special effects in my bathtub. There is no continuity. The editor must have slept or on drugs it is so bad. Should they smoke to be bad? The gun shoots either blue flames or balls, imagine. The bad girl and the other girl in the movie look so much as it is confusing. Who is called the 2013 Seadly Wake. It has nothing to do with the movie
