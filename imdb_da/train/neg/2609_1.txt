This movie gave nothing new or worth it. Having seen it, my wife and I both agreed that the studio simply churned this out and could have cared less if it was entertaining. This is a good example of a "concept-only" movie - they have a concept of a movie and the other details are insignificant because execs KNOW will make $$ just based on the original concept. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Cruella coming out of prison and going to parole. She no longer hates puppies, but has been programmed to love them - she simply couldn't hurt a flea. This does not last too long after her release, and she is back in her old ways. Period. <br /> <br /> The most annoying aspects of the movie were the supporting characters. Eric Idle as Waddlesworth's voice, the bird made me HATE him - and it's FULL because I'm a die-hard Python fan. It was obvious that he did so because they gave him lots of money (there can be no other reason). Cruella's low self-esteem, Tim McInnerny, was fun in Black Adder shows, but here he is completely wasted and unfunny. And it must have cost a few bucks to get GÃ©rard Depardieu, but he was also completely wasted. There were also other supporting actors, but considering how badly the characters were, I try to block them out of my mind. Overall, you would be better just to let your kids watch television than bother to let them see this drift.
