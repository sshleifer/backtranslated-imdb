In general, I have found out that if you do not hear about a movie before you watch it on DVD, there is probably a good reason for it. I hadn't even heard of this movie until I was in a Blockbuster the other day and looked at it on a shelf. Since all the good movies had already been rented out (those I wanted to see anyway), I thought I'd give this a shot. It's really not much different than other movies in the genre, such as The Singles Ward or RM If you are in these movie types, you will probably enjoy this. <br /> <br /> But if you're not a Mormon, this movie probably won't appeal to you. There is no way to avoid the obvious religious (Mormon) message contained in it, and sometimes it comes across as juicy and cheesy. In the end, if you don't fall into demographic demographic Mormons, you're probably better off seeing something else. There were some very funny moments in the movie, but I didn't think it was enough to save the movie together.
