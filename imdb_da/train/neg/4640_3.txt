Hunters hunt what they think is a man through the forest, even though the audience sees that he is a werewolf. The hunters never seem to realize this, because after they shoot him, he usually looks like they are beheading him. <br /> <br /> A doctor transplantes the werewolf's eyes to a man who lost his own in a lab experiment. The man, Rich, gets sex with his nurse (Stephanie Beaton) before he even gets his bandages removed. <br /> <br /> After leaving the hospital, he finds that his wife has also cheated him. When a smoke machine sends clouds past an amateur painting of a moon (with a false tree branch on the foreground), he becomes a werewolf! His torso gets bigger, splits his shirt, and he grows a huge werewolf mask on his head that has red lights in his eyes. His pants remain intact. The mouth chews unbeatably, even though some kind of robotics (or hidden hands) in the eyebrows gives him a barefoot look at times. Despite the poor werewolf costume, there is a lot of blood and gore, and they are pretty well done. There is even a pretty good peeling later in the movie. But when a man falls from a height, doing a pretty bad dummy job. <br /> <br /> Rich has a friend named Siodmak, a kind of occult expert, and he also accidentally beats a little man with crutches named Androse, who is also such an expert. They are trying to help him a little. <br /> <br /> Rich kill people who made him wrong. A policeman examines the murders and tries to beat Beaton, who doesn't care much about lesbian scenes, so nothing comes of it. <br /> <br /> Quite cheap, but between nudity and blood and gore and a non-grim story combining (kind of) the most dangerous game with the hands of Orlac and The Wolf Man, it's something entertaining. Available alone or in the Scream Queens Vol. First
