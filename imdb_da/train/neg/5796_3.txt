I saw this feature as part of the Asian American film festival in New York and was horrified by the graphic, sado-masochistic, child pornography that I experienced. The story is hidden along the way for many graphic sex scenes - and not one is at least erotic - the sick are the more feeling. The director seemed to have gone for shock value rather to explore the different levels of why these characters are like this. See it if you can stomach it - I still have flashbacks.
