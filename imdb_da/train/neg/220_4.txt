"The Crush" is a comfortable enough 40-something romantic romantic chick flick for the first two-thirds or so, as it tries to be a Brit "Sex and the City". <br /> <br /> I especially enjoyed the tournament of the young hunk trophy whose character is not much flattery (think of what we saw not so much physical flesh of him either and Kenny Doughty is worth seeing more of). <br /> <br /> They make a lot more young man / older woman than in every version of "Sabrina" (neither film I like) or for that matter Douglas / Zeta-Jones or Dion / Svengali nuptials. About Andie MacDowell as an ex-pat is otherwise welcome family members from Brit dramas and comedies, such as tart-tongued Anna Chancellor. <br /> <br /> The plot turns toward the end, feeling very deus ex machina. But it wasn't until the credits came up at the end that I realized what could really be wrong. As with "Sex and the City", the author / instructor is man, here the first representative Scot John McKay, and I think he would really make a script about three gay men, probably about those who come out to their lovers and at work (the characters are a school leader, a policeman and a doctor), which would have been a better and more interesting movie. The title of the film was "The Sad F * cker's Club", which would have made its parallels with the "Broken Hearts Club" even more obvious. <br /> <br /> (originally written 4/6/2002)
