Surprisingly, the film has some redeeming quality in it as it moves toward its end. On the other hand, this movie is a really bad and boring, with a small budget, insulting poorly written script and everything that goes with it. It's silly that with all the money going around in Christian circles they can never seem to get enough money to make a decent movie with. I'm not religious, so I couldn't care less about it, but filmmaking does something like a good tool to reach a new audience for churches and make people more interested and curious about reading the Bible for example. In this connection, these films always work as a wasted opportunity. <br /> <br /> The low budget really hurts the movie and brings it down. It makes the movie ridiculous to see with its effects, and it just gives the overall movie a campy-B movie as a feeling. <br /> <br /> But what's so bad about this movie is its writing. The things that just happen in this movie are just insulting to the intelligence, and I don't even complain about or talk about the religious aspects of the whole story. The movie is progressing, is just as unlikely, and the people in this movie are making so much unlikely things that it is insulting to its viewers. I also hated how the movie was like a soap opera at times. Seemed to me they just had a hard time making this a full-length movie, and they added in some characters and dramatic developments just to fill it. I just couldn't care less at times. It must still be said that the film becomes more solid and stable towards its end when history becomes more focused on its essence. Nevertheless, it remains predictably all, but it prevented this movie from being a complete wreck, and as far as these types of movies are concerned, there is much greater to look out there, even though I don't think this movie will win over some new souls. <br /> <br /> 4/10
