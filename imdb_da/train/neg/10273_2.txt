When it comes to horror movies, I am more than willing to suspend unbelievers, ignore sub-parameters, and overlook plot holes in interest for a good scare. This movie simply has no good scares to offer. It can't even be enjoyed as a camp. Bad dialogue, bad acting, poor direction, the killings were predictable and poorly staged, the music was annoying, the camera's work was miserable, even the costumes were poor. I felt really bad for the actors, who of course tried, but who had to deal with a terrible, constructed dialogue and a blatant lack of direction. I doubt they got any exercise either. It is embarrassing to see, and so boring, than to make it the constructed "surprise" ending requires tremendous endurance. It's simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I usually don't write reviews, but it was so bad that I felt compelled to warn others. This movie is a complete waste of time. To watch this movie, don't miss the "Making of" feature. The author / director seems to be under the impression that the killer was a woman who was a little daring, daring movement. (See it.) He and the pen spend half an hour to disassemble this movie as if it were a New Year's "Citizen Kane." It's like listening to a group of third graders taking you behind the scenes on their Christmas dinner. They really believe they have created some substance. It's sad, really? The only reason I gave this movie a "2" is because I think "1" should be reserved for real atrocities, such as "Manos: Hands of Fate" and "Space Mutiny". So "American Nightmare" is not the WORST movie I've ever seen, but I have to say it's somewhere in the bottom fifty.
