The saying "Never judge a book by its cover" was designed as a warning to those who do not see below the surface. <br /> <br /> When I looked at the artwork of "King of the Ants", I immediately thought HORROR! The path-shaped image, proudly displayed on the cover and back talking about a dark vision, synopsis promised a story of murder, treason and retribution. Instead of what I discovered under that surface, it was less interesting than what you can find under your average rock. "King of the Ants" includes Chris L. McKenna as Sean Crawley, an average guy ready to make a name for himself in this world, even if it means murder. Except Sean Crawley is one you don't care about, never once did I feel compassion or sympathy for this character. In fact, he is actually unlikely, but not as much as Daniel Baldwin (Ray Mathews), who becomes an uninspired performance as the very best of the extremely ridiculous dialogue he has to recite. Throw in Kari Wuhrer as a grieving widow who apparently has unconditional trust (especially in the homeless), and a little to no sense, and George Wendt as duke, who is basically a sober norm from Cheers, but BUT! <br /> <br /> Now, there are a few interesting "hallucinations" sequences in this movie (the source of the cover images), but this movie never gets into that world anymore. It prefers to bombard you with unmotivated signs, poor dialogue and unlikely event after unlikely event. Oh Horror!
