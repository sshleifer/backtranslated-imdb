I paid a dollar for this DVD, and at first I felt ripped off, but then I started thinking about it, and I should be grateful. I have found a holy grail, a real touchstone of poor cinema. If you think the opening of dramatic pictures of an empty stadium succeeds with Evel's inappropriate monologue at the camera address, wait until the opening bonuses roll on the driver's ass. The script appears to be inserted together from press clippings and ESL textbooks. But ..... I just can't believe how bad George Hamilton is. He seems to have absolutely no connection to anything he says, the only internal monologue I can discover is "Gosh, I think those I think I'm sweet, really sweet!". This is an epiphany! I now know how bad it can get.
