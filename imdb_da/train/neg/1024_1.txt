I watched this movie at the Toronto Film Festival with pretty solid expectations. the movie has a great cast and closed at the festival, so it must be good, right? how wrong was i <br /> <br /> I knew we were in trouble when before the movie director talked about how he, when leading an episode of wiseguy, met an unknown actor named kevin spacey (a director / author of wiseguy who made his debut debut = blah ... well Edison's director / writer must have some incriminating images of kevin spacey killing a homeless man because i can't see how he (along with the others actors in the movie) would ever agree to be in this disaster. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely horrible! It is a mixture of every politically hard-boiled clich√© ever. There's nothing new about Edison. the play was bad and the direction was even worse. it looked like the aforementioned episode of wiseguy. This was the best casted straight to the video movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Some examples of just silly moments in Edison ... Morgan Freeman dances around his apartment for no reason to rock and roll music ... Justin Timberlake gets creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded of candles ... llcoolj runs a vintage firebird ... 3 guys are shot in the head ... this movie is the opposite of good. EDISON!
