This movie was not exactly what I expected. <br /> <br /> If this movie was called something else, no one would even notice the difference between the two. <br /> <br /> It's really strange because I can't see the point. prequel and sequel lets just say don't make sense, don't even match. maybe I'm naive, but am not a vol 1 & vol 2 intended to match up. <br /> <br /> Carlito was in prison in the first and dies in the original, and in prequel he lives and does not go to jail. <br /> <br /> The plot was ok, but they should have changed some actors and some of the story and the name of the movie, and that would have been a good movie. <br /> <br /> I really expected it to end as the other one started. <br /> <br /> If anyone has an opinion on this post, please.
