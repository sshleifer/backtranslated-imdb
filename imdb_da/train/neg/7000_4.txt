Hollywood, the home of hype, glamor and the search for profits, is rarely governed by spiritual values, and so it is not surprising that its attempts to explore the spiritual life are thin and often stupid (better to go further away - to movies of Bresson, Dreyer, Rossellini and Bergman, to investigate the depictions of spirituality). "Strange Cargo" is no exception. This odd hybrid of fairy-tale film, love story, and religious parable trivializes the much insights it attempts to communicate. That some kind of providence and salvation would work to suit Verne (Clark Gable in his most combed way and self) and Julie (Joan Crawford, who spins and spits out every other word in an attempt to be the queen of hard ladies) ridiculous at best. Is this Patron Saint of Star System at work that matches warring egos before being passed on to further punishment on the M-G-M Party? BUT. . there are good supporting ideas here and visually arresting moments: the shady prison barracks; the escaping boat by moonlight or by a picturesque cloud; Julie walks along the promenade which the wind whips up; Julie and Monsieur Pig (Peter Lorre) negotiations for Verne's freedom as the storm builds; an extraordinary endopic gay prison romance between two prisoners. . . Above all, Paul Luke's worthy and tearful performance is like Hessler, a killer who can appreciate the virtues of Cambrea, but return to him. In the film's most arresting moment, Hessler, who has left Cambreau, stands outside the cabin. We hear the wind through the jungle, see the shadows on his face, which give a moment of fear and confidence. Then he goes out into the night. At this moment, Hessler achieves an ambiguity, depth, and existential power that none of the other characters manage to achieve. is the film's secret that its deepest sympathy is allied with Hessler?
