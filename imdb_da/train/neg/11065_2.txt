This film had so much potential. Anyone who followed the story of Jeffrey knows that there are so many details overlooked in this movie, it is ridiculous. Too much time and effort was used in the film about Dahmer's homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption. Where was the character development? The origin of any villain is always interesting, and Dahmer was no exception. Where in the movie did she turn to her youth when he started killing and mutilating small animals? Instead, we give a dizzying selection of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killers, but fail to address the big point in Dahmer's development. The reason why the country became so fascinated with this story was the details - how he stored the bodies in his apartment and the lengths and measures he took to achieve this; his cannibalism and his desire for meat, etc. I could go on but to sum up, too many backward points in the film, focused on his sexuality and not enough of gore - the good things you would expect to see when the title of the movie is "Dahmer".
