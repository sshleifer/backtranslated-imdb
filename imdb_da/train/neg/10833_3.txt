I wanted to like Magnolia. The reason reminded me of the Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives / stories that come together at the end, but Magnolia took a wrong trip halfway through the film and I lost. I almost hit it from time to time, but I felt I was going to hang in there for the end, little did I know it would be another torture 1 1/2 hour. Thank goodness I rented instead of seeing it in the theater. I screamed almost in frustration after 2 hours. The biggest kick in the pants was the final seed stage. My DVD player still hasn't forgiven me and I don't owe it a little. It was a unique movie, but a bad, boring and pointless movie.
