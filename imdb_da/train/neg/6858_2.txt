John Huston's Wise Blood was a more horrible misrepresentation of Flannery O'Connor's book than I could have imagined. From the extremely horrible appearances (and you don't, "Oh, that was done on purpose, you just don't understand it" me!) To the musical score that was more suited to an episode of Rockford Files, this movie was disgusting. I considered it with no bad will from the start and actually expected a pleasant experience. But the wrong character of the southern person, from the ridiculously fraudulent southern feature to the lily-shaped, comical way in which their faith was portrayed, was inexplicable. Just down to the end, which was completely devoid of any sense of character, O'Connor's book succeeded in everywhere shining and reasoning. The actors depicting the "southern" policemen may as well have eaten forged hot dogs from NYC street stands and quote the Godfather. One redeeming performance was Ned Beatty's lively and poor representation of Hoover Shoates, a religious con artist who hears Moates proclaiming the Church of Christ without Christ and seeing dollar signs and business opportunities. O'Connor's powerful book is best known for its eerie, religious undercurrent, jibing the seemingly lifeless carcass of "Faith". Mr. Huston's film is a shameful disgrace to the author's intentions as they are understood by me and most of her fans if I can be as bold as saying it. While I recognize that I cannot know exactly what the author wanted to convey, I have enough affection for her and her works want to remain a fan. If I considered Wise Blood as Huston apparently did, I would have thrown it into the bin. For Flannery's sake, and mine, I forgive you, John Huston. It forgets .... it will take some time.
