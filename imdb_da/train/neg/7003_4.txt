(aka: TRINITY is still my name) This sequel seems to have been made to exploit the excellent European box office success of THEY CALL ME TRINITY, only this time Joseph E. Levine and Avco-Embassy photos would capitalize on it in America too. Too bad they didn't get very far, as the Hill / Spencer images have only had marginal success here in the US, and this pretty boring, drawn-out movie doesn't help anyone. <br /> <br /> Trinity and Bambino swear to their dying father (Harry Carey Jr.) that they become successful crimes and take care of each other. They are later involved in gun dealers who smuggle guns out of a monastery and mistakenly believe they are a few federal agents. It's all going to fall flat in spite of a few fun scenes, especially the one where Trinity and Bambino are in a fancy French restaurant and don't know how to carry themselves. And the scenes with the shorthaired were also mildly humorous. The opening title music, sung by Gene Roman, sounds like a just Bobby Goldsboro-like early 70s pop song, while the music shows flowing throughout the movie are pretty good. Not sure if I want to buy the CD audio track of it, but some others might. The movie could have had half an hour whacked out of it and it wouldn't have dragged on for so long. It seems that many scenery are chewing up here. In fact, I lost interest in it about 2 / 3rds of way through. The DVD is also horrible, with a constant hum in the soundtrack, and a poor print that looks like it should have been sent to the big scrap yard in the sky. <br /> <br /> A big step down from the previous movie. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
