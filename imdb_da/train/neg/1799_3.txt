Skippy from "Family Ties" plays Eddie, a wussy 'metal' nerd who is picked up. When his favorite wussy 'metal' singer Sammi Curr dies, he throws a hissy fit down all posters on his bedroom wall. But when he later gets a handed record that holds the spirit of his dead 'metal' idol. He is first sucked into revenge, but then he will not take it as far as Sammi does. It's not as far as his main victims just seem to go to the hospital. This movie is completely ridiculous and has almost as much to do with real metal as "Rock Star". OK, maybe a bit more than the piece of junk, but you get my point. And how ANYONE can root for a guy played by Skippy from "Family ties", I have no idea. The Como by Gene Simmons is ok, and Ozzy Osbourne reaches context, I welcome him for it, but otherwise skip it. <br /> <br /> My character: D <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Elise Richards gets topless, a topless extra at a pool party
