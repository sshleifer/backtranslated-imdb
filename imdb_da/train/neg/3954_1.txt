WHOLE MOVIA are flashbacks from the first Boogeyman movie as well as inexplicable images from another Uli Lommel / Suzanna Love movie Brainwaves. It is framed with some more up-to-date (from the early 90s anyway) footage that is boring, badly acted and cheaply shot. Not only is the movie almost completely flashbacks, they repeat the same flashbacks throughout the movie. So you see the reused recordings over and over again, as if you hadn't already seen it. As if the originals were not bad enough. I've never seen a movie so padded .... Someone is milking the last dollar out of these movies. Total ripoff. And talk about padding ... why should I write 10 lines on this trash? If I can convey that there are garbage in 2 lines, it should be enough.
