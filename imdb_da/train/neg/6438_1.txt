I didn't really know what this movie was about when I went to the theater to see it (hype about satanism, etc. Etc.) As the trailers in the last movie I saw so, so pretty interesting. <br /> <br /> Oh dear Roman Catholic mythology? Not my idea of ​​a good scare and honestly, I just felt watching a really good, scary movie, not a loosely pronounced religious farce trying to score cheap excitement by getting some chicks to get bloody every few minutes! <br /> <br /> I will try to stay away from the spoils (!), but I found it very strange that an atheist who gets a series of rosary beads from a deceased priest could suddenly end up with the wounds of Christ (is not stigmata supposed to be deeply religious?) I mean, she hangs out with losers, does losing things, behaves like a typical rebel et al, and here she shows the wounds of Jesus Christ ?? Come on! <br /> <br /> Scenes of her crucified, head thrown back, screaming, blood everywhere, became somewhat boring after seeing it a dozen times. It was neither scary nor scary, just repulsive. However, it was very painful to see - the flickering scenes were extremely annoying ... CONCLUSION: If your Catholic, it clearly doesn't. If you are not, you still cannot see it.
