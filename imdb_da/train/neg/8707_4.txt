This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I rented it as a joke and expect to get a giggle out of the first few scenes and let me just say that I've never laughed so hard in my life. The first scene where ninjas randomly jump out of the air and start a huge and ridiculous fire fight is one of the most incredibly fun stupid action movie moments in my life. This is not a dinosaur movie, but more a movie that makes fun (and doesn't mean at all) in the action genre. I didn't see the first two, but judging by the complexity of the plot, I don't think there is too much I missed. If you want to watch a movie that fits well with a six-pack or herbal medicine than I insist on, rent this movie and sit back and watch a 100-year advance in the movie thrown into the trash and get shattered by carnosours
