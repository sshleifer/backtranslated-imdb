I'm sorry, but it's just awful. I have told people about this movie and some of the bad plays that are in it and they hardly believe in me. There is nothing wrong with the idea, modern Japanese troops are being withdrawn in the days of the Busido warriors, and with their modern weapons is a battle for almost everything. When the troops first realize something strange, it happens that every person on the back of the transport must say "Hi my clock is stopped"? Imagine lines like being repeated 15+ times before saying anything else, and you have the movie's lack of grandeur in a nutshell.
