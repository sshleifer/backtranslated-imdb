I remembered this show from when I was a kid. I couldn't remember too much about it, just a few minor things about the characters. For some reason I remembered it was really intense. Also, it was really really early in the morning up in PA. Finally, I found an episode after looking around online for a long time. the first episode not less. Criminey! This show was so terrible. It was of course just done to show the kids playing lazer tag and having a good time. the show opens with bhodi li tells his mother "my names not christopher, i am bhodi li photographer warrior !!!!!" we are so forced to see children play lazer roof for the song "foot loose". and not just a quick little bit, but the whole song. ahhhhhhhhh my brain hurts just thinking about it. Oh yes, and as if I couldn't get worse, you can't see the laser beams from their weapons. It's as if they just run around to the whole "footless" song. Later, after bhodi goes into space or anywhere, they have a crappy laser gun battle for Phil Collins song "su-su-sudio". ah, trust me, you will not know the rest. what can i say ...... THE LIGHT SHINES !!!!!!!!!!!
