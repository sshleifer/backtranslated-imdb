If you enjoy movies like American Pie, Road Trip & Van Wilder; Avoid this film rejection at all costs. It is an unamusing, mean-spirited, unimaginable waste of resources that should never have been discussed highly; much less actually registered and sold to unsuspecting consumers. Easy the worst movie I've seen in the last 18 months; mind-numbingly bad for the entire 86 minutes of it's runtime. Had it been much longer, I would not have been able to write this review without using profanity. Consider yourself warned!
