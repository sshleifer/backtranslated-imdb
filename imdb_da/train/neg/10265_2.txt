Kirstie Alley looks a little slimmer, but little, is in this mess with a man, there is a MacGuyver lookalike, bleached blonde hair and everything. The pastor of the film is about an elderly woman (50 !!!) who cannot get her acting produced because of age discrimination, so she sends in her younger nephew to constitute the author. Not an original idea and not a very good movie with miserable plays, inane dialogue and a ridiculous plot. There is another plot about a writer with an infatuation or admiration for Kirstie's character and why this is included is a mystery. The actor who portrays Kirsty's brother is so timid and mistaken, it was torture to see their scenes. What is there to say about this movie. Avoid it.
