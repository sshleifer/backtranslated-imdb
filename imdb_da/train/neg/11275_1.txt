This is a real abysmal `LOCK STOCK 'clone with a shooting star and a horrible script. I have no idea why so many top British actors have signed this junk, they must have been circumcised. A story from a story goes on forever and ever, and if I hadn't paid good money for it, I would have turned it off after 10 minutes. Not the worst movie I have ever seen, the honor goes to the really pathetic used book role of a movie '(I use the term loosely) `GUMMO' (I want to sue the so-called 'instructor' for the lost hour and a half of my life), but this garbage is almost down with it. Definitely one of the worst 5 movies I've ever seen. Things like this remind Hollywood that they don't have a monopoly on really horrible movies.
