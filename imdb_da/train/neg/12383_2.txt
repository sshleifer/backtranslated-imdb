While some performances were good - Victoria Rowell, Adrienne Barbeau and the two Italian girlfriends came to mind - the story was lame and distant, the emphasis on the girlfriend's racial background was at best wisely handled, and relatives were mostly portrayed as stereotypes, Not like real people. I found myself uncomfortable for many moments that should be fun. I can hardly understand why the local paper here in SF said it was a good movie and wondered who wrote the glowing review here on IMDb. Very disappointed in this movie and crazy I actually went to a theater to watch it, based on the flawed connection to Garden State, which is a much more fun, more inventive and touching movie than this one. In particular, I should mention the emotional climax of the church which was so wood and by-the-numbers that I almost left, and some in the audience actually did. It was followed by a silly climax in the cemetery, which I saw 10 minutes before it happened. I really don't like being misled to spend my money so useless.
