The video quality is horrible. The sound quality is pathetic. The action is horrible. The dialogue is painful. The lighting is gloomy. The editing is ridiculous. I could go on, but it would be meaningless. Snitch'd is a third rate amateur video delivered as a feature film. This is best left to collect dust in the video store dealer.
