Predictable, hackneyed & poorly written. Badly, I reasoned that such a prominent cast would not be involved unless it had profit. I think competition among players is so intense these days (and will only get worse) that you can't choose and choose much more. Early on, we got an incarceration that contributed to the murder, and we had hit it down in our throats since then. The film lacked intrigue, which gave us some insight into the victim and only a possible motive for the murder. Some of the discourse was frankly embarrassing! It's hard to believe that anyone would even consider, or even commit to spending millions of dollars to make this tripe.
