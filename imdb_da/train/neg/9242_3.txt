What a great premise: A movie about the Berlin Airlift. It should have it all. Tragedy. Excitement. Companionship. Rivals. Berliner Frauleins and hard American pilots. love and tears. What we have is a movie with none of the above. Heino Ferch tries to imitate John Wayne or so, but he doesn't fail. He seems so wood that he must break at all times. He's trying to play the tough guy instead of being a tough guy! Why would Bettina Zimmermann's character fall in love with him? Because they threw stones in a lake? Because he brings her stone stone? SFX is very, very well done. Too much. The hundreds or so fly over Berlin, looks like an assault-formation squadron rather than an organized airlift ?? as it actually was. Interestingly, the White House, the Kremlin, and General Lucius D. Clay's office seem to be the same dark and dusty set. Note the same curtains hanging deep down the windows as if a protective shield against nuclear fallout. Why is almost every scene INSIDE dark and dusty? By the way, GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAY comes across as a little time, uncertain, looser general who trusts his own noble idea that the airlift. He was very opposite. So you combine all the individual blunders and the result is a movie of what is based on no passion, no excitement and no historical accuracy. Sad, it started so promising ??
