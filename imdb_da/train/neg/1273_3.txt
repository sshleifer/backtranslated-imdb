I have two good things to say about this movie: The landscape is beautiful, and Peter Falk gives a good performance (considering what he had to work with in dialogue and direction). But I said, I found this movie extremely tiring. Seeing paint dry would have been more entertaining. It seemed much longer than 97 minutes. Beginning with the opening order, where everyone is talking about each other and Paul Reiser repeats all that is said to him on the phone, the movie is annoying. The film is filled with clich√©s and shtick, not to mention endless events of audible flatulence by Falk. The director also seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to look for laughs or tears. There are some sequences that touch, but they are all played for laughs. If schmaltzy, sentimental and "sweet" appeal to you, you will love it. But if you were hoping for something with more substance then watch another movie.
