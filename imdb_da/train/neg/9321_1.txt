I rented this movie about 4-5 years ago and was immediately disappointed. <br /> <br /> I wanted to watch a b-movie slasher flick, but ended up with a fecal case for my eyes. The action looked like watching grass dry. I've seen better acting in a softcore movie ... The idea that a crazy killer comes out of nowhere confused me. How was this a horror movie? <br /> <br /> The film's production value was at best ridiculous. There was no scare. It looked like a high school student got a new video camera for Christmas. The reason was everywhere if existing. If you're bored of finding a bad horror movie for rent, skip this one. There are much better b-movies out there.
