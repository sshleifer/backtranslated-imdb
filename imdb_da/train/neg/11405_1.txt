I had to see this at school. And to sum it up ... <br /> <br /> Talented actors, talented script and a talented instructor. <br /> <br /> This movie is so waste of your time. Don't even watch the movie. Do not want to. You will be so disappointed. My teacher said it should be good. How wrong she was. She even slept a bit through it. The film's actors were just bad. The best actor in there was the old man, and that doesn't say much. It has a terrible reason with horrible characters. So unrealistic, and I can honestly say it didn't make any sense. The writing was unemotional and confusing. There were points in the movie when I pointed to my pans and said, "What?" Also there were just too many loose tapes and plot holes. It was just awful.
