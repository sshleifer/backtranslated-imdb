Five passengers at a bus depot tell each other their scary dreams while waiting to be picked up. But is there more to these nightmares than meets the eye? <br /> <br /> Fortunately, five bad movies for the price of one! Each segment has the very best in acting, special effects, make up and music. And these should be scary? Hmm .. I think I've been more freaked out during an episode of Teletubbies. I swear you will sit there as I was sorry that tears are waiting in vain for something interesting to happen. Do not want to. It never does. In fact, I even stopped quickly forwarding the advertisements as they were a lot more entertaining than the main feature. AND the end is the ultimate cop-out. Yes, none of this has actually happened. If only the same could be said for the day I put my VCR for recording these cobblers .. 2/10
