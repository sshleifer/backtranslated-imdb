I'm no horror movie buff, but my wife's nieces and nephews are. Then I saw the first movie. It was cruel and tense, but not my taste. Still good though. For similar reasons, I am currently exposed to a successor. <br /> <br /> The premise is beyond absurd. I can buy that disasters occur in the desert. I can buy that mutants exist. I can even buy that events can be so weird and strange that the military can decide to get involved. It's unlikely, yes, but I'm willing to suspend my faith. But under no circumstances am I willing to believe that the military battle assigned to such an area would not avert the mutants. Being a member of the United States Army, I can assure you that while new recruits are missing the experienced soldiers' experienced eyes and experiences, such recruits will be integrated into a skilled team. <br /> <br /> A few armed soldiers are not being taken out of a few mutants with knives. It's just the way it works. Squad movements, very superior firepower, and of course, radio support, would ensure nothing less than total victory. I'm not saying you wouldn't lose, but as soon as the area was verified as hostile, military training would take precedence, no one would even go to use the bathroom. <br /> <br /> And if it was discovered that the area was so infected with the hostile that the team was unable to handle the danger, they would radio in for backup. And believe me, their radios would not be fixed if there was a chance that normal radios would not, the team would have a military emission phone. Chances are, if they couldn't check in every hour, a search would be called. <br /> <br /> To accept this movie, you must accept that our soldiers are incompetent fools, with incompetent leaders and an incompetent command chain. While it may still be true that the world's most dangerous thing is a lieutenant with a map and compass, our military forces are filled with intelligent, well-trained, competent soldiers. Knife mutants are far below our ability to handle. <br /> <br /> Throughout the performance of the movie, the movie's failure to deliver depends heavily on the impossible. Instead, we are expected to believe that our soldiers, sailors, and airmen are unable to handle even the most mediocre threats. <br /> <br /> As a combat veteran, I find the film insulting.
