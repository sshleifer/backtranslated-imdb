I have only recently been able to catch up with Marilyn Miller's films as they are not shown on TCM in the UK. I have been very fascinated over the years because this was one of the superstars of the 20s. What was she really like? For some stars in this era like Jolson some of the magic is still shining, but unfortunately not for Miller. . Even worse in this movie as the public had become tired of musicals, virtually all music tracks have been deleted.So we are back with a comedy of the period of little genuine appeal. She was paid $ 500,000 for this! So I have only two conclusions. Either she was badly served by the cinema, or she had no talent at all. I think the truth is closer to it later than the previous one.
