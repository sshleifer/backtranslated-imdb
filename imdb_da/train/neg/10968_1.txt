*** THIS MAKES VERY, VERY SPOILERS, NOT THAT IT IS THAT, HOWEVER, AS IS PATENTALLY OBVIOUS *** <br /> <br /> Oh my God, where do I start? Well here - this is the first time I ever come home from a movie and said, "I need to go to IMDb and write a review of this now. It's my civil duty." Such is the dizziness in this flick. <br /> <br /> Begin digression * But let me just say one thing before I start. I'm not a Harvard art main movie noir-weenie (actually I went to the college at the other end of Mass. Ave in Cambridge, the one where the real smart people without rich daddies and trust funds go who should put me right in the nerd-like-would-obsessive-love-comic-books-census group, and I still hated this movie ...). My viewing preference is for highbrow biographical oeuvre that includes Die Hards, Bond flicks, Clerks and The Grail. I wish the Titanic had never dropped, not so much for life lost, but then we would not have been exposed to a dunghung in a movie. And the only and only reason I want to see a snooty French art film is if there is a young and often disrobed Emmanuelle Beart in it. I even gave Maximum Overdrive one of his precious 10's here on IMDb for God's sake. So I'm as low as they come, so I don't criticize this movie because I'm looking for a standard of movie quality - that's because Elektra stinks like a three-week-old dead goat. * End digression * <br /> <br /> OK, so very bad here that I have to try to categorize it. Here goes: <br /> <br /> MS. GARNER: One of the compelling reasons a man would want to see this flick is to see lots of hot JGar (I have no idea why my wife wanted). I think that between this and "Finding Nemo" was the latter the sexy movie. You know the red clothes she's announced wearing in every freaking ad you see? You see her in it twice - once in the beginning, once in the end. Bummer. In the rest she looks pretty much what Morrissey would look like if he were a woman - lots of pouting and black clothes. Which brings me to the incredible line of expression JGar shows in his play - from "pouting" to "pouting and crying". Oh my God, you would think she was forced to date Ben Affleck or something terrible. Um, wait ... <br /> <br /> THE BAD GUYS / GAL: They show the same expression of expression and behavior as one might expect from a slightly overripe grapefruit. At least beside JGar's performance, it's not too bad. A guy's role is to stand there and be great, someone else is standing there and getting things out of him, and the woman's role is to stand there and breathe and / or kiss people. They manage to pull out these incredible feats. The biggest bad guy has the most difficult role for everyone - he must as often a) act angry and b) appear Asian. He does a good job on this. I think there was a fifth bad guy / gal, but my brain is starting to block parts of this movie into self-defense. <br /> <br /> PLOT TWISTS! This film has about as many surprises as a speech in the Democratic National Convention. Let's just put it that way - my wife, who has only been in the United States for six months and only speaks a little English - whispered it to me when the girl first appears in JG's pillow and I swear to God, I'm not doing this up: "She goes to the house to kill the girl. And also, father." And this is before the Father himself has shown himself on the screen. Now my wife is not stupid, but neither is she organized by Mensa for her gifts, and she has no exposure to Daredevil or the comic book genre. And she figured this out in .00015 seconds without giving anything and no prior information. Such is the obvious revelation of this movie. <br /> <br /> RARELY FOREWORD STUPIDITY! OK, so there is this big guy in the movie. He can take a huge shotgun blast and brush off the shot as it is lint, and he can take an evil Electra staff to his chest and just bend the metal (or melt it - or something - more defense kicks in, thank God). But JG jumps on his head and he explodes? And Achilles Noggin? OKAY! Such is the insane stupidity in this movie. <br /> <br /> I start to feel a cerebral bleeding that comes on, so I have to stop. But you have been warned. If you intend to scare your own tires to prevent you from watching this movie, DO IT. And if Armageddon comes, let it be> before <this comes out on DVD.
