Now I haven't read the original short story to know all the literary points that went wrong here, so I'm not going down this road here. <br /> <br /> But I have long since learned that Stephen King movies simply - not scary movies, with perhaps a few exceptions. This was not one of them. It started well enough, and for once I will not complain about the actor, even though Fred Gwynne was always wonderful. Also, I will forgive the total lack of parenting skills as they were needed to make the story ahead ... <br /> <br /> But there was a coherent point that I couldn't help getting annoyed with. And it came quite close to the end of the movie, and at least 2 characters participated in the stupid stupidity activity. The moments I refer to are like this: There is a little zombie running around the house. You suspect it's under the bed. Do you <br /> <br /> (a) as close to the bed as you can before blindly raising the duvet cover and exposing your entire body to whatever way such a teeny undead cannibal can cause you or <br /> <br /> (b) move a little away from the bed so that you can look under the completely open end of a position with slightly increased security, or at least see the mini terror coming at you and giving you some reaction time. <br /> <br /> I know let's join (a). I want to offer myself for slaughter today. Stay <br /> <br /> Fun enough movie though ... Just not very scary.
