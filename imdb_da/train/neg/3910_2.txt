Isabel Allende's magical lyrical novel of three generations of an aristocratic South American family was vandalized. The paralyzing oaf of a movie that resulted in - largely due to a magnificent cast of anglo actors who are completely incapable of averting Allende's characteristic Latin melody and a plodding Scandinavian directorial hand - was so uncomfortable in his skin that I returned to the theater a second time to make sure I hadn't missed out on something crucial that could change my mind. To my disappointment, I had not missed anything. No one among Meryl Streep, Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Vanessa Redgrave could get rid of the trap for them by Director Bille August. All of them looked completely stiff and resigned, as if by putting as little effort as possible, they expected to fade unnoticed into wonderful times. (Yes, the film was art directed within an inch of his life.) Curious that the production designer was allowed to place KFC products prominent in a scene that originated around 1970 years before the KFC came into being. Then it was known by its original name: Kentucky Fried Chicken. Do you even apologize for what in the world is Kentucky Fried Chicken in 1970 in a military dictatorship in South America? American fast food chains did not hit South America until the early 1980s. The "House of the Spirit" should have been the movie event in 1993. Because it was so clumsy and sly faith in the vague idea of ​​what the novel represented, Miramax had to market it as an art film. As a result, it was neither event nor art. And for that, Isabel Allende should have pushed charges for rape.
