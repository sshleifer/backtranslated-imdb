The only good thing about this unfunny drink is that I didn't have to pay for it. I saw it for free in college. And if a college student can't find humor in something that was free, it's hopeless. <br /> <br /> Stale acting and poor jokes can't be masked by an excellent but confusing set of designs (which goes out of its way to market Volkswagon Beetles). I don't know what Michaels Myers did in this movie, but I've never seen anything more depressing. This was nothing but an obvious effort to take advantage of Grinch's past success (which has its opponents, but I enjoyed it very much). It's hard not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were being transferred to fund it. <br /> <br /> You want a fun Seuss customization? Join Grinch.
