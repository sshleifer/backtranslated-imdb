A retired diplomat, played nicely by Michael York, goes to Russia to avenge the Russian gangster who murdered the diplomat's policeman's son. There the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian policeman who helps him bring the Russian gangster to court. <br /> <br /> I remembered the ancient action flicks of the 1980s, which always portray the Russians as evil evil people undermine the righteous US government. It is interesting to see this time the Russian guy as a hero. <br /> <br /> Not a good flick, it's really typically a "B" action flick. Michael York gives some classes to this mediocre movie. Alexander Nevsky, who plays the Russian policeman, is a little "blah" but surprisingly has some chemistry with Michael York. Face it, Michael York is such a good actor that he would have chemistry with someone he is making a scene with. In return, the beautiful Adrian Paul is killed within the first 15 minutes of the film. Now, if Adrian Paul was in this movie anymore, it would have been an above average "B" action flick. All I can say about Adrian Paul is that he is really nice to watch the first 15 minutes of the movie. The villain played by Richard Tyson is your typical bad guy. He is very blonde and very vicious in this movie. <br /> <br /> Rent this flick if there is nothing else on TV to watch. It is okay. It doesn't suck too badly. The action scenes are decent. The action could be better, the plot could have moved much faster, but hey, you see what Russia looks like today!
