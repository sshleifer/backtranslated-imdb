I simply can't believe the number of people comparing this positively with the first movie. It moved me to leave this comment! This is just an obvious attempt to deposit the success of the first movie. The dialogue is horrible and nothing as authentic or convincing as the original film. The storylin is ridiculous, the depiction of the French police ridiculous and the characterization of Doyle a mile away from the first movie. <br /> <br /> How many dustboxes do you think you go down to the ports personally to see a shipment coming in? The ease with which Doyle finds his guy is just pathetic. Like all French police, only coffee is drinking until Doyle turns up from America and some real police work. What a joke. Try to go to a foreign city and dismantle the largest crims on site with a travel card and some tourist magazines. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> A truly horrible sequel, anyone who thinks otherwise, is crazy.
