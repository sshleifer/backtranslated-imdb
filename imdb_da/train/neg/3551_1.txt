This movie is just plain horrible !!!! Slowly acting, slowly coming to the point and wooden characters that just should not have been there. The best part was showing Iron Maiden singing in a video at a theater and that's it. The finish was worth seeing and waiting for, but that was it !! The characters in this movie almost put me to bed. Avoid it !!!
