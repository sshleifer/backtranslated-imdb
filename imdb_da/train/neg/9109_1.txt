The first cruel intentions, the original, is my favorite movie all the time. It was an absolute masterpiece. So how on earth could they make a successor so bad. Sarah Michelle Gellar was perfect in the first movie. In this, Amy sucks Adam. She's horrible. And could they not have found a chicken that actually looked like Sarah Michelle Gellar? At least the same hair color !!! I mean to move on. Robin Dunn is not as bad as Adams, but he is absolutely horrible compared to Ryan Phillipe. Sebastian in the first film is wiping, deceptive and much more evil than Sebastian in the prequel. And what's with the story. It goes like this ... 1 Sebastian has a bad rep at his first school, so the film says, although it doesn't mention anything about him and his dating life and how he has been with girls 2 Sebastian moves to New York, and suddenly decides to turn around. He "falls in love" with Danielle (may I remind you that in the original says Sarah Michelle giller says quote "you broke up with the first person you ever loved because I said - so how can he have been in love with prequel ?? And he is all cozy and charming, and all "good people" as he beats sex off the chicken his father did. <br /> <br /> 3- He makes a complete 180 and joins in a triangle at the end of the movie and then seduce Cherry. <br /> <br /> I think it's terrible, and I loved the first one so much, I haven't even seen the third one yet, I hope God is better than this prequel.
