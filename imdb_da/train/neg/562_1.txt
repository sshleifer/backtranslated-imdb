I like musicals, but like a Dickens fan I HATE this one. ** MILD SPOILERS ** Hungry boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workshop? The London poor are singing? Fagin and Dodger go into the sunset? Not really true to the novel. As I recall, Dodger was hanged publicly, and Fagin was in jail. ** END OF SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Oliver Reed is very weak as Sykes, doing a little more than green to indicate his evil. Worst is Mark Lester as Oliver, who often comes across so awkward and passive, you wonder if he really is the main character. His portrayal is by no means helped by the fact that the best they could do when he sings is dub in the voice of a girl. Don't guess they realize the boy's trebles are in almost every church in England. Self-respecting Dickens fans: Stick to David Lean's amazing 1948 movie or BBC 6 hour mid-80's adaptation. Avoid this flushed laundering of a musical.
