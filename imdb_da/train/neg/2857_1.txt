I've seen lots of Sci-Fi Channel Original movies ever since I started watching them back in 2002 (My first was Sabretooth - which is actually one of the more entertaining Sci-Fi Channel features in my opinion). Their quality varies. Some of them are average but decent (Sabretooth, Dragon Fighter, Never Cry Werewolf, Swamp Devil), some are ridiculously bad, and then some are really awful. Raptor Planet is in the latter. <br /> <br /> Raptor Planet, a loose successor to the 2004 Sci-Fi Channel Original Raptor Island, is a barely troubled mess on a movie with really horrid plays and lazy scriptwriting. The effects that bring the dinosaurs to life (a combination of puppet theater and animatronics as well as CGI and stock footage from Raptor Planet) are some of the worst looks I've seen in a low-cost movie. The gore effects are even unconvincing. <br /> <br /> The plot involves a bunch of commands that, for some reason (I forget why) travel to a planet of alien dinosaurs. It's true people, the dinosaurs are foreigners. Dinosaurs in outer space. What are the next sharks in the room?!? The rest of the plot is simple. The human cast is picked and eaten. Now we have come to expect this in the many dinosaurs, movies and novels being published, but this is the first murderous dinosaur movie I have seen where I actually got bored with all the dinosaur attacks. <br /> <br /> However, there are a few chuckles in it. There is a scene that stands out where a man is munched by a Carnotaur (animated by stock footage from the original movie) that seconds later becomes a huge raptor. Also a bit of trivia is this scene where Steven Baur shoots on his own death scene from the first movie. <br /> <br /> While Raptor Island was not a good movie at first, it is a masterpiece to its successor. <br /> <br /> Believe me when I say this is probably the worst movie Syfy has ever aired. It's darn near unwatchable.
