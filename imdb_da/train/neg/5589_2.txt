I skimmed over Richard Burton's movie when I came to this title, which I remember alive when I first watched it in 1982. I remember a dialogue from Tatum O'Neal that was just terribly bad. I remember Richard Burton's characters, who so hopelessly lost, and then remember how his motivations did not translate to me. In short, I remember "Circle of Two" because it was so phenomenally awful. <br /> <br /> This movie came out at a time when America went through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or oblique angles of teenage sexuality. Recall "The Blue Lagoon" (and other Brooke Shield's irritations), "Lipstick", "Little Darlings", "Beau Pere" and other movies that just seemed to dwell on teenagers having sex, especially with adults. As a teenager of this time, I found the occupation combined with the sexual profits in the 70s and 80s, made for an unconscious worrying environment, where one could still find out everything. <br /> <br /> "Circle of Two" is not execrably traded or redundant prurient, such as "Blue Lagoon". In fact, it handles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave, if it is completely unsuccessful, way. But honestly, this is one of the movies you will * never * see if you didn't see it on its first round because it was so terribly terrible. Nobody wants to have this waste ever surface to be publicly distributed again.
