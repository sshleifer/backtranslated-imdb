I rarely comment on movies, but I've read the other comments and I can't believe there are people who applaud this celluloid waste. I know there are some people who have their own agenda, but let's take it on profit. badly acted, badly shot and the story felt like the director got it up when he went together. I don't want to focus on the sexual aspect of the movie involving young children, as the film makers knew what they wanted and what their audience wanted. All I can say is, it's a horrible movie, the content is poor and offensive, the production is amateurish, and I'm glad they couldn't make a movie like this legally today
