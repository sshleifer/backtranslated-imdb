I just loved watching it myself and having fun with it all in a movie. I watched this movie through the helpful sarcasm of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 and I have the DVD. If you select it to the other side of the DVD, they show the actual movie so I gave it a try. Seriously, this is grilled cheese. <br /> <br /> The play, special effects and plot in general are very cheesy and unrealistic. "Doesn't she need lungs", Crow says how the head can still talk while it doesn't have a body, and Tom Servo just says wistfully "No, she has neck juice!". The end is just classic and no one can touch this soundtrack with K-Porn! I loved the "cat fight" between the two strippers. The "Meow" after the fight or stage, regardless, was classic. So in some ways it was a funny movie. I think for horror fans, you will probably enjoy it. For a good time, see the MSTK3 version, you get a good laugh. <br /> <br /> MST3K version: 10/10 The brain that would die: 1/10
