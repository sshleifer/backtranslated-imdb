Often China's biggest movie ever voted by Chinese critics as well as Chinese film enthusiasts from outside, and I don't understand it at all. What I saw was one of the most generic melodramas imaginable, gently straightened and dealt with a complete shrew for a protagonist. Wei Wei (not laughing) is the shrew, a young married woman who has suffered with her tuberculous husband (Yu Shi) in recent years. It is post WWII, and they live with a man's teenage sister (Hongmei Zhang) in a fake home with not much money (the man had been wealthy when they married). Along comes the man's old best friend (Wei Li), who also used to be the wife's girlfriend when they were teenagers. She considers running away from her husband with this man, while the man remains largely ignorant of thinking that he can engage his little sister to his friend. That's the setup, and it doesn't go anywhere you wouldn't expect it. I have actually seen remake, directed by Blue Kite director Zhuangzhuang Tian. It runs half an hour longer, and it is actually boring, but at least it was beautiful. This supposed classic is quite intolerable.
