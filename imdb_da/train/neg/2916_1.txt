This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The reason and the message are terrible. There are too many mistakes in this movie that it is impossible to quit. I don't even understand how this movie can get any nomination, let alone 2. Here's why: 1) Sam Lee portrays an angry / irrational detective due to the disappointment of his father. Advantages: He's angry okay. Disadvantages: When it comes to the explanation scene, he cannot convey the grief / disappointment he has in his father. The crying scene was too fake, and it seems that he literally pushes tears out of the corner of the eye. <br /> <br /> 2) To connect the movie to the title there was barking or dog's wimping sounds under combat scenes and rape scene, which is completely irrelevant and confusing to the viewer. I understand that it should be a metaphor or not ... but it's just so stupid! 3) WHY DID THE COPS DO NOT PROTECT DEATH? What dunk is wrong with this movie. When the killer started an officer, he shot. He's already dead! What the heck? There were plenty of opportunities for the killer to be killed, but I don't know why he wasn't! 4) During the scene where the girl had her foot hurt. In the scene, it was very clear that the left foot of the girls was injured, so how in the next scene did she lend all her weight to her left foot? And this is the actor nominated as the best new performer? WTF? 5) Noises in the movie are not synchronized. <br /> <br /> 6) I guess this movie is trying to bring attention to the brutality and violence of children in Southeast Asia, why does the bad guy win and then the police joined the fight? 7) This movie is just too violent without a purpose. Cops turn CI into a pulp and so if they cooperate, do they give them marijuana and cola? This is generally the worst movie. I really feel that the person who wrote this movie is a sadistic and sick person. I have never seen a more disgusting movie throughout my life. WORST MOVIE EVER!
