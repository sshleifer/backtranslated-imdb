I'm a big Willem Dafoe fan and really searched this movie (I had to get a region 5 Chinese DVD of it!). But it's really one of the worst I've seen for a while. <br /> <br /> The action (except Dafoe) is horrible. Dafoe and Colagrande both wrote and directed this (although he is not credited as an instructor), and they have no notable talents to write or correct. (Stick to acting Willem; Giada get out of business, PLEASE!) <br /> <br /> Absolutely nothing happens. Apart from a series of totally convincing, completely unreliable motivation, these two people (who just met) work in this house. Colagrande is tired, I couldn't break my expression almost never changed. And the sex scenes are actually lame. I actually cringed twice on one of them. Yuck! They are certainly not least erotic, and yet the only time the movie does not put you to sleep. Then it is busy rejecting you. <br /> <br /> Just awful.
