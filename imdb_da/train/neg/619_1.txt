WOW is all I can say if your reading this is either seen or thought of. trust me see it! <br /> <br /> I laughed so hard at so many parts of this movie is the worst act ever made much fun! I can't believe they overlaid the school signs! I have to have played that scene over and over just to laugh more and more every time. If a movie like this can be made, it gives us all hope of making our own films. even the costume was bad. it looked like my 7 year old cousin could have done a better job doing it. heck i bet he could have written and acted better too. All I know is that I have to see the other part just so I can see if it was as bad as the first. It's a cool idea for a killer scarecrow, but a much better work could have been done. hopefully another killer scarecrow movie, just not like this one.
