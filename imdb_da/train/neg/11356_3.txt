This is not a good movie. For preachy in parts and story line was sub par. 3D was ok but not amazing. I almost fell asleep in this movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about 3 young flies who want to have adventure and follow it up. The signs are missing, I really don't care about these signs and feel that there was nothing to keep an adult interested. Pixar this is not. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more special 3D effects. I was also happy to see more air journals than my mother said, "Fly's Lord". Pretty sexist in showing the women as wives and fainting.
