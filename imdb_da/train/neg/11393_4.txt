Wow, I can't believe that people consider this a "good" movie. Now I have seen much worse, but there are much more romantic / fun comedies with John Cusack. <br /> <br /> At best, this is a mediocre movie. While the play was not terrible, but not good for a romantic comedy, there was little passion, little romance. There were many loose ends that did not appear or were not treated. Unfortunately, the main characters come out as complete cowards. They do not know themselves well enough to realize that they do not love the people they are engaged to. How do we know they are not in love? By the complete lack of remorse, both signs have to leave their finances. I can think of few things more romantic than the ongoing escape from engagement these two show. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't even end with a wedding scene, but probably both will get cold feet and lose each other as hot potatoes as a commitment approaches. This movie is really about two people who can't commit to anything, unlike Cusack's earlier characters, who were more than willing to make a deep commitment (Loyd in Say Anything, Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank etc). <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in this movie was the complete lack of any word or interest. When the film ended, I felt as though they hadn't got a climax for the story, which basically fits the whole movie: boring. No excitement as to whether the two will end together, no joy when they do, no consequences for their actions. It is boring that people are so blind to this film's proximity that they simply dispute any criticism with 'Everyone is too cynical!'. Criticism of this film is not cynicism, simply impartial investigation. There are many other better romantic comedies, even those with Grace Kelly or Eva Marie Saint. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is good, try these movies, your hearts will explode: Princess Bride, Say Something, Grosse Pointe Blank, High Faith, Keep Faith, Charade, Back Window, North West, or There is something about Mary (which is a good study of idealized romance vs today's society).
