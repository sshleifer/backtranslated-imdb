I give only 3 stars to the beautiful pictures of Africa. The rest was ... well boring. For about 50 minutes, we have outlined the plot ... In the war of the world, the initial part, oh, in 10 minutes? Then there was real action! It's something like, "Let's take a trip in the savannah and grab the beautiful sunsets!". And maybe deliver a message like "Don't Kill Elephants!". Very organic. I would have expected this out of a "new" Steven Segal movie, not from this ... The leading actress makes me think of artificial tan, colored hair and too much foundation! And I didn't see a scene where her hair is shaken, or she sweats, or her clothes are dusty. She just doesn't look like a 19th century woman! And in the bar where they seek our hero, Swayze comments to the commander that he resembles Dracula. Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896, and it became known in the years to come. Livingstone and other explorers went to Central Africa from 1840 to 1880. So unless the action takes place between 1896 and 1900, Houston, we have a problem. :) Swayze gives a good impression .. like a nutshell - hard on the outside, but soft and cozy on the inside. Not that I would cuddle with a nut, but you get points. He really manages to have the beaten puppy look at his face on several occasions. The film stank. Too long and increasingly boring. Don't see it! Don't Buy It! It's a waste of your money!
