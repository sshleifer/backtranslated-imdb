I would like this movie, yes it's a SAW, blah blah blah ripoff but I like these movies. If it was good, this had all the ingredients to be a good, not brilliant but good movie .... unfortunately these ingredients had been gone! The play was terrible and it was only seen when they caught being introduced with their prisoners one by one (caps taken off), the comments and a liners are just awful, yes I know writing bad .... but it's more than it was bad to write with bad acting. Two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until much further into the film ..... <br /> <br /> Sorry, I wonder why I was bothering to review this movie at all. <br /> <br /> I will end up with PLOT HOLES, PLOT HOLES & MORE PLOT HOLES! DISAPPOINTING!
