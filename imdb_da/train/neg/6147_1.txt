I really don't get all the admiration that this movie has received. It's scary, unnecessarily manipulative, and many of the big problems are being killed - ie. Nash's affairs and his sense of having sex with men in public places. I assume, in connection with a commercial Hollywood movie, only tolerable, but what is it about praise for Russell Crowe's performance? The man just seems to interfere, squeezes his folder and has a grungy hat and somehow seems to qualify as fine acting? Anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realize that Crowe's performance is slightly less than caricature. It is also quite offensive. And dare I say, right to be really horrible
