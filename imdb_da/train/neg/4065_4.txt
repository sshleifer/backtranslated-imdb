... through Eric Stanze's similarly minded antics. A not very talented instructor has hell a not very good movie, but I still found myself putting it through to the final credits if nothing but watching what happens next time. A rape escapes from the prison and calls its old flame. Having caught her (although she came willingly) and threatened her to have sex (another event she was also willing to do), he revealed that he had kidnapped three guys who had done her in vain before. He then decides to kill her (huh?) But is full and dies instead. The girl's mind snaps (or so) and she takes out her anger at the unfortunate jaws in the basement. <br /> <br /> Okay, the writing sucks: it's lengthy, loaded with ten cents and there's too much. <br /> <br /> The action sucks: what a minute, what is it? <br /> <br /> The movie sucks: home video is bad enough, but 20 minute cemetery recordings are just a marvelous insult. <br /> <br /> And the budget is a joke: get it ... 'budget', that was the battlefield. <br /> <br /> And yet, there was a charm to it. Back in the 70s, these kind of movies came out in theaters with actual budgets and talents attached to them, not this day and age though. If you want to see this kind of violent, sexually exploited garbage bin (don't lie, do some of us) then all you get is today. <br /> <br /> Some short hardcore shots in a sex scene, torture with fecal matter, fun with axes, anal rape by pin, and a long shot of the crazy chick masturbating with the same diet stick are some of the better things on the menu . It's not good and it won't be remembered, but not since Joe D'amato's thriving time, people have made movies like this. <br /> <br /> 4/10
