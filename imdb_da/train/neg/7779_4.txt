"True" story of a late monster appearing when an American industrial plant begins to pollute the waters. Entertaining, but not really good, monster movies have many people trying to get the monster and find out what's going on, but not in a completely involved way. Give it a point to give us a huge monster that they clearly built to scales for some scenes, but take a little away because it looks like a non-threatening puppy. A fun exploitation movie that is fun stupid in the right frame. (My only complaint is that the print used on the Elvira release is so poor that it looks like a well-worn video tape copy that was past its prime 20 years ago.)
