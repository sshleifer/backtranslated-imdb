We went into this movie because my husband had enjoyed the original version of 'My Favorite Martian'. We had our 6 year old daughter with us. She wanted to leave halfway through the movie, which was fine with both her parents! The parts we saw were only occasionally humorous, mostly either stupid or brutal. I would expect this movie to appeal to children between 9-12 if so. It is certainly not suitable for younger children. From what I've heard, the original series was much better, and if you want to "revive the past," you'll probably be disappointed.
