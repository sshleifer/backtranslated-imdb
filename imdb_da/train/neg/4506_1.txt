American filmmakers decided to make a movie that they think is Japanese. The characters are all badly represented, the actors are not even Japanese, and the set is cheap, unreal and does not represent Kyoto in the early 20s and 30s. Who ever read the book understands that the scriptwriters have not added any additional value to differentiate the movie from the script. Worse, they even changed the original plot line with a few goofs. Rob Marshall uses for his two main characters two well-known Chinese actors who previously came together in the crochet tiger-hidden dragon. Marshall probably saw a Chinese film and they represent Japanese culture. Watching these two actors together again makes the movie more ridiculous. Quentine Tarantino's last scene in Kill Bill # 1 is ten times more Japanese made than that of this movie.
