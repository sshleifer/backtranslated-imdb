I won't waste my time writing anything much more about how each aspect of this movie is indescribably bad. It has already been done in detail, many times over. 'The Plot started as a very uninspiring cockney wide-boy / gangster-by-numbers drilling and very quickly dropped into a complete shambles. Anyone pretending to see some hidden masterpieces in this horrible mess is just fun. It is now 7 or 8 years since I saw it during its 1 week driving at the cinema before it was pulled, but it sticks in my heart to be easily the most horrible movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I only make these comments, and the only reason I went to watch the movie is because of the entertaining fact that my brother Eddie appeared as the second "heavy" in the pub scene . It was his hands that printed a zippo lighter against Rhys Ifan's face at the bar in "Russia" (it was actually filmed at the former Butlins holiday camp at Barry Island). My brother has absolutely no acting experience - he had recently signed up for an extraordinary agency and that was his first part. After watching the movie, it turned out that no one in it required any acting experience at all. I remember there were about 8 people in the whole cinema - and it was just a few days after it was released. I have never heard of another movie that was so unpopular and disappeared so quickly - and rightly so. In case you were thinking of renting this movie on DVD, I would recommend you instead put your two pound coins in a fire until they are red and then jam them into your eye sockets. This will probably be much less painful than watching the movie.
