The package involves Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn pulling a big bank robbery, but that's not what I got out of it! I didn't get anything! In the first half there is a new character (without introduction) in all other scenes. The first half hour is completely incomprehensible, the rest is only a long, annoying, inferior chase scene. There is always an annoying sound in the background, whether it's a high-pitched look, a blaring siren, a train whistle or even the terrible score of Quincy Jones. There are many parts that are also ridiculously bad. Like the evil hunts Beatty on thin ice with a car! Or the police arrive at the scene about fifteen times. I really hated this movie!
