When will the evil stop? I will never see another version of a Christmas Carol again. They continue to make films with the same story and fall over each other when they try to make the movie better than the rest, but unfortunately it fails to do so, as it is not a good story. Moralistic, old-fashioned, conservative happy thinking. As if people are learning. The many different versions of this movie show that we do not.
