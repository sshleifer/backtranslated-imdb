Okay, so, somebody somewhere some years ago, thought it would be a good idea to make a 3D IMAX movie about some flies standing aboard the Apollo 11 and going to the moon. Then they did it. Someone, somewhere, was an idiot. <br /> <br /> I want to give the artists props to do their homework on the hardware. As far as I can tell, the rockets and launch machine were bang on. The graphics in general were pretty good - the rocket launch gave me chills, as a good rocket launch always does (my Popular Mechanics airplane gear head blood is still running strong) and the 3D was quite effective. CG was not Pixar quality, but it was generally good. The flies were quite mediocre anthropomorphisms, with some half-ass-late-60s signs thrown in for color (hippie flies, African American flies with giant aphrodisia and black shades, etc.) And the maggots were more like grubs with human baby heads (though they made appropriate brutal screaming sounds). The writers certainly did not do their homework as they stood on offensive and outdated clich√©s (60's gender policy, including mostly useless female characters, racial gestures, evil Russians, a bold fly that only wants to eat, grade-two level gross- out humor). In a movie directed at IMAX, they blew a wonderful opportunity to sneak into some educational content about physics and space travel - they didn't get their physics right (zero-g in the Lunar module during landing of burning? PLEASE.) They couldn't " t even be disturbed to read the original radio transcriptions between Houston and the astronauts, all of which are in the public domain; instead, they wrote their own dialogue that resembles crap. <br /> <br /> But we liked the skinny ones. <br /> <br /> They get half a point for rockets and maggots. Uh, yay. 1.5 / 5.
