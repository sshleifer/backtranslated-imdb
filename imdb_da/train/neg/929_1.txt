My wife and I like to rent really stupid horror / sci-fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh. We saw this at fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say that this movie is horrible, I mean it in a good way. Everything about it, acting, camera work, history, costumes, is just so wild and low budget, but it does so well. I believe in a scene that the actors looked as if they were actually in place. I really hope that the one who made this movie was not serious when they did, because if they were, it would just be sad. If you like to see really stupid horror movies just to have fun with them, then I recommend this one.
