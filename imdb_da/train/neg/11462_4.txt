I like monster movies, in general. Although they are unbearable and stupid. But it's hard to like this movie when it's so incredible and silly AND trying to take itself seriously all at the same time. Like in a really good way. <br /> <br /> While the idea is something that Orcas is known to kill the Great White Sharks, it's really hard to find it scary when I can't help but just see an angry Shamoo destroying thing. Especially the one scene where some buildings exploded the cause of the Orca does ... and as it explodes, the thing jumps out of the water and it felt like I saw a show at Sea World with fireworks. Plus they kill many of the scary moments before they even suggest they are going to happen. On top of that, it takes some jabs on JAWS. It's like "hi-look, we're factual, and we can come up with better reasons why Orca attacks". <br /> <br /> Yes, you are ignoring your outrageous **** ups in the logic of course. But JAWS had one thing your movie doesn't do. It's scary. Yes it is impossible. Yes it is something outrageous. But frankly, in fact, or not, a Killer Shark is not nearly as scary as a big white. And the bad attempt at character development and writing just makes it bad. Even JAWS The Revenge is frightening than this.
