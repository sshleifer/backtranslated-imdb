This is not just a bad movie, it is one of the worst movies ever. It's so bad that I found it fun. The play, oh my god, the script, you should be kiddin '. how can you imagine the writer coming up with things like: - a kid doing fireworks in school, fireworks so powerful that when someone gets hit it flies a hundred yards back and explodes. -A girl is trapped in the cells, the killer tries to open the door. She gets an exercise, but the cord is not long enough. She first makes an extension cord, oh horror, and then when she is done, she drills through the door and exercises through the head of the killer. WOW - and there are many more examples. Oh yes, and what happened to George Kennedy, he used to be great (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot / Cool hand Luke)
