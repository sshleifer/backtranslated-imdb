Charged with fine actors, I expected much more from "fraudsters" than was delivered. The reason is extremely constructed and manipulative. The many feedbacks only add to the confusion. The credibility flies out the window and at the end becomes unbearable and even ridiculous. I would strongly advise anyone who likes their movie areas to be based on something that is at least possible to avoid "fraudsters" because you become very frustrated. Maybe I'm just not hip enough to get it, but my suspicion is that many others were completely confused by the story and especially by the end. Blur of the line between reality and lies simply does not work because the whole movie didn't make sense. - NOTE
