This is my first movie review on IMDb. I was forced to register after watching this movie. I cannot in good conscience allow this movie to be reassessed by me. People must be warned! <br /> <br /> First of all, my rating is: 0 (as in "zero") I love Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Rachel Weis and Christopher Walken, and yet I hated this movie. There is a plot, but who cares when there is no script. The dialogue is unreal and simple boring, the situations are constructed, the flow of events is slow and somewhat arbitrary, the signs are unsympathetic and uninteresting, and the story, though based on a good premise, is stupid. This movie is a piece of poo. <br /> <br /> Don't forget to waste money on this movie, it's not even worth spending your time watching it. Please don't see it ... I ask for you!
