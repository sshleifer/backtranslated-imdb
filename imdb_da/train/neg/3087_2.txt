A group of extremely unlikely A-holes are plagued by lame dolls that some older shower bags by night watches have kept locked away in a movie vault for twenty years without any reason. Many people know this movie only from MST3K's spot-on ribbing of the girl. But I have seen the actual movie and can certainly say that yes it is bad, really, really bad. From one of the most horrible "battle scenes" I have ever witnessed to the stuffed toy aliens suffering from a lack of movement (I had a My Pet Monster that was scary) right up to the terrible act (I had a mine Pet Monster, which was more charismatic) But it is said that Rick Sloan's "Vice Academy" movie is somehow trusting me, I have no earthly idea how much worse. This is not to suggest that this film is anything but crap, because it is not. Just throw it out there. Eye Candy: No nudity in the movie correctly, but there are 2 pairs of breasts in the DVD Introduction to the movie <br /> <br /> My character: D- <br /> <br /> Retromedia DVD Extras: Introduction by Jim Wynorski; Stills gallery; and Trailer for this movie
