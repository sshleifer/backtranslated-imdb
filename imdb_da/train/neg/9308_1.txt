This movie was definitely the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I've seen some pretty bad movies. I didn't like the way the movie was filmed. all the actors are unknown and it looks like a bunch of friends came together and decided to film their own movie. But it is absolutely terrible. I've never seen a worse movie. The story is so false, and I just found that it took a long time to get to the end of the movie. There was no plot, it looked like it wasn't planned before they started filming. The story is too strange. I didn't like how slow it took to get to the point in the movie. There was no point in filming this movie itself. If you are considering watching this movie, don't. You just waste your time.
