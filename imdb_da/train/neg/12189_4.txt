I am surprised that this film is rated so high, even though I should go with typical grading scale 71, is a c or d so maybe it's okay, but this movie was just a typical thriller except very slow and unrealistic. Not that a typical thriller is realistic, but one seemed to try, and yet the woman who was raped did not press charges because she did not want to be cross-examined in a court, even though she would put the man broken her arm beats crap out of her and raped her away for life, but also the protection of the lawyer for whom she had feelings, and his family not just random people she didn't even know. There were other similar issues with the movie, which would have been ok if there was any kind of morality to take away from the movie, but they get moral issues as if it were right to try to kill / beat Kady before he did anything illegal was presented a little one-sided since Kady ended up being just a bile bastard bent on revenge so sure the lawyer was entitled to protect his family since waiting for Kady to actually rape her daughter so he could do something legal if it were a little absurd. So now I've just washed more of my life to this silly movie, so be so happy to see it, at least life won't be waist and that way my 2 1/2 hours has meant something.
