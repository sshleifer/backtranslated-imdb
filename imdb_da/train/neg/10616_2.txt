Dire. Just grim. The scripture is constructed, the acting painful, and the story just pulls together. It is undoubtedly a party of Sally Potter and a little bit more. It wouldn't be that bad, but she's the film's director, writer, and star, and it's just self-glorification. I didn't find myself worried about the evolving romance between the two main characters, and the end didn't come too soon. It has two redemption functions. Firstly, many shots are really lovely, especially in Paris, and look pretty good in black and white. Secondly, whether you're a fan of tango or not, the music is pretty much excellent (except where Sally starts singing). Watch this movie at your own risk or if you need an accidental grin. I'm sure it appeals to someone. Statistically, it must.
