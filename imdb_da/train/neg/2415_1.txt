... you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, DO NOT LIVE THIS MOVIE. If you want a documentary-esquire look at "hood life", you are also in the wrong place. If you're looking for a ridiculous piece of film, this is a real winner! The action is as flat as a piece of paper. The best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the drive-city. I can tell he also made the voice of the 911 operator with his flat tone. If I could hear a cardboard speech, it would sound like this guy. Oh yes, and the "zombies" did their best snake impressions that are on par with their AWESOME acting superiors (note sarcasm ... HOW DID IT NOT BE AN OUR FOR THE BEST MAKEUP) Quiroz ...... didn't do anyone form of management. I felt like I saw an improvisation period (the period is more like the 1990s LA) However, the direction is one-uped by the worst script I ever think grace a movie. I haven't heard such lovely lines as the epic one word that begins with the movie "F ** k!", Since the Ice Grill, which was another "urban" thriller. This of course only works in connection with the epic hip hop soundtrack too! All 3 or so songs of it! All in all, what do you expect from a movie entitled "Hood of the Living Dead"? I rented this movie with the full intention of laughing at its every scene, and boy it delivered and more! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to get along with a bunch of guys and laugh at a low budget horror (yes really ...) movie for the night. A memorable experience for sure!
