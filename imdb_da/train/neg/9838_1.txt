This movie is horrible. Decent battle scenes or not, the play is really bad as you can tell that they are reading their lines from a map. With painful line delivery by everyone in the cast. Think of watching a high school play and cringing on the obvious lack of smoothness in the actor's interactions (strange breaks between lines of characters combined with rush line delivery from others). If the movie was all the action, it can be forgiven, but much of the movie contains plot setup and Family Guy style, irregular cut aways (oh, wow, they are poorly finished). I suppose they were trying to be fun with these, but it came back as a bunch of high school students / college entry students who are leaving for the afternoon trying to create a fun Youtube clip. <br /> <br /> Now to the fight scenes. They are not that bad, considering the level of quality seen everywhere else in the movie. Nothing good either, certainly not everywhere at the same level as other posters have stated (Nothing like the Drunken Master). The battles have an overly staged feel, with lots of cuts at different angles with blatantly different positions of those involved. <br /> <br /> Overall, the only reason to watch this movie is if you were one of the guy's friends involved in this very, very cheap production. Which guy can you ask? Oh, the same guy who wrote, directed, produced and stared at this middle school masterpiece.
