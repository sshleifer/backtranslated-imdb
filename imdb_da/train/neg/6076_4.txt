In the fantasy, Robert De Niro plays Gil Renard. Or is it Travis Bickle? or Rupert Pupkin? Or Max Cady? You see the problem with this type of role is that De Niro has played very similar characters in TAXI DRIVER, KING OF COMEDY and CAPE FEAR, and unfortunately the characters were better developed and had better scripts. I found it a little hard to believe that Renard would have started as a frustrated obsessive sports fan to be an out and about psycho. The character arc is not the only problem with this script - it also lacks a character focus (A problem I had with UNTOUCHABLES where De Niro should have been great but ended up a little flat), for several stretches of the movie, I continued to believe that Bobby Rayburn was the protagonist, so the story changes back to Renard. It also seems to have disappointed many sports fans who seem to think that this should have concentrated a little more on baseball. I'm not sure if this was supposed to appeal to baseball fans initially, but again there are elements that it might have if the manufacturers made their opinion, have to whom and what the story should focus on <br /> <br /> I will admit that I was entertained by the fans (especially the soundtrack), but it is a very flawless movie and it must be remembered that characters in the mid-1990s were stalked by nutters as in SIMPLE WHITE WOMAN, UNLAWFUL ENTRY etc. Was out of steam long ago
