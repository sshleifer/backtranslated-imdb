One can deal with historical inaccuracies, but this film was just too much. Almost nothing was even close to the truth, and even for the era it was considered silly. For the defense of Ford, it was revealed in an old talk show that he was working on the story that told him of the genuine Wyatt Earp, who was apparently old, senile and played the scene his own way. Earp told the director about the stage coach and how it was planned to happen during stagecoach arrival, so despite what other historians claim, Wyat himself claims it was biased. <br /> <br /> This film depicts Earp as an honest man and also his brothers. The story doesn't exactly say they were or were not. Most people like to deposit a little bit of fraud and lawlessness into their characters, but it's nothing new. The truth is probably closer to those who are the law of the law GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL. Men who saw it as a career and believe in me in the Old West, did not have the time to think too much else. Signs that do not exist, characters depicted dying on the corral which really did not make this a weaker movie. It is further weakened by mature, who really did not make a convincing doc. He may be the worst cast choice ever for Doc, but at the same time, we must remember that older films were closer to the era and closer to a sense of truth. After all, ford information got first hand from Wyatt earp. It is also weakened by the so predictable events involving the Mexican girl. Hollywood was very pro Nazi these days and ready to kill brunette women in a very predictable way to show their patronage to Hitler idealism. This happens in most movies until the eighties. It is no excuse, however, and cheaply does the art. <br /> <br /> The actors playing Earps are doing well, and Brennan is always a thrill. In fact, ripeness can be the only working disadvantage of this flick. Still, it's the weakest of the old OK Corral movies.
