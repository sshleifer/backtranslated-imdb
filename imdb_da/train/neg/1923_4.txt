Ironic at Dr. Seuss's fable emphasizes the non-commercialization of Christmas should be one of the most hyped, promoted and successful blockbusters of the holiday season. The general feature of Ron Howard's adaptation is that Grinch's path toward Christmas stems from an early childhood event and that Whos himself is caught up in materialism's season, hidden from Cindy Lou Who (played very well by Taylor Momsen). This movie makes a glowing, ambitious attempt to capture the wackiness and sentiment of Seuss's history, but the end result is a movie that lurches and never completely packs the emotional battle of Chuck Jones animated version. Jim Carrey is remarkable in his performance as the devilish Grinch, but whether it's the dialogue, pacing, or alien stories built on the original plot, the transformation from bitter misery to merry charity just doesn't convince. There are some wonderful visuals, and the makeup work is great, but besides the technical triumphs, there is an element or two missing here. Succinctness <br /> <br /> Soul? <Br /> <br /> Or maybe Jones made the original adaptation too good in his 25-minute cartoon that Howard lacks in a movie that feels three hours long. Howard, Carey and the crew are all very talented and talented, but what seems to be a winning combination is just weak and plodding into its final product. If you want to see the version of the feature length, rent it on video with the Jones animated version, and you can see where bigger and glitters aren't always better. I give this movie three cans of Who-Hash out of five.
