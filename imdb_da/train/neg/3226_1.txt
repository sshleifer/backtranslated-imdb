We have reached the loft for obscenity with this movie. Basically, the dinosaurs come aboard this ship, launched by some weird old speeds called Neweyes (which I needed when I watched this movie). Apparently, Neweyes hears the children's desires everywhere and decides that he should give the child's wish that dinosaurs be brought in modern times to be seen by all for shameless exploitation. The dinosaurs eat these things that make them wiser (for badly the writers did not). By the way, it seems odd that out of ALL the wishes of the kids in the world, Neweyes gives the desire to bring dinosaurs to modern times? Why not give the children a desire to stop famine? Disease? War? I mean, come on! Does Neweyes have nothing better to do with all this power he has ??? Finally, when the dinosaurs come to modern times, they begin to sing, dance and destroy chaos (basically the kind of things you can look at a bad LSD trip, I mean where else you can see a T-Rex playing golf and jumping on a balloon of Spider-Man?). They end up in the circus and Neweye's Brother Screweyes (???) make the kids who have befriended the dinosaurs signed an empty contract. Why? Why should children sign an empty contract ??? Screweyes says that if the dinosaurs take something ... "Brain-Drain" That he'll let the kids go. The dinosaurs instead of breaking down the evil Screwey's limb from the limb, giving up and accepting his terms. What?! This is stupid! They could just have threatened him, causing him to lose the contract, eat it and then go with the kids. I think the filmmakers tried to show that the violence is bad, which is a moot point when finally the dinosaurs flee and a bunch of crows carefully screweyes and apparently eats him. Oh yes it is not at all violent! We're back makes no sense, it's not fun, it's cool, it's stupid, poorly written and contains some of the biggest plot holes ever required to film. Even for a child's movie ... it's BAD.
