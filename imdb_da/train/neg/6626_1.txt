I saw the movie and I was screwed because the movie was silly and boring. I thought ram gopal hot would justify his work, but unfortunately he failed and the whole movie was spoiled and they spoiled "sholay". the castrator and the crew were poor. the whole theater slept while watching the movie some people running away in the middle. amithab bachan trades is poor, i thought this movie will be the biggest hit of the year but this movie will be this year's biggest flop. no one was entitled to their work, including Ajay Devagan. this movie does not deserve any audience. I bet this movie will flop. <br /> <br /> "FINALLY THIS MOVIE SUCKS"
