This is one of the most hilarious bad movies I've ever had the privilege to see. <br /> <br /> I watched this on a DVD with a bunch of friends on a Friday night, and we just couldn't stop laughing from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough: Terrorists hijack a convoy that they believe carries uranium quality, but it actually carries a bunch of man-eating dinosaurs. Easy error making. Cue an exciting incompetent Army Special Forces team to tackle the prehistoric animals. They are led by Colonel Rance, played by Scott Valentine; a man who seems to have perfected 'Smell the Speed' that Joey's Friends prefer. <br /> <br /> There are lots of gore and a horrible mass shot, but unfortunately, Rance's team seems to have a problem aiming their weapons in the general direction of a horde of giant, lumbering monsters. Also, the lights always seem to flicker and go out when a Velociraptor attacks (presumably so we can't see how bad the creativity effects are). Having said all that, we all had a great deal As a Jusassic Park / Aliens style action adventure, this movie stinks worse than a dinosaur step, but as ridiculously heavy in cheek entertainment it is a roaring success.
