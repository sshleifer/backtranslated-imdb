Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal are already preparing a sequel to a young American corporal in Afghanistan. He also seems to be a highly qualified surgeon and roaming freely around Kabul, operating on wounded NATO soldiers. On a particularly difficult mission, he randomly picks up a sniper rifle and shoots Osama Bin Laden from a distance of approx. 3000 meters. He's finally encouraged the sergeant, but can't decide between a sniper and a surgeon's career, so he finishes completely from the army. A year later, frustrated with the civilian life, he goes to the Navy and the last scene shows him proudly wearing a white uniform.
