I read Tom Robbins' self COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES as a teenager. I loved every word. It was sexy, fun and full of glamorous scenes and beautiful writing. But when I saw the movie, I couldn't believe what a boring, sour, joyful piece of junk it was. How did this happen? I think someone in Hollywood read this book and filed it under "GAY PRIDE - WOMEN - LESBIANS." (It is the subject's headline of the library's congress.) Now all over 12 who read the book know that it has nothing to do with real lesbians, more than STAR WARS is about real space travel. The book was obviously - and I mean OBVIOUSLY - written by a heterosexual man who loves the IDEA of lesbians (in naked all the time) but never really met one. <br /> <br /> Still, anyone in Hollywood said "uh oh, give it better to a gay instructor or gay people will make trouble." Then they gave it to Gus Van Sant. Nothing against the man, but - though Gay he can really be - he has no idea how to make a funny movie. Gus Van Sant took a straight man's playful fantasy of guilt-free girl / girl action and male voyeurism turned it into a boring, literally minded Lesbian Power Recruiting Poster. It's like transforming an Oscar Wilde comedy into an Arthur Miller tragedy. Not beautiful. The most important idea that Gus Van Sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the incredibly bad casting. His mockery made him hire the very best. His ignorance of the novel's real subtitle (a straight man's fantasy, not a gay pride recruiting poster) made him make choices that were not only bad but bizarre. <br /> <br /> Let's meet with the casting of self COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES. <br /> <br /> PAT MORITA as "THE CHINK" Okay, there are few name recognition Asian players. And Pat Morita, in HAPPY DAYS, was pretty funny. But threw him as CHINK was wrong, wrong, wrong. Pat Morita has no idea that Chink is a very funny man. (Gus didn't say that to him.) Pat didn't seem to know that Chink is. . . Well, SEXY !!! In the book he is not wise old Mr. Miyagi. He's more like Hugh Hefner! He is a striped old goat and he knows a lot about the comfortable and responsive Sissy and Bonanza Jellybean. (You see in the book, they are not really lesbians. Do you get it is a straight man's imagination yet?) <br /> <br /> JOHN HURT as "COUNTESS." Okay, he's a gay friendly man. But he is a serious, shakespeare player !!!! You need someone who is fun and camp for this role. For John Hurt to be cast as a goofy guy as the Countess is tragic and sad. I expect Paul Scofield to walk all over dressed as Thomas More and unfortunately shake his head. "Richard, you know you've completely lost your soul. For shame, my former student!" And yes, John Hurt was fun (and pretty gay) like Caligula. But it was BLACK humor, not playful and breezy humor as the book. <br /> <br /> RAIN PHOENIX as "Bonanza Jellybean." No talent, no training, no problem. Apart from that in the book Bonanza is fun, playful, cheerful, (mostly) heterosexual and loving. In the film she is hungry, passive, expressive and boring. As for her taste for women, Robbins puts it like that in the book. "God knows I love women, but nothing can replace a man who fits." Uh, Gus? Have you read this book? <br /> <br /> UMA THURMAN as "Sissy Hankshaw." This is a tough role. In the book, Sissy is really an exceptionally passive and stingy heroine. Still, a more accomplished actress may have made a glimpse of her eye or a turn in turn to introduce some sort of hidden strength or hidden pleasure to her adventure. Uma doesn't pull it out, probably because Gus never told her that Sissy should be a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and big thumbs. Uma is playing it more like she's in a television movie about a girl dying from leukemia. <br /> <br /> This movie is sour and boring. And I blame you, Gus Van Sant!
