Jane Eyre_ is one of the greatest novels in English, and this scriptwriter should read it. I hate it when writers use Spark notes for what a novel is about. This movie is unbearable to see if you have read the book. <br /> <br /> The whole red room is so played that I wonder why they even like to put it in. In the book, the 'red space' is foreshadowing for the whole story and the rest of Jane's life. Helen Burns is treated so badly in the movie. I'm sure she was happy to die and leave early. In the book she is one of the most convincing characters, and she was not the red head. The whole Christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story Charlotte Bronte told it masterfully.
