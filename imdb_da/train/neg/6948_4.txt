An interesting idea (four African American women crushed under the boots heel of society, allegedly by robbing banks) is destroyed by F. Gary Gry's horrible slow direction and a creepy script (by Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier) filled with unintentional fun moments. Instead of giving a pointed comment on the role that city women are struggling to remain transhipped in a world where men are abusing and abusing men, Gray, Bufford and Lanier prefer to crumble their unsuspecting audiences with highbrow operative tragedy notions. It's the melodrama at worst. Gray has her actors linger over every tired line, and John Carter's lazy editing refuses to pick up the veil and instead chooses to keep the camera trained on the artist's confused faces. And they are confused: although actors such as Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fox have some raw talent (Queen Latifah is the fourth and as an actress she is an excellent rapper), they need a harder hand than Grays to lead them And as a result, they come out as sharp and uncomfortable in front of the camera. Stay away from.
