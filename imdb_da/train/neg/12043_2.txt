I like Brad Pitt. He is an actor with brains and whites, not to mention face, pectorals and the rest. Since I saw him in "Thelma and Louise", a thought has bothered me, who does he remember? "Troy" did it for me. He's the new Brigitte Bardot. The differences are obvious, of course. Man, Americans, etc. But Brigitte Bardot still comes in mind. He is so beautiful that he is the most effective when playing against it. "California" "12 Monkeys" "Fight Club" "Snatch" His self-defeating humor makes him human, almost accessible. Fortunately, "Troy" will soon be forgotten. Only photos with Pitt, semi naked in astonishing sprint positions, will decorate the walls in legions of savage fans. Strangely, "Das Boot" is one of the great films in the second part of the 20th century. What does Wolfgang Petersen do about this? Well, I suppose it would be very hard to say no to the chance to work with the new Brigitte Bardot.
