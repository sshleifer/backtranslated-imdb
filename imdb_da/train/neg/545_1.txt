This is just the usual Indian waste that is knocked out as a cinema, as Indians we can proudly boast of having the largest cinema industry, but it is also the worst. How can other poor countries have movies with real characters that challenge the views of their respective communities, and we continue to pump out waste. Take a look at Russia, Iran, China and Latin America, look at the amazing movies they have and we get shit like Kisna! <br /> <br /> Getting real people, no wonder, the international community generally laughs at Indian cinema.
