Those who are familiar with the two previous Cube films know pretty much what they can expect: a small group of people trapped inside a bunch of booby-trapped rooms, paranoia, bad acts ... This one, however, is slightly different . About half of the film takes place outside the cube, where we see the people see the people inside the cube (or at least five of them). I think Cube Zero aspires to explain what the dice are, but you really don't know much more than what was covered by the first two movies. Well, there is some kind of explanation in there, but it feels pretty lame compared to what was suggested in the first movie. The Cube Zero looks pretty cheap (like its predecessors) and the fact that it shows more than just a few empty rooms only emphasizes this feeling. I was also pretty sure to say that there is no risk that any of the players will win any prizes in the foreseeable future. They have brought back the traps from Cube 1, however (I mean, they are almost the same, which is a little shame). I know that many people really appreciate this movie and its ties to the first, but I just feel that it's a completely unnecessary contribution to a franchise that wasn't so good at first. [1.10]
