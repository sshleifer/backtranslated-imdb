In 2004 I liked it. Then it became very stupid. It suggests that the children are brain free. It offends children. Cartoon Network used to be great. One of the shows I liked was Hamtaro. It managed to be interesting and imaginative in its approach to kids programming. The show (Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends) is like putting 20 sugar in your sprite. It seems that today's television producers are only interested in making money, rather than engaging in children's imagination and making money! At the last minute my kids are set to the old shows (60s) to find something interesting to see. Perhaps, in the absence of originality, for television watching the past and reusing children's programming from day to day.
