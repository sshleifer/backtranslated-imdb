Don't waste your time watching this! Unless you want to study it for all the wrong things, you shouldn't do to make a good movie. I am not one to usually review a movie, but this one is personal. I wasted precious time that they cannot give back. I feel compelled to write this report to warn others not to waste their time watching this crap. If this was a student project, I shouldn't say bad, but only for the first 15 minutes ... after that it becomes annoying. the screaming, the bad sound, the bad video (a good camera man could have done much better). And yes, what about the Blair-Witch effect? no budget? I hoped it would be better, but it doesn't. Now how the hell deserved it a 4? 2 is fairer but 1 to waste my time! I have said my peace.
