A female singer named "Big T" - seriously, that's what they call her - risks her budding musical career and her life falling into the company with a shabby drunkard (Busey) who wants to be her leader. His mother committed suicide, his father is also an alcoholic, and he has a violent temper. You can imagine where it leads. Meanwhile, there is music that Parton, with its fluid vocal talents, belts out song after song (at least half a dozen of them on Texas). Avoid this mess and check her in NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS instead.
