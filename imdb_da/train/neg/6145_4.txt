Although I had seen "Gymkata" in a theater road back in '85, I could not remember any of the plot except for vague pictures of Kurt Thomas who ran and fought against a backdrop of stone walls and disappointment at the finish. <Br /> <br /> After reading some of the other reviews, I downloaded a copy of the newly released DVD to re-enter the world of Gymkata. It turns out that this is one of the films produced during the '80s that would go directly to video today. The movie star champion gymnast Kurt Thomas as Jonathan Cabot, recruited out of the blue to infiltrate the nation "Parmistan" to enter and hopefully win "The Game", a suicide blood sport sponsored by Khan, who encourages his people to shout what sounds as "Yak Power." The mission of the mission is the Star Wars defense system. Jonathan is trained in the martial arts of Princess Rubali, who never speaks or leaves the house. When trained, they try to interfere with the locals by wearing a bright red sweater with blue and white hyphens. Needless to say, Cabot finds himself driving and battling for his life along the Parmistans, on his way to a fate and the game. Star, Kurt Thomas was poorly served by director Robert Clouse, who it looks like, was never on the set. The so-called script is just this page of incompetence. See other reviews for the many howlers throughout. The city of crazies has a few good moments, but is ultimately destroyed by bad editing. The end ... meh. Still there is the germ of a good action adventure here. A Hong Kong version with more visceral action and faster pace can even be pretty good.
