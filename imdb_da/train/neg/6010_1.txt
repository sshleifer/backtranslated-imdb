This movie is perhaps one of the most boring movies in 2000 that I've seen! Especially the music fails to create excitement when people suddenly disappear. Also aspects such as fighting cases are not treated with the necessary seriousness. History itself has problems: The United Nations could never take power all over the world, as the United States alone would not allow it, but also nations such as China, Russia, Japan, etc. Neither would. This would also play against anyone trying to take over the world as Nicolae Carpathia does. This reminds me of James Bond movies, only that they have more action! Of course, the film is made for Christians and only for Christians, and they can enjoy it. Since I can't count myself a Christian, I find the whole idea ridiculous. Moreover, this prophecy seems to be dangerously close to other prophecies of cultures for the end of the world if they believed to be true. Why fear such an opportunity when we can make life as good as possible here on Earth without it
