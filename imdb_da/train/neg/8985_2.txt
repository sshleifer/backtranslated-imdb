Earlier comments encouraged me to check this out when it appeared on TCM, but it was a serious disappointment. Lupe Valdez is great but doesn't get enough screen time. Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette play well-known but promising characters, but the manuscript leaves them stranded. <br /> <br /> The film is about Egypt by Lee Tracy's character, which at best is a self-centered, physically and verbally abusive fool. The reactions of the "public" are poorly thought out and incredible, making "shenanigans" seem like a bad author's past. And it is credibility that the Lupe Velez character could fall for him. <br /> <br /> The "stinging one-liners" mentioned in another review must depend on the observer as I didn't even notice an experiment being made.
