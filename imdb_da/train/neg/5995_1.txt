This is a really horrible movie. What they've done is take a television show that was never aimed at young children and given the George Lucas treatment (that is, destroyed it by kiddifying it to appeal to the younger audience). OK so the Thunderbird TV show wasn't exactly the most cerebral of shows, in fact it was pretty formal, but it was always fun to watch (especially when the models were blown up) and the voice was not that bad. <br /> <br /> This suffers from bad casting and bad action (with the remarkable exceptions of Sophia Myles as Lady Penelope & Ron Cook as Parker who seem to be the only cast members who have a clue how their characters to be played) After this travesty I would not leave Frake's direct traffic. <br /> <br /> The whole point of Thunderbirds was that it was about the entire Tracy family and how they worked as a team, prevented disasters or rescued those involved in disasters. <br /> <br /> Avoid this rubbish like the plague. <br /> <br /> I only give it 1 out of 10 because a zero rating is not supported.
