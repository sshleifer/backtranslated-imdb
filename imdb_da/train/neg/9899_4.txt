Necessary ridiculous movie version the literary classic "Moby Dick". John Barrymore is Captain Ahab who falls in love with the pastor's daughter, Joan Bennett. His brother Derek is a rival for Mrs Bennett's feelings. When Mr. Barrymore loses his leg in a whaling accident, he rejects Bennett. He must kill the whale and win Bennett back ... There are several scenes that may have tense the 1930s theater audience; especially the scenes involve Barrymore losing his leg. However, the film is not aged well; There are much better movies from the time, both 1920s and 1930s talkies. The two name attractions, John Barrymore and Joan Bennett are not their best. <br /> <br /> **** Moby Dick (8/14/30) Lloyd Bacon ~ John Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Lloyd Hughes
