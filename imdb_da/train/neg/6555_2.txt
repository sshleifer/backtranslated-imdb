So the second night I decided to see Tales from the Hollywood Hills: Natica Jackson. Or Power, Passion, Murder as it is called in Holland. When I bought the movie I noticed that Michelle Pfeiffer was the lead in it, and I thought it had to say something about the quality. Unfortunately, it didn't. <br /> <br /> 1) The movie is very confusing. There are two story lines running simultaneously during the movie. Only they have nothing in common. Throughout the movie I waited for the moment that these two stories would come together, so the plot would be clear to me. But it still doesn't. <br /> <br /> 2) The title of the movie says the movie will be about Natica Jackson. Well it is sometimes. That said, the film covers two different stories, and the part about Natica Jackson is the shortest. So another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice. <br /> <br /> To conclude my story, I really recommend leaving this movie where it belongs to the shelf in the store in a place no one can see. By doing this you will not waste 90 minutes of your life as I did.
