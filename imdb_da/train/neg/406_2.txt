Buzz for this movie has always been about the amazing graphics that make Kevin Bacon disappear. Unfortunately, they stopped there. They should have continued to make the script disappear, so the stupid set and finally every visible element in this movie.

I think they bought this script on "Scripts-R-Us" where you buy a standard empty "Monster Movie" script and just fill in the topics. There is a monster stalking us. Let's split up. (They "let's split" into this movie). Hit Alien / Giant bug / Monster / Invisible man with crowbar. Not dead yet. Burn Giant Rabbit / Shark / Invisible Man in Inevitable Fire. Not dead yet. You know the common things. Even the smallest number of items specific to an invisible male film (IR glasses, spraying with something like paint) were handled poorly. <br /> <br /> It is sad that there were many opportunities to be a fascinating movie. The psychological issues for the subject, the deterioration of the mind due to the process, the treatment of an invisible subject and many other ideas were touched for usually less than 2 seconds and would have been much more interesting. Had there been a desire to save Kevin Bacon in the end, it would have been a much better movie. All in all, it stuck. <br /> <br /> I would like to mention some of the incredibly stupid items at the end of the movie, but I won't do any spoilers. Suffice it to say that these signs are so stupid that they are not thinking of pulling the plug on a machine instead of ...
