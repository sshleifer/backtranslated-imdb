I had never thought that the standard of Yashraj movies would ever break down to such an extent! The film has a nonsense story that does not interest. <br /> <br /> Saif has acted over. Kareena has improved her figure, yet it is not a good actress. Akshay is good. Anil is also good. May I say that the role was not good. <br /> <br /> Great affordability is completed. Wondered whether it should be the movie's "comedy part". Just because last few movies were flops, does that mean that Yashraj movies should make this kind of nonsense? It has a story with so many good movies. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was totally disappointed with the movie.
