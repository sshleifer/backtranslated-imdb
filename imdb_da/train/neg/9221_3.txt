All you need to know about this movie happens in the first five minutes: it looks cool, it has a solid original soundtrack that reflects the late 60s, and anything but a couple of its characters are unlikeable. Once you've got the message, you might as well switch to another movie. Davies protagonist ignores his beautiful girlfriend, one of the few people in his life who cares about him. So at that time, he can afford to join her in the real world - instead of living a fantasy film as he is the imagined director - by pushing her aside and mating with an actor, he is idealized for no reason. A few laughs and some thought-provoking artifacts are the only things worth seeing here. <br /> <br /> The movie is also interesting as evidence of Jason Schwartzman's fall from Mount Rushmore. In Rushmore, Schwartzman's annoying brattiness was something to overcome, but here it is his character's only quality. Schwartzman's family relationship clearly landed him in this role; Here, his choice hopes to improve.
