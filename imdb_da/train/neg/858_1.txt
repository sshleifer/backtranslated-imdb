I hate this movie! It was nothing like the book, and just thinking about it makes me angry. If you watch the movie before you read the book, then yes, it's a good movie. But the king's book was AMAZING, and this movie was nothing like it. I mean, the general meaning can be kind of similar, but most aspects of the movie are quite different. For example, the end! So in the book it is extremely intense, and Danny and Wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes. but in this horrible movie version jack like them goes through a stupid maze ... yes, there is no maze in the book and there is no need for it. Another part that made me angry was that the jack kills Mr Halloran! What dunk, he's basically in the book, and they just kill him as if he wasn't important. All in all, it was just bad that the movie was so extremely free.
