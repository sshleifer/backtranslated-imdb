My mother worked with Dennis L. Raider for eleven years, not to mention an office with him. When it was announced, he was BTK, she was shocked. The whole day was just her to tell stories about how she would never have seen him as Wichita Killer. I've heard her tell them many times. I asked her about a lot of things and went to all the interviews she was asked to go to. I've read the entire book written about Raider, Wichita is my hometown, and I was surprised that such things could happen in Kansas. <br /> <br /> There was another BTK movie on TV a long time ago, and I thought this would have been better to portray Dennis' murder, maybe even get some smart touches on his motives. I'm going to be very stupid with the errors in this movie. This is based on my mother's portrayal of him, all my readings on him and the video tapes I've seen of him speaking. <br /> <br /> First of all, the camera angles were terrible. It looked like it had been shot on a home video camera. The action was horrible and I couldn't even see it. <br /> <br /> Dennis Raider never had long hair. Dennis Raider was a "very anal man" and was a "follow rule book" kind of guy. He was not as good as the film made him look, he was very polite and abrupt, business. The same goes for his killing, as far as we all know. If you've seen his confession in court, you can already guess. <br /> <br /> And with regard to occupation with the slaughterhouse? No. Never have I read or have Dennis Raider confessed to having a problem with animal cruelty or people who are squishing bugs. In fact, he practiced cats and dogs for choking. Yet throughout the film, he put animals in the faces of his victim and appeared to be concerned about their well-being. <br /> <br /> Dennis Raider never killed the people he knew he admitted, but in the movie in his first killing he tells the lady he knows her too. <br /> <br /> I really don't want to go into this movie and I'm already ranting. This is NOT what you want to see if you are interested in BTK's current events. This is NOT what you want to see if you want a good horror movie. If you want a badly shot half-porno with some slaughter scenes, then this is your kind of movie.
