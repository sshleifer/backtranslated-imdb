First of all, I just want to say that I love this show !!! But this episode ... this episode makes a mockery of the whole show. <br /> <br /> I don't know what they were trying to do with this episode, but they successfully created the WORST episode in the whole series. There is no history line, everything is chaotic and the jokes ..... are shit. How they tried to answer some of the remaining issues in the game. .... For example, "how furlings look" by creating the stupid "earlier on ..." ...... is simply embarrassing. Obviously, the authors run out of ideas and it's really too bad.
