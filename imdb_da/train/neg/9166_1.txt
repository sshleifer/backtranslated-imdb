Recherche is a good word to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> Let's say each movie has a selling point, a gimmick. Transformers' gimmick are the amazing effects as well as fan boys nostalgia. Sleepless in Seattle's gimmick is situational in their tag line, "What if someone you've never met, someone you never saw, someone you never knew was the only one for you?" Many romances are heavily dependent on these gimmicks and some common drawings of big names. Leap Years both use the Irish folklore as circumstances and with well-known names in the country. So now the audience is in the cinema besides all the usual elements of signs, conflict or consequences, crisis, release and degradation, they also look forward to stimulating dialogue, more absorbing situations as a result of the leap years, interesting subplots and perhaps to some extent a good twist in the middle or at the end of history that favors the characters of the characters. <br /> <br /> That's what Jean Yeo is not trying to achieve. If they tried to, their targets were apparently in the other court at the second stadium on the other end of the planet. She and her author, Alain Layrac, failed to provide a stimulating dialogue. Most of the lines were constructed. It seems that they have a bag full of lines that she wants to use in her movie: "Okay, these are the lines and quotes I've heard or read from either movies I've seen or books I have read before and they sound good to me.If they sound good to me, they will sound good to the audience. Therefore all I have to do is piece them all, I need them all. "The result is cathartic. I can't say the lines were unnecessary and didn't have any relation to the story or to the plot, but they seem to be jumping out of nowhere and catching you with those quotes. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I know people who quote quotes based on most situations in our dialogue and try to make them meaningful to themselves as they nod together. I'm not going out with them anymore because the urge to beat them is overwhelming. <br /> <br /> Second, the portrayed portraits are stupid and one-dimensional. With the exception of the unnatural dialogue involving their motivation (necessary to drive the plot), there was no sense of conviction in them. I have no idea who they are. They are all simpleton's spouting lines from the council column in a female oriented magazine. <br /> <br /> The gimmick in the leap years is not enough to drive the story because circumstances are too low. So again there are movies with less, but fared better than this, there is not. They made it up with my first and second point. In addition, the subplots are inappropriate (not a bad thing for movies) and thin (bad things). Jean Yeo and the producers are trying to leave the horrible plot with fancy places and passable photography. This is because they probably understand that it is possible and easier to obtain approval from some viewers than the others with the good use of film, soundtrack and movie scene. These non-discerning viewers. <br /> <br /> It's not even the kind of movie that's so bad that it's good. It's just bad. Don't look at this.
