Have you ever seen a movie made entirely of long wide shots? None? Me neither. Now I've finally seen one in "Spring in my hometown", and I have to admit, now I know why people don't do this. The technique is "arty" to be safe, but it is certainly not ripe for public consumption. The technique is highly flawless, simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters, and perhaps it is the director's full intention. I don't know I can't read mind, and I certainly don't know enough about the director to decide a verdict. <br /> <br /> But one thing about this movie that is painfully obvious is ridiculous anti-American feelings. As Americans, I am very aware of my country's participation in the Korean War, and I am very aware that we were not always angels, but I will be cursed if I take this guy's version of how things happened. According to this blind fool, the Americans were not only in the root of the war, we were the cause of the war, and we almost destroyed the country. No matter what, Mr. Director. And I suppose you still wanted to make this movie in COMMUNIST KOREA if we hadn't disturbed, didn't you? Talk about forgetting your story. This is almost akin to making the Nazis the "good guys" while the Allied forces become the "evil guys". This movie is so historically naive and so in fact incorrect that it's almost embarrassing to see. For a man who comes from a country that owes its very existence to American interference, he surely comes out as tall and mighty and judgmental.
