Steven Seagal seems to be asleep through a horrible movie shot almost completely to hide the complete lack of budget and resources. Choosing the Technical Flaws - Silver F / A-18 and F-14s take off from an airline to a strike and miraculously camouflaged F-16s to the actual strike - would give this movie more credibility than it deserves. Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles that fall on and disappear in a lightning strike, which is probably available to all Final Cut Pro users. To put all your creativity to your own credit puts Michael Keusch in the same category as Marcel Mandu.
