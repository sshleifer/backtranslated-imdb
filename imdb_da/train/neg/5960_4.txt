My friends and I rented this to "Bad Movie Night" with great hopes, but The Brain was something of a letdown. The brain itself is brilliant creeping, but it mostly sits just on its small platform. Who thought it would be cool that the brain only munch on three people over 94 minutes? This movie has a number of things going for it at first, including an Estevez knockoff leader who plays a rebellious genius (we are told that his vast intellect is misdirected in his elaborate pranks and school stunts that include put krazy glue on a person's chair). It also has some beautiful lines, a hilariously crafted and exhale craftsman who just barely manages to be anywhere, and yes, some chick gets naked. The director desperately needs some schooling in pacing art. During the latter half, it just begins to pull on and off, with at least 3 or 4 meaningless, boring scenes that make up the center of the plot. The scenes inside the PRI complex are particularly bad. At least 15 minutes in this movie are people who run up and down the same stairwell. I could have directed the manuscript to this thing in half an hour - more cheese, more fun, more nudity, more brain action. If you want to make a bad horror movie, at least give me something cold to watch while my superego shuts down. Perhaps the director really tried to bring the audience into his movie - I started to feel like one of the zombie city-dwellers at the end of this crap party.
