I usually do not take the time to make comments that few people will read about movies will see. But in this case, I feel I have to warn all those who might be thinking of wasting time on it. I just finished seeing it only five minutes ago. This is simply one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The action is horrible, a plot is non-existent, and production values ​​are at best poverty level. I know that even a low-budget movie can be great, but not this one. There are only things that could have saved this movie for any kind of horror fan - more on the screen doing and slashing! The sum of three times this happens is off-screen. While it is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens - especially the end scene - there is simply not enough of it. The film is just too long because it is minimal content, for dialogue heavy and therefore almost impossible to see. What's going on? To put everything in a nutshell with space to save, three teenage girls go irresponsibly and deliberately and run through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered. Of course, their car breaks down and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people - one of whom is the psychotic killer. All three are eventually murdered, one by one, off-screen, by what seems like an eternity of boring, slow nonsense. As I said, the only things worth seeing are the murders. Please don't buy it or rent it just for that, and don't be fooled as I was at the misleading box and movie description. Save your money and your time.
