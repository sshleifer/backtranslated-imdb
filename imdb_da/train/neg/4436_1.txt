I gave this movie a rating of 1 (Awful). The only reason it even has to get a 1 instead of a big -0 is Ben Kingsley, who always shines nothing, what terrible material has thrown his way. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino is so out of her element here as a viewer you simply cannot get over the fact that she is right in such a piece. <br /> <br /> Stupid, stupid story and horrible production. DO NOT waste your video rental $.
