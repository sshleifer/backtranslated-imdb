The expectations were somewhat high for me when I went to watch this movie, after all, I thought Steve Carell couldn't do anything wrong coming out of amazing movies like Anchorman, The 40 Year Old Virgin and Little Miss Sunshine. Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I start with what fits this movie: Steve Carell has to be Steve Carell in some respects. There are a handful of moments in the movie that made me laugh, and it is almost exclusively because he got the wiggle room to do his thing. He is an undoubtedly talented person, and it is a shame that he signed it, which turned out to be a total train wreck. <br /> <br /> With that out of the way I will discuss what went terribly wrong. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Dan Burns, a three-girl widower who is being considered for a nationally syndicated counseling column. He prepares his girls for a family reunion, where his extended family gather for some time. <br /> <br /> The family is high on top of things that make this a horrible movie. No family behaves like this. It is almost as if they have been transported from Pleasantville or to Beaver. They are a caricature of what we think a family is when we are 7. It reaches the point where they become brave and simply frustrating. Touch football, crossword puzzle competitions, family bowling and talent shows are not where real people have. It's almost sick. <br /> <br /> Another big mistake is the woman to whom Carell is due. Observing her in her first scene with Steve Carell is like seeing a stroke victim trying to be rehabilitated. What I imagine should be unique and original in this woman coming out as mildly delayed. It makes me think that this movie is going on another planet. I left the theater and wondered what I was doing. After thinking more, I don't think it was much.
