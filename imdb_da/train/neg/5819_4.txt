This is a story of a Jewish dysfunctional family. The parents are divorced, and mother gets back east in the house. Father Murray Abromowitz moves with his children to California and moves around Beverly Hills so his children can get the best education. <br /> <br /> It gets really fun when Marisa Tomei, Murray's niece, comes to live with the group. <br /> <br /> The movie deals with the family's various adventures complicated by the drug scene in the affluent neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Jessica Walter costs like a woman who wants Murray to move into her as she wants a companion. <br /> <br /> Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno come to the end. They play Murray's brother and sister-in-law respectively; they are also parents of Tomei. In front of the kids, Reiner resolves to think Murray that he has paid the bills for them all the time. The movie ends with a sour note as the embarrassed family moves out of their beautiful tombs and takes to drive around Beverly Hills in their car. I guess the film promotes independence and some good old self-esteem.
