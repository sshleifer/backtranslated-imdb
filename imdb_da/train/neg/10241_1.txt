This is an incomprehensibly terribly low budget piece of horror. I don't even have the vocabulary to say how horrified, agitated, boring, confusing and even odd that this effort is (Hey what you know I ....) Seen in a post-apocalyptic America some guys meet at a beach, and slaughter and chaos are followed - it was so incomprehensible that I could not make the head or tail of any of it. <br /> <br /> Seriously how this was picked up by National Lampoon strikes me completely: it's really terrible. <br /> <br /> And it's not that bad, it's a good cool way. <br /> <br /> It's just terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible. <br /> <br /> Honestly. If you still don't believe in me, look with all intentions to love it, then come back and tell me what you think. Even gerbils on acid could not hope to understand this. Avoid or even better destroy ...
