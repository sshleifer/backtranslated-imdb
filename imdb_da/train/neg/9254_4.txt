Resnais, wow! The genius that brought us Hiroshima Mon Amour takes the challenge of making a French musical music from the 1930s in vivid color. The open voice-over with old, decorated inter-titles was a nice touch. Then, the camera opening (like the old hand screws) opens on a black and white poster. The camera turns off (or rather up), which suddenly shows us the surprisingly brilliant colors in an elegant table set for a tea party. This is all in the first 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> The music starts. A pretty banal and forgettable diddy with a convincing chorus of 3 girls blabbering some nonsense that has no relevance to the movie (and yes I speak French so I can't blame it on the subtitles). These characters jump out of the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgettable song. Then they leave, and finally Audrey Tautou looks out, and we hear our first noticeable dialogue for 15 minutes in the movie. I'm not sure what Resnais intends to start with such a sparkling waste of time and musical cacophony. But the effect on the viewer is to get you tossed on the screen and storm out. I endure. <br /> <br /> It didn't get much better. I'll tell you why. There is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters. We do not even see their faces half the time (as Resnais seems appropriate to show the expensive landscape to worry about the actual people in front of the camera). People fly on and off the stage as mills around a lamp, and we audiences are unable to focus on a particular person or plot. It's like taking every episode of Brady Bunch and slamming it into a 2-hour movie. With bad songs. The only thing that kept me as long as I did (1 hour) was that I looked at camera techniques, lighting and nature, which I all admit, excellent. But is it enough to keep your attention for 2 hours? Not me. Maybe tomorrow I will try to see the end. Oh, who I'm kidding. I have more important things to do. You are sure too. Skip this.
