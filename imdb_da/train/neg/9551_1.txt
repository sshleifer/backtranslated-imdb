This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I wish I could travel back in time and do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Find out where "movie" "War Games-The Dead Code" was filmed 2) See the original WAR GAMES with my current computer knowledge and eyes of 1983 preteen. 3) Burglary in the pentagon computer in the 80s with the knowledge and perspective you learned and remembered. 4) Reproduce WHOPPER to the NUKE position of the DEED CODE minutes before the first film day. 5) Come back to the present, grab a beer and get Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones to "blink" my memory blank of whole event, especially my original view of "The Dead Code" 6) Have another beer and watch the WARS GAME 7) Be happy for the next bad remake of a GOOD 80s movie. 8) Forgot I have Jar Jar killed. I'm not sure if I was going into the future for it. Maybe I need access to a wormhole.
