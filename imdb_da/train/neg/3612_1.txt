Nut emergency is to murder college students, can new teacher stop madness?! <br /> <br /> Believe me, you don't care. <br /> <br /> With a title like the Splatter University, one would immediately gather that this movie is just not high art. But worse than the Splatter University does not even qualify for entertaining waste. Splatter U is so poorly made - the story is thoughtless, the characters are throwing away, and the whole movie lacks the essence of imagination. Needless to say, there is no tension or atmosphere or scare. This drivel is not even brave enough to throw in any nudity (for the cheapest of all). So all the way around this infinitely lacking slasher offers nothing in the way of entertainment (not even cheap laughs) and just becomes a complete bore. The bottom of the barrel guys - even die hard slasher fans would like to think twice before viewing, let alone paying money for this flick. <br /> <br /> BOMB out of ****
