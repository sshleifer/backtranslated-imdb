I've seen horror movies since I was 5 years old, starting with Childs Play. Since then I've seen good horror movies and bad ones, but it is without a doubt the DUMBEST movie I've ever seen! The actors did everything they could with the material. The ground was just idiotic. Plus, it was just everything. I can stomach a lot of blood, but it was just ridiculous! In one of the scenes, a character is stuck in the back and cattle with the intestines! Plain Dum! Another problem with this movie is that it is boring and probably the slowest movie ever made. The end of it is just stupid. But then again it goes with the rest! At the end, when the girl gets away from cannibal / ancestor, she receives help from an old lady. The old lady makes tea, but when she turns to talk to the girl, the girl attacks her! She became a cannibal! Retarded film.
