Bobby is a greasy child who smiles too much and wants sex. Then he buys a van to help in this quest. The play is lamb, the comedy is pathetic, and the manuscript is no more than a loosely tense chain of clichés and inexpensive excitement. The film makers of course wanted to capture some of the craziness out there of other movies of the time, but fell far. They even advocate that Bobby slides on a banana skin, for it will probably add comic value. <br /> <br /> I'm struggling to find a redeeming feature of the movie. If you like DeVito, this is another classic DeVito kind of role - but he is only a supportive actor and there for cliché value.
