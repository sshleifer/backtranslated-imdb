A romanticized and thoroughly false vision of unemployment from a middle-class "artist" with a pleasant upbringing ... Clearly, the author director has never had unemployment directly and certainly has no personal experience with it. If you were to believe in this completely ridiculous story, unemployed men of all ages behave like teenagers, have no anger, no fear, no frustration, etc. All the characters live through the day wearing pranks, boyly jokes. They never seek work, they almost never experience rejection or anxiety, etc. Living on dole is almost like a summer vacation from school ... Ridiculous. Especially if you compare it to modern masterpieces from likes like Ken Loach etc.
