I was thirteen years old when I watched this movie. I was expecting a lot of actions. Since Escape from New York was 16-rated in Germany, I entered the movie as a return. It was so boring. Subsequently, I realized that this was just shed where a man exhibits his wife. Today, I mean you do this over the internet and you pay for instant access. It's more than 20 years ago, but I'm still angry that I'm wasting my time with this movie. This is a soft porn for schoolboys. Dress up Bo Derek and paint her with color - nice. But then they would name the film Undressing Bo and paint her.
