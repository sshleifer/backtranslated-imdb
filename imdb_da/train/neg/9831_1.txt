I tried to watch this movie without being able to really sit through it, because although it is supposed to have a "good" message; The problem is that it is, of course, produced according to a particular interpretation of the script. An interpretation would in my view mislead many people. In addition, I am a movie maniac and the actor in this movie was completely unacceptable. Never before had I wanted a negative score to judge a movie. So if you want to be preached too unceasingly by those without authority, then by any means, get this movie. This comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi, because the title will also deceive many people. It was an unfortunate movie because the basic idea had opportunities and these opportunities were wasted. The movie's only redeemable quality is that it made me realize that the character of "Time Machine" probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at their unequal behavior in his future.
