Seemingly seems to be a thriller in a movie, winning up to being almost ridiculous. It asked me to exclaim "Oh my God!" more than once in the past due contrivances of the plot that was just stupid. <br /> <br /> Fanciful or absurd places just for the sheer news or dramatic situation and unlikely, almost impossible, human reactions and circumstances are too much to be understood why they exist. <br /> <br /> If you have time and want to discover how bad a picture can be, then you would like to see this. Otherwise, spend some time watching some paint dry for a more productive investment of time! <br /> <br /> (The fact that a movie released in 2003 already appears on TV in July 2003 may give an indication of the quality of the movie)
