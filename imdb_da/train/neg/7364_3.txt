In 1692, Salem, a false child's lie about a slave's involvement in witchcraft, sends a whole society to a rebellion. Costume drama with Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray is not dotted, but neither is it a vivid picture of contagious hysteria. The work of three authors (Walter Ferris, Durward Grimstead and Bradley King) is the elements of history quite interesting (especially coming out of Hollywood in 1937), but to anyone who has since read Arthur Miller's "The Crucible" melodrama on display here will not be tolerated for a very long time. Biggest problem with the picture may lie in the casting: Colbert and MacMurray are an unhappy couple of lovers who are prevented by the witch hunt, MacMurray is far too modern for those surroundings. * 1/2 from ****
