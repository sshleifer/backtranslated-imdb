Trying to imagine something as incomplete as SENTINEL would be quite difficult. The problems are many. The result is terrible and loaded with plot holes. Michael Douglas stars as Pete Garrison, a secret service agent who "took one" to Reagan during attempts at his life. Years later, we find Pete awarded the Whitehouse Family, mainly as a guard for First Lady (Kim Basinger, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL). Problems arise as we see Pete's close involvement with First Lady, and a sudden threat to the president himself (David Rasche, UNITED 93). When Pete fails a polygraph test, he is designated as a disgruntled agent by investigator David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland, 24 television series). As the presidential assassination unfolds, Pete finds herself fleeing from her own people. His only confidant is First Lady, and she is reluctant to tell anyone about their feelings for each other (that's why Pete celebrated the polygraph in the first place). But is Pete really innocent? Or is he just trying to buy time until he can kill the president? If he is innocent, how can he help prevent the attempted murder while running from the Secret Service? <br /> <br /> The one big, overwhelming problem with this movie is that there is no justification for the cause of the president's threat. Isn't that what the movie is supposed to be about? You would think so! But the audience has never argued why the killer (s) will kill Prez. Hmm. Someone forgets to put it in the script somewhere? <br /> <br /> And what's with David Breckinridges (Kiefer's) new partner, Jill Marin (Eva Longoria, CARLITA'S WAY)? Seems she was put in the film strictly as a piece of a $$ candy. What was her purpose again? Did she do anything other than look good in tight pants and a low blouse? <br /> <br /> There are so many issues with The Sentinel's basic premise to be ridiculous. The action is too easily stymied by "What the ...?" Answers are sure to be pronounced by the unfortunate enough to watch the movie.
