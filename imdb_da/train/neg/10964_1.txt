I was unlucky to have seen this at the Sidewalk Film Festival. The pavement as a whole was a disappointment, and this film was the last stitch in the coffin. Being a good fan of Lewis Carroll's 'Alice' books, I was very excited about this movie's prizes, which only made it much more uncomfortable to see. Normally, I am fond of modern stories if they are treated well. It is usually interesting to see the parallels between past and present within a familiar history. Unfortunately, this film was less of a modern narrative and more of a pop culture version. The adaptation of the original characters seemed youthful and was usually terribly annoying. It probably did not help that the actors were not very good either. Most performances were ridiculous over the top, which I suppose was either due to poor direction or an attempt to make up for a bad script. I didn't even laugh through the film's duration. All the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that certainly lose their poignancy as time goes by. Really, the only highlight in the movie was the opening sequence, where the white rabbit is about to meet Alice, but even then, the score was a poor imitation of Danny Elfman's work. Also, I had to say that the conversion of croquet games to a rave dance-off was horrible. It was without a doubt the low point in the movie. <br /> <br /> What a joke. Don't watch this movie. After its conclusion, I was really angry.
