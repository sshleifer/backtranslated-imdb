Now here's a movie that, if made in Australia, would have been a comedy. Unfortunately and annoyingly, here it is, relax and cheesy and overcrowded from Lala country. How did the di-erector get it wrong? Well, mainly by being serious about a job so hilariously sensational that no one in their real mind could take seriously. Unless of course they were a nerdy lonely gay cliché (but somehow sweet) ... or the cliché is stacked on cliché. No value in history that almost seems like a prequel to Gus Van Sants GERRY ..... and with a title like THE FLUFFER, how is that all such a major? Well, this author must have sooo wild that he first came to Burt and BOOGIE that he had to make his own. Envelope and undeveloped except for 'pristine love is a drill's theme back from a faded Streisand lyric, we only have moody beefcake and television series level history back. The unnecessary fourth act of this over long turgid drama is really awful as the movie wanders out like Gerries into the desert and stuck there. In Oz in the late 90s, some 20 somethings made a similar but actually fun movie called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as VENUS FACTORY it also filmed a bit of an author more horrible than Orson, so they filmed half of it, got a ruthless tv editor to chop it up and down in 72 minutes and hi-presto .. Comedy tonight ! A lesson in there when bad movies are good at lighting up. I guess FLUFFER stiffens on release and after seeing it not performing, I can understand why.
