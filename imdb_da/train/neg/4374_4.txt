<br /> <br /> Entrails of a Virgin is so bizarre and incomprehensible that it allows the viewer to interpret it subjectively and apply whatever he wants for his inexplicable transgression of sex and violence. If this was a deliberate feature of the movie, it would be a postmodern brilliance work - but of course it is not. <br /> <br /> Without getting too much plot plot, let's take a quick turn on the events. In a secluded cabin there is an orgy going on, which includes topless wrestling and the diaper p. A burden of latecomers joins the orgia in progress, but they have been inadvertently followed by a monster I like to call "the muddy ninja". This monster precedes killing orgy participants one by one, except the sheer virgin (if you don't count oral sex) who receives his seed and consequently becomes so passionate about the desire that she masturbates with a person's separate hand. <br /> <br /> Finally, she has her gut pulled out and then there is a scene that seems to mean she is pregnant with a baby muddy ninja. Got all that? If you have to rent this movie, it's best if you don't speak Japanese and don't have subtitles. In a season populated by boring Hollywood flicks, it may be the cinematic equivalent shock therapy to put this in your VCR. It will definitely be something different.
