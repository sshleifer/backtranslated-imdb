It's great for me, what suits entertainment today. Maybe I'm a dinosaur from the fifties and I'm out of touch with today's movie generation, and that's apparently the case with this movie, as so many people loved it. I found it foul and vulgar. I haven't said about many movies in my life, but this one fits the bill. Humor is sophomoric and raw. I'm not a politically correct person, and even I found gay jokes, not just fun but just offensive (I'm not gay). The protagonist of the film is not even a sympathetic person, just pathetic. When the film was finally over, I heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just paid good money to see.
