These kinds of movies, where a psycho of a variety or another tries to damage the reputation (and ultimately eliminate completely) some naive people to take over their lives. Fatal Attraction, Pacific Heights, Hand that Rocker Cradle, Single White Female, and a thousand movies for television are some examples of this. But while a few, especially lethal attractions and quiet heights could offer at least some extremely paranoid, suspenseful characters or a few plot twists, illegal entry plays all about the book. And if it wasn't for the famous stars (Kurt Russel, Ray Liota and Madeline Stowe), this movie would sink to mediocre faster than a Danielle Steele miniseries. <br /> <br /> Russel plays Michael Carr, an incessant naive guy who calls for help from a few officers when someone breaks into his house and tries to attack his wife (Madeline Stowe). Unfortunately, he turns his anger over to feel so helpless in the situation of the wrong politician (Ray Liotta), a typical psychopathic villain without limits to his power. First, empathizing with Carr (probably only pretending to do so), free the police couple. But soon the police will have Carr out of the way so he destroys life in almost any way he can (which is quite easy when you are a policeman and when you are a policeman who has installed the guy's security system in his house) to take over and probably get his wife. It seems less end-oriented, and more like the policeman just wants to prove his power. The wife is more like a trophy, in other words an end. And the story is played exclusively by the book, you can probably predict any event before it happens on the screen if you've seen enough of these movies. From the "shocking" moment, our main naive character understands that he is the victim of credit card fraud (committed by the psychopathic villain) to the turn-around-he-not-really-dead final.
