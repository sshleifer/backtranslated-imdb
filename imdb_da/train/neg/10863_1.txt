LAYING RAHO MUNNABHAI is really a disappointing movie. I have seen the first part of MUNNABHAI, and it was really good, but this really makes you drill n disappoint you ......................... .. ............ <br /> <br /> This movie really wastes your time and money. I brought my friend to this movie on the first day of his release, and both were run in the cinema hall ......................... .. ......................... <br /> <br /> The role of CIRCUIT was very small and useless in this movie. I think SANJAY-DUTT cut down the role of ARSHAD VARSHI ....................... <br /> <br /> The character of The movie is also not well defined as the previous one. this movie shows you the result of OVER-CONFIDENCE ......... <br /> <br /> MAHATMA's ideas are also not defined and confusing ..... A really big disappointment
