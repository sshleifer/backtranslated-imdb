I came to this page to see what comments people would make about this absolute disaster in a movie. I was not pulled in yet another second. The characters were all one-dimensional. They threw every topic they could think of hoping for something would stick. I would bet (and hope) that all involved in teachers look back with embarrassment. There are some good actors here, but you would never know. Thank goodness, it didn't ruin Morgan Freeman's or Judd Hirsh's or Nick Nolte's or Laura Dern's careers. There was no vision, no love power here, only a terrible effort went wrong. BTW I don't think the author ever set foot in a real school.
