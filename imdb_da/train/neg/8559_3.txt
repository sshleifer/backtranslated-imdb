"It is just as difficult to describe how exciting it is to make a relationship as a drama as with all similar pornographic scenes that are thrown as equally well as, and to stir up controversial versions and make us more like money and the like. things. "- Ellen, the lost quote. "Kissing, Like, On, Like, Mouth And Stuff" is like the best of artistic efforts ever made. Looking like Ellen's hairy arms and like Chris masturbating was like the height of my years long movie viewing experience and stuff. But before I can start breaking new US-20 something-airhead records with my "likes", just let me tell you briefly as the high-light in this visual feast: <br /> <br /> 1. Chris does the deed with their genitals. And not only the way that the camera (guided so elegantly by Ellen and Patrick) rewards the viewer with a full-screen image of Chris's fat white garbage drum after completing the Ukatolian deed - it was really exciting. I can honestly say that I have never seen such grace. Chris, you should do more such scenes in your next movies, because that's exactly what we needed as a continuation of what the brilliant, brilliant man Lars von Trier and his "Idiots 95" started. A quick w *** and then a hairy, bold, white belly: what more can any movie goer ask for? Needless to say, I can sit all day and watch Chris ejaculate (despite being straight). Such a poetry started. Such elegance, such style. No less than total divine inspiration entered the movie the sequence - plus a solid amount of Zen philosophy. Even Barbra Streisand could not be more spiritual than this. <br /> <br /> 2. Ellen's hairy, thick arms. The wobbly-camera close-ups, so skilfully photographed by our two instructors of photography (I can't stress it enough), Ellen and Patrick, often caused confusion regarding proper identification of that gender. There were several scenes when we could see part of a body (a leg, an arm or a foot), but it was often a guest game: does this body part belong to a man or a woman? Of course, Chris and his co-authors, Ellen, Patrick and whatsername, deliberately threw themselves because their bodies were ideal for creating this gender-based confusion. It was sometimes difficult to guess whether one sees a female or male leg. Patrick is so very thin and effined in her movements, so hairless and untouched, while Ellen and the other girl are so much butch, what about their thick legs and arms. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> 3. Brilliant - especially the way that is precisely related to the theme of gender roles: so completely original and mind-set. Ellen behaves like a man, wants sex all the time, while her ex Patrick wants to talk - like a girl. Spiffing. <br /> <br /> 4. Ellens is looking for a leftist friend. "He must love" The Simpsons ", which is quite leftist." I am delighted that the film makers decided to break the long tradition of offering us intelligent leftists. Ellen is such a refreshing - and realistic - change. The number of likes that she and her liberal friends manage to say in less than 80 minutes is really phenomenal (3,849, to be precise). They have managed to realistically transfer their real life failure on the big screen with a minimum of effort, and I welcome them. <br /> <br /> 5. Close-up of toes. Lots of stuff here for foot-fetishists, which I think is a very liberal, very commendable way to reach sexual minorities. After all, shoe and foot fetishes are offered so little in modern cinema, so it's nice to see that someone out there cares. <br /> <br /> KOTM, or rather KLOTLMAS, offers more than the eye. It's not just a modest little movie about superficial people dealing with hollow relationships, while being connected to meaningless conversations. No, it's a lot more than that. It's about the light that controls all stupid creatures; the guiding light that dominates the wicked lives of various pseudo-artistic wannabes, which just fell out of the film school, and plan to overthrow our senses with dim drive that will hopefully work well on pretentious festivals like Sundance and Cannes to win the necessary exposure, therefore, some real money for a change that they will later employ as Sean Penn and George Clooney to promote the rescue of this planet and the solution of ALL political problems that this world is facing. What better way to do it than to make porn at first? <br /> <br /> If Chris and Ellen made the camera here, as evidenced by the final credit, who held the camera while the two were in front of it? They certainly hired some passers-by and pushed the camera into their hands ... Go to http://rateyourmusic.com/~Fedor8 and check out my "TV and Cinema: 150 worst cases of nepotism" list.
