This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I watched this movie with some friends and after 40 minutes we had enough. The reason was bad and there was not a single sympathetic character. I could get more entertainment by looking static. I gave this movie a 1 only because the scale did not go into negative numbers. Avoid this movie at all costs.
