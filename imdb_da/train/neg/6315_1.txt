This sleek, sexy movie is a must-see. Only with multiple views can one really understand the unique nature of this movie. Personally, I enjoy the narrator of his intelligent, no matter abandoned, untouched, narrative style. The introduction takes you right away and keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout the movie. He provides a wonderful insight into the world of trainables and allows the audience to truly "connect" with inner horror this film exhibits. The scripture itself keeps the film together wonderfully. Not only for children, but also the elderly will gain a higher understanding of trainables and the modern understanding they have about the sexual experience. Before its time and pioneering in cinematography, it certainly defines the word 'masterpiece'.
