I could not believe it. I had to rub my eyes a few times. Was that true? Yes, there were Billy Dee Williams, Jeff Conaway, Maxwell Caulfield and Tracy Scoggins. Everyone has some talent, but here they were all in what basically puts for a Cinemax-style skin girl Put as if it is "Alien Intruder" trying to be unique with a computer virus / alien demon / harpy / anything you will call her Ariel (Scoggins) infiltrate this kind of high-tech virtual reality station aboard a spaceship where four men are allowed to live their fantasies as the system is overstated by their captain (Williams). <br /> <br /> Interesting? Perhaps, but here everything is playing like a well-padded episode of "Red Shoe Diaries". Williams out classes all right and left, and looks as though he'd rather do something else, anywhere else. Ah, the things people make for money .... FX is pretty static, maybe even less than what one would expect for a straight-to-video cheapie like this one. Unfortunately, even the woman's nudity is less than you would expect. SEXUAL INNUENDO is the right star here, and of course it will be ALL the best scenes. <br /> <br /> If you like a movie that's all right and no brains, check out "Alien Intruder". Of course, you shouldn't look further than Cinemax at 2 or 3 in the morning. No stars, not even for which star force this flick can muster. <br /> <br /> Let this be lost in space.
