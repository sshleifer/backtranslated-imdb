This valued production has its fans. But to rewrite the classic bad review of 'Mary Reilly', Moby Dick is like a painting, only slower. This is because philosophical reasons for a movie "production" should never make a good movie, rather it is to replace the lack of a strong guide (in this case, to a book transfer to movies) with a list of hopelessly nebulous, unynamic but dazzling Performances in an attempt to trick the viewers into believing they have seen greatness. As viewers and critics tend to fall to this, Oscars follows and feeds the whole stupid equation. <br /> <br /> I don't share the pleasure that all these reviewers have found. Moby Dick is surprisingly uninvolving. Actors dutifully recite essays on Jonah, Moby Dick, the sea, Moby Dick, Moby Dick ... all things that can't react and not one of which absorbs at least. It is dramatically inert. It doesn't build. In the story, Moby Dick (as a movie) is a little more than a previous conclusion in search of a real story. After half an hour I mumbled "Oh fantastic ... another oath ... another 4 minute solo solo!" <br /> <br /> In the failed effort to get involved, it's a rather campy overactive showcase. Very gray hair here. Starbuck must be a golden god. (!) <br /> You know you are looking at a great instructor when he makes the medium his own, rather than trying to replicate the feelings of other people's paintings and palettes or plainly embalming a classic like Huston is here. Paintings and books are fine, but they are different media. A film like this fails to understand that an honest fun piece of shit (Village of the Damned) is better in most respects than a scary piece of culture. This is the Eat your Vegetables school for film making. <br /> <br /> You appreciate the work that must have been done to make the movie, but not the story. Only a few segments that reflect maritime research are interesting; recording shanties as a means of structuring work and various ocean efforts; and the whaling technology. And it doesn't require a two-plus-hour movie.
