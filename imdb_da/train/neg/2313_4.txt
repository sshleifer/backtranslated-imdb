Shintar√¥ Katsu got tons of fame playing the wonderful character, Zatoichi. The Zatoichi films had a strange and incredible concept - a blind guy is the greatest swordman in Japan and spends every film justly wrong and demanding retribution on evil perpetrators. He is a nice guy and the movies are exciting and addictive (I actually watched each movie). Because of this I saw this last pass of the Hanzo the Razor series when I assumed it would be very similar .... and boy was I wrong! It turns out that Hanzo films are extremely sexual by nature, and they also promote rape of "women who deserve it". You see, Hanzo is a policeman from the Meiji period, and he regularly takes vicious women into custody and interrogates them by violent rape with his "steel penis". How he made his member so strong is something you have to look to believe in, but it's certainly not too bad. Overall, I cannot recommend anyone who sees these violent and misogynistic films. But from looking at the other reviews I can see that they are still very popular ... and it's pretty scary. Despite some decent plays and amazing fighting scenes, the movies are just like brain contamination - and I would hate to imagine how the movies could have contributed to violence against women.
