I first read "Lorna Doone" about 20 years ago and absolutely loved it! It is a classic historical romance in the 17th century, when the western country was several days' journey from London, and law and order were much harder to enforce. Unfortunately, this version of the book takes more liberties with history and was incredibly disappointing in my opinion. The values ​​and production values ​​are OK, but the way the story was messed up was horrible. Why do TV adjustments do this? Why should they think that thousands of fans of a book would have to change the story ??? One of life's great mysteries !!! The BBC made an excellent version that was removed at Christmas in the early 1990s, which I am still trying to track a copy of! Take my advice, read the book and don't bother with this dirty version!
