Dolph Lundgren dresses and blows through this incoherent mystery / thriller that is not as cold as the box would have you believe. He is actually quite good here, but the story is rooted in B-movie cliches (detectives, revenge, tycoons, hookers, S & M) that resemble being created when they joined. The film gets a little in the other half, but instead of a more decent Lundgren flip you have to rent RED SCORPION.
