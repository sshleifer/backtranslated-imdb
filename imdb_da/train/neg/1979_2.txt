Hmm, Hip Hop music for a Western period. Modern phrases like "cool" and for many others to keep track of. "The sistahs are in tha house" !? French manicured nails on hard riding girls. Microphone packages CLEARLY visible on Li'l Kim's back. I just can't go on with the many mistakes made by the director and the editorial staff. <br /> <br /> The action isn't as bad as I've ever seen. The women did well enough with a bad script. <br /> <br /> It was strange to hear Louis Mandylor speaking in his original accent. The girls are beautiful. Costumes fabulous, though completely wrong. I just can't believe they would stupid down what could have been a great story. I would feel offended to believe that this movie was filled with such traps that it would play well in inner city. <br /> <br />
