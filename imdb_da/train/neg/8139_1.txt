Or maybe it's the way it feels. Anyway, "The Bat People" is as flat as a blanket, gentle like a bag of flour and as exciting as a stone ... and as intelligent as all three combined. Okay, plot in a nutshell (appropriate ship that ...): a doctor (Moss) gets bitten by a bat while checking a cave with his wife (McAndrew) and then turns into a bat - not exactly a bat but a bat like creature resembling a werewolf killing its victims in a first-person camera view .... <br /> But then there is the sheriff's business (Pataki), which is about the WORST kind of sheriff: the hick kind. He harasses people he learns from married women, he steals handkerchiefs from haberdasheries (FIEND!), Smokes with one of these cigarette holders in the mouth and speaks simultaneously and makes him look and sound like Buford T. Justice in " Smokey and the Bandit "and (this is the worst part) ... HE IS THE MOST LIKE CHARACTER IN ALL THE MOVIE! <br /> <br /> However, the entire movie is only TV-movie-of-the-week-like crapola (guano, in this case). It's an AIP to cry aloud! What did you expect, Oscar caliber stuff? <br /> <br /> What else can you do about a movie that can't even save MST3K? <br /> <br /> What about ... no stars for "The Bat People", the full version or the MST3K version! <br /> <br /> By the way, if there's ever a sequel to this movie, I'll bury my TV.
