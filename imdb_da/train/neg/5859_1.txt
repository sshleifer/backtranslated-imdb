Turkish cinema has a big problem. Directors are not interested in global cinema. They are local and folklore, but will be international. This gives kitsch results such a film. <br /> <br /> Films have jokes translated into Spanish from Turkish, and they have no meaning for non-Turkish audiences. Even for Turkish audiences after 10 years. Players, even Ferhan SENSOY, have a worse action than average. They work like dolls. <br /> <br /> Films were shot in Cuba, but nothing about Cuba. So Cuba is considered a banana republic. <br /> <br /> Waste of money, waste of time.
