Remember chain smoker channeler exposed in 60 minutes a few years ago? This is her. Many people reviewed this movie without controlling the film's bona fides. Manufacturers have used false word to mouth campaigns very successfully without revealing the economic and philosophical basis for this piece of marketing tripe. If you believe in channeling, reincarnation, new age killing and day-old baloney, this movie is for you. If you want a discussion about quantum physics or reality, look elsewhere. The purpose of this movie is to convince you that Ramtha is not a wacko, so you will give her a lot of money. If you can tiptoe through the Ramtha website without howling in disbelief, then maybe you think the bucks you fell on this infomercial were well used. <Http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN>
