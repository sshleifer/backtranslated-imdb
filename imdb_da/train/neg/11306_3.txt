Back (again) in Scotland, Lassie (again) is on trial for her life. Because the faithful dog is sleeping on her master's tomb, she must be killed in accordance with the law. It is also odd that Lassie had no "legal" owner, which apparently also opposes an old Scottish law. If there is no owner after three days, dogs must be destroyed. Edmund Gwenn (like John Traill) invokes Lassie's case, leading to an expanded flashback showing Lassie's adoption of Donald Crisp (like John "Jock" Gray). Although based on an interesting original story ("Greyfriars Bobby"), "Challenge to Lassie", several former Lassie situations reiterate; And it doesn't improve them. For comparison, this is sloppy and unexciting; And it's a disappointing follow-up on "The Sun Comes Up" (1949) *******. Geraldine Brooks (like Susan Brown) and several of the other performing artists may be charming but cannot raise it. Little Jimmy Hawkins (from "It's a Wonderful Life") is among the remarkable children who support Lassie; much later he will grow up to marry "Dark Shadows" "enchanting" Angelique "(Lara Parker).
