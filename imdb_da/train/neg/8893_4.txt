Celia Johnson is good as a nurse. Michael Hordern is good as Capulet, although it is his usual neighing and whinnying and not a patch on his King Lear. John O'Conor reads the verse as Friar Laurence, though he never takes it anywhere. Alan Rickman is good as Tybalt, in the first of his "yuk" roles that would make him famous. Christopher Strauli's Benvolio is sympathetic. The sets are beautiful, if not amazing, as in some of the other BBC Shakespeare's. <br /> <br /> And that's it. The rest is weak to terrible. Rebecca Saire was 15 in production and has no idea how to act Juliet - she opens her eyes really wide and whines every line in exactly the same way. Patrick Ryecart is poorly adapted to her and his self-sufficiency is inexplicable. The balcony scene flows smoothly and uneventfully with zero emotional or erotic impact. Their death comes as a relief. If I had a dagger, I'd have offered it to them hours earlier. <br /> <br /> Anthony Andrews is unlikely as Mercutio, a good shock if you remember his good work in "Brideshead Revisited." He breaks the mirror into Shakespeare's verse in a thousand shards of two or three words each, and then the fragments shout as uninterrupted and incomprehensible as possible. In this production, Queen Mab abdicates. Terrible. The director Alvin Rakoff only shows an intermittent gift to put the camera where it will show us what we want to see. The opening match is particularly incoherent. But there is humor in a later fight, Romeo apparently breaks Tybalt right in the cobbler. Tybalt then seizes the offended region. But did it come through? <br /> <br /> R&J is a long game. This version is not recommended for use in the classroom or much more.
