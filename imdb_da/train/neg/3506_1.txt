I wouldn't be so quick to look at all the good reviews and say it can be a good show. This show is only good if you don't know what "talent" is. I don't even want to say how offensive it is (I know it can be offensive to many people) because it's not right what worry about the show. What annoys me is that people look at this and think it's fun. It makes me feel that our generation is getting stupid and I'm actually afraid that someday it will be driven by people who see this waste .. Basically, the plot is simple. It's about an offensive, self-centered, spoiled woman (Sarah Silvermen) coming through everyday life .. <br /> <br /> That's .. As it hasn't been done a million times .. In fact, almost all jokes have been done or are racist. <br /> <br /> Sarah also likes to sing. I like her voice ... it's not the lyrics .. The songs are terrible .. like she likes to sing a lot of stuff .. <br /> <br /> If you like to see a hot woman put everybody else down and make th em feel like crap, while they spin and say crap about each race then this show is for you ..
