I wanted to watch this movie because of Eliza Dushku, but she has only a minor role in it, and her character is not very sympathetic. The main character played by Melissa Sagemiller, however, is extremely beautiful and a perfect joy to watch throughout the film. This really is nothing more than a showcase for her appearance and talent. She does a very good job. <br /> <br /> The story itself is pretty obscene on that face. After a car accident, some friends may have died but continue to live their past lives while all kinds of mysterious things happen. Some villains are after them, but we never really know who they are (maybe they were in the other car, but we certainly don't hear why they are after them). The last scenes seem particularly cinematically ambitious, but I can't get anything coherent out of it. The opening scene where the evil boys (wearing some strange masks) cut a blonde girl's wrist and gather some of her blood never explained or followed up. Unless the evil guys represent the surgeons trying to pull Cassie back from the dead ... but no, it doesn't seem to work. The evil guys are just bad guys; They really just clear a story that might otherwise have been interesting. In a supernatural story of death and love and sacrifice, who in hell has bad guys? <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
