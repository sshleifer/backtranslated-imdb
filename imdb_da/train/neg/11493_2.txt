Störtebeker is really one of the worst TV mini series ever made on this planet. The play is unbearable, and the historical background is mostly nonsense: Just two examples: Visby was shown as a village with three houses. Instead, it was a big city at the moment, it is the best days that have already passed. Second, Hamburg had never been the city that looked after pirates in the Baltic. Hamburg had no access to the Baltic Sea, the largest city at that time was Lübeck. <br /> <br /> But worse than all that: Director! How can a dilettant like this guy be allowed to lead a movie like this? Impossible! There wasn't a single credible scene, the battles were ridiculous, and I couldn't suppress laughter in most string scenes. I cannot understand at all how a large television station could be so incompetent.
