A denied scientific girlfriend is beheaded so he brings her head back to life. Honestly this is the movie. He is trying to get her another body, he is searching through the towering area of ​​the city for the perfect body. For some reason he has ugly-looking monster in a closet at his cabin. The movie's sleaze style is ridiculous. No one in the movie can actually act, including the head. The closet monster is a man with a mask tie on and you can really tell. The reason is slow, weak and the end is so poorly done. See the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of this feature. Believe me people, I didn't want to watch this movie alone.
