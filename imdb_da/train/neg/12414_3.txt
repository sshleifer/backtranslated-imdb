Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a great match showing very different siblings, but only Winningham is able to bring something convincing or significant to her role. Leigh, playing bar-band singer and alcoholic Sadie Flood, is constantly launching on older Georgia Georgia, a renowned folk song in the Joni Mitchell Sham. Perhaps due to her dual duties as co-producer on the film, Leigh is due to her throwing herself into a corner: she is not credible as a singer, and although appropriate, she gives too much screen time to the microphone. Probably hoping for a tour-de-force, Leigh is thread-drawn and nervous and chopped; But we simply do not see any talent in this character (Leigh is, of course, a solid actress, but she makes decisions here that will leave us behind). If Sadie herself had the slightest bit of charisma or appeal, we might be able to buy into the concept that she gets the (small) breaks she does. As it is the likelihood that she ever stands up on stage is slim. Director Ulu Grosbard crafted a couple of intense dramatic sequences, and editing in the finale coincides with Sadie's bar performance with Georgia's sold arena show - both singing the same song - and it's a sad nuanced moment ... but really, what's that point? * 1/2 from ****
