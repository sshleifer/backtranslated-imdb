This movie is hardly good, not at all fantastic. Some memorable scenes and the unfortunate choice of mating Norma Jean with a current actress. Jane Russell has it all for her, Marilyn's smaller woman and / or actress. One can only wonder why this is considered one of the highlights of her lame career. 3.10
