I was one of a few extra in this big bomb. I just happened to be in the right place work safety for running scenes at A.I.R. as it was known as back then. Thank goodness my scene into the first few minutes of the movie and I don't have to sit through the whole thing. It was more of a big party than a movie set, but hey, the salary was good. Attention to detail was not a strong point for this, but who should know. The funny thing was to see the cars in the track at really slow speed and then in the movie accelerated to what was close to normal speed. Many of the scenes were changed when they were filmed. I suppose to shave costs and time. But everyone had so good who cared!
