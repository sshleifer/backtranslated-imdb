This movie started very promising with the story of a director who loses sight and a blind woman bound to help him. But somewhere in the middle, it seemed as if the writers did not know where to go. <br /> <br /> An incredible event followed the next (Russia must be very small because they all meet each other all the time), the motivation of the female main character is understandable (why she still follows him after they why is she not trying to borrow a cell phone on the ship to call anyone?), the side stories were quite ridiculous (was the story with the mother and boyfriend likely to be fun? And what was the story of the younger sister?) . Nevertheless, with this sudden apparent arbitrariness, it managed to be completely predictable. <br /> <br /> The sadest thing about it is that there were many opportunities. As I said, the idea of ​​the film was good, the visuals and the score were very beautiful and the actors of the protagonists were also good. So it could have been a really good movie ... but it wasn't.
