I really liked this movie - the spot shot was mostly filmed in Pittsburgh and the trailer had some wonderful photography. But even for a filmed cartoon, it was a really bad movie. The continuity and pacing were both simply awful. The best pieces in the film are under the final credit, so it is (almost) worth sticking it out to the end (oddly, it gets a little over the last half hour or so). <br /> <br /> When the best performance in a movie is by Andy Dick, you know there must be a problem ...
