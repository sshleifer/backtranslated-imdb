I have no idea what idiots gave this movie a Palm D'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival because it was terrible! In fact, I've seen the whole thing simply because I couldn't believe anyone would make such a worthless movie. There is nothing interesting about the plot, the characters are without depth, and there is no attempt to give any kind of mood with music or sound effects. Also, if you decide to waste 2 hours in your life by watching this movie, be sure to bring in something to throw in because the cinematography is simply that someone runs around with a handheld camcorder and half the time you don't even can see the most important issues. This style has been used much more successfully in movies like "Blair Witch" because it creates excitement. In Rosetta there is no plot and no excitement that this style would borrow. I should have known better when it happened at 2 o'clock in the morning that it was going to be terrible.
