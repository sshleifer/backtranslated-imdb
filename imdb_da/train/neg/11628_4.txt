Wow You are too good !!! Corny, Corny, Corny That's how I feel about that movie. It started well with a good idea, A guy (Edward Asner) escaping from Prison dressed as Santa, a bunch of children he finds and believes in the right santa, so the fake santa allows the kids to help him find a bag with stolen money. the movie is like a Christmas version of "flute down the wind". The movie starts well, but eventually it becomes Cheesier and Cheesier to the point that it eventually becomes ridiculous and you just can't take this movie seriously. For example, you get the character Scrooge-type called Sumner (Rene Auberjonois), which is a total Douchebag who treats his young son as a pile of nonsense, he treats his son so badly that he doesn't even buy him decent clothes, the poor kids wear jeans with holes in it! but a 45-second scene of fake santa visiting Sumner, and at the end of the movie you get the guy all happy to sing Christmas Carol and give his neglected son a hug ... yes that's how Corny is ... I is all for a good movie, especially at Christmas, and I'm a big fan of seasonal television movies, but one is too over the top for me, it's a shame because it started well but the other half of the movie beats a supernatural element for the movie that just doesn't fit the rest of it. It's not quite bad, there is some solid play, especially from the kids, but there are plenty of better Christmas movies around.
