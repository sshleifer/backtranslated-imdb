I have to say that many people have argued that some of us need to come with time because the new "Dukes" movie is a modernized version. OH THANK YOU. If this is what you consider modernized, then Hollywood can keep it. Many people on the MSN site have also said it (and I quote) "You old fogies need to get over it and except what it is." Well, let me tell you something I'm 24, so I'm far from being and OLD FOGIE, and I won't get over it, it was a shame for anyone who is HAZZARD COUNTY. The only thing that was right in the movie title was "HAZZARD." Was all the divinity that smoking and drinking really needed. The casting was horrible. Jessica has been on several morning shows to discuss the movie and honestly I think it has all gone to her head. She is by no means a Daisy Duke, a fluke maybe, but absolutely no duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but not like Bo. They should have included the original cast as least cameos, but even Hollywood knew they wouldn't approve the script. I think coming to people, even though actors today and actresses express a negative opinion, why are some of you giving positive comments.
