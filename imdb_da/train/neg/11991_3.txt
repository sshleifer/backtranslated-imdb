- Bad stuff: This movie is really crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was "The Twilight Zone". Flashbacks are virtually useless. Part of the movie, he thinks taking his anger out of a window, will make his life better. I would like to know the casting director and if he was tall because the actor, even from the adults, was horrible. A kissing scene in this movie itself sucked. This movie killed the book. The book was great. I strongly recommend this movie. Not even for educational purposes. <br /> <br /> - Good things: I don't know what I can really say. There are some tension parts that are going on, but they are quickly shot down by the bad stuntwork and acting. <br /> <br /> - My judgment: Don't look.
