It wasn't all this: it had pace, pop and actors who were not afraid to chew nature. It also had a decent script. This one had me scratching my head. If Farrah isn't really "serious" about a career, why does she have a manager (and why does he waste his time)? If Kate and Barney are "artists", why join the The Mother of All Jiggle Shows (like the "Brady Bunch" movie, where Robert Reed will make Shakespeare, just to get on BB)? They were not industry names, but they were not hungry either. And while they got the story right (the poster was released before Farrah got the show), Silverman rejects pitches for "Funniest Home Videos" and "American Idol" and Staving promising his baby girl Tori one day he will make a show for her of course didn't happen . <br /> <br /> What disturbed me was how the spelling role is distorted. He is shown as a show runner and creates when he was not. And how he "comes up" with the "idea" to CA was ridiculous! How was Spelling and Goldberg allowed to enforce Farrah's oral contract when the others were signed? And why did Farrah or Bernstein not say she went because she discovered her inner diva, but because the majesties wanted her to? That's why when it tries to create conflict and excitement by putting Farrah up as the "bad girl" (like Suzanne Somers), it fails because the reason was never laid - that is where the "Three's Company" image was delivered.
