presumably based on the life of Domino Harvey a model turned bounty hunts. I would say that 95% are made. I always have an open mind when it comes to movies, but this movie lost its chances when it became clear that it had storytelling throughout the movie, something I can't stand, and for that, the heroine of history is so hateful and depicted as and arrogant b! I just wanted it to end up being shot in the head. it is too incoherent, too flashy and too boring, it is one that gives a good story, and i really believe that big time leaders should make movies on their own or an author's own imagination nothing based on something ignorant snobber's life .
