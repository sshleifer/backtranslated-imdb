As a big fan or Cracker series, I have been waiting 7 years for the next addition. This episode, I'm afraid of, just lives up to legend. Fitz returns to Manchester after 7 years for his daughters wedding and gets involved in a murder investigation was a soldier plagued by flashbacks from his trip to service in Northern Ireland going on a killing spree. What I didn't like about this episode is the extremely convenient way it is created and how the fitz is led to the killer. It's still great to find a place. <br /> <br /> There are, however, some good scenes in Northern Ireland flashbacks that have been filmed well.
