Please save me these movies that teach us that crime is fun and justified. Pair it with a vacuum script with an intense desire to be Farrelly or Coen brother, plus the life of yet another group of presumptuous school age who perform their Dawson Creek brand teenage fear, complete with a GenXYZ soundtrack that sadly tries to make the movie "cooled, and we have intense and painful inept satire. <br /> <br /> This is not even the water down 'Ferris Bueller' ... I'd rather see a traffic light change. <br /> <br /> Only one scene stands out as a place worth the price of admission: when the Betty Masked girls meet with a Richard Nixon masked friend. It's a surreal moment. Priceless though. <br /> <br /> But for the rest of it, I'd rather have toothache. At least I can use some benzocaine (tm) to stop the pain.
