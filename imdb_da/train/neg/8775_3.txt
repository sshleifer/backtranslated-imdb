The LOC could have been a very well-made film about how the Kargil war was fought; It had the sites, budget and skills to be India's "Saving Private Ryan" or "Black Hawk Down". Instead, it comes across as a soft, 4-hour birth of trying to report the war's movement with the masala film. Even the war scenes were terribly executed, using the same hill in all their combat scenes, and spent unnecessary time on casual talk. Instead of trying to appeal to the Indian public, a better movie would have been a record of what happened at Kargil (like "Black Hawk Down") or even spending time on a militant point of view (like "Tora, Tora, Tora" ). Even better, it could have used a competent director like Ram Gopal Verma to write, edit and edit the movie. Until then I would like to see some who convert this movie with only the relevant parts included; It would make the movie more visible.
