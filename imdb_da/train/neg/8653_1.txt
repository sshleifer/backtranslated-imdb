I went into this hope it would be the "thoughtful" little gem people have gone through this as. I love indy movies and expected to dig this too. Knowing what a hot button this topic is, I expected to be truly entertained, perhaps even seeing an outgoing perspective. <br /> <br /> All I can say is wow .... if your own torture or mutilation then maybe you like this. Personally, I don't like the idea of ​​looking at or cutting myself, so I thought it was garbage. bad script, bad acting, bad story, bad directing, bad editing .... i could go on. I have no idea why a reviewer claimed that he or she made a political point by giving this movie a 10th which is misleading and ignorant. voting for a movie on IMDb does not set a precedent! It just seems other people think that a waste bomb like this is ok to watch as long as it is controversial (this movie is not, it tries very hard to be but fails). <br /> <br /> You know the movie is bad when 15 minutes into it, ask that all the protagonists die terribly. unfortunately they die, but not in the painful manners that would have given the seer justice or justice for having seen the 2-hour shed they just endured. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor, just don't even bother. I've got this movie in a retail box on my local video store for .50 and feel ripped off!
