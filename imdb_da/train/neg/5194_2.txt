Don't make me wrong, I want to see that marijuana is legalized as much as the next guy. I'll burrow now. The scripture, however, was unrealistic. A PTA mother deals with drugs but adamant about her substances coming into the hands of a minor person. Give me a break. The smugness of very beautiful Mary Louise Parker's character was an insult to my intelligence. The characters were not at all sympathetic. Basically, the lines went nowhere. I understand the only television country. The hypocrisy was obvious. Mary Louise Parker should be a good mother and I believe this .... WHY ???? I just got the feeling that I was preached by a show that reeking of seediness. It's like saying it's okay to cheat on your wife but with some of legal age. Ok not the same, but I think you get my point. It saves the kids, things are wonderful for campaign tracks, but it does not contain water in a cable sitcom about a suburban mother like the local potholes.
