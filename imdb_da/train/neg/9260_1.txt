The only connection this movie has to scare is that it is terribly uninteresting. I'd rather stick my finger with a rusted nail than sit through it again. Even for a TV movie it is flat. The molding is dull. The play is as exciting as a bowl of sand. How two directors compound to create such a film will remain one of the great mysteries of the 20th century. There is only one scene that itself is poorly worthy to be included in the Omen franchise, and it is shot in slo-mo and truncated after expected payout. If you are tempted to see this, pop it in, set your alarm clock for 90 minutes and become comfortable. Fortunately, you will turn off quickly and the alarm will wake you when the worst is over. Namely, this movie.
