I hate to waste the time it takes to write 10 lines of this cruelty. Hyung-Rae Shim is fortunate that poor filmmaking is not a capital crime, or he would be killed twice to write and manage this disaster. I am surprised that this film had a budget of 75 million. $, But actually in the sense that it was such a huge flop that hopefully Shim will never make another movie for the rest of his life and therefore not waste any more of moviegoers' time. I would think the actors would have gotten together and lynched him now. <br /> <br /> With the effects resources available to them, a great movie could have been made with this budget. As usual, the error should have been seen in the beginning with the horrible script and story. "Transformers" was another visual feast with a weak script, but it makes it look like "Citizen Kane".
