For the life of me I cannot understand the blind hype and devotion to this incredible movie ...... and I think I have the skills to say it .... I am a former Special Operations soldier with 14 years in it "Lifestyle" ... This film was completely completely unreal and blatantly written by someone who did very little research into the life of the army, in combat or on team or plaon level. <br /> <br /> Three EOD guys trouncing around Baghdad on their own ????? Get Real ... No Command Chain ????? Get Real ... EOD Clean Buildings ??? Get Real .... EOD / Military Intelligence / Sniper qualified buck sergeant ???? Stay real .... Wait ... I shot and killed a bad guy and let two boys take me without shooting another shot or getting hurt at all ???? Get Real .... I carjack an Iraqi civilian while I'm only armed with a 9 mile, break into another civilian house, get punked by his wife and then make it back to camp on foot in the middle of Baghdad at night without as much as a scratch or confrontation ???? Get Real ... <br /> <br /> There is absolutely no compliance with the Military Protocol {Army} and no resemblance to any army unit that I have encountered myself. Incredibly and disrespectfully for EOD's men and women, who, unlike this poor movie, are not wild adrenaline seeking yahoos, but extremely skilled professionals are doing an incredible hard work.
