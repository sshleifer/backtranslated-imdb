This is a big step down from the surprisingly enjoyable original. This sequel is almost as fun as part 1, and it uses too much time on plot development. Tim Thomerson is still the best thing about this series, but his wisecracking is toned down in this post. The performances are all appropriate, but this time the script lets us down. The action is only routine, and the plot is only mildly interesting, so I need many stupid laughs to be entertained during a "Trancers" movie. Unfortunately, the laughs are few and far between, and then this movie can at best be seen.
