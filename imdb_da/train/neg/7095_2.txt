The "Sex Abuser's Diary" is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama on sexual obsession. Probably a movie marketing scam, this flick is a stylish shoot with a good cast and little else goes for it. Bottom line, "Diary ..." wanted us to believe that our sex addicts have the stupidest wife in the world, a staff of babes on the side who have nothing better to do than to lose their panties to him in his whim. , and No job despite being a restaurateur. At best, this flick could be a good drama. In the worst case, cheap softcore. "Diary ..." is not and nowhere between. This one is for the dumpster. (D)
