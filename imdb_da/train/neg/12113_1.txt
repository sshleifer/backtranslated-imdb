Townies is the craziest movie I've ever seen, and I watched the Blair Witch movies (parts 1 and 2). It seems confused in what it will be. It's not funny enough for comedy, it's not tragic enough for drama, it's not bloody enough for horror, and it's not good enough to see. It has scenes of a man making "slapstick / bloody" karate, so I think oh, this movie will be in the vein of Toxic Avenger and Street Trash. Then it runs without warning into a drama about a missing girl, a retarded (mentally handicapped) woman and a trusting mother. Then it beats itself in the only good part of the movie that seems to be created as a sitcom without the laughs. The part I'm talking about is a lonely TOWNIE that's so lonely, he finds comfort in a rotting body. It was the only part of the movie that gave me any feeling. The rest was a waist of my life. So just to show how CRUEL Wayne is there is a kind of DOCUMENT at the end of the movie by Wayne (the director) making fun of Toby (the star) publicly. It made me sick. Though Killer Nerd and Bride of Killer Nerd (two other films from Wayne) are not the best, they are at least thought out where you can be entertained until the end credit. I even like Killer Nerd a bit, it had some nice lines I still use for this day. <br /> <br /> If you like underground movies, if you like underground movies, and if you like watching your feet, just rest where they are, you won't like TOWNIES! <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of ****) <br /> <br />
