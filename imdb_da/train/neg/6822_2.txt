Drones, ethnic drum, poor synthesizer tube, children's song. The most degrading "world music" imaginable. This is a tourist movie and a miserable one. What really kills it is the incoherent sequences. India, Egypt, South America, Africa etc. Etc. No transitions, no visual explanation of why we are suddenly ten thousand miles away, no ideas expressed in pictures. Just a bunch of Third World War recordings with "baskets on the head" as another reviewer said. Goes along endlessly as if it had a profound significance. If these guys wanted to make a 3rd world music video, all they had to do was head a few hundred miles south where the best parts of Koya were shot and film in Mexico. It would have been a much better framework for "life in transformation." <br /> <br /> But no. What they decided on was an encrypted tourist route that covered half the globe and the mind-deadeningly overcranked filter shot. The only thing to recommend this movie is that it doesn't suck as much as Naqoyqatsi. <br /> <br /> RstJ
