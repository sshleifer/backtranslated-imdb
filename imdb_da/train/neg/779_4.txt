Seriously, I think very seriously when I first started to see the show, I thought it was good. But the grounds just got worse. The story was either too boring or predictable. George is not always funny, he sometimes seems stupid. His jokes are overdone. His mother is the silliest character of the show. How can a mother treat her own son that way, okay if it was sister-in-law, but it was her own son. I give this show a 4/10 just because the first few shows were a little fun. Actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha do a good job. Don't know how these shows will play so long. <br /> <br /> If you are really bored as I was and have nothing else to see, I suggest you see this.
