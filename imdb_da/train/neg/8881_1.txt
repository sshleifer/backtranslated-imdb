The character effect is a bit stiff, as if it were the first time the actors have appeared on the screen. Unfortunately, one of the better actresses, Jean Simmons (played many roles on television, as in Star Trek TNG and In the Heat of the Night) dies quickly and then she can appear markedly. <br /> <br /> The lead role is Mr Ballard, who portrayed cliff robertson. Cliff is forced to carry this movie with his body language for most of the time. He does not do a bad job, but it is a little too much to ask an actor to connect the oceans to the empty screen time, where the characters do not spend their time talking or working. Robertson's most memorable role may have been Ben Parker in the last 3 Spider Man movies (with Tobey Maguire). <br /> <br /> The reason is predictable. A man kills his rich wife for his money. then the wife sees to come back and haunt the man who drives him crazy until he jumps from a tall window (fearing his dead wife's ghost approaches him) on the day he is expected to die no less. <br /> <br /> The second driver Mr Ballard hires a lot like an English brand Hamill. Uncanny really! The only thing that stands out is the complete misunderstanding of dialogue. Many minutes pass by, no one speaks, and few actions. It's a pity that the MST3K boys never got hold of this movie. It could have been much better, if not equally predictable, with more dialogue or shorter scenes of 'nothing'. <br /> <br /> I continued to expect G'Mork's red eyes to emerge from the shadows and proclaim that he is working for the "nothing" in this movie.
