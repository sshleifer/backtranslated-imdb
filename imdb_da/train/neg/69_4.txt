I thought this was a very clunky, uninvolving version of a famous Australian story. Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom were very good at their roles and gave their character some personality; but it all felt forced and mechanical. The beginning could have been much more involved; maybe starting with a shootout, and then flashing back to a round of how they came there or that kind of thing. And I felt that every scene was routinely predictable and signposted as a very bad TV soap. I was really looking forward to this movie and hoped for something much better. The only thing I can say in favor of is that it beats the Mick Jagger version, but not much.
