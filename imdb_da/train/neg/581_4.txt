Before I move on I must admit that I am a great Bon Jovi fan. In fact, what attracted me to the DVD case is in the first place. I would probably have bought it anyway be such a great horror fan and have enjoyed the first Vampire title so much. <br /> <br /> But it's not half as good. Not even Jon could save this movie for me. My main problem would be that it simply isn't scary. Apart from Jon's character Derek Bliss, none of the other characters gives an impression, and you can't break less if they die or not, especially the annoying vampire / addict. The female vampire is simply not scary or sexy. Instead, she looks like an anorexic 14-year-old girl, no wonder she's so desperate for blood then. Another big problem is that everything is just "too bright". There is no atmosphere or sense of fear. I know that the first vampires that were put in New Mexico were not exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness, but still managed to be dark and perishable as needed. This movie has no tension like that. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty much the same as before. Vampire wants Berzier's cross to be able to walk in daylight. But the story has less chilly bits this time around. There is no wow factor in knowing that this is the master of the entire champion - the original vampire, as in the first movie. You really don't care who or what this is. There is no army of gentlemen. Instead, she hides in an old ruin that looks more like a Disneyland attraction, so a creepy temple. <br /> <br /> So there you are. Lack of scare, lack of atmosphere, lack of interesting history. A real disappointment to me personally.
