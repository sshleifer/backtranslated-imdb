If you enjoy the original SNL cast and shows, avoid this movie at all costs. When this first came out, my friends and I waited in line for over an hour to get into a sold out movie house. halfway through the movie the theater was 3/4 empty. We refused to leave believing it would be better. When the film ended, we were the only ones left in the theater. The movie lasted only one day at all theaters and disappeared from sight. In interviews with "Mr. Mike" he refused to comment on this movie. The movie was an inside joke on the episodes of SNL that came out just after the movie's release and closing in one day. We all tried to contact "Mr. Mike" by phone and mail for a refund but were completely ignored.
