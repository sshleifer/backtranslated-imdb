(48 out of 278 people found this comment useful and counting ...) People are such suckers for the image and appearance - as much as for the intellectually hollow "idealism" that lurks behind communism. Che's charisma and appearance have so much to do with his iconic stature as the misinformation that has been spread by leftist propaganda (like this film) about him. <br /> <br /> I don't know what's worse: getting caught by one of Che's murder squads or having to sit through 4 hours of this typical Soderberghian waste. The question is not why this animal project was made, but what took them so long. Of course, by "them" I refer left to Hollywood and its "secret" love to Marxist tyrants (Lenin, Castro ... choose). I am fascinated that it took decades for one of Tinseltown's least talented liberal directors to finally take such an irresistibly biased propaganda project. Where was Oliver Stone all these years? Robert Redford? Tim Robbins? Warren Beatty? Alan Pakula? George Clooney? Barbra Streisand himself? It's a mystery. All of these overstated "artists" have often devoted themselves to similar, politically unilateral projects, but somehow Che Guevara, probably the most popular and well-known communist, has not yet become a movie topic of theirs. <Br /> <br /> "Guerilla" has all the characteristics of an American sand-bending story of an epic scale; there are so many factual details here as in other similar large-scale political political adventures such as "Malcolm X" or "Gandhi", ie. almost none. The movie stars Del Toro as the famous Argentine revolutionary. Nevertheless, it is controversial and criminal that this man's actions could have been one that no one could take away from him: he was an intelligent manipulator that came from a rich family. Therefore, Del Toro fits only visually visually. Del Toro may be an interesting charismatic actor, and he may look like Guevara physically, but he does not radiate any intellectual qualities whatsoever, so he makes Guevara look like primitive. Casting such mediocrities as Bratt, Philips and Franka Incompetente emphasizes only the Director's lack of sound judgment. <br /> <br /> The movie is mostly extremely slow (no surprise there) and visually unattractive. Even a director who was as brilliant as Kubrick would carefully consider publishing a movie that goes beyond the 3-hour sign, so it certainly tells that this Soderbergh, who has only made one or two regular movies and early in his career would believe that his oceanic greatness was up to the task. If you think the film's length indicates that much of Che's life has been shown here - think again. Soderbergh focuses on Ches final stage, and much of the film is boring jungle nonsense, full of Guevara's alleged idealism. (Psychopaths don't have ideals.) I wonder what kind of mind this senior leader has to choose to ignore some of Che's past lives. Did he consider it too uninteresting? A massacre of 600 people has no interest in the viewer, huh? Amazing. Some much better directors than this overpriced charlatan would have easily looked after one, but two complete biographies in a 4-hour movie. <br /> <br /> In some ways, Soderbergh becomes accomplice by never guessing the negative, dark side - more than 90% - of Guevara. By spreading this kind of historical inaccuracy, Sinderbergh does not make himself aware of a humanist - a false image that most Hollywood and pop musicians are struggling very hard for their careers to maintain - but the opposite: that he only cares about ideas never about the people on whom these ideas are tested (like on guinea pigs). Soderbergh and the like are elitists of the worst kind; such people often have a latent contempt for "proleteriat" (which silly expression) they are supposed to sit with. <br /> <br /> Half of all students around the world wear Ch's picture on their red and orange shirts, but without ever knowing why. He has become an iconic figure for clueless, uninformed, very often young people who believe that having this man's face on their chest, somehow makes them seem "edgy", intellectual, hip, or interesting. In fact, wearing a Che-shirt emphasizes only a general groundlessness and total interest in self-education. (Don't you want to find out more about a person before you start advertising his / her face to the world?) If you have Che Bartson's Clich√© image, it's just as common to have a Bart Simpson coffee cup. All these "Che-wearers" probably know more about Marge's blue hair than they will ever read about Fidel Castro's dead allies. <br /> <br /> After all that was done in Marx's name, would think that these mongrel "ideals" would finally be put to rest. It seems that humanity will never learn. Stalin, Mao, Kim Il, Pol Pot, Castro, Milosevic, Ceausescu, Iron Curtain, hundreds of millions dead, more than a billion destroyed physically and / or mentally through this system ... so none of that matters? <br /> <br /> The fact that Del Toro won a Cannes award should only surprise those who are completely clueless about how Cannes and other European festivals work - and vote.
