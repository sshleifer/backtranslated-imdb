Hi, <br /> <br /> If you are going to make a documentary about Leonard Cohen, try to make it about Leonard Cohen! This is filled with just enough Leonard to anger the viewer, who will be left behind, wondering why they are listening to all these other singers (some of them dubious) talking about themselves. Puleeze .... sounds like they relive their junior high diary records - who cares about you, what about Leonard? Guess what people, if you "do something" worthy, can make a documentary about you. I found particularly abusive parading of U2 members as if it would add credibility to this movie - NOT. Leonard does not need Bono or Edge who speaks of his spirituality. It would have been good for the filmmakers to embody a piece of his spirituality through the film. Give what a concept! I will give props to Rufus Wainwright and Jarvis Cocker to their Cohen tunes cover - the rest of the shows were a bore and some were unbearable. Cohen fans don't say I didn't warn you!
