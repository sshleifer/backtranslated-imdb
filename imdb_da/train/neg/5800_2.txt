As a horror movie fan, I try to see all the essential short stories of this genre, especially those that are the products of my native cinema. And I can say that the "Power of Fear" (or "Vedma" as the Russian title) is one of the weakest films among them. First, it cannot scare even a small child, it goes so slowly and so predictably that there is no room for the real horror. Frankly, it is bad at all points: from the dumb plot (I do not know why the Russian producers / directors decided to transform the classic story of Ukrainian witchcraft into a bit of lamb and ridiculously modern thriller. I totally agree with the previous reviewer It does not stretch a bit) and to the work of the terrible and cheesy actors. All actors, including the leading Valeri Nikolayev and Yevgeniya Kryukova, who are quite famous in Russia, resemble wooden dolls or something, and it seems to me that they did not even bother to play at all, speaking only their English lines without any expression. And at the end I don't really understand why they filmed this flick in English with Russian actors? I think it was their wrong trip. At least, they could throw some US or English players into the leading parts to make them look more convincing. The same can be said of so-called "small American urban backgrounds" which were shot in Estonia and resemble it. The only positive moment I found in "Power of Fear" is the visual effects. They are not excellent but quite good for the Russian movie. And the music is okay, it annoys me not least. That's why I give it two stars. Overall, if you want to watch good horror movies ?? Don't waste your time and money on this boring flick. And if you are looking for something that claims to be a Russian horror, I would advise you to find a copy of "The Spirit of the Spirit". It's really the amazing movie based on the same novel as "Power of Fear", but much, much better.
