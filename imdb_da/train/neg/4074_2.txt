I expect the same excitement as I am spitting on your dig, but I was let down by just junk, how can you even call this a movie (that kind of a mini-peg). It made me sick when the guy was made to eat his own business. There is no story for it all jumps quickly from every murder. If you like to see a woman naked or even herred, then there are stains in the movie and there is even a masturbation in the movie that makes it a porn and not at all a movie. I've seen some stupid movies in my time, but it's number one. I'd like to see it again at all. The actors even look bored at the movie to me, so they probably needed money badly to make this movie.
