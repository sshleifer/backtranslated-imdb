Christ, oh Christ ... You look stunned, unbelievable and possibly stray, as this silly exercise in a glow-free dirt unfolds with everything enchanted by a fake Galapagos turtle. Can such things be? Does this movie actually contain, or was I the ignorant guinea pig of some shady international pharmaceutical company, sipping my coffee unaware that it had been nailed to a dangerous hallucinogen? I've seen many movies and many bad movies, but nothing prepared for this; At the end of it, I was a gripping, snapping wreck that tore the carpet with my teeth like a dog scratching the walls and shouting until my lungs were hurt. I prayed desperately, frenziedly for mercy (to whom this appeal was made, I do not know), and longed for the burning desire for Ozu Yasujiro's soothing balm. Sweet Weeping Jesus, the memories ... sometimes they come back to me. When I know my most vulnerable when I can at least handle them. I shake, I break into tears, I bite my nails until my hands are slathered with blood, but I can't completely ban the terrible flashbacks of my mind. I'm haunted. I'm damaged. I'm a man of a shell. The other user comments here suggest that I am not alone in having gone through this scary experience, which can only mean one of two things: a) the movie does, actually exists, or b) I'm just a victim of legions of an international conspiracy of truly eerie proportions. What is quite awful is that some people seem to have enjoyed their trial or at least have not been traumatized by it. Maybe they are part of the operation. God curse them, the madmen! God curse them all to hell !!!!!!
