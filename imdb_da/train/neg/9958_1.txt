If it's extremely light, regressive, self-giving, anti-establishment, anti-civilization juvenilia appeals to you, then this is the ideal movie. Very poor script, with often inaudible dialogue and uncomfortably tiring handheld camera all the time, this is a film that presents the world in appealing simplistic, manichean terms: all adults (especially teachers, parents, priests, and doctors) are insensitive and bumbler at best And, in the worst case, preying monsters. The only escape from the horrors of the civilists as a whole is plenty of primary warfare (gab) and infantile regression (literally) in a primitive cave-like space in the forest, with utopia in the shape of a ravine - again in the woods (of course ...). Shows all the weaknesses of a first movie and much more besides.
