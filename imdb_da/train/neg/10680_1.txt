SPOILERS AHEAD <br /> This is one of the worst movies ever made - it's that simple. There is no redeeming quality about this movie. The first 10 minutes are pretty difficult - they actually lead you to believe that this movie will be shocking and will get you on the edge of your seat. Instead, you will spend 83 minutes beating yourself while looking at stolen and poorly crafted scenes that run without any organization. The lake was ridiculous, resembling an aquarium and had the same plant in different parts of the lake. Characters show their advanced teleportation powers, such as Alex Thomas, who falls into the lake (full) and then ends up on his boat in an impossible position. Angie Harmon put a pitiful performance like Kate, got worse from the space-time continuation dialogue, which seems to be written at the last minute of a fifth degree. An example of this would be when she said "flashlight!" in such a stupid way that it shows the threshold for how much a human body can creep before it is half-snapped. Finally, editing this movie was by far the most bizarre and horrifying thing I have ever seen. It was like the cameramen were a bunch of chimpanzees who had been given video cameras by scientists. An example of this would be when we suddenly get a close-up of the headlight on Alex's car. I bet there was little or no time to edit this movie. The finish was completely pathetic. The authors, of course, tried to create a kind of mysterious plot line that made the viewer say "oh yes!" Instead, we are back to see some silly painting of a spider that somehow fits into the story. Unfortunately, there is no perspective in the millions out there that could save this movie from being a partying piece of crap. <br /> <br /> I give this a .5 out of 10, .5 is from the fact that this movie was recorded on film rather than becoming a picture book.
