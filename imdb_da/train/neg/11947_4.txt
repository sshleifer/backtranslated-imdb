An interesting change from the first. there was more mystery about this movie than the first one. Even when it ends, you ask yourself what happened, who was the killer. There are some good parts through the movie, the first half starts slowly, and then in the last half the pace goes up. Everything in the movie is fun. The story is 22 years after the events of the first movie, Norman Bates is out of an asylum and back to Bates motel, but when a woman turns out to claim to be her real mother, things start to go wrong. Perkins plays an old Norman well again, and the scene at the end was excellent, he swung the spade terribly hard.
