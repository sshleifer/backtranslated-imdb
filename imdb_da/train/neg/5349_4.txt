This straight-to-video duffer is another nail in the coffin of Rick Morani's career. As is the Disney tradition, the quality is sacrificed in the name of a fast cash-in; This is a lazy journey with Moranis accidentally shrinking himself and a few relatives so they can repeat all the best scenes from the original movie. Instantly dated visual effects and curvaceous dialogue abound in this cheesy lamer, who did nothing but make me pine for the time of 'The Incredible Shrinking Man', as this kind of thing was done properly. Offensive this is led by top cinematographer Dean Cundey, who either has to stick to the day job or choose better material next time.
