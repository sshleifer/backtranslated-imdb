I also saw this amazing bad part of "anime" at the London Sci-Fi Festival. If you have to see this thing, do it with a large audience, preferably after a few beers, then you can enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I found the dialogue fun, filed in my mind is the introduction of Cremator. The animation is horrible. It is poorly designed and poorly executed. It might have been a good idea for manufacturers to have employed at least one person who was not color blind. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else to say, this movie is a mistake at all levels.
