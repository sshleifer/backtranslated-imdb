As an impressive 10 year old, I liked the "love conquers all" philosophy of the 70s sitcom "Bridget Loves Bernie." I understood the controversy about the romantic complications between a Jewish taxi driver (David Birney) and an Irish Catholic school teacher (Meredith Baxter) and both sets of parents (Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald as Bernie's parents, Audra Lindley and David Doyle as Bridget's parents) have problems with the young couple's intervened marriage. <br /> <br /> Looking at the show now with years of personal life experience, I am surprised that the show was a success for a, though highly rated season. Created by veteran television writer Bernard Slade, who, a few years after the show's cancellation, would write the successful game "Same Time Next Year", "Bridget Loves Bernie" was a very light superficial comedy that collapsed under its own airy weight. br /> <br /> The real chemistry between Birney and Baxter was not denied. But in recent years, both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects (Birney in his short-lived role in "St. Elsewhere" and Baxter in "Family" and "Family ties"). Here they tried to breathe in a show that needed a very laughing comic that could have given the complications more depth to a very controversial topic. <br /> <br /> The exhibition closed Saturday quarters between two CBS powerhouses: "All in the family" and "Mary Tyler Moore". Both of these shows were clever, funny and had enough of an edge (more like the former as the latter) that kept my interest in the situation and the characters. "Bridget Loves Bernie" was not very smart and only had some occasional chuckles. <br /> <br /> This was another example of a show that wasn't really as good as I remembered.
