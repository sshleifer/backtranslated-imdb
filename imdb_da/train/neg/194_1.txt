This movie, The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory, is completely rubbish. The play is terrible, it is far too patriotic and its historical accuracy is not always the best (historians would have a field day). It has some good moments, but not enough to hold interest because it is far too long. Rating * out of **********.
