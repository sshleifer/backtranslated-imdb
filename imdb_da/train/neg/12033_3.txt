Film about a small town with the same number of Mormons and Baptists. New family moves in, cue the overwritten dialogue, mediocre plays, green jello salad with roasted carrots, and every other 'inside Mormon joke' known to man. Anyone outside the Mormon culture will find it difficult to frame this movie. Anyone in the Mormon culture will be amused with a chuckle here and there. You'll be much better off seeing Hess's other movies (Napoleon Dynamite, etc.) than trying to sit through this one. The action is mediocre. Jared Hess has had his hands on much more quality films such as "Saints and Soldiers" and "Napoleon Dynamite". I would recommend both films over this groaner.
