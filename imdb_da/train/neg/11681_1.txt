Trailers for this movie were better than the movie. What a waste of talent and money. Wish I would have waited for this movie to come on DVD because at least I wouldn't be out of $ 9. The movie is missing the brand. What could have been a great movie for all actors turned out to be a B movie at best. Movies moved very slowly, and just as I thought it was going somewhere, it almost did, but it didn't. At this time and age, we need unpredictable plot twists and closures in movies, and this movie is offered neither. The whole thing about how everyone is suspected is good, but it is not certain whether it was the way it was addressed, the lighting, the line's delivery, the writing or whatever, but nothing came of it. Lots of hype for nothing. I was very disappointed with this movie and I'm not telling anyone to see it. The osteic saxophone music throughout also made the film worse. And the end had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. What a disappointment.
