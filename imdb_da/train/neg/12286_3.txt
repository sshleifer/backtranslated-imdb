The summary from my cable tv guide made it sound much more interesting than it actually is. "Slaughterhouse Rock" is by far the worst horror movie I've ever seen, a title previously held by "Urban Legends: Final Cut". From its opening scene I could tell that it would be really bad, but I was so sad that I couldn't fit less. This movie contains ridiculous plays, especially by the guy who is afflicted in his dreams, unbelievably as in non-credible plot phrases, and some of the hardest music I've heard and I live in a time when likes Britney Spears and Nsync dominates the air waves. The biggest problem with "Slaughterhouse Rock" is that it is not fun. You wanted movies as boring and boring and then not scary as it would try to spice things up with a couple of fun lines here and there, but no. We've plagued Guy's self-centered friend who's trying to be fun, but came across it as annoying instead. (spoiler) And please tell me who in this crazy world is insane and self-sufficient enough to visit a creepy prison in the middle of the night? None! If you are going to make a horror movie, at least make it credible. This is anything but.
