Yes, I saw the hard cuts. They unedited six scenes. The sharp cut scenes. Almost on par with the movie 'The Need' for horrible plays. This movie is as bad as bad movies get. The bad script, bad acting, bad effects, bad places, bad stunts bad everything. The best 'actors' in the film were the lace dancers, they employed for vampire accessories! Sean Harry, the "fake actor" that someone else puts it, makes a matchstick look talented here. His amazing ability to drive badly when apparently shaken by people on the bonnet (check the reflection in the windshield), his inability to turn left, which is class. OH and don't forget the sex scene. plus his remarkable use of a toy gun that the props couldn't even bother to pamper like a real gun. The other actors on the screen could hardly deliver their lines. It was as if half of the time was waiting for a line that wasn't there! <br /> <br /> The 'special effects' were so good at the point that the guys who made it took their real names from the credits! <br /> <br /> If you want a laugh at a party, then rent this movie ... again there are plenty of great comedies that are just as fun and don't give money to people who don't deserve it.
