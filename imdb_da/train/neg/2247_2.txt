Kris Kristofferson finds on his exaggerated top in the mid-70s that he is almost unable to squeeze the screen together with La Streisand's humongous ego and discount store feminism. None of the characters are really well-liked; I was so happy when Kristofferson's Ferrari went over that hill and crashed. <br /> <br /> To watch a good movie about the rock and roll star, try _The Buddy Holly Story_ (made only about half a year after this drunk).
