Worst movie on earth. I don't even know where to start, but I hope I can save another person from punishing this movie. When it comes to acting and lighting, this movie looks like a bad porn without the flesh. The actors are some of the worst I've ever seen, and could not have been worse, even though they were trying to make a complete mockery of this movie. The film must have had a record-breaking low budget, which I surely wasted almost exclusively on the film's cover. This movie has now become a regular joke with my friends and has become the standard for comparing other waste products. I would like to point out that no other movie itself compares. I feel personally responsible for suggesting a friend and I see this movie and am surprised that she still considers me a friend after the plague I passed through. Don't watch this movie!
