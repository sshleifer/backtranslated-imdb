STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> This second installment of Che movie moves the story forward to the late 60s, when the man has now moved his resistance fighters into the hills of South America, survivors without enough food and water and with tensions lying between the group. Everything comes to mind as he crosses the border into Bolivia, and the government forces step up their campaign to bring him down. <br /> <br /> Without flipping between times and places in the last movie, Soderbergh's second installment focuses exclusively on action in the hills and manages to be an even more concealed experience. And, more pretentiously, the score has been drowned out, giving the second installment more of an unwelcome air of artificiality that emerges as alienating. There is just one indelible air boredom for the movie that never lets up. You can't fault Soderbergh's ambition or Del Toro's drive in the lead, it's just a shame that something in the production managed to take such a disappointing trip. **
