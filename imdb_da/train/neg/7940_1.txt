Guy de Maupassant was a novelist who wrote a novel about a man, a poor man, without moral qualities. He only wanted to succeed in a society where all the peoples, the political men, the businessmen, the journalists, the women are corrupt. The only king is money. Maupassant hero Charles Forestier goes higher and higher in the community scale thanks to his seduction bags. He is in love with all the women who could help him in his efforts to climb the founders. At the end of the novel, he married the largest diary owner's daughter in the largest church in Paris: "La Madeleine". "Le Tout Paris" is there. He has a fortune and more, he becomes a member of Parliament and later a minister. The "useless" women are out of sight, but he always keeps in touch with the beautiful and useful women. The image "BEL AMI'S PRIVATE AFFAIRS" is a story of MORALITY. It's all but not a story in the Maupassant idea. Why did they have "BEL AMI" in their title?
