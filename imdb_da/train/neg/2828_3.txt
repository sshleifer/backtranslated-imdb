There seems to have been a number of films like this released during the 70s. And the fact that I can't remember the title of one of them out of hand is a measure of their influence. It is these writers would call "boilers". They are hardly more than a means of keeping movie stars in the public eye. We have Micheal Caine, Peter Ustinov, Omar Sharif, Rex Harrison and William Holden; More than enough names to get pimples on movie theater seats. Every taste in the whole is catered for. Although one suspects that most of the audience still went away disappointed. <br /> <br /> Their talents are simply thrown away, and I wonder that stars with so much money and such a reputation can be so desperate or lacking in common sense. This kind of movie almost doesn't add gilding to a resume. Occasionally, actors may choose their instructor instead of vice versa. <br /> <br /> It was pretty obvious that it would be peeling even from the start. The ridiculously disagreeable jaunty-jazz themed music, which also percolated up whenever any random noise is needed, had the entire atmospheric conviction of elevator Muzak. Who imagined using a jazz band, as a scene depicted the steaming jungles in central Africa or the endless Sahara with camels and palms as a backdrop? Definitely a serious goof ball. Ennio Morricone would have known what to do; and his results would have had enough atmosphere and tension to increase my rating a good two points. This director should have had trouble seeing "Lawrence of Arabia" or even Sergio Leone's western; He could have learned a few things. But then again, probably he wouldn't. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock played the missing wife theme for a good effect in his movie 'Frantic'. It was later recreated with the same panache staring Harrison Ford. In each case, the confusion about her loss and the excitement of the hunt was tangible. Here, when Michael Caine might otherwise be forced to hire a little brain and bravado, Rex Harrison kept popping out of nowhere like some crazy old geniuses to put him back on track when the story stumbled. <br /> <br /> At least, photography was pretty good, with excellent use of the often beautiful environment. But then the stupid music must stir up and blow for atoms, which little atmosphere it created. Action scenes were also constructed and styled with such eerie choreographed battle sequences that they might have been staged in a first-year drama class. And of course, the players have to fight for a jazz accompaniment - as you do. <br /> <br /> And it's about as much comment as this topic deserves. Apart from saying that the manuscript was also rather miserable. <br /> <br /> Stick with your hobby on this one. Although it contained your favorite movie stars, you are sure to be disappointed with it.
