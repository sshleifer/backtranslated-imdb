Horrible, Horrible, Horrible don't waste your money to rent this movie. Its like a low budget made for TV Canadian movie. Absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen and there have been many others out there. This movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the DVD player or VCR. : ~ (Is it possible to write ten lines? The action was horrible, it had absolutely no power, I saw it made for TV movies at the BTK killer and it was much better (in relation to this). was supposed to produce this movie, but if it were to educate us or tell a story about the BTK killer, they missed a mile, which seemed to be more of an animal rights infomercial.
