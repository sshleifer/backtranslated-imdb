Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. However, I feel he was selling to get his first major budgetary role. Foxx follows in the footsteps of Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, all of whom have seen their talents wasted by stereotype producers who believe that black men who commit beautiful crimes are a fun concept (See: Money Talks, Blue Streak ). Okay, I laughed a couple of times, and given all these comedians continue to download fun roles, but I would love to see these guys branches out ala Marlon Wayan's account in Requiem for a dream. Or in Living Color's Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans move performances in Spike Lee's satire Bamboozled.
