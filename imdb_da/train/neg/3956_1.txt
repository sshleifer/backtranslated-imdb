In fact, it's pretty much the same movie. And they couldn't even get the timeline of events right. It was intentional because of laziness or indifference. In any way, this thing is a real woofer. It doesn't even deserve to be called a movie. I saw this as a so-called second function on the disc with the original The Boogeyman. I thought my head would explode and I urge you to go so far in the opposite direction to this thing if you were to curse the accident to fight across that road. It must be provided with a warning mark such as: Warning - may cause your iq to lose more points if you are nearby. For me, there is no doubt that this thing is a 0/10
