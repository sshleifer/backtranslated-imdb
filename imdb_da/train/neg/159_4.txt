I have always admired Susan Sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talents as an actor. Therefore, I found it odd that she would appear in a movie that distorted these facts. Her character rescue from the South Pole was performed by a Canadian charter company from Edmonton, Alberta, flying a Canadian designed and built Twin Otter aircraft. The trip was knocked down by US Airforce, Navy and Coast Guard as well as beyond their capabilities. The same company started a similar rescue a few years later to bring a man out of the South Pole. I feel that the film fairly represented a very poignant subject and documented a very courageous woman with a frightening task. I fail to see why the producers find it necessary to ignore the rescue pilots' courage and show the rescue plan as the USAF Hercules.
