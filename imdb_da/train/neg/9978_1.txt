My girlfriend and I were stunned by how bad this movie was. After 15 minutes we would have called it quit unless we were too curious to see if the movie might redeem itself. It didn't. <br /> <br /> I can't understand the praise given to this movie. The scripture was actually horrible and delivered by some of the worst actions I've seen for a very long time. One thing that particularly annoyed me about this movie was often when people talked to each other there was an unnatural break between the lines. I understand how to use a break to create a sense of awkwardness (as in happiness). It wasn't that kind of break - it was just plain poor conducting. This movie can actually be much better with subtitles, and perhaps the overseas market is the best for this movie because then the inner dialogue and the bad play would not be felt so much. <br /> <br /> I like these types of small quirky movies (The Real Blonde, Walking and Talking, Lovely and Amazing) but this one failed at so many levels that I consider it one of those worst movie I've been through for the last few years.
