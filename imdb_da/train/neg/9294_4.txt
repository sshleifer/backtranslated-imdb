As someone staggered on the incredible "Hero" images, I was eager to watch this movie, which was billed as being on the same lines, but better. It also highlighted an actress I like: Ziyi Zhang. Well, I was disappointed with both counts. I bought the DVD of this movie sight-unseen, and that was a mistake. It wasn't better. <br /> <br /> I realize that these flying martial arts are pure fantasy, but this story has stretched so far past something remotely credible, it just made me shake my head in disappointing disbelief. A blind woman defeating hundreds of opponents? Sorry, it goes a bit far. Also the great male character 'Jin' (Takeshi Kaneshiro) was so annoying with his dialogue, stupid look at his face and silly laughter that he destroyed the movie. <br /> <br /> Despite the wonderful colors and amazing action scenes, this story - for me - just didn't have an appeal to make it a movie worth owning. This movie is not my "Hero"!
