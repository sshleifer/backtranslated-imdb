I just watched this movie in high definition on TV. I am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few movies made about them with physical disabilities. <br /> <br /> First of all, I found the protagonist something noble and captivating. His message of the disabled and the lifetime he used to fight for the recognition and integration of disabled people into the general community's labor market is great. And my problem is not with the real person who did these things. He was a great man. But this film is totally hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the message itself, which it says I found abusive. First of all, they did not throw anyone into a title role with an actual physical disability. Sure they were competent actors, but it seems quite inappropriate to preach about hiring disabled people and then not actually disabled people in the movie. Further enhanced by the fact that in a scene midway through the film one is seen walking on a podium on crutches that apparently only have one leg. But CGI in this scene is so clear that it's shameful. What? They couldn't find a real amputant anywhere for the movie? In a 5 second shot, it was more economically viable to make CGI effects than just RENT a CURRENT amputant? At that time in the film, I found it so deceptive and completely against the message that it tried to convey that I came here to bitch and throw it like the pathetic cripple I am. Figure it out.
