I would have left the movie halfway through if I hadn't been to people who liked it. The movie is based on real events, but it's so over the top that it didn't feel right at all. I have a certain psychological background, are related to many psychotherapists, and have known severely crazy people so it is not that I believe that people like this do not exist. But in the film were the only characters that seemed consistently human, August's father (Alec Baldwin) and the young Augusten (Jack Kaedin). (Although Evan Rachel Wood was an exciting diversion - very sexy with a vicious sense of fun). There were some entertaining moments, but the overall tone of the movie was grim, bizarre and unpleasant. What a waste of an excellent cast! When I saw them through their swing, I just felt that I was looking at a play school. This was brought home under the credits when a few people were shown just sitting there, not acting, not talking. These few moments were more entertaining than the previous 2 hours.
