I watched this movie for a project of love. please tell Nicolas Cage how it would feel for his character and then read the lines he says. My life can't continue ... I've accidentally cut off my own hand ... my brother was nearby. Of course his fault. And since then, happy endings have included the nice guy who takes care of mother sad and alone. No closure, bad script, and not enough extension of minor characters. Save yourself unless you have a good laugh. Costumes were done correctly and extras did a fantastic job. I'm sure it would have been a fun movie to make, but be it more genre-specific, I can't recommend this movie to anyone I know because it's not an intellectual movie. It's not a chick flick. It's not a strict romantic. And I can't show children because of gender and issues to follow. All in all, just not a good flick.
