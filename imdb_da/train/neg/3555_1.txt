Many years ago a movie that went to friend and I went to see a horror movie that we thought would be good because it was the star John Cassavetes. For the uninitiated, John Cassavette was an actor, writer and director (married to actress Gena Rowlands), nominated for Oscar's three times, who wrote and directed a number of good low-budget films using his income as an actor to stay in the air. Until we saw The Incubus, we did not understand that John Cassavete's income was made by any film offered to him. Had we known what the movie was about before we saw it, we could have completely avoided it. But we didn't go out. At that time, my friend and I stated that it was the worst movie ever made. Frankly, it's not true. I've seen many badly made movies on Friday night at Cinemax (I just said it aloud?) That is far worse than Incubus. Almost every movie starring Brian Bosworth is by definition a worse movie than The Incubus. Surely Santa Claus conquers the Martians is a worse movie than The Incubus. However, I have since consistently used The Incubus as a threshold below which I do not want to fall. When I talk to this friend about a movie I may have seen, I will always notice that it was better (or worse) than The Incubus. <br /> <br /> http://thevillagevideot.blogspot.com/
