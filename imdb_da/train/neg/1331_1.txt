The Collusion Course is even worse than the typical "evil white male corporate capitalist" movie of the week. This film is less comfortable than toothache. Jay Leno can act. He is good in his undervalued debut film, The Silverbears, where he gives a performance, consists of his characters' demands. This movie is so bad Leno's character, a devotion, is less annoying than Morita's character, a haughty stupid.
