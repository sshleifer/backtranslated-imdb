I had the feeling that after "Submerged" this would not be better ... I was right. He must be looking for champagne money and don't care about the final product ... his voice is repeatedly called over by a stranger who doesn't sound like him; editing is - well - just a class over amateurish. It's no more than a B or C-grade movie with just enough money to hire a few talented cameramen and an "OK" sound designer. As the previous poster said, the problems seem to come up in the post-production (... voice dubbing, etc.) Too bad, because the plot is actually OK for a SG flick. <br /> <br /> I will never rent another SG flick unless he emails me and asks for forgiveness. <br /> <br /> Too bad - I miss Kelly LeBrock ... <br /> <br /> - jimbo
