Despite its stereotypes, basically "no-name" cast and a apparently low budget, I thought this movie was okay; much better than I expected to be. I was skeptical at first - the idea of ​​a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a bit ridiculous to me. But in the end I thought that the film handled the concept well (though some scenes were a bit clichédic). The cast was quite good, and the two leaders seemed to take their roles very seriously. I couldn't imagine Janine Turner being a bit of a Geena Davis look-a-like. Maybe it's just her face or make-up, the hair and the clothes she had in this movie, but it just got down in the head all the time. <br /> <br /> Although not a "must see" or a big movie of any standard, 'Fatal Error' is an entertaining flick that keeps you in mind until the end.
