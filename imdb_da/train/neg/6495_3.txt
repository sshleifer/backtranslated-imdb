I rented this movie on the benefits of what the trailer showed, and of course Sir Anthony Hopkins. <br /> <br /> If Jackson Pollack teamed up with David Lynch and Timothy Leary to make a movie, it would be the end result. I don't think I've seen a movie like the one who did an LSD trip, resembling an episode of Sesam Street. <br /> <br /> It's a bunch of pieces where the characters blink in and out of reality, or different realities, and the movie doesn't culminate in anything until the last 5 minutes, when it suddenly makes sense. I wrote a scathing review on my movie review blog that essentially gives everything away and I don't want to do it here. It's a well-acted piece of cinema, and the soundtrack is written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, and let me say, if there's a redeeming feature for this movie, it's the music. It fits perfectly. Some of the dialogue is incredibly good and incredibly bad everything. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed parts of this movie, I really did, and when you get to the end of it, you'll actually find out what's really going on. It is unfortunate that you have to wade through 2 hours of fragility to get to a big point, which minimizes the effect of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I give it a 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that real problem with this movie is not the play, that's all.
