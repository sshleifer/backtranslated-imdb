A complete waste of time <br /> <br /> Halla Bol is a complete waste of time. The script and dialogue are poorly written, the direction is dark and the acting limits on hammy. This movie was obviously aimed at the Rang De Basanti audience, but it falls far below the mark because it doesn't even have one of the elements that made RDB connect with its large audience script, great plays, good direction and a strong social message that never was preached but shown. Compared to the near masterpiece, Halla Bol takes a step backwards by resorting to scenes as such, as the hero takes a leak on the villain's Persian rug and the hero's mentor stares down bullets in a truck no less! All of this could have been acceptable in the 80s, as there was a decline in movie quality and bad movies like DivyaShakti and Phool Aur Kaante were big hits, but filmmaking has become increasingly subtle and thoughtful too late. <br /> Rajkumar Santoshi is a skilled instructor, and I appreciate that he will give a social message to every movie he does, but perhaps he simply does not know how to do it! He is fermenting to predictions without paying attention to the public's intelligence to understand what he is trying to say. Perhaps he should just concentrate on entertainment and leave the social messages to Rakeysh Mehras and Aamir Khan's. Although you do not agree with everything I say, you will agree that throughout the screening you will think that Rang De Basanti was much better and Mr.Santoshi should have left the industry bashing to About Shanti Om. Industry-bashing? It is true !! Santoshi has portrayed the industry as a place for backbiting, bitching and casting the couch, which the hero gladly welcomes with a starlet who is curiously called Sania. There are some people who would think these portions show the real face of the industry. Don't believe everything you see! <br /> <br /> All in all, raise your voice against movies like this, and don't use your hard earned money on this bomb. <br /> <br /> * out of ****.
