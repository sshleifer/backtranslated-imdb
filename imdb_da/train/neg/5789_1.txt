My wife and I had really great hopes for this movie, but it was a big disappointment. It was an Indian version of Mr. Magoo. A pathetic father who fails in everything he tries, for example. fishing, hunting, in an obvious way, he teaches his family to his wild fantasies. His "visions" are not only ridiculous, but in the process he many times lies to his son about various obvious things. Words cannot express how bad this movie is. The kids and wife are very real, making the movie even more sad. I don't get humor ... unless you like to laugh at other people who are fooling themselves. I don't understand how this could have come at prices. Save your money, it's not worth renting.
