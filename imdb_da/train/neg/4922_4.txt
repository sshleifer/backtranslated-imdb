DRACULA 2000 is a horror movie that was continuously shown on Sky Movies in the UK and considering that it appeared to be screened about three times a week for a whole year, I have absolutely no idea how I managed to miss it until the first broadcast on the network television tonight. In fact, seeing as I'm not much of a fan of horror movies was the reason enough down to my theory that this would be tripe. My theory was proven mostly <br /> <br /> !!!!! MINOR SPOILERS !!!!! <br /> <br /> What makes the DRACULA 2000 such a bad movie is the amount of silly scripting involved. For example, early in the film, the evil Dracula's coffin flies from London to America (In a twin-turbo plug-in!) And one of the evil boys is standing alone in the hold where Dracula comes alive. A fight breaks out, there is lots of noise, but the bad in the cockpit doesn't sound like a sound before the script requires it. It is also seen in this segment's climax that Dracula can control the weather, but it seems forgotten when the film progresses. Sloppy scripting, and there also seems to be a problem with the structure, where there are many scenes of New Orleans mardi gras characters, so the characters are in a different location such as. Police station in the following scene, then they are back on mardi gras is the scene after that which means the lack of credibility in the plot improved <br /> <br /> There is something else that gave me the chain - Product placement. There are umpteen scenes where the logo for a particular record label / retailer chain is in full view. I dare not publish the company's brand (except that they also run a train company that is a national joke in the UK), but I was under the impression of this kind of advertising was against British television broadcasts and I am surprised that the BBC showed this movie if so <br /> <br /> There are some positives in the DRACULA 2000 as the images, for example. This is actually a nice movie with a beautiful cast and boy were the vampire chicks warm, but that's something we should expect from Hollywood the last few years - A very nice movie that is very stupid
