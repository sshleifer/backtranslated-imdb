No, it's not the horror movie ... This is actually a love story. The ring is a silent film from 1927 that stars two boxers and the woman who comes between them. She loves the boxer known as "One Round" Jack. She loves him until the master comes together, that is. Even though she marries a round, she obviously begins to flirt with the champion until the climactic finals fight between a round and the champ. She comes back to One Round's corner, just as things look their worst, and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the battle and win his wife's love back. <br /> <br /> This movie was very early in Hitch's career, but time constraints must not have made him make a lasting movie. Although there are special movie tricks and some comedy help, this movie doesn't hold anything to his later work. It must have been extremely risqu√© for the time period, however, with the shameless incredible wife. It could have been drawn back in 1927. As you look through all those old movies, it's amazing how I think they could redone on today's screen and really get out. Maybe I'll be the one .... Skip this movie unless you're planning to watch all of Hitchcock's movies. You could fall asleep in the middle.
