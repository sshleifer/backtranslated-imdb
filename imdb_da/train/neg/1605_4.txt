Recently, I saw the documentary film "The Revolution Will Not Be TV", also known as "Chávez: inside the coup". First, I thought it showed a real insight into the events during the Venezuela coup in April 2002. What disturbed me was the fact that the tone of the story and the accompanying music was suggestive and that at no time was criticized about Hugo Chavez. This is peculiar, because if a documentary gives a non-biased statement of what happened, there should have been some of it too. After all, Chávez is certainly not a saint. Fortunately, since the documentary film is several years old, there is much more information on the Internet today and it was not difficult to find, for example. "Urgent inquiry into the Chavez coup from the five European broadcasters who funded the film, presenting incredible lies about Venezuela." It shows the many flaws and intended or unintentional fakes in the documentary. (Just use the title as a search query in Google you find it). Another interesting document was the video recording of a presentation of the results of the many errors in this documentary, "The X-ray of the Onion". For me, it seems to be a good counterweight to "Chávez: Inside the coup". It is available on video.google. I strongly advise you on seeing "Chávez: Inside the coup" to look at "The X-ray of the Onion" and then form your opinion. My conclusion is that Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Brian were (deliberately or not) part of the Chávez propaganda.
