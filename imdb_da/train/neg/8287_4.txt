This is very much a television version of the story, the movie starts as an episode of 'Xena ...', with little meaningful dialogue or character description. It will be a bit more substantive after a while, but all characters are still cartoonish. <br /> <br /> Salma is the exotic beauty. Richard Harris is a vicious and sexually repressed Frollo who tries to bust a nut in Salma. The other characters, including Quasimodo, are completely forgettable. <br /> <br /> It's also a sorta liberal version of the story, Frollo is a suppressor of Enlightenment ideals, as the abbot in 'Rose Name', and Quasimodo's freedom struggle. The shady side of the Quas character is ignored even though he pours liquid on humans. He is really only an outsider because he looks different and enjoys playing with bells more than the average person. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the movie is for kids, but I doubt it, considering that Frollo flogs himself is bloody to change who wants to strut his monkey. A mostly uninteresting and forgettable, but not horrible, and sometimes entertaining, reproduction of the story.
