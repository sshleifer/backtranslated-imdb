Why do I watch movies like this? - except that I have some strange wrong masochistic beliefs that one day I will find a real gem among all this dross, I can't think of a good reason. This movie was dross from start to finish - but semi-hilarious dross. Where else but in a poor Italian dubbed movie you can find heated exchanges of surreal lacking English like this between an honest military type and the outrageous boss of a secret X file as an organization dedicated to saving "The Truth": <br /> <br /> Man in Black: Silence is best for us until we can prove that the UFOs have no bellicose motifs. <br /> <br /> Military type: In any case, I find your disturbance insulting. <br /> <br /> Man in Black: The one who has to impose his will is. <br /> <br /> I rewind the DVD (you know what I mean) half a dozen times, and I still can't make those lines mean all sense. My second fave line was: <br /> <br /> "We can be very hard on those who violate our interests." <br /> <br /> It's English Jim, but not as we know it. <br /> <br /> The other highlights of this dreary punk of a movie for me were the completely unfolded appearance of the photographer's character at first. Saddled with the worst haircut EVER in the history of everything, the man walked straight and looked like an anesthetized fish in a bad gem to kidnapped and forced to look at a piece of plexiglass by some foreigners. Foreigners are most effectively not seen as a POV shot - handheld camera with a fish eye lens - kind of creepy first time, but used over and over it lost its power (coincidence, if it is a Point of View shot, it means foreigners always leave the rooms behind for some reason. <br /> <br /> The movie was put in "England". This meant that the Spanish Italian set of designers put some British number plates on a few English cars and put a Union Jack on our hero's press card ... and that was about it. No other attempt to make it look like Britain. <br /> <br /> Favorite moment? When Foley artists did not see the signs they were foleying (is there such a word?) No longer went to gravel, but were now on the lawn so their feet continued to make high "crunch! Crunch!" sounds. Other than that, another total waste of 90 minutes in my life. I hope they show that these UFOs have no bellicose motifs soon ...
