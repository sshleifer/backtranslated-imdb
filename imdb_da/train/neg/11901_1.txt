"Land of Plenty" is not a movie. It is a tombstone for the German director Wim Wender's career. <br /> <br /> Many felt it in the "Million Dollar Hotel" and now the "Land of Plenty" makes it quite clear; Not only has Wenders lost it, he has actually become a poor director, creating terribly weak and superficial stories and scenes. One can argue that "the time you lose it" comes for every director, but Wenders's case is extreme. It's as if he totally forgets everything he knew about the cinema and started again - only to get bad results. <br /> <br /> In a few words, this movie does not deserve your time.
