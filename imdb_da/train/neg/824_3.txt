Gene Hackman gets busted out of prison by a nameless state body who wants him to murder. Of course, it is given that Hackman has the skilled skills for the job. <br /> <br /> No one tells him anything he is given as the audience gets bits and pieces of information. It should be exciting, instead it is annoying and boring. <br /> <br /> Hackman goes through with the mission, but the escape is messed up and the guy at the top of this mysterious unit arranges all the dead to cover it. So everyone dies in the cast and at the end you don't really care. <br /> <br /> One of the other reviewers pointed out that the movie was originally twice as long, almost three hours, and chopped quite a bit. Perhaps something was really lost in the translation, but I tend to believe it was a compassion on the audience. <br /> <br /> A very talented cast that had people like Richard Widmark, Candice Bergen, Mickey Rooney, Eli Wallach, and Edward Albert are so thoroughly wasted here, it's a crime. <br /> <br /> And we never find out what federal agency did all this, the FBI, CIA, DEA or even the IRS.
