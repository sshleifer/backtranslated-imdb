I remember back when I was little when I was out in the camp and we wanted to campout under the stars. There was always someone who wanted a good story to tell that involved the forest that surrounded us, and they would always crawl out. Well, when I found Wendigo in the library, I checked it out and hoped to be one of those movies that had a supernatural being that scared people in the woods, like the stories told at the camp. Well, to my dismay, I was so far from the truth. Wendigo is really bad. The story starts when a family of three drives to their winter cabin, resembling your normal suburban home and nothing like a cabin in the woods, and they run into a deer. It seems that the local rednecks actually searched for this particular deer and are rather upset by our townspeople. The movie spends too much time following the families everyday activities instead of getting to the point in the movie. It was only in the last 15 minutes that we actually have some actions involving "wendigo". My suggestion is that you become very far away from this movie. It will leave you wanting your and half an hour back.
