By far the most important requirement for any movie that follows confidence-stickers is that at least occasionally they must be able to pull one on us, as well as their stupid characters, the police, the mob and (ideally) each other. But this movie never pulls it off. Every scam can be seen as a kilometer away (especially the piglet!) Neither are they very interesting, intricate or sophisticated. Perhaps the mother hoped to compensate for this with snappy dialogue and complex psychological relationships. If so, he failed. The lines are okay, but they are delivered in such a stylish, unnatural, stylized way that I thought maybe some smart point was being made about all of us all the time ... but it wasn't. Regarding the psychological complexity, the protagonist is a little repressed and makes some ridiculously forced freudian ties about her father because she is a whore but she comes across it. I really liked the street scene. Looked like an Edward Hopper painting.
