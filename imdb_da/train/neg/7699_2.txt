I expected a comedy like "Big Mama" movie. Instead, the movie was a bizarre mix of comedy, drama and a love story. <br /> <br /> This movie has three plots: The first involves Madea and her takes in foster children. The second involves a woman who is engaged to a rich man who abuses her. The third involves a relationship between a single mother with 2 children and a single father. There is actually very little comedy in the movie. There are also a number of very twisted messages in the movie. For example, Madea beats the foster child with a belt (in a comical way) to convince the child to straighten out. The child is really moving around. Apparently it pays to beat children. <br /> <br /> There are grounds dealing with rape (with mother's consent). There are scenes with old men ogling young girls who are related to them. (The ogling takes place through a family reunion.) The movie jumps from plot to plot so you are always out of balance. Is it a comedy, a love story or a drama? It's actually nothing ... except the waste of time and money.
