I just watched this movie on Flix after hours-taping it. I grew up watching F Troop and had a big hard for Wrangler Jane so I was shocked, literally shocked to find out after watching this movie that the degenerate homicidal nurse was Melody Patterson, who looks good but also looks completely different and is unfortunately poorly photographed. I would never have guessed that it was her for a million years. What the hell is she doing on a picture like this? I agree with the guys here that the movie is missing what it is pushing. No sex, no doing, no right. It is also a remake of Atomic Brain aka Monstrosity (1964 or so). Most of the action is boring; The protagonist spends huge amounts of time running around in the mad doctor's house and basement, and in the neighborhood in general, or being dug up by the policeman, all boring and time-consuming. Now, if the Italians would have done this, half of the movie would have been Slingblade / Uncle Ernest / Jack Elam henchman who smuggled the unconscious naked girls. But you only get it for 20 seconds.
