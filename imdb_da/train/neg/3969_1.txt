I write this because I somehow felt led to believe that Dark Remains was a good movie. Although it's not the worst I've seen, it's certainly not good. <br/> <br /> A weak script, weak actors and weak instructions. Even if they can't afford a big name, would it be too much to ask for a more attractive lead tax? It was painful to see a clean actress through the movie with her boring performance. The story was a clich√© and badly written. The special effects were minimal. The "suspense" tricks that were used repeatedly were difficult to swallow. To be fair, Dark Remains is no worse than many Masters of Horrors episodes. But not quite on par with quality film yet. Dark Remains is only recommended for hardcore horror fans who will not miss any movie in the genre, even if it is badly made. As for everyone else, the time should be spent on something more valuable - which should be extremely easy.
