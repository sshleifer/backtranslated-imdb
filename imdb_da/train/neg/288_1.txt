There was nothing of value in the original movie, one was even lame. The fact that I even found that renting was absolutely fantastic. Anyone associated with this movie must be high on anything! So what was the story line? What was with the girl? Should the viewer get the story in the first four minutes of the movie. Unfortunately, I tried several times to see this. I even borrowed a child from someone to get some feedback. Kid said it was stupid and he was four years old. I find that maybe some credit could go to the film director, which may have some of the pictures made the movie more than a B movie. It may be pushing it. I loved the theme song. Good thing, it was only a dollar, it was worth it. I suppose you might like the movie if you were tall as cast and the crew should be. Is the pot legal in France?
