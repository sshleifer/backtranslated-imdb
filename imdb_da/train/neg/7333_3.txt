I enjoyed the feeling of opening a few minutes, but 20 minutes in I used the liberal quick button. Too many shots from Stewart (Michael Zelniker) go from room to room, down the hall, through doors and down the street, and so many shots of him are looking after and confused. Gave me the impression that the story had originally been termed a short (20-30 minutes), and then stretched out into a function of love work between director Grieve and star Zelniker (they wrote the manuscript together). <Br /> <br /> It could have been more entertaining if any of the characters had something to say that I hadn't heard in many other movies before, or if the ending was not - disappointing - the one I had predicted three minutes into the movie (atypical for an independent / smaller studio movie). At least the heart was in the right place - it was not your standard Hollywood manipulative nonsense.
