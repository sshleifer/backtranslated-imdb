OK, we all love the thousand dukes, but what is it about this cast. Let's start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there's no country about this girl and Daisy wasn't ditzy! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest to look like the original. No offense to Burt, but I have never noticed that Boss Hog is so high. It was part of Boss Hog's humor was his size. Did they even try someone like Danny Devito?!? OK, now get it, they threw Jessica Simpson, took someone a look at her husband? He matches Luke Duke to a tee !!!!!! Cleary these manufacturers did not look at the appearance of the old cast members. The screen was never present on the dukes !! This made the movie a trip from the beginning. I give this a huge thumbs down.
