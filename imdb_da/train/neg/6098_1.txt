Scotty (Grant Cramer, who would continue to star in the big B movie "Killer Klowns from outer space") agrees to help three middle-aged guys learn to "dialogue" the ladies in this bad 80's comedy. Not bad as in the 80's lingo, which meant good. Poor as in bad. With no similar signs, including, but not limited to, a child who is the most freakiest-looking guy since "Friday the 13th part 2" "a girl who leads men and then goes into hissy suits when they will touch her, and token fat gossip, for what would an 80-year-old sex comedy be without a fat hit?
