I didn't know what to expect from the movie. Well, now I know. This was a really horrible movie. The play, instruction and action were just as bad. The story was stupid and stupid. The director could have made a smart and thought-provoking movie, but he didn't. I squirmed in my seat in the last half of the movie because it was so bad. Where was the focus on the movie? Where was something in this movie? Christians should boycott this movie instead of promoting it. It was rarely finished and wasted my money. Don't watch this movie.
