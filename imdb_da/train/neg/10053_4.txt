A little girl's death body is found cut off by all possible means of identification. When one leg is found to be longer than the other, it is believed to be the body of a couple's missing daughter. After this trauma, the couple separates and the mother becomes dependent on sedatives and leads a miserable existence. All this changes when one day, many years later, she receives a phone call from her daughter! With the help of an ex-cop and a reporter, she sets out on a journey to determine if her daughter is actually living. "Los Sin Nombre" is a root plot-wise, moving at a painfully slow pace, and is completely rude. The saving grace is Emma Vilarasau, who does an excellent job as the desperate mother. The best part of the movie is the end, but I'm not sure it's worth maintaining the rest of the movie. Beware of the English subtitles on the latest R1 release - they are not very accurate.
