This is a decent effort, but the guy who wrote the script seems to be a bit in the dark, what exactly makes a zombie movie cool. No, it's not CGI errors and software companies. In fact, I'm not sure if it was a software company - I saw it without subtitles, so I had to guess what they were talking about. Still, my point - instead of wasting your time animating a stupid ass error - is why not throw more zombies and more action. 2/3 of the 20 minutes consist of news bulletins, bugs, some guys shouting for something. And to make matters worse (more boring), most deaths occur off-screen. I realize it's too common for non-budget movies, but then there were some very impressive effects (good, kind-one) that left me wondering why the director (or scriptwriter, anything) chose to focus on how the epidemic started - It's short, no one is going to fit anyway.
