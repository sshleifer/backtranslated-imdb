After seeing Koyaanisqatsi two or three dozen times and loving every second of it, I finally got a chance to see the successor Life in Transformation. I was really disappointed as it hardly stood up to the high standards of the first. 90 minutes of people with baskets are not my idea of ​​a good movie. Philip Glass's score for this had neither the beauty nor the correlating strength of the first. Compared to Koyaanisqatsi, this movie seemed slow and meaningless. A water version of Baraka, which is the same idea but made better. I really hope that the third film in this series does not follow the example of this waste.
