How is it possible that no journalist or critic reminded us of the similarity with the second better Flemish film "Congo Express (1986)"? There are also some signs in the congo express composed without having a relative relation to one another: Jean, the Congolese, the workman, the two taxi drivers, the street singer Roger, Guy, Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course Tom Barman is a star, and Luc Gubbels was not. It should not be a reason to apologize for the shortcomings of the script (if there is a script), no matter where the wind is blowing. The wit (the only one!) At the party on the ice in the fridge is taken from the great Flemish film "De Witte (1934)", where De Witte puts too much salt on the potatoes. Some accidents happen in the movie, but there is no explanation. Tom Barman gives us here a movie that is more like an experiment to watch on television than a movie for the theaters. Another missed opportunity for Flemish cinema.
