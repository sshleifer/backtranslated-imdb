I live in Salt Lake City and I'm not a Mormon, so why did I rent this movie? Well, because I live in Utah and thought it would be nice to see places I know in a movie. I really knew going into it that I wouldn't get inside jokes so I wasn't surprised when I sat with the deer in the headlights staring. What I was surprised at was the non-Mormon actions that were placed in this movie. I know it's a Mormon movie that fits the members of the LDS Church, but I found it offensive because of the typical stereotype of people who are not of their faith. Every non-Mormon who was not many drank, smoked and had a great egoism attitude, why? It really crossed me on this movie, they made the Mormons so clean, but the rest of Utah's state I think is full of punk psychos, just because they don't follow the scriptures in the LDS church. <br /> <br /> I can understand that the plots are all LDS members, but you think Salt Lake City was 100% Mormon, which is not even close to being the truth. And as I said, the non-Mormons in the movie were portrayed as drunken jerks, thank you! <br /> <br /> I don't think I just get it because I don't belong to your faith, and I never think I will.
