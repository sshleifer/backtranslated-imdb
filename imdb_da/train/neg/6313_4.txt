Now it is not often that we in the UK have made a film about the inner city life from the perspective of the Afro-Caribbean community. The last example I remember was the underrated Babylon road back in 1980. So I had high expectations when I heard about Bullet Boy, a movie that has been spied on as the British version of La Haine! Now La Haine it is not! I agree that the use of dialogue and the environment gives this movie a authenticity that has been missed in other British movies too late, but my concern is that this movie is unfortunately predictable. <br /> <br /> The movie handles intelligent escalating problem of black on black violence, which unfortunately is far too common in London, but I'm worried that filmmakers now use type casting in plot as opposed to characters that are just as harmful. Saul Dibb had a great opportunity to make a movie that could be both entertaining and inspiring to all of us, but unfortunately missed and created a movie that only reinforces the idea of ​​being a young black man in London, the only future is violence and tragedy
