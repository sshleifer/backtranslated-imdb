I didn't know Willem Dafoe was so hard for money that he would argue with such a shocking hamming in this monstrosity. Hell: I'll donate the money I was going to send to Ethiopia if he's so desperate. I have never seen such a pathetic and obnoxious movie for a long time ... who paid for this? They either draw some tax or fraud. A 5-year-old would be ashamed of the plot, and I'd rather get cancer than sitting through more than the hour I already suffered. All those involved should be unlocked for one year in the sodomism of a third world prison. Avoid at all costs. I would give it minus 10 if possible ... unbelievable.
