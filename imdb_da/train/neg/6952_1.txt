The most horrible tale of a great series. It should not have been named Battlestar Galactica because it is only the same in the name alone. Too many changes have only changes. You have characters from man to woman, black to asian to cylon in a way to "attract female audience" as there were already strong female characters who could just be stronger. Gone is the Egyptian feeling. Gone is the search for the earth. The lack of cylons to go to terminator rejections takes away from the movie, especially when you are made a fembot. Granted the original show had a lot of cheese for it, but it had a great following. They tried to hold on to the following but give the fans nothing to work with and spit in their face, as they make it "their own story". Changes are good when doing something better, not just making them.
