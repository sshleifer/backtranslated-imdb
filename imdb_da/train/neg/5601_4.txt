I only saw this because it was directed by Lucio Fulci and highlighted Claudio Cassinelli, an actor I like. I was definitely disappointed. The idea that condemned prisoners would fight to death for television reviews has been exaggerated with Rollerball, Logans Run, Blade Runner and the new movie Death Race, which will surely suck me in because it's stars Jason Statham. <br /> <br /> This was just a drilling for the most part. The "Kill Bike" action was ridiculous. The "training" was a snooze party. It never grabbed me and made me break into anyone, including "Dallas" star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson. Choose one of the others mentioned and you get better.
