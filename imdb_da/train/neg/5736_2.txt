This is one of the worst movies I've seen this year !! You could randomly pick 5 people out of the streets and they could trade better than anyone in this movie. Absolutely a waste of time watching it. I only gave the 2 that I like gory movies, but it's just plain nonsense. The actor (and I use this phrase very loosely) is scary, someone telling me that the 5 main players in this made their first movie ever ?? Don't waste your time watching this. Hostel was a better movie somehow. I can't believe anyone has spent money doing this. I hope for the sake of the manufacturers that it only costs $ 50,000 to make - it looks like a school project made by children who have no idea. Did it even make it to the cinema ??
