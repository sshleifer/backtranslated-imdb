Tara Reid as an intellectual, Christian Slater (usually great) like a dollar store Constantine and Stephen Dorff as ... Now it is STEPHEN DORFF FOR CHRIST MESSAGE !!!! Personally, I just want to thank the brilliant casting directors for the hard work and work. They are on. Here's an idea, just my humble little opinion as the film becomes public, but it follows directly with your previous choices. A film about the most glorious neurophysicist in history invents a pill to cure all diseases that are ever known to man and get it Heres The clincher they are to play by Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I knew you would love it. Seriously, even if you owe me $ 7.50.
