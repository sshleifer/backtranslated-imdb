I gave this 4 stars because it has many interesting themes many have already mentioned. From domestic violence, sexuality and many of the taboos in it. Without gore, I really wouldn't call this horror as much as I wanted science fiction. It's gloomy, depressing and hopeless. Although I don't mind a weird ending, I am really very tired of the "human sucking" clich√© that is central to every movie. I know you cannot get a degree of liberal arts today without bending against self-hatred as a member of humanity, but how is it as a writer / instructor we are doing as if we are different than everyone else in the package and note that ALIENS KILLING Human RACE is evil! Right now, if you read this and believe that humanity deserves to die, just go out, find a lake and swim 'until your arms are tired. This way, you won't be around to lead the next movie or write the next book that tells me I deserve to die to be alive. It's stupid, not thought-provoking and boring.
