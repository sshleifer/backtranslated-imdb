Iberia is nice to watch TV. But why see this in silver screen? Lots of dancing and music. If you like classical music or modern dance, it may be your date movie. But otherwise, an hour and a half is too long. If you like watching talented dance in silver screen, it is better to watch Bollywood movies. They know how to combine breathing with dancing into a long movie. Director Carlos Saura knows how to shoot dance from old experience. And sometimes it looks really good. But when the movie is one and an hour, it should be at least most of the time interesting. There are many kinds of art, not everything is bigger than life, and this movie is not too big.
