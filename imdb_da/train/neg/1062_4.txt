Ouch! This one was a little painful to sit through. It has a sweet and entertaining premise, but it all goes to hell from there. Matthew Modine is almost always pedestrian and annoying, and he does not disappoint in this. Deborah Kara Unger and John Neville were surprisingly decent performances. Alan Bates and Jennifer Tilly played it among the top. I know that's the way the parts were written, and it's hard to blame actors when the manuscript and director have them doing such schlock. If you want outrageous characters, it's okay, but you need good material to make it work. It didn't work here. Run away screaming from this movie if at all possible.
