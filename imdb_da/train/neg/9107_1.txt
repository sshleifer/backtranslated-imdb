I was sad someone made this movie. I was even more angry I lost valuable minutes in my life that sat still to see this. I could have had a wax job and been more entertained. At least Cherri makes me laugh before it hurts. I was a little confused at first, but then I got hold of and realized what was going on. At this point, the movie was halfway through, and yes I am a procrastinator, but I always want to see things through to the end. So I stuck it out, I saw it all. Not only are the actors not as attractive as in horrible intentions, they are just not convincing. I have seen my nephew cry for attention more convincingly than the supposed desire portrayed on the screen of this movie. If you like bad movies with bad acting, see this.
