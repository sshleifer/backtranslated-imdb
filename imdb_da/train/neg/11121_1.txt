I really can't understand how could anyone give this obnoxious movie more than 1 star ... How do you like such a retarded movie where all animal abuse scenes are real? I do not even want to imagine the relentless pain, the innocent and defenseless living beings felt in these terrible moments ... Jesus ... What kind of "human" would torture them without reason or just for money? I tell you that the director is either mentally retarded or he is just a monster with a "heart" of stones. Or both. He really deserves to have his hands cut off and burning alive. <br /> <br /> It contains various horrible barbaric scenes that can cause shock, especially for sensitive people and children: a real seed is shining alive, fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water, a dog is beaten, birds Thrown into the water ... <br /> <br /> This movie is more than horrible; It must be the worst and most retarded movie ever made with someone called "Cannibal Holocaust" or something similar. I will never see or buy any movie directed by this heartless monster. No one should waste their time watching it, especially when there are many really good movies out there where all animal abuse scenes are staged. Fortunately, only a few people liked this - which is natural, as it is the worst movie ever - so it failed. I hope it will make the retarded instructor realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to real animals will never be praised and that he will provide all animal abuse scenes in his subsequent films. I really think everyone receives, but what they give! There will be a day when all the retarded and cruel '' people '' will feel the same pain they once inflicted on others. <br /> <br /> However, this is probably my only negative negative review. I don't usually comment on a movie if I don't like it, but this time I just couldn't stop. I had to speak the truth because animal cruelty must stop!
