What a load of leftist Hollywood bilge. This film glorifies myths as brave and noble if it is for pacifist principles. The adventure ends with the pacifist character Danzel Washington plays and is actually promoted for his betrayal. What about these Hollywood tools? Is this still repaid for McCarthyism? <br /> <br /> If I sound cynical, it's because I'm tired of movies with a political agenda. Military brass in this movie is portrayed as what more? Gung-ho war memorial. Sounds good? Have you ever seen a movie where the CIA or a state agency is not hurt? Think about it. Once again, the Crimson Tide emphasizes the point. The Hackman character, U-boat captain Ramsey, crosses like a ravaging lunatic until the end, when, of course, appears, makes a complete 360, rejects his bloodstream, proposes a promotion for the treacherous Ron Hunter, and repents by resigning from the service. A four-legged commander, commanding your boat, puts the United States in serious danger of receiving a nuclear focus, and you promote him ???? What mushrooms!
