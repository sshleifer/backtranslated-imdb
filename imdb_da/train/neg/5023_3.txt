No one, but no one, could chew nature as the divine, Ruth Elizabeth Davis, and "Elizabeth and Essex" are a good example. Even though she surrenders the part at times, look at her when she presents about Raliegh, who writes the lyrics to a song that her ladies are waiting to play: at one moment she makes us understand how Elizabeth could rule and rule completely! At other times she finished the script's sappiness. When Elizabeth is to be vulnerable, she comes out as weak and sharp. This has the extra effect of undermining her authority: when she blows her stack and threatens to distribute justice, it is difficult to take her seriously. <br /> <br /> Flynn exudes charm and makes us see how Essex was able to snake his way into Elisabeth's heart, but he is completely inept by conveying man's complexity and pure evil. Nor does it help Essex to be poorly attributed. Why is he this hothead who wants to overthrow his queen - even when he swears faith in her - except that he is more blood-blooded and thus more "worthy" to rule? And why does Raliegh Elizabeth betray her and Essex letters? He has no risk of falling out of favor and we know where Essex (and his head) are heading. So why does he risk his own head by speeding up the inevitable? <br /> <br /> What did Curtiz do with all the $$$ he got? He doesn't even interfere with trying to hide that his fighting scenes are being shot at a solid stage. He should have finished it with Elizabeth the first time alone at The Tower; everything else that follows (especially the last scene between her and essex) is unnecessary. The costumes are amazing. And is it me, or does Bette look just like Susan Sarandon?
