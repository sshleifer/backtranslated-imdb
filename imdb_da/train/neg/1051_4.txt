Although Frank Loesser's songs are some of the finest Broadway has to offer, they are bollixed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz's lethargy and uninspired presentation - when it is over, it almost doesn't feel like you've seen a musical. Mankiewicz does not seem to know how to present Loesser's challenging but melodious melodies for maximum effect: for example, one of the best songs, showstopping'Adelaide's Lament, ends by having Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) belt out in the final while sitting on a chaise lounge; and Stubby Kayes faux-spiritual `Sit down, you are Rockin 'The boat' has its trunk in folding chairs while he simply stands there. Mankiewicz zaps all the fun out of everything by letting static scenes go too long, and his dialogue (adapted from Abe Burrow's stage book) has none of the pictures his movie like 'All About Eve' has. Part of the blame should go to the leaders, almost all of whom are miscast: Marlon Brando looks confused as to why he is in a musical, Frank Sinatra plays too good a guy and has none of the edge that makes him so crucial ( the songs are not tailored to his style) and Jean Simmons hardly records the way a Shirley Jones can. Only Blaine, like the beloved showgirl Adelaide, commands our attention as a Broadway pro should. The colorful art direction is created by Joseph Wright and Howard Bristol the showy sets.
