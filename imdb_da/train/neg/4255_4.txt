The film opens with a beautiful lady in a tattered white dress running through a stereotypical Eastern European city. We know that she is being followed by something because she keeps looking behind her. And soon we see that she is being chased by a mysterious man in a black trench coat. Then we realize that the man is actually the vampire hunter, and he is after her. but see is that her reflection in the shop window ??? no it's just her identical twin vampire! but unfortunately they both get it. <br /> <br /> After this brilliant and incredibly fun throwback to the old hammer movies from the 60s and 70s (in the credits, the twins are listed as twins of evil, which is, of course, the name of the final pass in the hammer's carnival trilogy), the plot dies largely. <br /> <br /> What little plot is involved with dracula (which comfortably changes its appearance every time he is reborn, so the manufacturer does not 'you must rehire the same dracula) comes to a morning they with students realize that he is undead and thinks .... wow what option, maybe i just want to ignore all the movies that say that drinkampire blood makes you a vampire and use the vampire's blood to find a cure for our tremors disease. It is of course a mistake and everyone becomes a vampire. <br /> <br /> A new concept, but haunted. The movie stops creating amazing situations and refuses to do anything with them. <br /> <br /> For example, students try to bring drac back to life by placing him in a bathtub filled with blood in a remote country mansion. The house itself is scary enough to be the center of the movie, but will we stay there? no because they decide to take the vampire to an abandoned swimming pool. sigh. This movie has a real problem with "homages" that I mentioned before the opening scene is straight out of the hammer and this house scene would have been perfect for a hammer-like movie, but the movie shifts quickly and changes into a medical horror. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that they introduce so many characters, it's almost impossible to be bored by any of them. There are fellow students and their wheelchair bound professor type "friend", the fellow students are all: arrogant, boring, money hungry and stupid. How they did it with the school amazes me unless the co-school had to meet its muscular hunk / big breast quota. And then there is the vampire hunter who remains mysterious through the movie. hi i can respect it but it would be nice if they didn't set it up as if the movie were about him. Then you have random priests, police and science types. So many people are introduced and then quickly forgotten until they need the person either to save the day or jump to a cheap scare that it quickly becomes boring. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is a lazy movie. No real scares, just a few predictable jump scares. The setup for these is so detailed, it's fun. For example, bath tubs full of blood. It is so obvious that the dragon will come out of the dark blood. and yet we have to wait far too long to get to the inevitable fright. after that he kills one of the stupid and bigger breasted with the students. we all know she will be one of the undead. but what do the others do? bury her in a low tomb near the house. sigh, so you know who will jump on you when the police pop up in the house ......... <br /> <br /> Oh yeah. <br /> <br /> Perhaps someone will get the hint that it's impossible to make a scary vampire movie and just go to atmospheric, and then we'll end up with a whole movie that's as good as the opening scene. <br /> <br />
