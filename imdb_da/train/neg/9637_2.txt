Boy, it was a miserable movie! Although I have not seen all of the Burton / Taylor collaboration, I can confidently say this is the worst. This rich but sick woman (Taylor, of course) owns this beautiful island in the Mediteranean, which ruled a mandatory staff when she is suddenly visited by this travel poet who walks platitudes. In fact, the whole movie is just a talk, with a lot of talk without meaning. Even in 1968, no one could make heads or tails of this pretentious nonsense, and the time course made it even more clear. If it wasn't for the beautiful movie and scenery, it would deserve a negative review. The only thing that this movie is good for is its unintentional grin at the expense of the stars.
