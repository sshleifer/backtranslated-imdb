This movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I study French in college and thus understand the whole dialogue, so the language barrier was not a problem. I have to say that it is really hard to empathize with any of the characters depicted in the movie. There is only one professional actor in the cast and I don't guess professional directors or writers. Although I have rated it 1 out of 10, it's probably not that bad. This is only a disadvantageous effort to lower its current overall rating of 7.3 to something more realistic. Perhaps 4.3 would be a more accurate assessment because the movie is a true non-event 100 minutes or so in the long run that you will never come back. The real shame is that I'm sure some college students are busting their nut making a movie twice as good and half the length. But if you want to join the bandwagon that seems to be rolled around imdb, you might as well give "10 in Translation" a 10 too.
