I didn't think it would be possible for Joe Don Baker to make a movie as bad as his stink bomb 'Mitchell', but it succeeds. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it if you are a fan of Joe Don Baker's VERY better work. But if you like to watch fat guys sweat and really, really drawn gunfights, you'll love this movie.
