This film, originally released in Christmas 1940, was long thought lost. A very bad copy is rebuilt and made for a CD, now for sale. Don't Buy It! The movie is incredibly horrible. The casting is poor, the manuscript is terrible, and the steering is terrible. <br /> <br /> Picture Roland Young singing and dancing. And that was the highlight. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this movie was deliberately gone.
