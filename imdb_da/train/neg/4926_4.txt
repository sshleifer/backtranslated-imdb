I watched this movie for 2 reasons - I like Gerard Butler and Christopher Plummer. Unfortunately, these poor men were forced to wear a rather silly movie. I liked the idea that Dracula is actually a reincarnation of Judas Iscariot, because it explains his contempt for all things Christian, but there was so much camp that this idea was not realized as much as it could have been. I see this movie more as a way for the talented Gerard Butler to pay his bets before being recognized and a way for the legendary Christopher Plummer to remind the public (me and the 5 other people who saw this movie) that he still exists. I actually enjoyed the special features of the DVD more than the movie itself.
