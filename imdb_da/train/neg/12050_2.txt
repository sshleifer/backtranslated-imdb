I had read a few positive reviews of this movie and was really surprised at how terrible it was. Placed as some cross between an AIDS-related story and a kind of "Ghost" / "Blithe Spirit" tale, this movie cannot always make it sensible what it will be. <br /> <br /> Simon and Mark are a gay couple who have an "open" relationship - Simon is able to have anonymous (but sure) sex on the side whenever he wants. Mark is HIV + and he and Simon don't seem to have a sex life anymore. When Mark dies, Simon - who is used to closing his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father - is trying to erase his memory and just continue to be a bachelor. Not that his behavior before Mark's death was very different. But Markus returns in ghost form and feels his various trysts, while Simon opens up and admits his true feelings. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Simon is such a selfish SOB, it is impossible to feel any empathy for him for most of the movie. At that time, he should be more sympathetic, it's too late to care about. Mark, on the other hand, follows in Demi Moore's footsteps from "Ghost" by crying violently throughout the film. <br /> <br /> There is a bizarre shift in tone after Mark returns. Suddenly we get some lame attempts at humor, and let the television show "Bewitched". But it doesn't take long. When Simon's emotional health is at stake, the whole thing becomes more and more soft, with amateurish attempts to push your heartbeat. The final, with a gilded muscle boy's angel, steering a tower of Mark to heaven, while a bull-ridden Simon waves farewell are just stupid, mainly because it's not intentionally fun.
