This movie fails to capture any of the mysteries and intrigues that the book offers. The main point of the book, the insights, is hardly even touched, leaving the viewer exactly why everyone is doing so much about them and why they are willing to risk their lives. <br /> <br /> Sign development is not good at all. No background or personal development leaves the audience right at all to worry about what happens to them, so the action sequences fall. <br/> <br /> The search for the manuscripts ends abruptly and without any real explanation, leaving no satisfaction with what the whole search was for. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst adaptations of a book I've ever seen. It is terrible and a waste of time. If you haven't read the book, skip the movie and read it. If you've read the book, skip the movie and read it. <br /> <br /> It's almost as if the point of making the movie was to discredit the book, it's so badly done and ridiculous this movie is. It is also a shame because it could have been good if they had capitalized on it at the height of success, and they would probably have been able to get a good screenwriter and some good actors. <br /> <br /> Please don Don't waste your time, READ THE BOOK !!!
