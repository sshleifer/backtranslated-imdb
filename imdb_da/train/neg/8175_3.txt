The mood of this movie is pretty good, and it captures the feel of the 80s well with some good performances. <br /> <br /> But ..... <br /> <br /> The script is run by the mill with the exception of a few comedic moments and comes out as strange as I expect it was meant to Be edgy. The characters are completely over dramatized and incredible and full of right-wing cliches that the scriptwriter is likely to see a panorama documentary on the national front. The biggest problem is that this movie has no real story. It marks all the right "arty" boxes, but nothing happens, and in the end you are left to wonder what the meaning was. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing
