I knew my summary would get you. How is this movie like a Pet Rock and Disco?! Well, unless you lived through the 1970s or 80s, you probably can't understand why someone wants a new cola or own a pet rock (and honestly, at least in the case of pet rocks, I still don't quite understand ). They are just a few things that seemed to make sense at the time, but really confuse the younger generation. The same can be said for Kay Kyser and his band. At that time (mostly in the 1940s) they were very popular and had enough complaint that the studio stared them with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre in this movie. But if you didn't live at that time (it was good before my time), you wonder why someone liked this kind of "entertainment". After all, Kyser and his bandmates are incredibly unpleasant and their humor is very, very broad (ie, unsophisticated and cheesy). Frankly, I couldn't keep their antics either, I didn't appreciate that there were just too many music tracks in the movie. Because of these factors, the large support aids were given the back seat, and fans of these actors would probably be disappointed. <br /> <br /> The movie involves Kyser and the band coming to a mansion where a young lady and her wacky aunt live. Once there, the bridge is washed out and strange events begin. Eventually, it culminates in some attempts at Sally's life and a seance (of slaughter). It's all played for laughs - and it's not really a horror movie despite the cast. All in all, it's the best entertainment at best. Like a Lugosi and Karloff fan, I was sure to cheat to see Kyser and his kink head.
