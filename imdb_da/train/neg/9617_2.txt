Three years ago, Rachel (Therese Fretwell) joined the lake with her friends when her brother dropped out of a boat and drowned. Rachel's friends think it's time for her to stop beating and blaming something she doesn't have control over. Then grab the pier and something to chew and go back to the same lake that has been in Rachel's constant nightmare. As expected, a carnage is already started when two of the friends are splashed before even going to the party. This flick has the feeling of a high school where everyone has forgotten their lines and "whistled it" ... very bad! Author Marcos Gabriel gave himself the most caring role as Rachel's girlfriend Leo. Outside of Fretwell and Gabriel, there is something beautiful and a few signs you would like to choke off the crap before they become "offed". Draws attention to a few players who had the nerve to look like: Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves. This is a MEMORIAL DAY you don't mind missing.
