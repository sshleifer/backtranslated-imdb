Many themes or parts of the story are the same as in Leon, as other parts felt like another movie, I do not know, but there is a well-known feeling throughout the film. It was nice to see, but it would have been great! If the story would have been more original. The theme of little girl, killed killer from Leon, has just been slightly adjusted. The opening scenes are really good :-) It's strange that people like to fight in the kitchen, in the movies :-) My biggest problem was remembering which parts were from Leon, Nikita and if they were from the French or American version . If you haven't seen Leon, it's a good movie. If you liked this movie, then I can recommend Leon. <br /> <br /> Regards / Rick
