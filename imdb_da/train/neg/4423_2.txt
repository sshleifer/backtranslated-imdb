Another of many almost forgotten films was printed out of poverty line in the 1930s, risen by the magic of DVD. <br /> <br /> Credits Universal plays Lionel Atwill (often a supportive actor in several Frankenstein films) as a couple of twins involved in a murder racket. You kill the victims (stockbrokers involved in a scam) and ask witnesses of the exact time while the other is deaf and is proven "innocent" because he could not have spoken to witnesses. Of course, when it falls apart, if it was a congenital deafness, wouldn't they both be deaf? Oh good. <br /> <br /> Atwill does a good job here, being deaf and stupid. Unfortunately, no one else here really works for a darn.
