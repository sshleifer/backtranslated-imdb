This is the kind of movie you're sorry to put into your VCR. These are some weird, bad rip off versions of Stephen King's movie "Misery (1990)". I can't understand how this movie got a 5.2 score because it has no story whatsoever, and when the movie finally ended, I was relieved. <br /> <br /> This movie should have been released as a short film instead .. too much time is spent on the same thing. And, as in any bad movie, everything happens right at the end of the movie for a 10-15 minute time period ... So before you decide to watch this movie, be sure to put some new batteries in your remote control because You will make very quick forwarding ... don't worry, you will not miss anything important.
