How many freaks do we have to see a ghost passing by in the background and topping through the reflection of the mirror? It's been done in two dozen movies in recent memory and four dozen times in this choppy, badly made movie. There were only two freaky moments to appreciate .... as the ghosts invaded the personal spaces of two characters. Speaking of signs, the action was as flat as Diet Coke in 64 oz. cup I draw it from. The side signs could have been drawn from various Scooby Doo cartoons. There was the friendly, aged sheriff. There was the cooked weirdo who lives in the backwoods with Alabama drawl. Lots'o'characters without development. The most disturbing picture was for a murdered child in the beginning. But rather than exploring the child's murder which would have been interesting, they just told us she was dead & her parents had difficulty reconciling her death with the community and each other. When they come to the cottage, the scenes rarely flowed together .... with flashing pictures of the dead daughter scattered here and there. Oh ... and the scary sounds were also overdone. You know what I mean .... creaking doors that open themselves, crickets in the woods, yada yada yada. Ooooohhhh. Haven't seen it before. Again you will see the amazing self-opening door in the movie over and over again. NOTE TO DIRECTOR: A scary scene is scary only if it is not repeated every 5 minutes in the same movie. Think these things out before calling out "it's a wrap!"
