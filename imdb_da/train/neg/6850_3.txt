As a girl, Hinako moved away from her little village to Tokyo, leaving her two best friends, Fumiya and Sayori. She returns as a young woman, surprised to find out that Sayori died when she was a teenager. She is reunited with Fumiya and they are horrified to learn that Sayori is mysteriously revived through the island of Shikoku. Oh boy. I rented this because I like Asian horror, and I think Chiaki Kuriyama is a nifty actress. Unfortunately, if I were to describe Shikoku in a word, it would be "fruity." This movie is stupid, boring, poorly filmed, imaginative and most of all rude. Kuriyama has minimal screen time as the resurrected Sayori, and her character has been given little to work with.
