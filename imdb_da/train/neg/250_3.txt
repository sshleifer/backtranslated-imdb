Having seen three other versions of the same movie, I'm afraid this is by far the weakest, mainly because of Scott's rather boring and light performance. His feelings all the way through are so bland, making it difficult to participate in the movie. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better. When Scrooge was best, you don't get the sense that Scott says dialogue with great conviction, and when he goes through his metamorphosis, he's not convincing either. I can't think of any actors in this movie that match them from the Alistair Sim version. Even the musical version (and honestly the Muppets) assume this is better done. Very disappointing.
