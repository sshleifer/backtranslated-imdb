This quasi J horror movie followed a young woman as she returns to the childhood town of Shikoku Island to sell the family house and meet old friends. She finds that one, the daughter of the village priestess, drowned several years earlier. She and Fumiko (another childhood woman) then learn that Sayori's mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic. Already the ties between the dead and the living weak are, and the friends and villagers see ghosts. Nothing was unusual or even very good with this movie. Contrary to the stellar J horror film, the excitement does not really matter, and the result does not seem to be endangered, and the end adjoins the absurd. <br /> <br /> This film, like plain white rice, is cooked a little too long so it borders on the mushroom. Sometimes you get this at poor Asian restaurants or cook your own white rice a little too long. You end up eating it because you need it with the meal, for what is Chinese or Japanese food without rice, but it almost destroys the meal because of the lush, tasteful taste of it all. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
