can't see this. This was one of the stupid movies I've ever seen. It's hard to be Mormon sometimes when there are movies like this out there. what a sad mormon life. I can tell you if you saw this movie that it is not like this in a single department. If it was I don't think I would have done it through it. It is too bad that most Mormon films are made by a group of geeks who have nothing better to do. The action was so bad that my wife and I almost didn't get through it. I think you could say it had all the signs of a B movie. or is there a C movie? anyway ... I just thought this movie sucked and was full of cheese. I want some Mormons to start making some quality movies.
