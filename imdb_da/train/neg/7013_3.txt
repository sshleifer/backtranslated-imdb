Unfortunately, this film, 54, was a pathetic attempt at the true story of 'Studio 54'. The only good thing about the picture was 'Mike Myers', which was a joy to watch. "Neve Cambpell," although she was small, was unfortunately bad. The bottom line is that this movie lacked a good performance from the actors, except one, and that the conversion of the true story was a desperate attempt at a good script.
