This movie was a gift from titles to credits, it is boring to tedium, and the play is wood and the stem! Certainly it was director Richard Jobson who directed the debut, but who on the ground green a script that poorly developed like this? Looks like another money down the drainage government project (Scottish screen credited with surprise, surprise). I almost fell asleep three times and unfortunately my review will be more detained than this one. Please lose Jobson what you have ever done before instructing this calming movie, go back to it!
