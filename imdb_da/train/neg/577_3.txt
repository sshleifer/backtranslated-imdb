First of all, Jon Bon Jovi does not seem to be in a vampire movie. Along with the other not so interesting characters and the bad story, the whole movie becomes predictable. If you remember it and you are a total vampire movie fan, you can have fun with some of the scenes. Don't expect any chapters from the Tarantino style here, nor an Anne Rice story. (I expect to have forgotten the whole movie tomorrow;)
