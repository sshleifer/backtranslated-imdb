This movie is massively boring and pretentious. There is only a good moment when a sailor shaves Mr Barney's (think the little dinosaur-less pretense) eyebrow. The music is relentlessly cloying-it is sad that Bjork, a person with so much inner beauty, has been brought down to pretentious falsification in his art. Pomp of tea service makes a beautiful ritual seem vapid. Mythology and culture are not respected in this film, they are lifted. Not only from Japanese culture, but from another filmmaker ... (team tuned) In a perfect "art mimic life" moment - the crew of the ship finds a huge piece of sh * t. That's what the audience found in the theater. There are some sets that are very complex and arty without heart --- so prepare for spoilers - I'm talking to you, Mr BARNEY. <br /> <br /> The emperor has no clothes! Mr. Barney you've been out! I've seen Jodorowsky's HOLY MOUNTAIN. And your thin, false veil from BS has been lifted. You have stolen your images your style and your EASY ART CATALOG from this man. Now that HOLY MOUNTAIN has been released finally, let's hope the powers of the world art councils, STOP FINANCE YOU! Poor Jodorowsky lost in an economic battle with the Beatles lawyer when he is Lennon / McCartney in film making. And BTW, while Jodorowsky is Beatle-YOU ARE MONKEES! A cheap thin fun rip off only suffered from facile kitschy college freshmen. And BTW I am a movie maker. If you are interested in making a reality movie, I will legally fight you in a ring that defends Jodorowsky-you and defends direct theft.
