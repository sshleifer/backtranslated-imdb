Oh my, where to start ... this movie was just awful. The script was poor, the action was poor, special effects were bad. I think the only good thing about this movie is that it made me laugh! I was in the mood for a scary movie, but certainly didn't! I thought it would be decent enough, since I'm not picky. I've seen several bad horror movies. In fact, it's my goal to see all horror movies, no matter how terrible they may be. At some point in the film I made a comment on "corn syrup blood" and in the special features they actually admitted it was karosirup (brand name syrup ...) The film had all the necessary things for a horror movie (blood, nudity, crazy killer) , stupid movements), but it was just missing something really to do well. The author must either take some classes or just give up!
