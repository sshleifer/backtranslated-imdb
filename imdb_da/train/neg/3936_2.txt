Wow. I thought it could be incomplete, but it was even worse than I imagined! Sometimes I like to watch a good "car crash" movie: those who are so bad you can't look away because you want to see how bad they might be. This really is the only reason I could leave the television morbid fascination. It was not so much the play that was only mediocre or a little worse than one might expect from this cast, but the premise and the plot, which should never have seen the light of day. The script is also moody-inducing. As for filmography, others saw that they used a "curtain drawing" segue unit, as in an old 50s TV show ... but without irony? At first I thought they should be fun, but the film takes too seriously to use it in a way that is heavy Not even asking me the score ... the only highlight is the final song, of Morcheeba. I guess they wanted to leave people with something for their $ 8 ... glad I saw it on TV !!!!! Just stupid! I wonder if that's why Timothy Hutton has had a hard time finding much work recently? I think if you don't expect much and want to see a mindless thriller, it would be better than spending an evening cutting your toenails, why it deserves a 2.
