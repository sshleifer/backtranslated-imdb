Sorry, but I will spoil both the plot line and the end for you in the hope of avoiding a holiday fiasco like the one I am now facing. Father dies, and mother asks Santa in a letter to bring him back to the family for Christmas, and Santa does. Father is peachy, happy healthy and totally unaware that he was dead. Everyone ends up syrup sweetly. But as a parent who recently saw my five-year-old losing his best dog friend, it was a scare. Now, my son is convinced that all he has to do to bring his friend back is to ask Santa! Do not underestimate the willpower of a young heart - no persuasion will convince him that it was only a movie and that his dog will NOT come back for Christmas. It has been the heart to break to see his joy only to know that Christmas Eve, he will have to face his loss again. <br /> <br /> Shame on behalf of all the believers who have recently lost a loved one. It is hard enough to handle the loss once for a child, but there are some wishes that we should not even portray as an option.
