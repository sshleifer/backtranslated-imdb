A movie without conscience. Drifter agrees to kill a man for a mobster for money. Then they double him. Meanwhile, he falls in love with the dead man's wife, and without her knowing that he is the killer, goes into her. So he "accidentally" kills her when she finds out. Then he is asserted on the mobsters who double crossed him in a WALKING TALL kind of heroism. The first problem is that the drive of accepting the murder through rental tasks loses all sense of sympathy, dignity and heroism. We cannot accept any goodness in him and as a result, the rest of it has no moral center. We just can't worry about that kind of guy. And the wife (nicely played by the retrieving Kari Wuhrer - the sheriff of AIGHT LEGGED FREAKS), a high-class lady driving a homeless mission, also loses some sympathy by jumping straight into bed with the homeless drives (despite her apparently weakened condition after her husband's death). And when she finds out, he's the guy ?? what is she doing? She locks him inside her house (as if ALL houses had locks you can't open from inside) with her and continues to tell him. Stoo-pid. George Wendt, however, is fantastic in a role as a buffalo bow. Director Stuart Gordon did so much better with RE-ANIMATOR and DAGON.
