I have noticed how all the other reviews of this movie mention how "healthy" and "entertaining" it is. These people need to get out of the house more often. I don't know why they are shilling for this stupid, eerie, brain-free fluff. Pat Boone has absolutely no action figures and his tenure is only exceeded by his co-star Pamela Austin, a former model (another reason to ban the insidious practice of inflicting unscrupulous models on an unsuspecting, moving audience, an error habit, unfortunately continues to this day). A good support game (including Terry-Thomas, Edward Everett Hortyon) tries hard to make sense of this, but to no avail. I noticed that two directors shared credit, although "credit" is not the word I would use (neither is "director"). With regard to "healthy entertainment" there are lots of these types of movies available without torturing your loved ones by forcing them to sit through this. Find one of these movies and skip this one.
