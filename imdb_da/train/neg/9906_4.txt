After reading the reviews, it became obvious that everyone intellectualized this work. How totally boring. Oh, what about the good ol 'days, and there was nothing like that. Of all the comments, no feelings for this work or anyone else expressed. I grew up just after the steam age, and this cinematic gem along with Dan'l Boone praised Saturday afternoon's matinees. This was an annual film that made the rounds and filled the slots with gabbing, yapping, farting, giggling, snot monsters like myself or myself. And it was a cinema filler at the time. Almost as big as the Wizard of Oz. <br /> <br /> IMDb insists that every criticism contains something about the plot. The problem was that it was pretty much a template. Here goes. Randolph Scott (cowboy / hero) gathers friends and defeats the evil people. Hooray! <br /> <br /> All of us kids figured out the plot before we plunked our quarter down to see it. It was just about the plot line for all Scott, John Wayne, Roy Rogers movie ever made. If you take the time to go back and review every movie - just don't ask for surprises. One must remember the context of the ages. There was no or little TV. No one for children. There was school. There was the great outdoors. There were toy guns. No Cyber ​​Time. And the steam age had just collapsed. But movies like this gave entertainment and filled fantasies from young whippersnappers. Even the girls got into it. <br /> <br /> This movie was the entertainment. And it is as thoughtless as something that is produced today. It was originally intended to be propaganda. But soon there were kids clubs. <br /> <br /> Our fathers had experienced the right thing. And it would not be before Sam Peckinpah a decade later, finally transmitting the red splashes of imitating blood into realistic and abundant quantities. Only to his leadership does anyone die slowly, with great pain and misery. Until Peckinpah's war and gun battles were a pretty bloodless affair. Thanks Sam. <br /> <br /> To see a movie had little or no blood, the adults didn't mind. They would not have tolerated what I believe. No mother spray splashes the broken plant life. So this movie had all the glory and none of the gory. Gung Ho was suitable for children then. <br /> <br /> You'll see I've awarded a four to this rating. Why would I do that? Well. It's a horrible movie. No matter how I love it. I love this movie because it brought back one of my childhood happiness moments. But it's not so good that a movie is of high quality. Basically Gung Ho transferred to become a Romanesque novel for children. <br /> <br /> Should people see it. Of course. I'm not saying to stay away. Realistic though. The reason is simple. Signs low? they are shoals. You can love a bad movie.
