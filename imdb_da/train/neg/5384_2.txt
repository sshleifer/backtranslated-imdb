All Hype! What better way to describe a movie about people who are disturbed because they can't release their movie through a mainstream distributor? Therefore, they do it themselves. Otherwise, the film's hype does not justify the content of the movie. The story is absent and can easily be short. The action is bad, but the animation and music are pretty good. Otherwise don't waste your time - don't think hype! But if you have the chance to watch the movie for free, you do it. Then you won't have to waste money. Still, the filmmakers do a good job of squeezing their story and creating cliff hangers with their self-giving mini-series. Otherwise they are a hit wondering that has never hit.
