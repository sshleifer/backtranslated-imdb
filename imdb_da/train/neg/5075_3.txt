The animation was good, the picture was good, although it wasn't quite original, but the story was too long, too confusing and over the top dramatic. After approx. one hour I couldn't wait to get it over. With so many characters having nothing to contribute, and album elements that either come from nowhere or go nowhere, this movie wasn't really a movie at all and would have been better as a short series or possibly two movies. If you like this kind of typical story, you might like it, but frankly, I've been pampered by much more creative stories that actually have some kind of message to tell. Go hire a Miyazaki movie and watch it twice, you get a lot more out of it.
