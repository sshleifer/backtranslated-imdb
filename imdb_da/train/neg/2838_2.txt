Jump Mission: Galactica and see the original Living Legend episodes instead. The network took part 1 and 2 of the Living Legend and stuck them in a plot with the horrible Fire In Space episode. Although Galactica suffered from network-driven writing and lack of time to prepare for proper production, Living Legend is the best of the television series in 1978. Fire in space is in itself one of the worst episodes. As a historical note, see Galactica, the original Star Trek and then the revival Trek series, and you'll see the difference in quality between network-produced sci-fi and syndicated sci-fi.
