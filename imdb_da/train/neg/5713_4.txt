There is nothing worse than renting an Asian movie and getting an American movie experience instead. It is only my opinion, but a good thriller is dependent on the creation of sympathetic, intelligent characters. As for equality, the main characters of Say Yes are a picturesque couple. Well done. Unfortunately, they are stupid beyond belief. Let's count the ways they abuse by being terrorized by a stalker. <br /> <br /> 1. When a hitchhiker threatens to kill you, be sure to tell him which hotel you're staying at when you release him. <br /> <br /> 2. Strike the hell out of the stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses, thereby squeezing charges of attack. <br /> <br /> 3. Don't tell the police about the stalker and simply assume (without any apparent reason) that the police were being overthrown by him. <br /> <br /> 4. When you try to escape, let your lady as much as possible to make sure the stalker is kidnapping her. <br /> <br /> 5. After getting help from someone to find the stalker after kidnapping your wife, be sure to send them away as soon as possible so you can meet him one by one one. No point in being unfair, right? <br /> <br /> Now, I would never expect anyone to be immune to make a few mistakes under these stressful conditions, but the characters in Say Yes are so dense and make so many incredible mistakes that it's impossible to Do the viewer to worry about their safety as they are the victims of their own work. This kills the pleasure of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> If you wonder, the scriptwriters did not stop with weak characters. Since they are certainly dim-witted to write this crapfest, they decided to make situations so absurdly unrealistic that all the sense of reality goes out of the window. <br /> <br /> 1. The stalker kills a policeman inside a police station ?? while the protagonist sleeps no more than ten meters away. <br /> <br /> 2. The Stalker deals with all dubious activities in broad daylight and around many people, but none other than the married couple seems to see its odd behavior. <br /> <br /> 3. The Stalker survives an absurd amount of violence that would have killed any human being. <br /> <br /> 4. The "suspense" scenes had no imagination at all. In fact, some scenes were direct rip-offs from American films. The only positive is decapitated at the end, which was a rather brutal scene when it was inflicted on wife. It's too bad that the filmmakers followed it up with a monstrous stupid end coming out of the left field. Make sure Koreans behind Say Yes's creation are ashamed of themselves. Even better, they just have to move to California and deal with people who make movies with similar disregard for quality and intelligence.
