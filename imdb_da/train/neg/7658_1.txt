In the Dark alone, Uwe Bolls kicks in the nuts to Hollywood after the House of the Dead's blow to the face. <br /> <br /> If anything, it turns out how much a master manipulator Boll is. Having forced the artisans out of the business over the flop, which was the House of the Dead, one can only assume the normally credible Lion's Gate Films only released AITD under contractual obligation after acquiring Artisan's assets. Because AITD is an even greater example of complete lack of coherent filmmaking ability, plot display and simply steals badly from other movies, because it should look tough rather than fit into the film's framework. <br /> <br /> But that's the point, isn't it. Boll does not try to make a coherent movie because he is not trying to lead Alone in the Dark. He's just trying to manipulate Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Alone in the Dark, like House of the Dead, Dungeon Siege, Far Cry, Bloodrayne and the other 3 or 4 projects that are "advertised" or in "production". <br /> <br /> These are not movies to be addressed but investment portfolios. Each of them rushed into production under the sense that tax law Boll and his investors are exploiting, can be closed within the next 2 to 3 years. The more bomb projects he can release within that time frame, the more money he and his investors can get. Why bother making a good movie when a bad movie makes you a mint anyway? The result is movies like Alone in the Dark's terrible. <br /> <br /> Like all of his other films, Alone in the Dark is just a cynical exploitation of Hollywood's current trend for lazy movie production. <br /> <br /> And to those who support Boll by calling him misunderstood or the next Ed Wood, congratulations on making a cult figure out of the man, you just make it easier for him to get investors but to give him rythed. <br /> <br /> For more information, read here: http://www.cinemablend.com/feature.php?id=209 http://www.cinemablend.com/forum/showthread.php?s= & threadid = 21699 As a page, just don't ask me how he gets his cast lists together. Unless the actors engage in investment fraud somehow, this mystery is still being uncovered.
