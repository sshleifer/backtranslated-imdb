Veteran sleazeball Bruno Mattei is again with this erotic thriller, which clearly echoes Joel Schumacher's 8MM. But as expected, Mattei makes her movie on a small budget - so it already looks hidden when it's recently released. <br /> <br /> After the daughter is abducted, a mother enters the dark world of underground pornography because the kidnappers belong to an international organization that is snus film as long as exclusive customers pay well. The search for her daughter not only leads her mother across Europe, but also to prostitution. She goes to bed with some guys to get her track. When she finally gets in touch with the snus organization led by the mysterious Doctor Hades, she is in great danger. There is not much good to say about this, even if it starts promising. The problem is that the film is far from being as creepy or explicit as one might expect from the director who made films like BLADE VIOLENT. SNUFF TRAP (which was first published in Russia!) Is not gory enough nor does it contain the amount of nudity and sex to really keep the viewer's attention. The reason is also not so special, except perhaps for the surprisingly many different places across Europe. The end is extremely disappointing. The action is also not remarkable, except for Anita Auer, who plays Doctor Hades: She looks and seems extremely scary. You don't want to meet her like this in a dark hill (or your bedroom, for that matter). All in all, SNUFF TRAP speaks only to collectors of Bruno Matthew's films. But it's good to see the man back on the helm again: It was his first thriller since 1994's giallo GLI OCCHI DENTRO.
