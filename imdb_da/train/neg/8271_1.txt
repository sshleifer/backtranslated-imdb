"Beautiful Guys With Bad Haircuts !!" "Beautiful girls without any trace!" "Stupid gangsters who can't shoot straight !!" From the Dragon Dynasty comes Hong Kong gangster drama, "Dragon Heat." For reasons that are likely to be completely obscure forever, both production and casting calls for this "criminal-steroid" movie both Maggie Q and Michael Biehn log in as villains. But they don't get much to do in this horrible slug party. They are two of the best modern actors around, each with their own CV and a list of achievements, and Biehn in particular has had the courage to take some rather challenging and non-heroic roles. <br /> <br /> Maggie Q was the super-bad "May" in "Live Free Or Die Hard", so nuff said. /> <br /> Of course, Biehn is famous for being the soldier-from-the-future who made "The Terminator" in 1984 such a credible science-fiction / fantasy romp by colliding with Big Arnold, who is now governor of california !! <br /> <br /> Michael Biehn is almost wasted in this terrible train wreck of a police drama. There is absolutely no reason why the incredibly enchanted plot - which is mainly given in Chinese as it is a story in Hong Kong - could have been better elaborated for non-Chinese audiences with a stranger's narrator. <br /> <br /> In other words, if Biehn had been used as something like an Interpol observer or coordinator or an agent under deep cover, who would get some "splaining for him every five or ten minutes, it would But no, he's been brought in as part of an unhappy group of special forces - type of evil guys who seem to be freelancing their own corrupt deal amidst others' completely corrupt deal involving the local king of corrupt offers . <br /> Yes, I said it all. Confused? Also me. "Welcome to the party, buddy." <br /> <br /> In the truly amazing Hong Kong criminal drama, known during his English title as "Breaking News", there are also a number of fascinating characters in the workplace, but there is only one story line in the plot. <br /> <br /> Bad guys vs good cops. In a Hong Kong Triad or a gang's world, the hot shot police seem to be a little more d a couple of ducks in a shooting game that the criminals beat them down. So, not surprisingly, there is an almost otherwise incomprehensible scene (more scenes actually) where children try to shoot tree ducks in an arcade game to win full animal prizes. And then the hot shot police officers intervene naturally on their behalf, so the arcade owner must give up the Kewpie dolls. There is also a half-hearted attempt to create a "love" interest "between one of the" visiting police "and the only female" visiting policeman. "The visiting police must be formed as witnesses to the Triad gangster leader who is being hijacked on the road to his right looks, but not of his own team but of the mercenaries (Biehn, Maggie Q, and some others). These killers will all have something, but we will not learn what it is until the end of It was a stupid mistake in the overall story. <br /> <br /> You can't build excitement in a crime drama without gaining or getting away from, or being introduced very early in history. > <br /> Add to that some "cut-away scenes" made for purely artistic effects, all showing the bad bad guys and the usual bad guys past past, and any movie buff can easily understand why this barking dog gets a 1 rating from this fan of all things cinematic with criminals and conspirators and Hong Kong.
