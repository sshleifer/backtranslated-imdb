I want to keep it short; Thanks to Greg for helping me to say this briefly: Captivity is about a guy who drinks a girl's drink, prisons and tortures her, then forms a prisoner for having sex with her. It is the only twist and stroke of the film. It is torture that slow motion date rape. And it's not even a good movie. It's not that bad, it's good; It's just bad. It should also be mentioned that among critics there is a "spoiler code" which they dare not break even though some were tempted to be on this one because it is so in vain. Why no one had cojones to step up and say "this is garbage and that's why" lies outside of me. <br /> <br /> Don't give your money to these poop peddlers.
