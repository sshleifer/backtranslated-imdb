This movie was so amateurish, I could hardly believe what I saw. It's shot at the VIDEO! NOT movies! I have not seen similar songs since the early 70s when sennat network showed movies in the week 'horror flicks' shot in ...... video. It looks like a bad soap opera and it pays it a compliment. Some of the actors give it their best shot. Michael Des Barres does it okay with what he is allowed to do, which must act as a sex addict without control. I can't say it's comfortable to see. <br /> <br /> Nastassja Kinski as a therapist sits in a chair for almost the entire movie, with very little variation in camera angles. I can't fault her for the poor blocking of others, but she's absolutely incredible in her role. Her little girl's voice works against her here. And I consider myself a Nastasia Kinski fan. She is probably ageless and exotic, but she is out of her assortment with this. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul is pathetically overwhelmed. Every line she delivers is with three exclamation points. Someone must have instructed her to scream at all costs. Why would Michael Des Barres have sex with such a rage? <br /> <br /> Finally, Rosanna Arquette comes out as the sweet, maligned wife, and probably the most credible of the pile. But that doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> This is going to be the worst movie I've seen this year.
