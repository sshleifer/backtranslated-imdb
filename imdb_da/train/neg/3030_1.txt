Repetitive music, annoying narrative, horrible film effects. Half of the plot seemed to be centered around shock value, and the other half seemed to be focused on appeasing the kind of crowd that would rub people to start a fight. <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes was in "deleted scenes" section, one in which she is in principle office with her mother. I don't understand why they would cut it. The movie seemed desperate to make a point about everything it could, and Domino, who spoke of sororities, would have been a highlight of the movie. <br /> <br /> Ridiculous camera work is reminiscent of MTV, and it is not necessary or useful for a movie. Speed ​​up the movie to jump past a lot of things and rotate the camera around something repeatedly became old the first time it was used. It's like the directors will use all those extra footage they don't want to throw away. <br /> <br /> Another movie with Jerry Springer in it? It should have told me I couldn't see it from the preview. <br /> <br /> A popular movie for "in" crowd.
