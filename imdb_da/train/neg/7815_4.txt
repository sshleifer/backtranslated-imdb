As a prolonged fan of Superman from the comics, through the 1950s series, the first two of the Chris Reeves films and Lois & Clark, and finally Smallville, I was * really * hoping for something wise with "Superman Returns". <br /> <br /> Instead, we got Lex Luthor to do * another * real estate conversion attempt, another Superman-turned-up while-wearing kryptonite sequence, and internal inconsistencies: he couldn't stop himself to fall into the sea when he is stuck with 6 "kryptonite, but when Lois breaks 3" of it, * leaving the rest embedded in him *, can he * promise * a continent * in space ?? Really the only one in the story was Lois' partner - I can't remember his name off-hand. He did all kinds of life-saving, heroic things with nothing but courage and skill - no superpowers, no innocence ... just a normal human being. They continue to make Superman so small. Why can't we have Superman fight Brainiac or fight to save the General Zod universe instead of Lex's little schemes. Oh, I forgot ... they do it in Smallville. <br /> <br /> Yeah ... I think I'm stuck with Smallville ... You'll have to, too ...
