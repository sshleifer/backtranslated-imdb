Just brought this movie to a buck at National Wholesale Liquidators, and after seeing it, I feel like I was being ripped off. <br /> <br /> I don't know I've seen a worse movie than this. Frankly speaking. And I would never write a negative review of a movie if I didn't have so much respect for the subject, that is, Stephen Foster and his music. First, what is it? It's a musical biography? Yes, many of Foster's tunes so scattered here and there are those pseudo-Broadway-Jerome Core-type songs that roam more than the Mississippi Delta. Do I mean anyone was paid to write this drift? Second, the real story of Foster is fascinating. Why not even get close to it? Third, what did they have on the big Ray Middleton to get him to make this movie? Pictures of him with little boys ?? With Communists? So waste a great talent. <br /> <br /> So scare the fetus friends and the truth and the good entertainment ... be very, very scared.
