Visually heterogeneous and full of himself, the director apparently chose to look for depth to extend a 5-minute plot to an 81-minute snowstorm. <br /> <br /> The moments that work in this movie are very limited, and the characters don't even feel real. How could you feel invested in a protagonist made so surreal? <br /> <br /> Fully and stylistically, it all feels like a quirky dream sequence. Jarring irregular camera work, awkward silence and gaps in action, and what is the little spider image that creeps across the screen? Anyone who thought about it should go back to the film school. It didn't add any meaning, just cheese, and didn't even work stylistically with the rest of the movie (assuming the movie itself had a close call style). What a flop.
