If you have seen friends, the writing will feel very confidential. Especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of friends often share the same comedy settings. <br /> <br /> The exhibition is about a group of people whose connection is that they shared the same class, as they were still quite young (I think about 10 years old). Now they are in the mid-twenties and they meet again in a classroom. This is where the series starts. <br /> <br /> A typical episode deals with several story lines at once. They are usually not connected in any way. Each story line is cut into several sections, which are then displayed in a mixed order. <br /> <br /> The sketches are where my problems lie in this series. As in the later seasons of Friends, it is often a rather stupid attitude with difficult situations. One of the protagonists does something really stupid, it's hard to believe. The situation is so heavily exaggerated as if it were not stupid enough. If you are in this kind of humor in your face, then you might like this series. For me, this is a great departure. <br /> <br /> The reason I started seeing friends is because of the first few seasons. There are interesting and particularly credible story lines, with some romance in it that makes you root out for the characters. The class has none of this. The characters are simply too forced and stereotypes are pressed too far. It is therefore not possible to relate to them and like them. At least with friends, it took several seasons before it ran out of steam and the characteristics were all exhausted. But in class it seems that it has run out of steam before it even started.
