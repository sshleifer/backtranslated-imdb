Watching this movie is like eating a banquet of anything other than meringue. It initially looks, but ultimately gives no satisfaction - no one. The plot is a confused mess for a toy factory and the forces of evil. So how about this basic plot AND Robin Williams that the movie still shows so bad? That's because the picture is all the look without any substance - like the terrible Popeye image Williams did at the start of his film career. The film must have cost a fortune, but perhaps there was not enough money left to hire writers who had taken a high school. <br /> <br /> The movie is an eerie joke that continues and over and over. I'm really unsure why it was made in the first place - it was certainly not done to provide any kind of entertainment.
