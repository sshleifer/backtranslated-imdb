Some not-so-exciting spies <br /> <br /> Why do people, when disoriented or sick or afraid of a club, cut through the middle of the crowded dance floor on their way to the bathroom? <br /> <br /> Who in their right mind would hide under a bed when someone breaks into their room? <br /> <br /> How often do you knock on a door of a stranger, and when they did not respond Immediately, you open the door, go in, shout a few hello, and then begin to go through their stuff? <br /> <br /> If you were persecuted by someone you just discovered was a killer, what would you do? Funny sneak and hide under a wooden platform or among metal tools? Of course, drive quietly to a ratty old barn or other casual structure? <br /> <br /> I could talk about almost any thriller that has come out in the last couple of years, but since this is the "Return" page, of course I'm talking about "The Return." I saw it for free because I work at a movie theater and do a point to screen all the "scary" movies. I thought this was tolerable ... except for the well-worn clich√©s. Sarah Michelle Gellar is really boring and looks a bit like "Huh?" through most of the movie. The details of the plot are slowly released when the film progresses, and it is almost enough to make it interesting, unless there was not enough explanation as it went on, so I was almost lost until the last 2/3 of it. <Br /> <br /> If you're a die-hard thriller fan, it's worth seeing at least once. If there is nothing better at the theater and you really want to watch a movie, eh, I think it's worth a matinee ticket. If you thought the trailer did, it looked like an interesting movie and you can't wait ... wait.
