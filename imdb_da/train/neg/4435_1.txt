Gods, I haven't seen a movie here awful for a long time. Maybe not since 'The New Guy' or various Freddie Prinze Jr. movies. Yes, it's amazingly awful. Mira Sorvino's shiny and wood plays must surely be inspired by Freddie. The film modeling was awkward (like a game, rather, and the sense of confinement doesn't work well on movies). The actors didn't know what they were doing, especially Sorvino. Her accent was terrible, and her sex complaints appealed here so it was painful to see her seductive other characters, and they fell for it. And what about occasional shots of a living crowd in lawn chairs? Meaningless! I had to turn off the DVD player, it would have been self-inflicted to end this movie.
