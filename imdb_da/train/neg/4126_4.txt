Absolutely nothing happens in this sloooow, annoying, thrill-free thriller directed by Amenabar's usual partner Mateo Gil. The film, which somehow deals with the effect of boredom and the quest for excitement, actually delivers none and acts as an exercise in boredom. The only mildly exciting moment is the movie's climax, which takes about 30 seconds of the whole worrying 100 plus minutes, and it is also resolved. The reason lacks sophistication or credibility, and while the idea is original, the story is widespread, and each plot unit or twist is a result of extraneous interference (deus-ex-machina). The hero is always passive, everything happens to him without forcing him to show any initiative or ingenuity. If you are fans of the genre, see "Tesis" instead.
