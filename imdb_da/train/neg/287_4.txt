As an Altman fan, I would have searched this movie for years, thinking that with such a large casting, it should be at least marginally brilliant. <br /> <br /> Big mistake. <br /> <br /> This is one of Altman's great throwing mishmashes, thrown together randomly and improvisationally (or so feels) with the hope that it would all come together in the editing room. It doesn't. <br /> <br /> As Maltin points out, this turkey is remarkable only for the debut performance of Alfre Woodard, which radiates veterinarians around her. But except that, avoid at all costs. (It's pretty easy to do - it's never been released on video - to my knowledge - and its cable performance has the frequency of Halley's Comet.)
