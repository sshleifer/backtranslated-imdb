As a South African, it is an insult to believe that someone was actually paid to produce this rubbish! <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the director was one of the authors of the original Shaka Zulu mini, this "addition" to the series is appalling! The original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great strategist, leader and warrior. A man who played a major role in shaping the history of local tribes in South Africa. But the plot of this movie is nothing but hogwash, scraped from the bottom of the barrel of a writer who has not been impressed since the mid-nineties. While Omar Sharif and Henry Cele are good actors, what does David Hasselhoff do here, saving drowning slaves with his red bow and a bleached smile? <br /> <br /> I kept expecting blonde, busty women to get out of nowhere and run across the screen in their little red swimwear for no apparent reason. Not that this would have been more bizarre than the amazing plot line that was probably dreamed up after 10 pints of beer at a fancy dress party where a person's caveman costume inspired the author to return to an African theme for his next "blockbuster" .
