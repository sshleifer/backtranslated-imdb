This is a simple story, but it feels very manipulative. It lacks pathos because it does not leave a space for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflection. <br /> <br /> The animation is well done, but I want it to be too presentation. I would have preferred more pictures from behind, more space in the background, and maybe it wouldn't feel so kitsch to me. <br /> <br /> But for a Hollywood style movie, it seems OK, but it is very much derived from Aardman movie and it bothers me. Maybe a longer movie will test if this maker can do without voice-over. <br /> <br /> I think the voice over is too glib.
