1e watched 12/26/2008 - (Dir-Eugene Levy): Corny comedy murder mystery with very few laughs. The film seems to be based on a former Italian movie, according to the credits, but was rewritten by two very popular American romantic comedians. But one of Charles Shyer & Nancy Meyers didn't cut it in relation to their other endeavors. The story is about a few down and outgoing Americans played by Richard Lewis and Sean Young who stumble upon a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing an ad in the paper for the dachshund's return. When they try to return, they see a hand sticking out of a garage door at the woman's residence, which they believe is attached to the rest of the dead body of the woman who is to give them the money. They freak out and instead contact the police and tell them the truth that they run out of the scene, expecting to be framed by the murder. The other characters in the movie are met in a train ahead of this and hang around in a Monte Carlo slot machine that does various things to be drawn into the story. The other cast members include character actors John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton and others. After the police find out about death, they begin to question the protagonists, and of course they have to work through their heavy lies to find out what has really happened. None of the above-mentioned character actors can bring this movie out of the mediocre state despite some fun moments mostly given by the Belushi / Shepherd couple. This is not a horrible movie, it's just not that good. There are lots of average movies out there and it's just another one for the pile. Try it, maybe you like it, probably you won't.
