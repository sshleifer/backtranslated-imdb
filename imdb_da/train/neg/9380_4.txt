The last few weeks in the life of a dead vagabond woman are told in flashbacks. Like the vagabond, the film wanders effortlessly and meaninglessly. Mona, the lazy, sultry and drug-abused title character, does not like, and Bonnaire does a little to make her interesting. While there is a pretentious dialogue trying to explain why Mona has chosen this miserable lifestyle, her motivations are never quite clear. The episodic character of the movie, involving some random characters, becomes tedious after a while, making it much longer than its running time. It is also hard to believe that an attractive young homeless woman would not receive more attention from men.
