After seeing this, I had lost a little respect for Christopher Lee (this has passed over time). This movie was completely garbage. First, they tried to recreate the ending from the first "Howling" with incredibly bad makeup. Then they try to make it a sad excuse for a werewolf porn movie! The reason sucks and the whole movie is just awful !!!! A brother to a werewolf victim from the first movie (from the appearance of what it was SUPPOSED to be Dee Wallace Stone) quit Lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves, led by Sybil Danning, who to be naked all the time. <br /> <br /> It's not even worth renting (unless you're wasting your time and money looking at nudity.). Try to catch it on cable instead. It would be so choppy, it may actually make sense.
