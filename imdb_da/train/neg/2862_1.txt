Someone should send this Uli Lommel guy back to the MOVIE SCHOOL. Who ever told him? He knew how to make a movie? Can only any movie make these days? Previously, it always required TALENT before anyone could make a movie. Having seen this lame BTK movie and the others he is made, it obviously seems obvious that the poor guy has about as many stores to make movies as I do. In fact, I even think I could make better movies than Uli LAME-ALL. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with BTK Killer, except for the name of the victims and the killer. THAT IS IT. Where did this guy get the big idea that BTK killed people with rodents and all the other hopeful crap in the movie? This is a classic example of a person trying to lure people into watching their movie based on the term "BTK" because of the fame it has achieved. Absolutely pitiful. The only serial killer movie I would consider WORSE is the paralyzed "DAHMER" movie. That child smoked so many cigarettes, it made me sick. The one who made it must shoot.
