I didn't expect much from a movie directed by Sidney J. Furie and starred Dolph Lundgren, but I probably expected more than one got. A one-liner user comment - 2nd movement action movie - did not seem too depreciative to me for a Lundgren movie. On the other hand, I would not have bothered to watch this movie if its rating was below 5.0, but hey, the movie had a 5.9 out of 10 score, which seemed pretty acceptable to me for this kind of production. <br /> <br /> Now, I understand that 37.5% of those who rated this movie a 10 (excellent), were obviously an advertising stick because DETENTION is the regular Nu Image waste you've seen before repeatedly. <br /> <br /> Lundgren does not convince as a former military became a history teacher assigned to an elementary school. His plays are simply horrible, numb and constructed. Lundgren's lack of action becomes more visible in the scenario with the young criminal children. Either they are good actors, or in relation to Lundgren they look to great actors - just because they seem natural and credible. DETENTION has some elements that could have been potentially interesting for this low budget film - a high security closed to high school, four teenagers in detention with a war veteran and a group of ruthless criminals trying to enter - but the story (something BREAKFAST CLUB meets DIE HARD, or is it PANIC ROOM?) Is full of incredible situations, lots of clichés, and stereotypical characters. And let's not forget Dolph Lundgren is the main actor. <br /> <br /> Alex Karzis and Kata Dobó play a Bonnie and Clyde couple in love, and they deliver the movie's most acceptable performances, although he seems to be a low-budget version of Sam Rockwell and she, a Milla Jovovich wanna -be. In a movie where everything fails, their craziness delivered and fresh enough air to prevent my interest from falling to the ground.
