Republic pictures come late in the game to "werewolf" is the Werecat genre. The plot has a writer who returns to Paris after a long journey abroad, where he developed jungle fear where he had blackouts. He comes to great acclaim as his novel, which parallels a notorious trial is a best seller. The French Government wants to know if he has access to secret documents, something that seems more likely when an official is killed by a "catman". Suspicion really falls on the author when his fianc√© ends. Complicating cases are the return of blackouts, so the author does not know whether he is the killer or not. <br /> <br /> Okay thriller is too relaxed to be enjoyed. There are too many music tracks early and too much downtime when things are all talking in the middle and later sections. The play is fine, and the sets are quite good, but there is a reason why most people I know only remember the top hated killer, he is the most interesting thing in this movie. Despite its short running time (just over an hour), I think this movie was rarely seen on TV, that after 20 minutes you start losing patience with it. Just as the speech is, I just wanted someone to do something. When it finally happened, in the final minutes it was too late. <br /> <br /> Take a passport.
