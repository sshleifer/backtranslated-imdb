Worst Bob Hope comedy ever (and it includes some heavy competition). Hoping on an island with sailors, dreaming high of being in a bathtub with a geisha girl "managing her ship". Someone probably guided this Hope-hackery over the rock as it contains Phyllis Diller and Gina Lollobrigida and still can't build up any laughs or excitement. Where is Bing Crosby when you really need him?
