For my first taste of Shakespeare on stage, I can't believe what these people did for a great game. <br /> <br /> -Let's start with the good bit, shall we? - <br /> <br /> Alan Rickman is okay, though some of his dialogue might have been delivered with more emotion. The rest of the actors had to pull it together. Romeo, Romeo, why aren't you dead yet, Romeo? The actor could not read his lines with anything gusto at all. He was completely out of focus, had difficulty looking at Juliet's face and absolutely no mercy on the lines he got. The one who threw him deserves to be punished. Juliet is almost acceptable, but she gives no depth to her character and seems to be completely out of touch with the game. Mercutio was incredibly scary and totally out of character for his entire dialogue. Benvolio was insensitive and mercilessly crooked with its lines. <br /> <br /> I was forced to endure this half-baked production of Romeo and Juliet. The plot was stolen and the costumes were nothing less distracting. I have seen kindergarten puppet theater with more effort put into them. I just wish I could give this movie a zero rating.
