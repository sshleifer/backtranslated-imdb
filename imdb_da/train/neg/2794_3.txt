Well, because I'm a musician I thought maybe I can watch this movie on TMC, nothing else good. One of the worst mistakes in my life so far, and it's only half finished. I seriously thought it was one of the soft core films with crappy plot and crappy acting, crappy filming and crappy effects. But no, I don't even get the joy of it. Even the "musicians" were not very good. I was hoping for maybe some laughs, but I wasn't sure if they were trying to throw in one-liners or not. But now I have to sit here and see the rest until Pulp Fiction starts. Or maybe something better. And now I'm going to sit here until I have 10 lines
