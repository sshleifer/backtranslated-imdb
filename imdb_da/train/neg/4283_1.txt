Unfortunately, it is true. "Legiunea sträinä" reveals with absolute clarity the parameters of Daneliuc's irreversible failure. As already said, the author lost the faculty to blending its content factors and artistic intent into a coherent form. Manically concerned about the mechanical trick of picking by random news subjects and joining them without any legitimacy, he merely gathers a disorderly pile of events that cannot follow the smallest storyline. The level of the script is similar to a "Cântarea României" amateur play about the brilliant performance of socialist realism - only turned upside down: while the Communist line dictated a narrow concern only with positivism and sugar festivalism, Daneliuc is equally obsessed with negativism and vile scatology. The idea content is zero, and "message", infantile and didactic, at kindergarten level. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he also forgot the most elementary professional principles. He is unable to organize a dramatic situation anymore, order it in a proper movie scene, to frame it properly and to edit it according to the simplest rules of cinematographic grammar. His level of narrative storytelling in film pictures is similar to saying something like: "Holy arkman, it's not really right, and all people are donkeys!" What a great distance from the impressive artist from 1976-1984 who had created unique works such as "Cursa", "Proba de microfon", "Vânätoarea de vulpi" - and even "Croaziera" and "Glissando" ... Sic transit gloria mundi ...
