1998 Michael Keaton's kiddie comedy with the same title was condemned for its impossible special effects, but compared to what Screaming Mad George cooked for this horror comedy, they are positively overwhelming. Killer snowman seems to be made of styrofoam and his arms look like oversized oven set. As they probably were. The cast puts it thick in this parody of dozens of other (much worse) movies and Paul Keith as the city's doctor is particularly memorable in a small but fun role.
