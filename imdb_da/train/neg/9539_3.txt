A bunch of children set up at a theater to get an all-night horror movie marathon. But as the night continues, someone among them kills them one by one. Who is it ... and why? I saw this on a theater way back in 1991. I was looking forward to it - but boy! It didn't work at all. The premise is a good one, they have a very appealing young cast and some benefits like Dee Wallace Stone on board ... but it doesn't work. The story stops making sense halfway through (it could be because of some major edits before the movie was released), the killings are relatively bloodless (how this has an R rating is beyond me) and the masking of the killer at the end was boring and stupid. <br /> <br /> It's really too bad - this movie had potential. With a better script this could have become a great horror movie. As it stands, it is mostly forgotten, and the cast itself is embarrassed by it (I heard Stone won't talk about this). I give it a 3 and it's just for the cast.
