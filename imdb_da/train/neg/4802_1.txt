I give this marriage 3 years and it stretches it. Adrianne Curry is fouled mouth, spoiled, controlling, loud and her bi-sexual past makes me laugh. She tells Chris that he has a picture to protect and must avoid strip clubs. He married her. Chris has low self-esteem and from another time chain. I have nothing against Adrianne Curry, but this combination will not have a happy ever after ending. Her mother said he was an old rooster and thinks this is his last attempt to resume his youth. Here are 2 very good people who are going to end up in a creepy divorce. I don't think his old "Brady Family" will fit into his new life. I see them closed. Chris said his friends were more important than his family. It supported him and was there for him.
