The good news is that a movie was made, drawn on a supposed aztec myth and with an unusually aztec-American (there is such a word). The bad news is that it was dead at birth. <br /> <br /> If Ed Wood was out of retirement and trained George Romaro through his classic 'Living Dead' season, this is where we could come up with. 'The Legend of Diablo' is a clear feed for future resurrections of the Mystery Science Theater 3000! 'I don't think you can even call this a' B 'movie. The production values ​​are so immense that I continued to feel that I was both looking at a long shit from a selection or a backyard 8 mm film shot by a group of school children. <br /> <br /> SOME SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The basic plot line sounded interesting enough to lure me to rent it. A rural California sheriff finds a box containing an aztec demon and randomly releases it into the unsuspecting society. His daughters, a warm and homely, join a gringo FBI man and a priest to try to re-should the demon. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, every zombie scene you've ever seen in previous undead movies is re-enacted-poorly. These zombies are more like an army of Nutty Professors than undead! The suspected infrared scenes from the demon's point of view are nothing special ?? and he / she / it surely seems to back up a lot (as opposed to turning forward). And the scene where the pastor lures the demon out of the fast-moving cave is ridiculous! It really seems to be cartoon effect - though I know it wasn't! I expect the Benny Hill theme music to start playing & for the whole band zombies to start chasing the pastor all over the beach! <br /> <br /> Of course, Darth Vader / Field of Dreams calling the FBI agent speaks plainly comic. So again so was most of this cheese ball! Robert Napton, director and writer of the manuscript, was to win something for this effort! (What about a lifetime blackballing, like 'Hollywood 10?') This one I see now is rated 1.5 on a 10 scale. I fear it may be a bit generous! <br /> <br /> Is there anything good about this movie? Well, Lindsey Lofaso looks great like the dead Sheriff's younger daughter. This is probably why her domestic older sister (Calvi Pabon) really ran away from home! Fred Estrado is reasonably decent as an FBI agent. I wonder if Mario Soto, who played Father Rodriguez, is the same Mario Soto who pitched to Cincinnati Reds? If that is the case, he should be in baseball. In fact, they could not have done anything worse if they had gone with a baseball theme and called it 'Demons in the Outfield!' <br /> <br /> If I find out, this was actually a project for a community college cinema class, I will give excuses. It may be good enough for a B or even B + as long as the band has got the college camcorder back to campus in one piece! "The Blair Witch Project" showed that a cool, campy movie could be made on a shoestring. 'The legend of Diablo' does not seem to have a shoestring OR shoe to work from! It was low budget, low talent, low everything. The final scene - and I think about the last 10 seconds of the movie - is just a mildly creative or interesting moment. I paid $ 3.45 to rent this. I could have used it better on a hamburger!
