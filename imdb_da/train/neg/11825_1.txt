This movie is a fluttering rip-off of one of the best novels of all time, Silas Marner by George Eliot. <br /> <br /> The details of the movie shown on the IMDb acknowledge the original author, but I did not see this at the beginning of the movie, only a credit at the end of it says "suggested by the book Silas Marner ". Suggested? It was nothing but a complete rip-off of all the essential elements of the story: <br /> <br /> A wrong and sad old man, a craftsman, poor and lonely, has all his money stolen. One night a child walks up to his door when her mother is dying in the snow outside. The man takes her in and brings her up for a day, requiring the local warlord (or rich politician here) to adopt the child. It is he who has faded the child in an illegal affair years before. The fight then follows who should have legal custody of the child. <br /> <br /> In this and all other aspects of the movie, the story is exactly the same. In only one I can find a difference. Silas Marner had epilepsy - but perhaps it would have tense Martin's performance abilities too far. On top of that, he has the hair dyed in some carrot juice (presumably to make him look younger, but actually make him look more the clown he is)! There is also the addition of meaningless jokes that this gigantic comedian cannot resist bringing into the story that has nothing to do with it and only degrades the depth of history. Just as when the child is crying in the courtroom, she only declares to be satisfied with the man who has fostered her all these years. This is performed in the film of the girl using the nasal decongestant to the nostril to make her tear! <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that the legality and integrity of the movie industry allows such a movie to be made. If I were the administrator of George Eliot, I would insist on repair. If I were Steve Martin, I would send the profits to that property or to the poor. It must at least be right Silas Marner - adapted by S Martin. Or even better removed from the archives! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in this story - and I hope you are - dismiss it completely and see Silas Marner. Or read the book! The BBC made an excellent adaptation to it in the 1980s.
