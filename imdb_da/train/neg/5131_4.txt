I liked it, but I think I could have deleted at the same time. This recast of Cyrano de Bergerac / Roxanne is a completely exhilarating, formal romcom saved from just to video-ignominy by the release of the sharp tour of Janeane Garofalo. When she plays Frasier of Pets, she finds herself in a love trap when insecurity leads her to pass on her best friend (Uma Thurman) as herself when a caller comes a-courtin. <br /> <br /> This is an interesting movie in the fascinating career of Ben Chaplin. An average British actor, he gave the Hollywood treadmill a shot with this movie. He is unremarkable and his anonymity in studio productions is surprising because of it, even though he has appeared in significant cameos in both later Terence Malick films. Uma Thurman makes a ditzy turn on autopilot and Michael Lehmann packs it all competently. Icky phone sex died. 4.10
