I bought this DVD because it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings said; "Nominated R for strong violence and sexuality, nudity and language". <br /> <br /> Which correct, IMO, should state; "Rated R for strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language". The word "sexuality" must come after a "comma", not a "and" because of the great difference in meaning it gives. I think many people who have seen this movie will agree with me that sexuality and nudity share almost non-existent. My first impression when looking at the mpaa rating was that I want to see something as "live" movie. therefore I felt cheated. story-wise, it was so-so, after all, who really cares about the story if the beautiful kari was in it. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> Joseph
