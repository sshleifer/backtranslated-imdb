Honestly, if anyone has a brain, there is no positive thing <br /> <br /> to say about this movie what ever. <br /> <br /> I lost my $ 1 rental this. I'd rather laugh at Will Smith who says "If you have a dream, you must protect it". <br /> <br /> All the actors must have been bored or had no fame at that time. even Matthew Mc Conahay * but you spell it * was better than all the actors in this movie when he played a psycho in Texas Chainsaw 4. If you see this movie and have something good to say, you must IQ, be extremely low, with such bad taste in movies hurts. Thanks ... and the truth has been spoken! <br /> <br /> Save yourself from the misery. <br /> <br /> Get the Devil's Rejects, now it's a classic.
