Every Sunday, a trio of buds comes together at a NYC dinner to boast their sexual conquests of the night before. Sometimes they are connected by a newlywed ex-buddy and hoochie hunter who hangs on them as a pulsating infant. They are undefeated corn dogs / corn dogs and Mia, who testifies to them on prowl, decides that they should be taught in a lesson, dammit. Ergo, she dates and dumps - why not? All three of them! <br /> <br /> Gasp. What a wild idea. What a radical, crazy gal. Women now have the right to dance and sleep as much as they want. As much as men do, even! <br /> <br /> There is a lonely ridiculous element in the "whip" - the fact that not even during the amigo's detailed discussions of their body functions and the tantric talents of the bed partners they are being scrapped. in diner turn around and say, "Dude, we are trying to eat here." In fact, a heh-heh gag has an older lady with great emphasis on the useful sexual characteristics of certain beverages. A big fat Kermit frog "Sheesh" for it. It is really unfortunate that a buddy movie with a good attitude, a smart, sweet heroine and three possible mating might have such a conclusion. <br /> <br /> PS - 30 "whip-oosh" sound effects to the scriptwriter for the use of the phrase "You go girl". It was tired in 2000 and it is now tired. <br /> <br /> Save your time and see some "Sex and City" resume ...
