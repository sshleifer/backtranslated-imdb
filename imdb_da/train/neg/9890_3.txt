Another rape of history <br /> <br /> This movie is a disaster; It just uses a historical story and creates a sweet love story with poor acting and low budget production. <br /> <br /> The movie should be 1/3 time, they just pulled the time to make a mini series. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes are so stupid and illogical, the soldiers are stupid, the costumes are a disaster. The Romans were good at fighting in open spaces, one of their armies was completely destroyed by the Germans as they tried to fight in a forest. In this movie, the Romans choose to fight in the side of the city, I believe to be real. <Br /> <br /> By the way, Cleopatra was of a Macedonian origin, meaning a slightly shiny person.
