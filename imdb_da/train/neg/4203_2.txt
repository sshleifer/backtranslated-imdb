What begins as a pretty smart farce about a somewhat shady security monitoring company is almost instantaneous to an uninteresting and completely inanimate murder mystery. David Arquette and the great Stanley Tucci are trying to make this train watch visible, but some things just aren't human. For example, what causes Gale to suddenly turn from a cute motherly figure to a drunken shrew at Tommy's parenting? Why would Heinrich, although admittedly a sleeper bag, destroy the business he is using his life by revealing and possibly murdering his customers? Why does the apparently sensible Tommy think Heinrich could be a murderer (based almost exclusively on a dream), and even though it was credible, why wouldn't he go to the police? And why didn't Gale activate the alarm when she came home, especially after howie had it turned off? Of course, all these events are necessary for the plot (and I use the term very, very loosely) to unfold. And it can be forgiven if it resulted in even the slightest bit of comedy. But everything from Howie's description of his rape to the wrong misidentification of Gale to the final "joke" of Gale and Howie, still dead, is more tasteless and pathetic than anything else. <br /> <br /> I marked the box indicating that my comments contained "spoilers", but there is no more I or anyone else could do to spoil this thing that already stinks to high heaven.
