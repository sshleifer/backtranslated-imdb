a very good story, good excitement for it ... but the last 10 seconds destroyed the whole movie ... what happened? extremely well made and a good story destroyed in the last few seconds ... sorry to say, but a voice 1 ... that's what it deserves, i think Chris Shadley could come up with a better end ... but maybe next time :) all this pointless blood does nothing? the end would lift the story to close to a 10, but it didn't .... the end ruined the whole story, i think most are not paralyzed and when they go a movie, they will have a good end even though it is intricate .. But the only lama here is the end ... sorry
