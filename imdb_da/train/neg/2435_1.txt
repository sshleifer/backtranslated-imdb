I will warn you here: I chose to believe in the reviewers who said this was not an action movie in the usual sense, rather a psychological drama, so you should appreciate it on that basis and you will be okay. <br /> <br /> I'm here to tell you they were wrong. Completely wrong. <br /> <br /> No, not quite; It is very disappointing if you are looking for an action girl they were right about. But it is also very unsatisfactory at all other levels. <br /> <br /> Tom Beringer was not that bad, I suppose, no worse than normal; But what did they have to throw Billy Zane into this? Was it a kind of death desire by the producers? One way to make their movie a guaranteed flop? If so, it worked. <br /> <br /> If they were actually looking for success, why not throw someone who can shop? Oh, and maybe just as well go to a screenwriter who knows how to write. Oh yes, and a director who knows how to lead. As someone sat through this mess, actually thought it would soon cash in, I can assure you that it never did. Too bad it could have been a good movie.
