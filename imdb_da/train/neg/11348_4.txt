Six GIs, soon to be sent home and discharged, become full and sneak into a cult meeting in Asia. Surrounded by hat figures, two male dancers make a fight. Behind them lies a woven basket on an altar and a figure painted appears and begins to imitate a snake and finally bites one of the dancers on the neck. The imitating snake is dressed in some scaly body stretch. (This is certainly a female imitation hose.) The cult member who threw them into the secret meeting has warned the six men repeatedly that the ceremonies must not be interrupted and absolutely no pictures taken or otherwise they will be chased down and killed. Of course, the GIs take a flash picture, send the cult members to an angry hysteria, steal the basket containing the "snake" and run off with it in the Asian evening. <br /> <br /> One of the boys, the most offensive and snarky, dies of a cobra bite on the neck, though no one can explain how the snake entered his hospital room. <br /> <br /> Back in New York, it seems a bit old news when they were discharged Men sit down in their civilian lives and still maintain their bond with each other. Their job extends from the head of a bowling alley (David Janssen) to completing research students (Richard Long). James Dobson, Jack Kelly and Marshall Thompson are also part of the neighborhood. Richard Long has a lovely blonde girl friend. Kelly is a somewhat reckless womanizer. But they go well enough, and everyone seems happy. <br /> <br /> Then a dark, shy look, mysterious woman (Faith Domergue) appears, and Marshall Thompson has a taste for her and insinuates her into the group. <br /> <br /> Guess what happens. First Janssen is frightened by a shadow in the back seat and dies in a car accident. Then Kelly gets a visit from Domergue. Something scares him so badly, he tumbles through the window and dies in the fall to the sidewalk. Long and Dobson begin to suspect what the viewer already knows - that Domergue has had something to do with the deaths. They also expect her to become a cobra, which is the case. Dobson confronts her with her suspicions and she proves her point. <br /> <br /> At this time, Long and Thompson are thoroughly frazzled, especially Thompson, who is in love with Domergue and has discovered that she is attracted to him, even though he has to explain to her what "love" is. Does not matter. A final ruthless attack by the cobra woman against Long's girlfriends - not one of the six original offenders - and Thompson has to throw the snake out of the window. On the pavement below, the body changes to Domergue. The end. <br /> <br /> I think I will skip most of the issues raised by the plot. I just want to mention one of the more prosaic in passing. Who paid for Domergue's fare from somewhere in Asia to New York? Who pays their utility bills at the hotel? Who paid for his spectacular wardrobe? How will she speak American English as well? What the hell is going on? The authors and director have obviously seen some of Val Lewton's modest horror films, and although there has not been much effort in this production, they have grimly stolen some gimmicks from Lewton. For example, in Lewton's "The Cat People", the woman is transformed into a black leopard, but with a slight exception, the threat is always preserved in the shadows, and it is more creepy for it. Most of the transformations here also use shadows, but unlike Lewton's, the shadows are clumsy and unambiguous. <br /> <br /> Lewton also made occasional use of what he called "buses". Lewton's first "bus" was a literal one. A potential victim rushes through Central Park's dark tunnels with only the sound of footsteps. Something or someone follows her. She freezes with scare under a street lamp. Some of the bush's branches are shaking over her. She looks up. There is a loud, hissing scream that makes your hair stand on the end. It's a bus that uses its air brakes to stop her. The producers used at least two "buses" in this movie and they amount to nothing. A guy goes too distracted over a cross, for example, and there is a sudden robbery of a truck that almost hits him. There is no setup for the shot. It is jammed with a shoehorn. I'm not very interested in movies that run the stereotype of snakes like slimy, ugly, poisonous and fake. In fact, no snakes are slimy, most are harmless, and many are exceptionally beautiful. Moreover, they are more feminine than masculine in their weak movements and serpentine approach to goals. Do you want a reptilian symbol of masculinity? Try a six-lined racer. It's a really quick lizard. When it sees something to eat, it pops up and gobbles it down. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you want to see some nice, low budget scary movies, don't bother with this. Find "The Cat People" or one of Lewton's other smaller masterpieces, of which this is an obvious copy.
