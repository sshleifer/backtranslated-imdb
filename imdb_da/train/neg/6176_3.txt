I'm not a big fan of Stooges' slapstick, but I find their story interesting. I have recently tried to check things from every Stooge era, but the ability to see Joe shorts doesn't seem to come easy; This is the only one I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> Some say the quality issues with Joe era shorts are really not Joe's fault and I suppose that is the case. Joe as a performer is far from the worst of this. The thing that concerns me most about it has been pointed out in another comment: Pitting the other guys against the third violates the entire comedy team / Stooges ethos. Perhaps Joe's style was perceived by those responsible as not really appropriate - even though there were no real off-camera conflicts between him and the others - and that was their way of working around. <br /> <br /> And what about the titles of this and some of the other late Stooges shorts? Absolute lack of creativity takes place there; Was this kind of thing the cause or impact of the shorts market dry up?
