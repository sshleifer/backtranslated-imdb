I can't believe the same guy who instructed this crap and Dracula 2000. Dracula 2000 was innovative, fresh and well-written, if badly acted. <br /> <br /> This pile can't even claim it. It starts with the Dracula defeat at the end of Dracula 2000. Then the story ignores afterwards describing what happened after that. After the story it could have been a good sequel in one way or another, but Craven chose to go in style with his older films, without having any good tie, but the biggest villain's name. Even the actor who played Dracula was different (going from dark hair in Dracula 2000 to a blonde here). <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you respect your taste in movies.
