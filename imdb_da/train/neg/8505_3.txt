"Semana Santa" or "Angel Of Death" is a very weak movie. Mira Sorvino plays a detective trying to find a killer who shoots arrows in humans. Mira has an Italian accent that falls from time to time. Couldn't she just speak English? All the other characters have a forced Mexican English English accent that is distracting. The dialogue is very poor and the delivery of it is wood. The cinematography looks good, but it is not enough to save this tripe. THIS NEXT PART IN THIS AUDIT HAS NO SPOILER !!!! <br /> <br /> Under the climax it seems that the villain is coming away, but then he comes back down the stairs to get shot and make a cool stunt down the railing. It just shows that this script has no originality. AVOID!
