This is an amateur movie shot on video, not an "electrifying drama" when DVD liner notes fake boobs. I've seen much better things from undergraduate film students. Most of the story unfolds with an all-nite taxi ride around Jakarta. This movie could have been made with a single camcorder, but there are a few sections where two cameras were used and the content was jumping together later. Editing is extremely rough. The final editing was probably done with two cameras, jumping content back and forth instead of with a proper editor. Maybe they did the editing in the taxi too? The English subtitles were written by someone who is not fluent in English, eg "Where are you going now?" Saying the production quality is on par with Blair Witch is generous. If you're not scared away yet, this movie was an ambitious and creative effort, with lots of cool and funky pictures from all over Jakarta.
