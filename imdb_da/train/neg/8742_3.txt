Having seen the trailer of this movie in the cinema, I thought it was an original concept for a thriller that put it in the competitive world of computer companies. All star cast was another message that this movie would probably be good. But since I didn't go to see it in the first release week, it disappeared in week 2, where I was afraid something was a miss. Patiently I waited for it to be DVD release, so bought it rushing home for an enjoyable evening view. The expectation on the way home was far better than the film. For a start, the direction is appalling. There is no thought at all, and the director is just a role for himself, so he can look in the movie. I wouldn't rush to hire him in the future. Secondly, the lead role is completely miscast as Ryan Phillipe. Phillipe is usually the cold character as in horrible intentions and the gun's way, but in this he must be a bumbling hero, which he tries to portray by slipping when he runs and has nerdy friends, but he just doesn't look right. The female stars, Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani don't have enough, but when they do, none of the shows are close to their best. The only highlight of the movie is Tim Robbins in a role that could have been made for him, and it's his fiery temperament and mysterious ways that draw the film together. The last point is that this movie is another one that fills the trailer with scenes you can't see in the movie and instead only participates in deleted scenes of the DVD. Causing even more disappointment, although some of these scenes are raw, fill the important gaps in history.
