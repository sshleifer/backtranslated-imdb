If you are a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3K, Attack of the Giant Leeches or Pinata Survival Island, this movie may be for you. <br /> <br /> I live in Nashville and I didn't even know about the movie's existence until the day before its release, as the advertising company panicked and tamed Music Row with dozens of fliers and billboards. However, it lasted two weeks in theaters. <br /> <br /> Poor acting, poor writing and poor production only begin to describe this embarrassment on a movie. At first, the names are a bit big: Bo Price, Angel and Dixie? Eesh. <br /> <br /> Toby's immeasurably slow line delivery makes one wonder what production assistant is stuck and holding the cue cards away from the camera. The angel's character quickly changes from his city-slimmer ways to a cowgirl, sliding into southern snake after two days at the ranch. Her wardrobe goes from chic to a female version of Toby's - in the end, their outfits are identical, wondering if the wardrobe assistant gets sick. <br /> <br /> The sound is inconsistent - perhaps the most noticeable example is when Toby decides to swim and his voice suddenly sounds like he's shouting at a high school. There is never quite enough explanation or character development to be enough on the screen. Overactivation, extinction, grimaces and moods best describe the actors' interpretation and direction of the horrible script. <br /> <br /> This movie is best enjoyed after consuming a few alcoholic beverages and in company with your wittiest friends. But that doesn't say much.
