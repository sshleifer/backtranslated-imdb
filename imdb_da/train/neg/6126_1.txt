For that matter, it is one of the worst film productions ever made. The foundation goes as follows. Beat through the jungle looking areas for 10 minutes or so. Have Bo go somewhere and strip. Beating through the jungle some more. Give Bo another excuse to strip. Back to the jungle. Oh see! There is a Tarzan leader guy! Strip, Bo - strip. Kill the safaris. Tarzan looks guy has a fight scene. Saves Bo. Stay strips. Run credits. Run credits, run.
