The Japanese have always had incredible ambitions in their fantasy film. They have always been prepared to destroy cities with large plastic samples coming from outer space and elsewhere. The problem is that they have never had the money to succeed in making compelling special effects. This film, published in France under the title Les envahisseurs de l'espace, is no exception. Its ambition is to show three creatures from the giant squid to the giant lobster trying to get the upper hand on humans. It is extremely awkward and ridiculous, but it is also very pleasant. After all, we like these creatures and these movies after all, right?
