Yikes. It's pretty bad. The game is not good at first, and the decision to transfer it to movies does not benefit - especially as Peploe does not decide how she wants to treat the material's theatrical origin (we occasionally observe an observer theater audience, etc.). ) and have decided to go with a jumping editing style to keep you aware that you are watching a movie while actually serving to remind you that you see a very bad movie by a director overwhelmed by her material . Mira Sorvino's central achievement is the breath poor: scene-y and plummy, it's like she's playing that part via Helena Bonham-Carter's Merchant Ivory oeuvre. Only Fiona Shaw delivers notes - and it may be that her theatrical pedigree means that she is best able to handle the material - but it is difficult to see a movie for a performance alone, even though that performance is so bright, truthful and all as Shaw's. Ben Kingsley turns in an average and offline tour, and Diana Riggs daughter, Rachel Stirling plays her supporting role as just that. Unfortunately, none of Bertolucci's magic rubs off on his wife if this film is to be the proof.
