This movie is great, remember you - but only in the way it tells a very bad story. Stella is so terribly raw and never learns better. Her husband is incredibly snobby and less mindful. No one ever learns better. Is it realistic? Somehow, Stella understands that her daughter is ashamed of her merry manners and dress, but doesn't understand that she just needs to tone it all down? I do not think. Stella is a good woman and a very good mother. Giving himself up so her daughter can be associated with a bunch of bigoted snobs is disgusting. <br /> <br /> Much of what we see could have been normal in the past - people have a beer or two, enjoy a piano, dances - but it's made to be a kind of moral inferiority. "I can't make our child live this way!" Save me. <br /> <br /> This story tells me one thing: that the unwashed working class can never hope to strive for the heights of the upper classes. And it's simply a load of hogwash.
