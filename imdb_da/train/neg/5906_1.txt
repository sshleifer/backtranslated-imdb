This movie was horrible. The reason sucked, the play was bad, editing was unfortunate, and this movie makes me want to stick my eyes out. I wish I had the time I spent watching this movie back. The balloon scene was stupid, Mormon's jokes are really old, the soundtrack sucked, I saw no chemistry between the two leaders, it's full of stereotypes, stupid local "celeb" cameos. Most noteworthy was Part "I need to run as fast as I want .." computer idiot. What is worst is that these actors had to play themselves on the spiritual side, and even they turned it up. This movie helps create a wide variety of missions to integrate LDS beliefs into Hollywood. DVS. RM, Church Ball, etc. Etc. I'd leave to watch this movie and instead run my head first in a wall. You'll be more entertained than seeing this bad excuse for a show.
