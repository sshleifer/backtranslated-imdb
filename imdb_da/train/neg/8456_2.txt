I started watching this movie with my girlfriend. And after 5 minutes I was alone. <br /> <br /> I succeed at the end. It has been a painful experience. <br /> <br /> I liked jean hugues, but I think he needed to eat like us, and so he agreed to play in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are only 5 characters and the rest can be called 'art' or something I couldn't express, but I didn't understand at all. <br /> <br /> The only worst movie I saw was a breakdown, but I'm pretty sure now that I have enough experience to see it again. <br /> <br /> Good luck !! ; ISLAND)
