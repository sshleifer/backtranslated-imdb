An OK flick, located in Mexico, about a hitman (Scott Glenn) who hitches a trip with fighting American writer and his Mexican girlfriend after a hit. He pays them to take him to the limit? <br /> <br /> It starts well enough but fights quickly and dies. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> The final relationship twist is poorly created and hard to believe. A lack of passion and essentially no justification behind her leaving one man for the other made it ridiculous - and the end was predictable and boring. <br /> <br /> ** END SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> Harvey Keitel is the American agent on the hitman's track, but he seems a little confused as to how boring and slow the script is ...
