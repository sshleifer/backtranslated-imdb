Tim (Gary Daniels) desperately wants to break into serious TV reporting. When a job he asked for goes wrong, he gets fired. His beautiful but empty girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley) says sayonara too. When he comes home, Tim is surprised to find that his house has an intruder (Christopher Lloyd) from the planet Mars! Call him Uncle Martin, Tim is soon trying to help his new friend navigate life on earth. But Martin gets into trouble wherever he comes from the bathroom to the laundry room and much more. Lovely Lizzie (Daryl Hannah) finally sees a chance to make time with Tim, but even in true love it runs smoothly. Soon everyone in the television sets off on Tim and hopes for a story about a real stranger. What is a man to do? For those who loved the old TV show of the same name, with Bill Bixby and Ray Walston, this movie is not worth tying the magnificent boots. It is truly, undeniably terrible, without a plot and an addiction to supposed special effects that also fall flat. Daniels is okay, since earthling but Lloyd is simply horrible as the alien who overcomes a storm. The rest of the casting is sufficient, as are costumes, sets and production details. While your kids see the cover and ask for this movie, convince them to choose another flick in the video store. Be sure kids and adults will find this movie a colossal well, so choose one night at the museum or around the world in 80 days instead.
