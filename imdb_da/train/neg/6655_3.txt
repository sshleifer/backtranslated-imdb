The only redeeming quality of this overwhelmed miscast melodrama is the landscape of southern France and the voice of Nana Mascouri, who sings the theme song. Stephanie Powers is mistaken and betrayed by a false accent. As has been pointed out, is she too old to play an 18-year-old and look too young as a grandmother with a school-age grandchild? Lee Remick is good, even though she is timeless in her later years. The talented Joanna Lumley is under exploitation and also manages to look forever young when her middle-aged son (Robert Urich) finally married Grandma Stephanie Powers. Stacey Keach's incessant arrogance casts doubt on what these women saw in him. Don't know how any viewer could relate to his exaggerated depiction? The most credible performance is given by Ian Richardson, who makes the rest of the cast as rank amateurs. It is credible that the beautiful male suitors of this epic would remain single, while patiently awaiting the subject of their emotions to finally accept accepting them. Can anyone believe that beautiful Robert Urich would remain single for decades and wait for Stephanie Powers to finally accept his endless marriage proposals? The WW2 engagement between Wehrmacht and Marquis is ridiculous. Initially, the Germans did not occupy the Provence part of France at the end of the war, it was controlled by the French puppet government from Vichy. We see the French resistance staging a daylight raid on the Mistral villa to steal the sheets, after which they all lounge under a bridge waiting for a caravan truck of Nazi troops to surprise and annihilate them? If you want to see a well-behaved mini-series set in a foreign country, don't see Mistral's daughter. A much better alternative would be The Thorn Birds.
