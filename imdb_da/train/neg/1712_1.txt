If Todd Sheets were to come out and admit that this movie was meant to spoof the zombie genre, I would change my rating to an eight. Try to imagine a movie where each scene, line, and even every play is designed to be a parody. I could probably throw out the alphabet soup, rearrange what was left of the letters, and still have a better script. Especially two scenes come to mind when I think of this movie. SPOILER ALERT! One is when Mike's father and the other father go, I repeat to walk down a staircase of jam filled with zombies. This is a small staircase, and although they brush up against the flailing undead, nothing happens to them. When they reach the exit, ex-marine turns, says "God, you are a horny bastard" and shoots only one. The other is in the military complex. The girl sticks a zombie with a machete and is immediately surrounded. The camera moves around her for about forty seconds while being surrounded by zombies in an arm's length away. Then she runs almost randomly from the crowd and joins the other people. SPOILER ALERT OVER! These scenes should be seen as believed. I still enjoy this movie as much as almost any comedy, just because it's so funny. Kudos to Todd Sheets to get so many people in his movie and have it run to do it but not really for anything else.
