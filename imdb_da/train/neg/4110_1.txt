It's just breathtaking in the terrible - you really have to see it! <br /> <br /> Depending on your perspective, Dylan Walsh is either a savior or a problem here: as he is the only one on the screen who can actually get his lines out with something similar to natural cadences and bends, he either destroys the movie by pointing to everyone else's mistakes, or he saves it by giving some contexts for their terrible. <br /> <br /> I tend to see it later - thanks to him, it seems like a high comedy. He is the 7th football in a game of dwarf basketball, his skill set just doesn't apply in this context, and his discombobulation is delicious. The real treat, however, is Ms. Eastwood, whose inability to speak in English is so pervasive I actually googled her and expect to learn that she was a Russian beauty who expressed her lines phonetically without understanding their meaning. But no: she is just a talented American who will let you laugh with every line she falls. If she knew what the lines meant, keep an open question.
