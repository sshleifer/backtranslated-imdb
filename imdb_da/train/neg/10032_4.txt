The story was okay. Akshay Kumar was good as always, and that was the only good thing about the movie. Kareena Kapoor looked bad. There was so shade and crying over her size zero, but she didn't look good. I don't know why in hell Anil Kapoor accepted such a bad role. There wasn't much to do for him in the movie. Just because it's a Yashraj movie doesn't mean an actor has to accept the role of how bad it is. Said Ali Khan was okay. I think it is high time that Indian directors and manufacturers are beginning to think of Indian customers as intelligent parties. What are we? fools !!!! What do they think they will show 2 men taking a SWAT team to count and we will believe them. Is the Indian police so stupid that they are trying to nab some criminals .... they take a whole group of 100+ police officers and no one was there to surround the castle. The action was crap and I have never seen such bad action. Akshay Kumar was between a circle of 30-40 policemen who all shoot at him ..... and he shoots back on them. None of the police's bullet touched him, but he killed all the policemen. Crap. CRAP. <br /> <br /> I think the battle director who believed in this scene should retire. I strongly recommend not watching this movie.
