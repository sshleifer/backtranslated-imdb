I have seen many silly movies in my life, much, but it is undoubtedly the worst ever! I usually like silly movies if they are entertaining, but I can't even think of a good thing about this movie. I like "Teen Witch" for Heaven's sake. But S.I.C.K. have horrible plays, paralyzed porn music all over, and even sex scenes sucked! I would have to compare this movie's lameness with "Twin Dragons", "Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys" or even "a Very Brady Sequel". Although this is far worse than any of them. I ask you, don't even waste your time. Trust me, it's 2 hours you never come back.
