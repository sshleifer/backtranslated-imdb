Comedy Central has been successful with original programming using professional comics. The Chapelle Show, Mind of Mencia, The Daily Show and the very popular Colbert Report all star-professional cartoons, and all, or in the case of the Chapelle Show, were solid shows. When Sarah Silverman is one of the best female comics in the company, I expected good things when I voted in. <br /> <br /> I was so disappointed. <br /> <br /> There were some mildly fun sequences, but considering that the star is Silverman's caliber, the show could have been much better. It was just the pilot, and hopefully next week's show will be better. If not, get her some help in the form of better authors for the show.
