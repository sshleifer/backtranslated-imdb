This reminds me of when I was a believer who was born again, who was to be minister. I never thought I would be a minister or even graduate from high school because I was almost positive I would be raptured to heaven before it would ever happen. It was before I discovered that Christianity was a lot of rubbish. I am now an atheist, and it just shows that the "once saved always saved" doctor that Christians tell us is no more real than elves. If that were true, why did I leave many faithful born believers after many years? Yes, I was really saved. I prayed the stupid sinner prayer with all my heart. If Christians were to read their Bible, they would find that their god seems to be rape, genocide, abortion, and many other atrocities are in order according to him. They may be surprised to learn that not where is the word "rapture" mentioned.
