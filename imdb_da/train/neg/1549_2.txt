While Leon is sweet at SNL, he is only for a moment. Like most SNL sketch-to-movies, this cannot reach 90 minutes. It has some sweet moments (those you've seen in the trailer), but the actors are pretty much wasted. Tim Meadows does his best, but the plot does not have many high points. Will Farrell have a part. Farrell can be the funniest man alive ... but not in this movie. What a shame.
