I rented this movie because I hoped it would be one that the whole family would enjoy. Although the film is family-friendly, my family does not enjoy it because it gives a false picture of God. If you obey God and follow Him, you are not guaranteed success. Your football team will not always win. You do not get magical to get better grades. Infertility is not always cured. You don't always get a raise. Sometimes you are stuck in the old car. God does not exist to meet our every whim. We were rather made to glorify him. Sometimes we are most pleased with him when things seem to be bad for us. Living is Christ; to die is gain.
