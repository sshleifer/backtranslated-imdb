This movie was more effective in persuading me to be a Zionist conspiracy than a Muslim. And I'm Jewish. <br /> <br /> A man goes to the journalism school? Read an editorial? Freshman's rhetoric? These alarmist claims presented in a sweet way can prove convincing. But by offering no recognition of possible conflicting arguments, not even viable (or any at all) solutions, few sources, and every questionable origin, the argument makes an inefficient diatribe. <br /> <br /> And thank goodness for it - I don't want anyone to leave the theater that believes in any of this racist slap. <br /> <br /> A good lesson for me - and hopefully a warning story for you - is actually reading a movie before you see it.
