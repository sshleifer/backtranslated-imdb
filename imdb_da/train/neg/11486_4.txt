Because some people, like me, like to know everything about a movie, even though they plan to see it, including the end. Anyway, here's the end as I remember it because I couldn't have been more than 8 years old when I saw it for the first and only time on television. But I say, it was definitely scared the little child I was, and I thought about it for days after, and it still stands in my mind to this day, though some of the details are a little vague. Monkey Vigoda was in this movie? I can not remember it! I don't even remember that ol 'Barnabus was in this movie and I LOVED Dark Shadows. So at the end is the protagonist (Belinda Montgomery?) The lure of the judge (Joseph Cotton, I guess, although I remember being an old family doctor or something instead of a judge, see how the memory falls?) To the wedding, which as I remember it is in a kind of hole? Maybe I'm wrong and Shelley Winters is laughing, and the judge has a coat and the camera angle looks a little up to him, and he throws the robe back and he's got a kid and he says he's actually her father, the devil, and she is playing right into their hands (the satanic cult) because the "mortal" guy she is in love with (i think it is Robert Foxworth) also turns out to be the guy Satan wants to marry with The Demon with yellow eyes And, of course, they show Robert Foxworth, and his eyes glow yellow. There are many close-ups in the last few minutes of the movie. Everyone laughs and rejoices, except Belinda Montgomery, who is very unhappy and crying or screaming or something, and that's the end. The evil boys win.
