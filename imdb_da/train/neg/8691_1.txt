If there was a NULL rating, I would give it to this movie. Today was the second time I tried to see it, and I still couldn't do it from the beginning to the end. I can't believe in more stars given by others and can only assume that they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise! The play is frightening around, the script is blah, the child playing Nichole shows zero feeling even when she is threatened. The "southern" accent of the actress playing Amber's mother is ridiculous - I'm from Georgia and have friends from Texas - believe me, no one is talking like that! None of her feelings were real in any scene. The subject is very serious and deserves much better treatment.
