This horrible comedy drama became surprisingly sterling reviews on the release in 1979. I remember opening the LA Times movie file and watching a 2-page advertisement for "Chapter Two" filled with glowing captions like: "Better than" Goodbye girl! "and" neil simon does it again! "What does Neil Simon do? He takes an autobiographical situation (marry too soon after a beloved spouse's death) and makes it rusty, uncomfortable and - worst of all - unfunny. James Caan plays Neil - It's George - a writer who can't seem to come back in life after losing his wife; the intrusion of Martha Mason (real life Mrs. Simon ... soon to be ex-Mr. Simon) trying to love George despite his mood and general melancholy, Mason is very appealing here and may have saved the day when it was not for Caan's indifference (not to mention a sub-item on painfully thin blonde Valerie Harper, who brings the matter to a brunt). liked Mason's outburst at the end ("I'm wonderful! I'm NUTS about me!"), but I saw no happy end for these two people ... and the time showed me right. ** from ****
