Peter Fonda is so deliberately enervated as an actor that his lachrymose line-readings cancel any irony or humor in the dialogue. He trades sassy barbs and non-witty repartee with Brooke Shields as if he were a wooden block with waning hair; Even his minor touches (like catching a non-existent mustache on his grizzled face) do not reveal a character as much as an insecure actor being directed by himself, an insecure movie maker. In the southwest around 1950, a bad gambler (not a little cheat) wins an orphan, would be teen Lolita in a botched poker game; After getting a tax card promising gold in the Grand Canyon, bickering becomes twosome prospectors. Some wonderful prospects, and a weird but interesting como by Henry Fonda as a grizzled canyon man, are the only compensations in tired comedy drama, with the two leaders dragged by cartoon-like killers who will stop by nothing before they get their hands on the card. Shields are very pretty, but - although the camera loves her pouty, shiny beauty - she has no on-screen presence (and her tinny voice has no distance) every time she opens her mouth, it tends to either ring or duck. * 1/2 from ****
