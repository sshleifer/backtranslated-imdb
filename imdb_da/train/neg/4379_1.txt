<br /> <br /> Okay, I rented this movie while I was getting bed ridden jumped on painkillers and let me say it didn't help the movie anyone. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a man buying a car as he goes through a midlife crisis, he loves the car more than anything around him, one day his wife decides to borrow the car. Since I don't want to spoil (not that there was anything to spoil), I have to let your imagination find out "Zany" (and I use that word easily) that comes with it. <br /> <br /> I had to struggle to stay awake through this one-minute leash of a movie, and I'd like to say that if you're waiting for the movie store and thinking of being adventurous, please that it is not a waste of the movie it was printed on. <br /> <br /> Again, I could be wrong ...
