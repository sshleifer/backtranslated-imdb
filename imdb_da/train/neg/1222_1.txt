This is a seriously disturbed movie. Although the boys deserved some of what they got ..... the sadistic cruel executions were "a little" over the top. The only sign that showed some conscience early in the hunt was killed before he could offer some help to the sad plot. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, there was a promise of a mediocre affair, but it was just a move to put viewers in a false sense of security before the joy of what was to come. <br /> <br /> The only thing that could have saved the movie for me was if Jack Nicholson had jumped out of the bushes and shouted, "and where's the batman?". Kim Basinger could have screamed. <br /> <br /> Now it would have been cool!
