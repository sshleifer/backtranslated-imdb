When people ask me what's the worst movie I've ever seen this. It's not even close to MST3k level riffing, or midnight viewing at a theater, or even as a Disney channel late night filler. The only time I ever wanted to jump on Disney World (or Disney / MGM Studios in this case) was to grab Dick Tracey's mannequin jacket, rip it into tears and tuck it into the tour guides neck saying "Eat Eat this unholy shadow of darkness !!! " I have never been so angry with a movie, not even "Nutty Professor II: The Klumps" or "Flash Gordon". Want beautiful colors and movies? Is not here treasure. Critics continue to say "oh, but it also looks like a cartoon", it's good it's the color of a Gordito after several weeks in the sun. If so comfortable too. Beatty walks around this landscape and jumps around talking to her watch, herself and occasionally with the other actors, hoping that someone will tell him when the sequel starts shooting. To be fair I have only seen this movie once, but my pain limit is that of a man, not a God.
