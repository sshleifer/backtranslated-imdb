This should be one of the worst movies I have ever seen, the graphics are ridiculous, and the script is pathetic and the biggest question is how this little low brow script came through the selection process. <br /> <br /> I like all kinds of movies from deep dramas to the more male kills everything you see type of movies so I can't say I'm picky. I have struggled to find something to compare it with, but I just can't think of anything that matches this, maybe starship troopers 2. The witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and I'm thinking of throwing my DVD player out but In relation to this, its effects are great. The play is excellent and the script should be awarded. You know when a movie is bad in a fun way, good people this is not one of those that kills your soul minute by minute.
