Seriously, I'm too gooey romantic comedies and will be sucked into Miss Congeniality as well as Goodfella's ... but this movie? It makes no sense !!!! And I'm not even talking about the willing suspension of infidelity doesn't make sense. Why does her family live in England? Or at least why doesn't she have a British accent? She is confident about her father and he surprises her not to be around for the last two years. (On that subject, no one ever makes much of an agreement that she's gone so long). And what about the greasy clothes on the bachelorette party? I do not even admit that the escort she paid for falls in love with her - it could have been overcome by better filmmaking. I'm just saying that the characters, the setting, and the plot aren't enough to make an equally coherent story. Oh, and the worst is, in my opinion, that the filmmaker constantly uses the most unflattering angles on Deborah Messing's nose. I had sued the filmmakers if I was her! I honestly believe that I am all about women being the way they are, but why have I never discovered how incredibly strange the nose is over seven loyal years with Will and Grace? Oh! Because these manufacturers are friendly to her! This movie, like my second least favorite movie ever, Armageddon, is the filmmakers' fault, not the actors. I can see both Messing and McDermott in these roles with a better author, director and producer. <br /> <br /> This makes me easily vote as one of the worst movies I've ever wasted on. I'm just glad a friend lent me her DVD so all I wasted was time. If there was a way to make this review ZERO stars, I would do it.
