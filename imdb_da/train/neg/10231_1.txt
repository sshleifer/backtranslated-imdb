I honestly believe that, due to the dazzling reviews attributed to Steven Smith, I spent almost two hours on his debut offer. Have they all written by his friends? The action clings together, the music is annoying and over used, the manuscript is simply bleak and the actors (with the exception of the gardener) at best mediocre. I think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker, but say that it is brilliant when it is not, will definitely just encourage him to make the same mistakes again, ie. to continue writing his own scripts and using the same actors for another venture. Yes, it's his first movie, low budget, etc. I understand it, but it's also out there for members of the public to buy and it's just not up to scratch.
