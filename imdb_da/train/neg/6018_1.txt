I find it sad that Christians (and I am one) feel that we must make movies as "Left behind". We have much better stories to tell that it doesn't have to be so predictive. I was very disappointed with this movie. As an aspiring filmmaker who believes in Christ, I see this movie as the perfect example of what to do with my film career.
