My title should be enough. It confuses me that a culture so rich in literary expertise (Dumas, Flaubert, Balzac, Maupassant) would outperform such tosh as the "nouvelle vague" movie movement. Until the 20th century, France had a great tradition of artistic ease and wise philosophy. But the moment you give them a movie camera, they start acting as WOOOHOOO LOOK HOW WEIRD IN CAN BE! REASON? THEME? CLEAR MOVIE A AMUSEMENT PARK RIDE GO ROUND AND ROUND! At least it's not as bad as Godard (who has an unhealthy fascination with the smokers' head. Oh-la-la, quel artiste.). No, Truffaut maintains some visual clarity. But it also makes the security camera on a quickie mart. The two cannot be distinguished. <br /> <br /> Haha, just as a side to all your dweeby film school nerds: I bet the friend pops out in the neck right now. But don't go without reading the last sentence of my review. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you like French literature, you will HATE this. People who like this movie have probably never read other books than Jack Kerouac's ramblings or maybe "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". Or maybe they have read the lyrics of The Door's songs, and they think it is very moving. Whatever floats in your boat. I find it ironic that this film injects some (weak) allusions to Balzac, one of the finest and most significant writers who have ever lived. Nice sample, truffles. But you are not close to the ballpark. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as an AIDS infected syringe. <br /> <br /> If you are the type of person who likes to think, then stick to Jean Cocteau (ORPHEE), Robert Bresson (PICKPOCKET) and the Japanese Masters Kurosawa (IKURU), Kobayashi (KAIDAN) and Teshigahara (SUNA NO ONNA). <br /> <br /> If you're an idiot, enjoy your Truffaut, Godard and Andy Worhol. And for good reason, push the vein back into your neck. You look like a cabbage.
