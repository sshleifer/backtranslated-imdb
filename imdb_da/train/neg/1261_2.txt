I am a Jean Harlow fan because she had star quality. I don't think her movie is good, and I don't even think she was a good actress, but she was definitely great in comedies. Every single comedy in The Girl from Missouri is very good. But this movie is perhaps more like a love story. Jean Harlow is wonderful in this one and you can forget about the rest of the cast - their performances do not bring anything new. It always impressed me a lot to believe that Harlow's beautiful body was a sick woman. Well, in this movie she looks beautiful.
