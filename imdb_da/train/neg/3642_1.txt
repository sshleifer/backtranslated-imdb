Unfortunately, the film is more concerned about making lame social comments on a real event, but does not have the balls to legitimately document what happened. The constant rhetoric where violent video games are not due (I get the impression Ben Coccio is an avid gamer) or how media and music are completely devoid of influence is the obvious message (we even get a ridiculous scene of the two boys burning ALL their CDs 'is, talk about subtlety!), but the movie just goes away with it because its' fiction'. Nice try. Yes it is a good idea to ease the media of influence, but how can we the children who have actually planned and executed a school shooter affected by the media? or video games? We do not, and we usually use this movie, because these children are wise enough to completely refrain from the media, but stupid enough to scorch a Nazi symbol on earth? haha, i somehow don't think so. <br /> <br /> The film treats you over the head with its depiction of the family's normality, it hardly makes you think there was no serious flaw in the family dynamics of children who actually went out and shot their fellow students. Why are everyone so worried that killing seems "normal" when they are clearly not? A completely false and false depiction.
