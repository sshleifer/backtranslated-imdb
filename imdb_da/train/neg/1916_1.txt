This film is complete waste. Some imbecile intellectuals comfort themselves by doing everything they can to claim aristocratic superiority over the working class. Nothing more than a piece of self-complacence catharsis. Ã†gligt. <br /> <br /> If this kind of movie is set in the US, it will definitely make a big joke. And simply because it comes from 'the other side', it makes itself a masterpiece, a wonderful entertainment for some brainwashed and / or brainwashing westerns (some George W. maybe :). A typical cold war sequel, some sort of joke. <br /> <br /> I would say that if this - as expressed in this movie - is all that Soviet intellectuals had thought of all these years, then they may deserve all the misery they claim to have gone through. BUT NO! For, like many others, I have read and seen real masterpieces made from truly outstanding Soviet intellectuals. For example, something relevant to the dog is "White Bim Black Ear" - both Gavriil Troyepolsky's book and Stanislav Rostotsky's film - a real masterpiece. Real life, true tragedy, really sad, real pride and dignity, one of the real best in the Soviet era.
