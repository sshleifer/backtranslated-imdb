I saw this at an arty cinema that also showed "last days" and some Charlie Chaplin movies. Based on the quality of the other features, I decided to give "Immortel" a chance. I almost went out of this movie and I like science fiction! The story is set in a futuristic New York city, filled with Blade Runner style sky ads and some similar debates on cloning / synthetic people. Unfortunately, the manuscript was not condensed enough for an hour and twenty-five minute movie. There are three groups in this world: people, artificial people, and Egyptian gods. The artificial people seem to have the upper hand and control the city's policy. The people are slaves and used for eugenics and organ donation. The Egyptian gods have a fluid pyramid (modeled on Khufu's great pyramid and complete with a deteriorated exterior and leave a smooth "cap" on the pyramid. Wouldn't a liquid futuristic pyramid be in perfect condition?). The pyramid rests on the city, and no one on earth understands what it is or why it is there. I will not drill you with the so-called plot, but there are lots of unnecessary doing and many rough scenes. The movie, as I said, seems to have been influenced by Blade Runner, and perhaps also by The Fifth Element and The Matrix. At the end of the film, credits were made grateful to the United Kingdom, France and Italy. The film is French, but uses British actors who do not speak French. It is therefore obvious that their French dialogue has been called. This is a distraction, and I also think that switching back and forth between real people and rather distracting animations. It doesn't help that the animations are poor - no better than a video game. Skip this one.
