One of my friends gave me this movie. A friend of mine is now in a hospital where a team of doctors is trying to surgically remove a DVD house from his ***. <br /> <br /> I was excited by the possibilities of another Michael Chabon movie. After all, his novels have given me a lot of entertainment, and previous acting adaptations were great, but boy was I wrong. First of all, the people who did the molding must have slept while they did. I imagine the castings went something like this. "Tell me, do you like fish?" "Yes, I enjoy a lot of fish." "Wonder full, you're employed. Have some money." <br /> <br /> than is the script. I have read Chabon, which I hope was blind before he could see this piece of music, and it has absolutely nothing to do with his novel. I am not sure why it annoyed me as it did, but it could have something to do with the fact that listening to a speech-impaired 90-year-old duck hunter with a pretty cranial lob dysfunction would have been a treat In comparison to the one-liners these 2-degree model massacre children spat out. <br /> <br /> This is an actual line from the movie; "If you tell me something you've never said aloud to anyone before this moment becomes unique!" Unique? Do it? Do It Really Of course you are not plank. Please send me Imodium. I have a whole **** ing strip. <br /> <br /> The management is ... good. I have nothing. Maybe Rawson Marshall Thurber got equal words, his grandmother exploded or something. Stick to controlling comedies. No one sticks to advertising. <br /> <br /> This movie is so horrible that it left me beating my head against a wall so hard it took me back to the Stone Age. I give it 2 stars because I don't want to be the guy who saw a 1 star movie.
