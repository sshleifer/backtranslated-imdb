argh! this movie hurts my head. and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> maybe it's just my growing hatred of the action genre, but even as a kid when I wanted to swallow tripe like Navy Seals, I still considered this movie reluctant. now I totally disdain it. <br /> <br /> Take a pretty good, fast pace story. Keep the title and throw away the rest. instead use some half-assesd future gladiators storyline thats so full of plot holes the whole thing in danger of collapsing (why is there a rebel base in the middle of the arena, what about the cameras? why have clearly marked recordings of what really happened on the baker's flaws in an unprotected space?) <br /> <br /> The whole movie screams in the eighties, from the truley horrible score to the greasy shiny costumes. ugh. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. I know some people liked it, but some people get rid of being peed on, and I don't understand them either.
