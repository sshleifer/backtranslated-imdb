I don't think this is too bad for a show in the right conditions. I tolerated the first season. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is a show about lawyers who are not real lawyers. God forbid anyone actually going to law school based on these shows that I had heard was the case when I saw some interviews of the show. It just made me gagge a little. <br /> <br /> In addition, Spades and Shatner, who will be the stars of the show, are the most annoying. Although this may be a compliment in some situations, it is certainly not here. Their constant harassment of the women on the show is fun first. But since that is what they are literally doing all the time, I realize that this is as deep as the show is going to get. Trying to cheat some serious, dramatic, and even tearful moments in the midst of this mockery of a real show, fails to compensate for the progressive range of interest I've experienced trying to enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> Alan Shore's flamboyant and free "public service announcements" where he plays his statements does not impress. Denny Crane is just annoying. I was embarrassed to him and to the author's play for Crane's speech wearing a colonial outfit. <br /> <br /> I give two stars because there are moments when I thought the show's attempt to deal with some modern issues was done with care. <br /> <br /> I think the show's authors realized that the sexual harassment that Denny and Alan showed was becoming indulgent even to those who were more appealing to them from the start. The thing is, I don't care if the sexual harassment treatment in the show has done well, but I just felt that the author insulted me with artificially implanting sexual banners throughout the show in the hope that my libido will keep me going back to more. I'm no longer teens and I think this show is promising if its goal was not to take into account the lowest common denominator to get ratings. <br /> <br /> Of course I write this after I realized that it really doesn't get much better than this. It's a shame because it's one of those shows I'd love to love.
