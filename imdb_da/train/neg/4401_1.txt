We went to the movie with a group because the game we were going to was canceled. It is undoubtedly one of the worst movies ever. It's not that I don't like cult movies I do. But nothing happens in the movie. You don't feel any connection with the characters at all. endless times without dialogue. And the car. How do they have a large tent and beds chairs and clothes every day in that car? It's a two-seater! However, I have to say that the landscape is beautiful, but not in a movie, the director should have made a photograph of the film so we could skip over 80 minutes of useless time, with nothing happening anyway. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it as it is a waste of your time
