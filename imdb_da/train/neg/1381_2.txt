Mild SPOILERS contained herein. I spoil this movie to save you the trouble of seeing it. <br /> <br /> Jet Lis's films fall into one of two categories: Shaolin movies and modern Hong Kong films revolve around Triads or Triad as organizations. Each genre has its best and worst movies. `Twin Warriors' is Jet Lis's best Shaolin era flick while 'The Evil Cult' is his worst. `Fist of Legend ', while recent is the best` modern era' Jet Li movie. "Black Mask" is undoubtedly the worst. <br /> <br /> Jet Li plays a self-sufficient mercenary who received an injection that gives him superhuman ability but shortens his lifetime. In his 'new life' in exile, he plays a pacifist librarian. When his old mercenary goes on a rampage, Jet Li becomes a vigilante determined to stop them. He drones a very stupid corrugated mask to hide his identity from the police (and the public) as a librarian, and to hide his true identity to his former chambers of arms. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was called and awful by it. Why does Jet Li pick up and hold his guide teacher if he is a pacifist? Is there a love story between them? Why is police officer not indifferent to learning about the true identity of the black mask? The reason is just plain BAD. Bad in superhero cheesiness, bad in the sense that characters are never properly developed, bad in its character interactions, which all topped with a half-explained story, I quickly lost interest in. The action and martial arts sequences are far above the top. Lots of blood, gore (separate body parts aplenty), explosions, and matrix-superhuman martial arts fiascos are present in the film. Unfortunately, this is the movie's best and only selling point. To see that Jet Li plays a vigilante superhero in a Mission Impossible movie "Black Mask" delivers. For the rest of us, Jet Li fans are a real disappointment. This is one of those films where Jet Li never becomes Jet Li: nor does he get the chance to charm us with his charisma, nor a chance to impress us with his impressive but realistic martial arts ability. <br /> <br /> Normally, a Chinese knockoff of Ozzy Osbourne would be enough to cheat me in a movie, unfortunately, "Black Mask" had proved to be an exception to that rule. In fact, the antagonist of this movie, by the way he dresses, his long straight hair and trademark round sunglasses resemble the modern and old Ozzy Osbourne. But the villain is not on the screen enough to make the gimmick worth. I suppose Ozzy was passionate; Beyond the appearance of the villains, he also ran a satanic look. So much more could have been made by Ozzy Osbourne villain gimmick! If only the author, the director or someone had bothered the background and developed the character of the movie's villain! <br /> <br /> "The Black Mask" was the first Jet Li movie released on video in the US after deadly weapons 4, and I'm glad I got away from it so far. It may well have ruined my entire perception of Jet Li as a martial artist and actor. If you want to see Jet Li on his worst, rent `Black Mask 'and' The Evil Cult 'and turn it into a dual function or horror, both intentionally and unintentionally. Otherwise, adhere to movements that utilize the talents of Jet Li, and have plots that are half-thought out and plausible. 3/9 stars.
