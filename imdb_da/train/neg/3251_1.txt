I caught this movie on FX last night and when I sat there watching it, it seemed to me that it might be the worst movie ever. Poor plays, bad movies, bad sound, incredible battle sequences, stupid characters. All these made it the most ridiculously bad movie I've ever seen. It was so bad I was thrilled it was pure lack of something semi-competent that I had to keep an eye on ... and they made a sequel!
