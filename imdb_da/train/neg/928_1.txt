This movie is so awful that it's hard to find the right words to describe it! <br /> <br /> In the beginning, the story is so ridiculous. A narrow-minded man can write a better plot! The actors are boring and unbearable, perhaps they were forced to play in this movie. <br /> <br /> The National Forest camera recordings are the only good thing about this movie. I should feel ashame because I paid for this miserable picture. Hopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar movie with such a worse story :-)
