What a wasted opportunity to actually make an interesting movie about a complicated subject. There is very little exploration of how it really feels to be a straight (or gay) man working in a gay sexual environment. The dancers continue to talk about their art as if it has no erotic component. They cannot all be prostitutes for rent, but they are actually sex workers who play fantasies and sell private sessions where more than dancing is offered. From the film one could get the impression that they mainly appeal to the women who go to gay clubs and then end up hiring the "dancers" for private sessions. Even the shots in the club show only women in front of the stage and the "dancers" only play for the women in the audience. This is just not the reality of these clubs. It would be quite difficult to live with making private dances for equal women and couples. So what do they really feel about their gay admirers and clients? We learn very little. Instead, we get fillers. A gay activist who does not add anything to the study of straight dancers. A leader who tells us about the costumes to pull the actions, but gives no insight into the dances and attitudes of the dancers. <br /> <br /> The pictures in Mexico City are generic. The fake assembly showing sausage cheese is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This is a completely simplified movie that should only be of interest to those who want to see a few pictures of beautiful boys dancing. The rest of the movie is an insult to gay men.
