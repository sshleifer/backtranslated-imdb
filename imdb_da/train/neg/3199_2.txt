Joe Don Baker. He was great in "Walking Tall" and had a good deal in "Goldeneye", but here in "Final Justice" all hope is gone ... the dark side has won. <br /> <br /> As with most of humanity, my main experience with this was at MST3K, and what an experience it was! Mike and the robots dig their claws deep into Baker's plentiful flesh and eat this flick completely. It's obvious that they just started with "Mitchell" on their anti-Joe Don kick and here's their continuation on a theme. It gives a fun experience though: there are plenty of choice riffs. My favorites - "John Rhys-Davies for sale", "It's Meatloaf: Texas Ranger", "none of them are spongy", "Why has she dressed her prom dress in bed" and my favorite - Son of a ... "What? What was he son of: Son of a BEAUTIFUL MAN?" Indeed, "Final Justice", as Joe Don puts it in the movie, is "a great fat nada". But here it actually has some entertainment value. You get a chance, catch this version of "Final Justice". <br /> <br /> Two stars for "Final Justice". Ten for the MST3K version only. <br /> <br /> Don't try to visit Malta when Joe Don is in town.
