The story of Norman Maclean is a masterpiece; Redford's film is a mediocrity. He adds banal scenes of the Maclean brothers going over a fall and of them double-dating in a seedy bar that didn't even suggest in the story. The cipher, Brad Pitt, trying to play the charismatic Paul Maclean, a genius outdoors, turns out to be either risky or depressing, depending on what the original story meant to you. Some of the flight casting scenes are beautiful. Also, Tom Skerritt as father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are strong and masculine, as men were once expected to be. None of the women get an impression on the film, which is regrettable because Maclean loved the women in her story and made it clear, even poetic.
