Yes, I admit I was crying under this movie. It was so incredibly disappointing that I couldn't help myself but cry. TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) has done so again. First, having the Million Dollar Man (ex-professional wrestler) on their program and now this. The Omega Code follows a stream of outlined religiously oriented films. It was quite funny, but at the same time it was disturbing to find it so biblically inaccurate. The film follows what is known as the "Bible Code" instead of following the actual biblical scriptures. This film is extremely badly made; from his writing to its direction to his hilarious horrible play. It's depressing that people actually put effort into this movie. It seemed more like a fictional movie that anyone would watch on the US channel or a direct video for the home rather than a theatrically released movie. I strongly recommend that you do not see this movie, even if your life depended on it.
