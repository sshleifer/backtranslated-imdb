I watched this movie alone in the dark, and it was full moon outside! I didn't do it for the purpose, it just happened this way. Then all the items for this movie were to scare hell out of me !! Well, I didn't, I actually wanted to turn off the DVD player after only 8 minutes, but I thought to come and give it a try, unfortunately I did. The action was horrible, the only one with any decent acting was Samaire Armstrong. The reason is not original, if you are a horror fan, then it is just the same thing you have seen many times before. Some scenes made no sense and you just get the feeling that the instructor wanted to make the movie longer! The monster was the biggest disappointment in the movie. The (scary) scenes looked like they belong to a horror movie from the 80s, as there wasn't enough technology, but some good movies were made back then! I was surprised to see the name of a larger production company at the start of the movie, I didn't think they could put any money into it and make it decent? !! I couldn't agree with the reviews that the movie got, it's also my rating for that, 3 out of 10.
