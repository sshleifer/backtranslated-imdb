Okay. Look, I've seen many, and I mean many of these types of movies. You know them where the DVD deck just looks so good and scaarrryyy that you just can't wait to see it? Well, I got it again. And I get pretty tired of it. But I go down. It's pretty simple. It sucked (I know, quite juvenile), but it did. And I agree with the other poster that if we had to go through the boring thing why oh why did the leading actress have been so unattractive? Distracting, so if I can add. And the scowl she used conveyed undissolved pain / grief over the death of her daughter, did some help. I mean, Jesus. Oh, but the crawling-on-her-back demon thing was pretty nice ...
