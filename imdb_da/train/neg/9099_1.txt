This review also includes a spoiler of the first movie - so if you haven't seen any movies and want to but don't want the spoiler, don't read this review! <br /> <br /> While this movie is about Christian and Kathryn meeting for the first time, the film is a poor copy of the first gruesome intentions. Actors, as they had portrayed Ryan Phillippe's Christians and Sarah Michelle Gellar's Kathryn, are actually very bad substitutes. It also can't draw the smarmy, snooty rich-kid attitude that the original actors did. It is quite terrible that part of the dialogue was proper - not so much between Christian and Kathryn, but if you listen well enough, you recognize it. There are also discrepancies in the plot - if it really was Christian's and Kathryn's first meeting, why is it that Christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie? He was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original film (with Reese Witherspoon character). <br /> <br /> Also, the context of the photograph / "You could be a model" comment on the end was completely paralyzed and did not add anything at all. Overall, this movie was a waste of time. I can't believe they made a cruel intention 3.
