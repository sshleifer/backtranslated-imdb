The movie My name is Modesty is based on an episode that takes up a page in the 10th fashionable Blaise novel called Night of the Morningstar. It describes an event in which the young modesty (17 in the book, mid-twenties in the film) claims its leadership in a war over a casino. Since this is set before the actual Blaise adventures, her trusted sidekick Willi Garvin is not in the movie. This is one of the biggest problems, as the relationship between Blaise and Garvin was always one of the fascinating aspects of novels and the long-running comic book. The second problem is that the movie is simply incredibly boring because it really is only a small episode blown up in a manuscript. The molding is okay, but the Alexandra City is not really convincing as the heroine and actually too old for the role of playing the young Modesty. I get the impression that this movie was a quick and dirty solution for not losing the rights to the Blaise franchise.
