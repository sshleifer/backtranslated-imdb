This movement is just as bad as they come. However, I was forced to give it a 2 for the landscape. There are many good shots in the southwest, including many in Monument Valley, one of the most breathtaking places in the United States. It also starts with John Ford, one of the most filmed. In fact, a scene with Kris and the girl was recorded in a place called John Ford point.
