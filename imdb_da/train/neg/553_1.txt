After eager wait for the end, I must say I wish I would not have joined the whole series in the first place. The last episode was against the previous seven years. It has ruined everything. The journey was 23 years, but Captain Janeway has the power to reduce it ... let alone seven years. Why Seven? Why not just one? Or nothing? Why not avoid the whole adventure? Crew members died along the journey. Why would she just save seven out of nine? The others don't count or what? The most ridiculous part when the crew says coming home is not really the most important thing for them. As it says, "the journey is more important than the destination". Incredible. And in the final stage they are surrounded by other federation ships, and the land is in sight. Nothing about landing, returning to normal life. <br /> <br /> Worst end ever.
