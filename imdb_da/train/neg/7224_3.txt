The movie stays in the gray for too long. Very little is explained as the film progresses, with as a result many nice sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning, but because of the story's story they only become weird and not understandable. It forces you to watch the movie again, but no way to do it. It's that I watched this movie in the morning, I'm sure if I saw this movie in the evening, I'd fallen asleep. For me, the film was like a poor man's "Blade Runner". <br /> <br /> The movie leaves too many questions and unlikely. It makes the film leave a meaningless and endless impression. <br /> <br /> Also, the weird look of the movie doesn't help much. The movie has halved the CGI / halve reality, but it's not done half as well, impressively, spectacularly and imaginatively as would be the case, for example, in recent films such as "Sin City" and "300". They even created half of the movie's characters using a computer that seemed to be a very pointless and unequal choice, considering also that the cartoon is not that impressive. Sure, the futuristic environment still looks good and the film was of course not cheap to do, but its style over substance, and in this case it is really not a positive thing to say. <br /> <br /> Some of the lines are also quite awful and uninteresting. The greatest god of the movie says constant lines like; "I have to do this, but that's not one of your worries why I want to do it." Then you just don't say anything, Mr Horus! It's annoying and a really easy thing to put into movies if you don't care about explaining something about the plot. Also, the deeper issues and meanings of the movie are muddled in the movie's drive and its script. The actors still did their best. They seemed to believe in the project and were certain that what they were doing would be something special. So I can't say anything negative about them. <br /> <br /> The story and the film are far from original. It rip-offs from many classic and semi-classic, most modern, science-fiction films. It might also be the reason why the film made a very unnecessary impression on me. <br /> <br /> A failed and uninteresting movie experiment. <br /> <br /> 3/10
