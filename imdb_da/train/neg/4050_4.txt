It is quite an obsolete film aimed at highlighting youth's longing for freedom in some dehumanizing British school. Oh yes it is like in the army you learn to obey and do what you are asked for. Yes the young dream of something else, but it breaks their dreams and sweeps away their optimism on the threshold of life. Great. It is basically how you can summarize the pleasant intentions of If ... Nice intentions that raise no cinematic challenges: the result is a declamatory film. Can you see how boring I mean? At least this oldie helped Kubrick with McDowell in a Clockwork Orange, a movie with a truly powerful social satire and no self-sacrificing sentimentalism.
