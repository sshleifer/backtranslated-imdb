From the beginning to the end, this is the most emotionally overshadowed movie about nothing I've ever seen. The characterizations and interactions between the title character and Marthe Kuler's character are pure torture. The racetrack as a metaphor gimmick is so overplayed that it borders on the cliche, but director Pollack treats each hairpin as if it were something very important. <br /> <br /> Perhaps there is something worthwhile for an MSFT3000 replay of some of the scenes, such as Pacino coming into contact with his inner female, for good value. But even such unintentional humor is hard to find in this total turkey.
