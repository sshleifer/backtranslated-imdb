It's quite literally the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. It may be the worst movie possible. Some movies are so bad they are good; This film is so bad that it passes comfortable camp and becomes simply invisible. It is anti-enantiodromia. We bought it with the intention of heckle, and my whole family gathered for a fun night with wise remarks; Instead, we sat in anesthetic silence, sorry poor Peter Sellers. <br /> <br /> This is worse than the animated Lord of the Rings. It's worse than the Matrix successors. It's worse than Krull. It's worse than any Batman movie. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances let this movie approach within 10 meters of your television.
