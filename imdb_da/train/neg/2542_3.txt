... not all Disney movies are garbage. At least I saw "Legend of Boggy Creek" first and absolutely loved the movie. When I heard it had 2 successors, I was ecstatic. I finally found a copy of this and saw it one night. I can't see how they can make a G-rated sequel to a horror movie. The original is a movie / documentary about Fauke Monster, and can scare anyone. "Return" is for children and should not be seen by anyone. I can't remember the plot too well as it has been some time since I saw it and I don't want to see it again, but ... It's about those hunters coming to town and they are looking to kill Bigfoot. Three little kids sneak out of the house to stop them. A great monsoon comes through. The hunters are wounded, saved by the children. Then they all hide in a boat with a big piece of tarp on the top and try to wait for the storm. Then suddenly Bigfoot comes and does something really sick. I won't ruin the end for any of yas, but it's not scary. Well....
