I saw it last week after getting the DVD cheap. I had wanted to see it for years, to find plot sketch very exciting. So my disappointment was great, to say the least. I thought the main actor was very flat. This kind of part required a performance like Johny Depps in The Ninth Gate (which is almost a complete rip-off), but I think TV budgets do not always extend to this kind of play. <br /> <br /> I also thought the direction was confused and boring and only serves to remind me that Carpenter has not made a decent movie since in the mouth of madness. As for history - I was also disappointed there too! There was no way to meet my expectations, but I thought the payout and the explanation were poor and how he finally got the film's anti-climactic to say the least. <br /> <br /> This was written by one of the major contributors to the AICN and you can tell he loves his cinema, but I would have liked a better result from such a good initial premise. I took the DVD back to the store the same day!
