I'm not sure what. I just couldn't laugh at it. I had an open mind. I didn't want to be a tight @ ss about it. But I just couldn't laugh seriously at this movie. It just wasn't fun for me. Some parts seemed to be like Ben Stiller and Jack Black were trying too hard. Just because you put two very funny men together does not mean that this is going to be an excellent comedy. Some movies just can't be made. This is one of them. Because it makes many old jokes and the play was just stupid. I know I know it's a comedy. Kind of at least. But I was just not impressed. I'm sorry, but I can't give it anything lower than a two. And that's all I give. <br /> <br /> 2/10
