This movie was a waste of time, even rented on DVD. If super-fast camera images are faster than this, we might as well pay 20 bucks to get into the laundry room, get popcorn and see the dryers. Jet Li is so much better than this. One can only hope that he will not make offers anytime soon to make another clich√© movie like The One. <br /> <br /> If there is a movie you should avoid, this is "The One".
