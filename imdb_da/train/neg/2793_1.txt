This goes a long way up to my top list of worst movies I've seen so far at Starz on Demand. They seem to get everyone just for the DVD crap party they can find and put it on here. Why? Who knows! Apparently anyone with a digital camera and a great budget can come up with a horror movie and have it put on TV. To be honest, it looked so awful from the moment I saw the trailer - but I gave it a real chance. I always try to have an open mind about low budget film. Some of the best movies I've ever seen were movies that worked around their low budget or in other cases only required the low budget to be good. <br /> <br /> This is not one of those movies. <Br /> <br /> You know the plot now, I'm sure if you read this. Either you have heard about it at Starz on Demand or for what reason you ended up on this page out of boredom. It's about a pathetic and whiny girl, we get to know in all 3 minutes in an incredibly bad "heavy metal" music video. Anyone who puts it together must have thought it was really interesting, but it really doesn't. In any case, she kills herself. Then she possesses someone. Then some killings start. It's really unmemorable and as totally average and boring as possible. When the first shot hits her apartment, it sounds quite serious as a piece of popcorn popping. Was it the best sound effect they could bring? I could find a better sound effect using free (without copyright) on the internet ... right. now. <br /> <br /> Don't let the other reviews claim this is a 10-star movie fool you. They are, of course, either distributors of the movie or maybe even the director is trying to ask you to believe that this piece of junk is worth buying. <br /> <br /> Laughable.
