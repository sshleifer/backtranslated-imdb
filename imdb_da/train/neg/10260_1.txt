This movie was horrible! I rented it without knowing what to expect. I saw the first 5 minutes and the movie and knew it was a bomb. The action was poor and there was no plot. The monster is sooooo false. It laughs and its mouth does not move. Also why would they have a doctor playing a xylophone to kill the monster. Just bad, don't even waste your time. (1 in 10)
