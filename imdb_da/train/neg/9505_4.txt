I don't want to criticize the movie. There is not much to talk about. It has good expensive actions scenes which were probably pretty amazing at the time. Clyde Beatty is not exactly a matinee idol. He is a little small and not very nice. But it's okay. He is the man in the lion cage. We know that when he can't take the time off his lions to tend to his girlfriend, he'll end up on an island with her and save the day. Someone said earlier that it is a history lesson. The scenes in the circus are on another day, especially the children hanging around. I didn't realize that even in the thirties, they sailed on three masted schooners. It looked like something out of 1860. I suppose that is the stock footage they had. No wonder the case was destroyed. They always talk about fixing her. There is even a dirigible. It tells us a bit about male female relationships at that time, a kind of giggly silliness. But if you don't take it too seriously, you can have fun watching it.
