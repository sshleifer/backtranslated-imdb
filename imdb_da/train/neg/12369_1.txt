There will be a time when kids will grow up without ever seeing the only Bugs Bunny kiss (technically) another man on their lips. There will be a time when it will not be the Duck or the Rabbit season. There will be a time when the tazman devil will be baptized politically wrong. <br /> <br /> But then helping me is not that time. No one really wants an 'EXTREME' version of our beloved Loony characters. Whoever is in marketing that comes up with "Corn Nuts: Corn gone wrong" and "Extreme Doritos" and obviously this partying turd should know that just because they have a degree in business or advertising or what does not mean that they know jacks about kids. I think they make an accident for children, depriving them of one of the biggest and most iconic shows at all times. This show is hampering me, and it is not just the dated work of art or terrible dialogue. They abuse good voice talent, like Phil Lamarr, Michael Clarke Duncan, Candi Milo, and so many others. It lacks style, humor, character development and most importantly, the heart. <br /> <br /> The show as it is repackaged (Slam Tasmanian, Rev Runner, Ace Bunny) is just a shadow of the former, timeless and beautiful self.
