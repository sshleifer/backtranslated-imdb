WARNING! This review will reveal the end of the movie, "Scoop." If you do not want to know how the movie ends, do not read this review! <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is so bad you think "Annie Hall" was a fluke. <br /> <br /> It'll be a star because you'll see Hugh Jackman's bare breast. That's the only thing "Scoop" has on its way to. <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's misogyny and his fixation on women who are young enough at this time to be his grandson have confused the ability to make films he may have had at any time. The plot seems promising: a ghost, Ian McShane, heads a fluffy headed student, Scarlett Johansson, to investigate whether an English gentleman, Hugh Jackman, is the infamous Tarot Card Killer of prostitutes. A magician, Woody Allen, helps the girl. <br /> <br /> But promising plot lacks the movie's full charm, humor or atmosphere. It is an incredibly guided, amateurish action for someone who has made yet another movie, never against dozens. Perhaps Allen has had a stroke that has gone unreported in the press. Much is made of that, unlike in his previous movie, Woody Allen, now a septuagenarian, has finally allowed a younger male lead to get the girl. <br /> <br /> Not so. In fact, the plot is constructed in such a way that the girl does not get any. <br /> <br /> There is an early stage where Johansson, without reason for the film, allows himself to be drunk and seduced by a strong, older director. "Seduced" is a euphemism for what happens. It's a "slam, bam, I have to go" kind of moment. It has no relation to the plot at all, and it trillions Johansson in the viewer's eye. Why did Allen add the unnecessary scene to the movie? Because it shows a strong instructor - like Allen - having sex with the woman leader. Allen gets his cake and eats it too. <br /> <br /> Johansson is not yet an actress. She doesn't know how to control the screen except by wearing a tight, low cut top. She mimics Allen in a couple of scenes, and it just looks weird and boring. It does not help her character to be written as a doll that cannot function without a ghost or an older and less than awe-inspiring magician, and tells her what to do with each turn. She is about half the Jackman's age and she comes across as a very vapid screen presence in their scenes together. <br /> <br /> Target members who aren't obsessed with breasts deserve better in their heroines, and Jackman deserves better too - a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and agencies and an actress who can convey these qualities. <br /> Hugh Jackman is also cheated by the script. Allen can't seem to assert that Jackman is so astoundingly beautiful and young, and then he gives Jackman nothing to say or do. As Johansson he is only used for his good looks. It's a shame because he, like Jackman, has appeared in a number of productions, from "Oklahoma" to "X Men", he can act. <br /> <br /> Here's the great plot twist - Jackman, suave, charming English gentleman, really is a killer. So even though the film says it's about letting someone else than Allen get the girl, she doesn't get any. Jackman, the man she's loved, is a man who murdered a prostitute. Nice, Woody. Nice way to punish your heroine for being outside of you. <br /> <br /> In a passive aggressive strike, Allen deprives her heroine of his own presence and kills his character, the magician, and leaves Scarlett Johansson all alone at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> A final note: At my screening, no single audience laughed at any point during the movie. Always a bad sign when a movie is announced as a comedy.
