Guy Ritchie's noble effort has been knocked down, beaten, raped, kicked, shot, broken, spat on, stopped, sodomized, and abused, and left to the death of Madonna's terrible achievements. Her plays were much reminiscent of a candidate from the Al Gore School of Dramatics and Public Speaking. Guy Ritchie made a somewhat noble attempt to restore this, and if you exclude all the scenes his wife was in, at best, it is a fair movie. I think the best act ever had to be Guy comforting his wife that her performance was good enough not to resume. If you have the opportunity to look swept away or cut your toenails for 89 minutes ... go to the extended pedicure.
