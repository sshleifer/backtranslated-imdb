Basically, this is a pale shadow of High Fidelity, which was a witty and wonderfully acted movie with several truly winning character trips. Looking at the detectives has none of it. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite for a video store that swept off the feet of a quirky mystery woman is a good one, but is never fully or adequately explored thanks to a very weak script and miscasting of the leaders, not to mention the lack in some real visual storytelling style. I think this movie is centered around MOVIES, but is even incredibly indistinct! It's a big shortage right there. <br /> <br /> But the biggest problem is that we just don't care about the main characters, because the script and the actors (Murphy and Liu) don't make them true or sympathetic in any real way. So the movie just becomes a series of episodes involving two people who think, yes, not so terribly interesting. Oh yes, another thing: For a romantic comedy? It is not fun. And the romance is not terribly romantic either. <br /> <br /> Avoid it. Even in its 90-minute minute running time, it's just not worth sitting through ...
