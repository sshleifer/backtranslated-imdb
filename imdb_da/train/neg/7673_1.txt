I don't know where to start. Tara Reid must be stopped before she is put into another movie. Stephen Dorff looks like he got his character's motivation from Val Kilmer in "Top Gun". Slater sleepers through this drunk. The direction, editing, sound (do we really need a heavy metal video in the midst of a war force?), Costumes (bulletproof vests with muscles on them), and hi, there is also no visible plot. It amazes me that no one attached to the project stopped and said, "Hey guys, that's just nothing, let's start again." Hopefully, Slater's career can come from this disaster. <br /> <br /> Hands down the worst movie I've ever seen.
