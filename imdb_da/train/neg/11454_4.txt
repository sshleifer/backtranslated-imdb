So I had low expectations for this movie at first, but failed to meet them. While there were some fun parts, even one or two laughing loudly, this movie fell horribly of what I would call good. The funniest jokes were unexpected and over very fast and left us to sit there, "WTF just happened?" In addition, there were a few jokes that just dragged on and over and over. the part where he falls down the mountain made me yawn. Also, editing was really lacking. There were some bad stage transitions, but it seems to be the style today. It made me laugh, but I didn't want to see it again, and I'm very happy that I was waiting to rent. Give it a try, you like it, but don't think you are in any harmony with the 40-year-old virgin or Superbad.
