I got this movie from a private collector and was very curious about it. It had a 7.8 in IMDb (only 9 votes) and some external comments were pleasant. But I have to say that it is a very common and uninteresting giallo. Yes, great filmography, the film is well directed, but it never found me. It starts well, but even if it doesn't get bored at all, the story is so common and the things that are so normal that I didn't like it very much. <br /> <br /> You can make a few laughs. And you can see some small breasts. But if you like the kind of giallocks I like (bizarre, surreal, nonsense, gory, atmospheric, brutal murders ...) you won't appreciate much this movie. I give it a 4 for the good guidance and editing, and the last phrases that make the movie entertaining. But it could be much better.
