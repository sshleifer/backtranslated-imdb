This movie is a total waste of time, the plot is terrible, the dialogue is horrible. The action is ok, but the actors have absolutely no plot or script to work with. The photography and some of the special effects are also ok, but again there is nothing interesting in this movie to watch. There is no logical advance to history, history is completely nonsense. It's not even scary. For a movie to be scary, there must be at least a small element of credibility. This movie has no credibility at all. <br /> <br /> There are only three characters in the movie. Each character is low and has no personality. <br /> <br /> Most of the special effects and make-up work are both poorly done or very mediocre. <br /> <br /> I hope you read this and don't waste time on this movie unless you are curious to watch a horrible movie.
