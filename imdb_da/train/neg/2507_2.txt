This is not a good movie. It's uneven, all the play is bad, and has a lame story you've seen a thousand times much better else where. Not to mention you can see all plot points coming from a mile away. Worst of all, no one bothered to tell Lonette Mckee she can't sing. But who cares, she is so nice to look good. But I go down, not something new here. Bottom line, hot girl group being exploited, some being hooked on drugs, someone being hooked on a guy, some getting fucked out, and then the horrible things happening. Surprise, surprise. Welcome to the music industry. I can't believe so many people out there, think it's a good movie. So many of you seem to need a sliding scale when it comes to classifying black films. I don't play it! If you want to support these movies by watching them - amazing! If you enjoyed it - super! To each their own. But don't try to tell me it was good. Pleeeease! I wish colored people would not fawn over these kinds of movies just because they have black actors. Want to see a good African American movie? See Love Jones. Ray. Or the color Purple. It would be good movies no matter what the actors' color has. Why? Because they told convincing stories with great plays, it made you feel somewhat long after you left the theater. Just because it's our experience, it doesn't automatically make a good movie. It's only good - when it's good. Period.
