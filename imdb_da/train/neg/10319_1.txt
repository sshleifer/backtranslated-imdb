Unlike many, I do not find the premise or theme of this show at least offensive. Its execution, however, is another matter entirely. Like so many B-minus movies, all the decent gags seem to have been spliced ​​into trailers. For most of the 22-or-so-minutes we are in decreasing expectation any kind of real humor. Or at least something to keep one from fidgeting with the remote control or counting carpet fibers. With a few exceptions, the play is terrible; The comic overcoming and gesturing of some cast members may be suitable for a sennat infomercial, but not a primetime sitcom (even a Canadian). Regardless of the rather original cultural angle, I can't help but believe it is essentially a misfired shot of CBC to replicate the success of Corner Gas. Unfortunately, they got the tone - and the script - completely wrong for the priests. The final insult is that they apparently can't even afford to get the location work done in an actual little town (Why are they so hard to find in Saskatchewan?) Did they think the audience would be fooled by the downtown Regina exteriors? As a proud Canadian, I hope this thing will soon go away and that the rest of the world, founded by CBC publishers, will soon forget this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom.
