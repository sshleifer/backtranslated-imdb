The cars in this movie are awesome. The action in this movie is horrible. The grounds and driving scenes do not make much sense and are just as bad. If you are really bothered by movies where someone changes and suddenly goes ridiculously faster, save yourself the hassle and money. Good movie for racing fans? Now there's a part where they make the mistake of referring to a NASCAR driver as a rally car driver. If you can't tell the difference, see what you want a blast. It really comes down to this, there are really really good cars in this movie, they are badly run and are totally unrealistic. The action is horrible, mainly because of the extremely bad plot. If you want to see hot girls, turn on mtv or vh1 instead. I am disappointed that such cozy cars would be represented in such a bad movie. If the class of cars were to match the movie, they would have to run with rusty bikes.
