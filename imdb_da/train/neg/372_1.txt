I watched this movie once a long time ago and I have no desire to see it again. <br /> <br /> This movie is about Preston Waters, a creepy preteen who always seems to be overlooked by his family and who always seems short on cash. All this changes when a bank robber runs over Preston's bike and sends him an empty check as compensation. Preston uses the check to withdraw $ 1 million from the bank (ironically, the money belongs to the bank robber who gave him the check). Preston then buys a mansion and says he works as an assistant to a mysterious and wealthy baker named Mr. Macintosh (named after its computer). Then he just loves the money. <br /> <br /> It sounds like a good idea on paper. But on the screen, it's one of the empty movies I've ever seen. First, it's too incredible. I know some parts of the movie should be incredible, but I draw the line on a twelve year old boy who goes out with a thirty year old woman and becomes responsible for an imaginary person's small fortune. Also this was a low movie with weak plays, a predictable plot line and characters that are less than memorable. The signs were either cheesy, over the top, annoying or underdeveloped. But "Juice" was a fun character. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good movie to watch with your family, skip this one.
