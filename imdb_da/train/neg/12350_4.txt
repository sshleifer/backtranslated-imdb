Hmmm ... where to start? How is a serious actress like Demi Moore involved in such rubbish? "First blood" can be judged as the bull *** t, but this type of nonsense is just Rambo with breasts, point. Of course, if you are interested in crapstory (Demi Moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of NAVY Seals), this is the most stupid clich√© I can think of, you will say "GI Jane" is a great movie. Just the performance of Viggo Mortensen made this movie bearable, but hell, I can't think of Demi Moore as Rambo (especially not in the last, useless, 30 minutes). Ridley Scott doesn't deserve the credits to make this movie one that comes up with equal rights women, it's just brainless propaganda for the US Army and to make it more attractive, they fell Moore into it. Horrible movie.
