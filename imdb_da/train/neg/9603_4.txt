"A young woman suffering from the madness that she is a werewolf based on a family explanation of an ancestor accused of and killed for allegedly being one. Because of her previous treatment of men, she raises the country seductively and kills the men she encounters When she falls in love with a friendly man, she seems to be taking a trip for the better when she is raped and her lover is killed by a band of thugs. Return to his violent ways and seek revenge on the carpets, "according to the DVD sleeve synopsis. Rino Di Silvestro's "La lupa mannara" begins with full frontal, writhing, moaning dance by the shiny blonde Annik Borel, who (like Daniella Neseri) mistakenly believes she is a werewolf. The hottest part is when the camera catches the background fire between the legs. The "flashback" opening revealing her hairy ancestor was (probably) a lycanthropic creature. Unfortunately, Mrs Borel is not a werewolf; she is only a very strong lunatic. As a movie, "Werewolf Woman" would have been better if Borel's character was really a female werewolf; With her sexual victim is a great characterization. But as far as the 1970s, skin and blood flicks are going, it's hard to beat. Bouncy Borel is either naked or sexy dressed throughout the film, which contains a lot of free doings. Dazzling Dagmar Lassander (like Elena) and hunky Howard Ross (like Luca) are good supporting players.
