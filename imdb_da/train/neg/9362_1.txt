The ground sounded like it had a promise. To be honest I didn't look at the whole movie. After approx. An hour in the movie I had to make a decision. Is this movie worth seeing until it concludes? The answer was clearly no! It was not the fact that the human body could not receive a transplant from another species without rejecting it. Nor was the premise that he was hunted by secret government authorities for a human / wolf transplant. It was because the film was badly written, plays lacked emotion, and I did not understand the many dream sequences with wolves and buffaloes. When he drove to the zoo with a dog pack and left them at the front of the zoo gate, "If you can't run with the big dogs, don't leave the porch" kept running through my bored mind. Save yourself time and skip this movie. I can guarantee if you dare to see what you want to sit there, and I wonder why you are wasting money, time, energy and effort to make this offensive indignation into American cinema.
