This movie comes straight out of the dark dungeon of Full Moon Entertainment. This production company gained fame and happiness in the first half of the 90s by producing terribly bad and cheesy horror movies. The most famous disasters in their old age are "Subspecies", "Seedpeople" and "Trancers". None of these are recommended, and neither is Dr. Mordrid. Hyperactive director Charles Band came to the right company for his film. Doctor Mordrid is incredibly stupid and cheesy and almost completely humorous. I only saw it because it originates Jeffrey Combs. I learned that if you are a fan of him, it may have several disadvantages. For every good movie it seems that he has made 5 subordinates. Yet the story of the battle is between two old wizards. A good one here since 150 years to protect humans (Jeffrey as Dr.Mordrid) and an evil called Kabal. He will destroy any kind of human life for some reason I have already forgotten. Combs receives his instructions from the mentor. The "guy" only consists of a few eyes in the room. Very very cheesy, it is! Occasionally, a dazzling flash of light appears on the screen, but it's about the only kind of special effects this movie has. It's all just a piece of whining and nagging, and when the two wizards finally face each other, it's over before you know it ... I would have expected the evil wizard to be at least struggling a little back, but no, no. ... In some scenes you can really discover some originality and creativity (such as Jeffre's lecture on the moon's influence on criminals), and if you are really aware, you can even find some very small but cozy aspects (like the raven called Edgar Allen), but in general it's a terrible waste of time and energy. I'm a big fan of Jeffrey, and maybe he's a superhero in my eyes ... but he probably doesn't need a stupid maillot for it.
