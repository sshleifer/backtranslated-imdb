When many say it's the "worst movie I've ever seen", they tend to say it about almost any movie they didn't like. But of the nearly 700 movies I can remember ever seeing that this is one of two that I walked away from feeling personally offended and angry. This is my first movie review, by the way, and I signed up with IMDb just to rave on the movie's badness. I went to see it when it was in the theaters (I and my two friends were 3 out of 5 people there) and after 15 years I can't remember very much detail, but my attitude of leaving the theater is still crystal clear. <br /> <br /> --- Spoiler alarm --- <br /> <br /> Oh my, where to start. Fat loser left on the altar, go skiing weekend, meet blonde bombshell who is interested in him, take him home to meet the family, they are all cannibals and he is the main course, pathetic attempt at a dramatic escape, kicking all their butts and run off with the brother's boyfriend, they live happily ever after. Puke. First, the gags are so bad that it took me a while to understand that they were trying to find and that this was a KOMEDI. The special effects of how few are, look like they were done 15 years earlier. The big dramatic ending was so hokey and badly acted that it was almost unbearable to see (he knocks out the entire cannibal family with rakes lying in the lawn that stands up for Tom and Jerry style when they step on them). I am sure there is a lot, much more, but I do not intend to see it again for a refreshment.
