This movie was largely a waste of an hour and a half. I like the cheap horror monster type movies, but this movie was a disappointment. The biggest mistake is the lack of explaining the beings. When they got into the house and found the man he could lease, he explained them. He says nothing about them other than that they killed his parents, and unless I missed something, they did not say how he managed to escape either ... not to mention that it does not give any clue or reason why Kun Survivors remain and live essentially creatures after their own near death experience. It had turned out that she would have had the opportunity to leave after the "cross incident".
