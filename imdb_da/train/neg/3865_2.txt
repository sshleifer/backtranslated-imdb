This is so incredibly bad. Bad actors. You can tell that they are trying very hard to polish a turd, but we all know you can't. The scripture is so obvious and easy, it is sad to see them try to sell it. Humor and pacing are such labor, it's hard to believe in any of these good actors who are signed on to this. <br /> <br /> Having said that, it's so awful that we have a hard time looking away from the screen. We just need to know where this train wagon goes. But that's only because we caught it on television. If we had actually paid for this, we would be disgusted. <br /> <br /> So it will be 2 stars to be at least entertaining / fascinating bad. And the random music (unlike the trying-for-hard indie soundtrack) is ridiculously reminiscent of an episode of Scooby-Doo ... but not so good.
