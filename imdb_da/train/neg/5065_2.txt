This movie is simply bad. Weak history, weak control and below average. What really annoyed me was the blatant advertising - all the time - for a well-known internet provider. It is obvious some scenes are written to do just that advertising. This movie is a blow to the face of anyone who paid money for this. <br /> <br /> Don't look here, it's not worth your time.
