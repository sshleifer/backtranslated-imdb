I never panned a movie online, but I felt moved to do it after seeing this. You do not discover anyone's funeral and say to those deprived: "My family members died, so why should I worry about yours?" <br /> <br /> Minus the propaganda, which was a little if anything that could be called "art". As a daughter of deaf parents, I was particularly annoyed by the use of deafness as a gimmick. Any deaf person who feels a vibration of this monster would probably have investigated, not ignored it. The word "chutzpah" comes to mind. As a writer there are few issues I would stay away from: the Holocaust is one; This is another. I wish these filmmakers had not been so arrogant (and inappropriate).
