This clunker of a movie sets a new standard for poor filmmaking. Jared Rushton provides an appropriate performance of a very poorly-crafted character in a bad movie, creating a net effect of a very bad movie. The film's main feature is how a boy's temporary outing in the Canadian desert after surviving a plane crash console allows the disgruntled youth to handle his anxiety about discovering his mother's disproportionate affair. Unfortunately, it turns into a bizarre collage of random "survival events" (including two especially hokey scenes involving fighting a bear) and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid is not just sitting in a tray of something place on the pot that dreams this whole movie (and what a nightmare it is!). In addition, despite some reviewers' greetings of the film's family's view, several scenes that are not suitable for very young children or family viewing, including a graphic scene of the dead pilot underwater with one of his eyes apparently exploded. <Br /> All in all, a horrible movie that no one should be exposed to, much less innocent children.
