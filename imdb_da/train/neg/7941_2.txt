When the 2000s came to an end, King Kong's adopted daughter advanced and made a tearful announcement that her show was coming to an end. <br /> <br /> As Miss Winfrey struck, I laughed and screamed like a wild Indian from the old west. <br /> <br /> So what is Oprah doing? She takes famous people and puts them on her show. what kind of famous people? people who have suffered (like she, except these people have lost more than their virginity), they have slightly melted faces (true story), missing limbs (true story, see end of play) and abuse of power (too many to count ). And somehow they come to the show and tell their story as if we haven't heard it before tons and tons of times (Bethany Hamilton, I've heard your story of losing an arm to a shark since day one that was October 31st, 2003. Don't tell me you have no hard feelings.) But the biggest thing likely on Oprah was Michael Jackson's interview in 1993, after being accused of being a grandmother. Unfortunately, Mr. Jackson since gone away. but that a particular show told about Michael's personal life, something not many people knew about at the time. <br /> <br /> Oprah's real influence comes from middle-aged women and football mothers. They seem to believe she is sometimes like a personal Jesus. But all I see in Oprah is a great ghetto lady who made it big and she just shows out how rich she is. <br /> <br /> I'm glad she shows up soon. We need better TV shows.
