I'm rarely moved to make these kinds of comments, but after sitting through most of the rankin's horrible movies, I feel like I've really earned the right to say what I feel about it! In fact, I couldn't do it right at the end, and became one of half a dozen or more walk outs (about 1/3 of the audience) after the ragged plot, unhappy dialogue and abusive characterization were just too much to bear. This movie is all and no art. all style and no fabric. it is balanced by horrible acting, a real scary script, indifferent film and student production values. How it was funded, started and finished is a mystery to me. I bet you a million quid it never goes on general release. the right critics would tear it apart. a really bad movie. shockingly bad. a really really really bad bet and it is without mentioning the free newborn-kitten-getting-fallen-in-a-frozen-fryer moment. completely meaningless, full lightweight, poorly composed; This movie is a horrible embarrassment for UK cinema.
