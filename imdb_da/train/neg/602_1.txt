Yet another example of the complete waste of British lottery money. Just how commercially this film appeared. The film council, which financed this miserable waste, had to be stranded at one of London's underground stations, to allow this clich√©d, stupid attempt to commit movies, a half-mutant thing consisting of all the horror films the director has seen and felt fit imitating, especially Deathline. Among its many sins, it is quite obvious failure to make the protagonist extremely sympathetic until the last moment. It's a little too late then! Surely all the development leaders in the UK Film Council could have noticed this on the script stage. Add to this scary play and the ridiculous look of the creature, and you get a good example of how not to scare.
