This "movie" is trying to follow the genre with low-budget, handheld camera flicks that have proven to be very effective and successful. <br /> <br /> This one fails and WHERE. /> It's amazing how many so-called "prizes" this piece of garbage has got plastered on the cover ..... it makes you doubt what those critics were on when they actually presented this ... <br / > <br /> Words fail to describe how horrible this movie is. Seriously, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> I saw it in 20 minutes flat, on almost continuous rewind. From garbage lighting to terrible steering, grainy visuals to silent sound and of course not forgetting the ABYSMAL, it was a completely and completely pathetic piece of so-called film making. It seriously has no redeeming qualities - at all. Save your money and see a decent low budget horror flick that's plenty out there - Dead End, The Blair Witch, REC, just to name a few. <br /> <br /> AVOID this rubbish at all costs. Don't waste your money or time on this piece of garbage that pretends to be a real movie. Watch all the other comments! You've been warned!
