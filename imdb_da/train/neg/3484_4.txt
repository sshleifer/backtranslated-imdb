I remember when this was in the theaters, the reviews said it was terrible. Well, I didn't think it was that bad. It was fun and had a lot of heavy humor in relation to families during the holidays. <br /> <br /> Ben Affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for Christmas to please his girlfriend. He goes to visit the house, he grew up and made an appointment to rent the family there for Christmas. I really liked the law scene where they signed a contract. It was fun. <br /> <br /> Then he makes stupid requests from the family and even writes writings that they can read. Of course, the family has a warm daughter for the interest of love. And he learns that the holidays are not that bad. The whole doo-dah act was also fun, especially as they replaced the first with a black guy, and the boyfriend's parents did not say anything about it. And those parts where doo-dah hits his "supposed daughter." FINALLY VERDICT: I thought it was worth checking out if you catch it on cable.
