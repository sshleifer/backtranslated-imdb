This is one of the worst movies I've seen for a long time. Not only the story, but the play is shockingly bad. The dialogue sounds like a person reading the news. <br /> <br /> This is classified as comedy / drama / romance, it's not of the stuff! It's a little action, that's it. There is really no comedy and drama at all. <br /> <br /> If you went to the cinema to see this, I feel sorry for it. I would not recommend it at all. Almost everything else you choose to look at is getting better. This is basically an action / crime film. The action scenes sucked, and the crime story part of it was very predictable. <br /> <br /> If you're not really interested in a good story or good acting. And you just want to look at a 'foreign' movie for the appeal of being foreign. So it may be for you.
