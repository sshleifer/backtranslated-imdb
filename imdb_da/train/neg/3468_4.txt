A student filmmaker listens to a B-class actress (a delectably diva-ish MOLLY RINGWALD!) To complete the horror movie that her mother (a terribly boring Kylie Minogue!) Attempted to make 12 years ago. It's a curious plot choice to say the least, as any Aussie horror fan knows that the genre is unfortunately missing in women directors. The movie has a curse on it, because Molly had to kill some psychic killers on the original set. But she's back because she needs the exposure. Unfortunately, the curse is still there and people are starting to die on "sets". Cut is an Aussie attempt on the modern "slasher", but unfortunately it doesn't add anything new or exciting to the table. In fact, it rages half of Wes Craven's 90s filmography. Lots of movie-world name-drop a la "Scream" (apart from it's Aussie name-dropping - Jane Campion ... see how this is not so funny) and lots of "is this really or is this a movie" a la "new nightmare." The editing is bad, the music is annoying, the effects are ridiculous, almost everything is bad about this. Fortunately, the movie can have a sense of humor: At one point, a well-dressed girl in the movie staff tells the owner of the house that they are filming: "Don't worry, we treat your house as if it were our own," which he responds to. , "it doesn't matter to me, you look like you're living in a dump!" Ha! And Molly's ridiculous one-liners were enough not to regret renting this one. "Do you have cookie in here?" (as she runs in the film professor's car) and "Does anyone know where to buy tofu?" (the first thing she mumbles on the set) and "Where the hell is my agent?" (Wait, that's what I was thinking of her.)
