This movie was horrible. The script is completely unrealistic, but it is written to take place in reality. The editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in the film school. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone who: A) knows any details about the police world or hidden operations. B) Know any details about film making or appreciation. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie on average or below average, I think it would be fun if I were stupid. If you have to watch this movie fully, I highly recommend some kind of inebriation <br /> <br /> It's a total waste of the small production value it has.
