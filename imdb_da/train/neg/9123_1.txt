I don't have much to say about this movie. It could have been a wonderful tour-de-force for Peter Sellers, but it is one of the most tragic misfires in film history. That it was Sellers' final movie makes it all the more painful. The horrible manuscript, direction, and shocking wood performances are all terrible together to make this one of the most uneven horrible movies ever made. <Br /> <br /> I want so much that I could even find a snicker or a chuckle buried somewhere in this pile of creepy blubber, but it's a lifeless, humorous disaster. The truth hurts. <br /> <br /> Peter, why couldn't you be stopped by being there?
