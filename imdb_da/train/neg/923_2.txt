For some reason, various young couples who walk through the Italian Alps attended to see who can first reach their campsite name. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) enters a cave, finds a skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and becomes obsessed with the spirit of Tyranus when he puts a helmet on his body. He then uses the rest of the film around the forest and chases down his friends and chops off their limbs to add some pots to bring the undead "Demonicus" back to life. This release on digital full moon is stupid, meaningless, has horrible acting and sound, and the (Los) Angeles National Forest is a bad substitute for Italy. However, it is rather high on the unintentional laughter scale, thanks to the overwhelmed lead performance. Whether bug-eyed runs in cheap-looking armor that burns a sword or spitting neurotic Latin gibberish on demons and resurrection, Kenyon's ridiculous facial expressions and awkward line delivery are to be believed. Oh, at least he is not boring like most of the rest of the casting.
