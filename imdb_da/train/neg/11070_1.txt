This was a really bad movie. The character "Cole", which Michael Moriarty played, was the main reason why this flopped, the actor felt, that it was a vicious sad southern attraction that would make this character more evil, it did not. After approx. For 20 minutes I wanted a speech therapist to appear. This would have added some sincerity. 1) badly traded 2) unsympathetic characters - 3) razor thin plot line /> <br /> Yuck! <br /> <br />
