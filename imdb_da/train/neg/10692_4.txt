Poor Ingrid suffered and suffered as she went out to Italy, tired of Hollywood glamor treatment. First, it sounded on a volcanic island's plague in STROMBOLI, an artificial failure that would have killed his career with a less elastic actress. And now it is EUROPA 51, another boring exercise in soggy feeling. <br /> <br /> Also, the story does not matter much to Alexander KNOX in another thankless role as his long-suffering man trying to comfort her after the suicide death of their young son. At least this has a better production value and a more coherent script than STROMBOLI. <br /> <br /> Bergman is still attractive here, but is moving towards a more matronic look like a wealthy community woman. She is never able to cope with the sudden loss of her son, despite attempts by a friendly male friend. "Sometimes I think I'm going out of my heart," she tells her husband. A subordinate statement in a movie that is completely without humor or grace, but it gives us a sense of where the story goes. <br /> <br /> Soon, Bergman is motivated to help the poor in the post-war era in Rome, but being a social worker with poor children does not improve her emotional health, and from there, the plot takes a turn for the worse. <br /> <br /> The overall effect of the film is that it is not sufficiently interesting to be part of a project for a big star like Bergman. The movie loses the pace in the middle of history as Bergman is becoming more and more confused, and her husband suspects she is two timing him. The story goes downhill from there, after she nurses a street walker through her terminal illness. The final thread of the plot has her husband having to place her for observation in a mental asylum. <br /> <br /> Ingrid suffers nothing through it all (over-compensates for the loss of her son), but it's not for use. Not one of her best flicks, to put it mildly. <br /> <br /> Trivia note: If she wanted new realism with mental illness, she might have been better off accepting the lead in THE SNAKE PIT when offered to her by Director Anatole Litvak !! It would have done more for his career than EUROPE 51. <br /> <br /> Summary: Another gloomy indiscretion of Rossellini and Bergman.
