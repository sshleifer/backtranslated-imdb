Someone told me this was one of the best adult movies to date. I have since discredited everything I have told myself by this person after watching this movie. It's just awful. Without going into long descriptions of the different scenes, take my word to it, sex scenes are at best uninteresting. Jenna in normal street clothes at the beginning was the highlight of the movie (she looks good), but it is all the way down from there.
