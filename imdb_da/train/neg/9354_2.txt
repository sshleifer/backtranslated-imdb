There is an important aspect of movies that Jobson seems to have forgotten - it has the ability to tell a story by showing it to you. You don't have to tell the audience what to think because they'll see it. The action here is mixed with some of the most overwhelming stories triggered by the unsuspecting audience - the purple prose from the sensitive fifth earlier. And it should be unnecessary because they are a fine cast here and some beautifully composed and shot visuals. Maybe Jobbo found that the basic principle needed some support. And he may have been right, it lacks a basic credibility: The 70s Edinburgh was not exactly full of pretty nice girls with a penchant for Velvet Underground and a soft place for a passing sociopath. From the gorgeous and recent clothes that the character carries on the cod's intellectualism, which tries to connect it all together, it is far too confronted with my taste.
