Angels who got a little icky were banned from heaven and now live in a British forest where they seduce and chop up teens. Talk about high concept. On the small side, this little mother gives us Tom Savini, but since his acting is limited to two minutes of screen time, his five minute presence seems a little long. The angels run around the forest naked for the majority of the movie, but even though they may have an angel's body, their faces certainly look like Joan Rivers on a bad day. Mediocre actors and amateur gore effects do not help and night scenes fail to recall Paris Hilton's most famous movie. So bad that it's really bad.
