This movie is the second worst movie I've ever seen (the first being Ghost Rider). There is absolutely no plot, climax, conflict or other important details necessary to portray a story. This 'movie' is basically just another excuse for Toby Keith to show his male side and the 'hard guy he really is'. I completely wasted my time watching this movie. The best thing should be the final credits. If I were Ebert or Roper, I would have thrown off my thumb and threw them at the manufacturers. The one who, in their right mind, gave Toby Keith the chance to appear in a feature film, is, of course, the same mental level as him. Finally, don't waste your time watching this movie, it might be the only thing you regret.
