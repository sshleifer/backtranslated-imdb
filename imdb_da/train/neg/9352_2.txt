You can often tell that a movie did not appear as it should in the heavy use of a narrator. This movie contains this device all the way through. Richard Jobson not quite happy to write directly and even fund some of this film adds to his credits by reading excerpts from his own semiotobiographical writing, which, combined with some beautiful edits, is able to shine over what is a dull depressing story that he must fail for real art houses. Kevin McKidd puts a good performance. Everyone else is okay. Budget constraints meant that all scenes were shot in daylight, although most of course are meant to be at night, but if you know serious alcoholics, they operate mostly today, so it adds me a touch of realism. The funniest part of this movie is a waitress who doesn't live up to a single day in the 20 odd years running between her appearances - a more extreme version of the problem that McKidd has that goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes. Bless.
