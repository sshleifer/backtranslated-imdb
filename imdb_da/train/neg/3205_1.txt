I note from the remarks that most people discussing this movie base their comments on the MST3K aeration. It is fair enough (after all, how it has its widest exposure), but I have had the accident of seeing "Final Justice" in its original form, I just want to share a few thoughts and comments on the harmless version. <br /> <br /> First, it must be admitted that the original version is a little more coherent than the MST3K broadcast, primarily due to an exposure scene between Rossano Brazzi and Venantino Venantini (I could use the characters' names instead of the actors "but I just love to write the words" Venantino Venantini "and explain why Venantini's fleeting nature cannot just leave Malta immediately. (It's not a very CONVINCING plot point, but at least the filmmakers tried to cover it.) Whether this scene was cut just on time, or because it didn't provide much feed to riffs, I don't know. <br /> <br /> Another plot point is missing in the original: The treacherous treason of Venantino Venantini to Joe Don Baker, apparently unmotivated in the MST3K version, is explained by a previous, very unpleasant scene in which Venantini rapes her in the shower. While this gives her a motive to turn against him, the whole scenario is just really ... icky. (There is no other word for it.) <br /> <br /> Some of the MST-worthy moments (the eternally truncated shouts of "son of one--" and "deja vu" shot by the sheriff) were pure result of the edited-to-television print they worked with and were absent from the original movie. <br /> <br /> A scene I wanted had made it to the MST3K version: Before entering the line to ask some people, Joe Don asks the Maltese police forces accompanying him to stay outside because "They see it uniform, they don't want to cooperate." But Joe Don himself wears his ridiculous cowboy slash-sheriff outfit, complete with shiny badge! I can't imagine why they went on the great opportunity to make fun of him ... A final note about the original, unknown version of "Final Justice": Why, oh why did they feel the need to put Venantino Venantini's bare butt up on the screen?
