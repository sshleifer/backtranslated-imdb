Typical thriller has been done many times before. Single plot sketch; cop Liotta is obsessed with Russell's wife and he tries to bump well with Kurt so he can get her. This is not predictable, it does not even try to guess you, the plot is plotted and there is no thinking outside the box here. I suppose the only reason to see it is to see how it develops, but nothing is done initially or interesting. There is nothing to say about this movie, it is not very bad, but there are no good things either. Russell plays Russell and you know what you get when you watch him in a movie. Ditto Liotta. Stowe has an annoying Cher-esque voice. I read the plot overview and I could see the movie in my head, it was so obvious and basic. I saw it, and it rolled out in front of my eyes exactly as I had imagined. I didn't feel a sense of emotion all the way through. I have no feeling for this movie, it's like I never saw it myself. Given this, it's a pretty pointless movie isn't it? Yet I give it 3/10 for some reason.
