Eddie Murphy for Best Support Actor ??? What an insult to Alan Arkin and Djimon Hounsou. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx (who can act) goes through this movie as a zombie. <br /> <br /> Beyonce ??? It acted ??? <br /> <br /> This movie pales in comparison to CHICAGO or almost any other recent musical. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't for Jennifer Hudson's great song and performance, I'd have given this a zero. <br /> <br /> No, I never saw the stage game, so I'm not making the typical Broadway vs. Hollywood rap.
