It was not what I wanted to see. I bought this on DVD and under the film I found myself annoyed and turned off the movie for a moment. Here's what I didn't like: <br /> <br /> 1 They shoot at the danger <br /> <br /> 2 The tribes were really annoying 3 dinosaurs (mostly) looked to fake <br /> <br /> 4 The poor scientist was very annoying <br /> <br /> 5 The picture quality of the DVD was really bad <br /> <br /> What I wanted: <br /> <br /> 1 The music from Jerry Goldsmith. This music is really good. I have the bootleg soundtrack from this movie. Unfortunately, the sound quality is not good, but it is okay for its time. <br /> <br /> 2 The first time we see the dinosaurs they inspire some kind of awe. 3 Baby is kinda cute when in the water and plays <br /> <br /> 4 The fun scene with the tent. <br /> <br /> 5 The kids who see this movie would hopefully learn that evil always loses.
