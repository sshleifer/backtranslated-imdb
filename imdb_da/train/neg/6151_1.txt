... and by no means * as pure, logical and understandable as in the picture in the pathetic sum of tired Hollywood clichés. I am 27, and I have spent 16 years of my life fighting through erroneous phobia and paranoid hallucinations. Like the protagonist of the movie, I was successful primarily because of logic: for I thought over and over to keep deception away from reality and to know what was really going on and what was not. In the end, I was really successful because of medication, by the way, but I certainly avoided madness because I knew before I took medication the difference between what was genuine and what was not. <br /> <br /> So, I have the right to tell you that this movie is a total scam. Not only does it cheat with the protagonist's story (which was not faithful to his wife who was bisexual - something really important here), but for the most part it shows a comforting, tame view of schizophrenia - which is completely missing the point. <br /> <br /> Schizophrenia is a thought structure, not a disease. A schizophrenic * is not * a "normal man with a disease". It is a person who occasionally sees and feels different from most people: things like time, space and people's personalities are not solid things. He feels it can be bent, it can change, it can mutate and maybe even disappear. To cope with this, a schizophrenic has a rich, highly imaginative inner world that "normal" people do not expect - but he is trapped in it because he cannot relate to most people and his world becomes poorer and poorer until he is finished in an empty, crazy dead end. <br /> <br /> This is very different from what is depicted in this ridiculous "cure" tear film. It must be terribly scary. People other than the protagonist must appear strange, strange and absurd, such as. In Lynch's "Eraserhead". There should be * truly * impressive, weird, coarse hallucinations because that's what schizophrenia is about. It's not about * details *. <br /> <br /> I mean, see "Naked Lunch", "Lost Highway", read P.K. Dick's "Martian Time-Split" or "Ubik", see "The Cell", "Perfect Blue", "Dark City" or play "American McGee's Alice" on PC and you can have a vague idea of ​​what it is like. Don't watch the movie's "Feel Good" movie of the month with banal situations, cleansed characters and visual images and stupid plot tricks. "The Cell" is the most accurate movie about a schizophrenic's mind, his visions, and his inner consistency - it's violent, strange, confusing and very, very scary. Once again, schizophrenia is not about details, it is not a nice, tame trick played to you. It jumps in your face and will not let you go: walls are falling apart, people become strange enemy creatures, you want to go backwards in time, you are not sure you are who you think you are, everything feels. .. strange, unnatural. Believe me, it is much more than what is depicted in this soapy melodrama
