OK, I knew it would be an old F movie (far below B movie standards) that went into it so I thought, "Man I could use a good laugh, let's see some close creatures kill Well, what I got could have been found at your local "love clothes" store. Random lesbian scenes, very small games and no plot. For example, I especially remember a scene (for only the pure stupidity I've seen better porn on ABC) is where the two main characters (I can't remember their names offhand ... great movie, huh?) Run together as they mostly did, and the driver was tired of driving and stopped: <br /> <br /> Driver: "Let's pull over, I'm tired. You'll take over?" Passengers: "Yes, I can drive in a while." (Once you've pulled over, the driver begins to grab the passenger's boobs) Passenger: "What are you doing? I'm not like that!" Driver: "It's okay, everyone does it once." Passenger: "OK so." (Continue to take off shirts, hug, kiss and perform fellatio) <br /> <br /> Now, the last time I checked, horror movies were not in the porn video of Hollywood Video (unless you are in S&M, so You go elsewhere) and it should definitely not be in mainstream videos at Blockbuster. Don't make me wrong; I am definitely not one of the people who hate porn, but I only look at it when it is appropriate and absolutely do not want to see it if I am looking for a movie in the mainstream stores when this rented I was at one of the two dealers I mentioned (and probably on the other also if I went and saw). Worst movie ever, no one should rent it, and it should only be purchased for a public firewood ceremony. If I could give it a 0, I would, but I can only give it a * of 10.
