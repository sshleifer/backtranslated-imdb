The only reason to watch this movie is for a brilliant performance by Thom-Adcox Hernandez, who is underutilized in the film in the movie. As usual, Tom Villard is also good. Otherwise it is c ** p. The owner does not even exist, how does he powerfully change the letters on the theater market to spell out "Possessor"? Lame.
