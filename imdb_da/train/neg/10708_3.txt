This film had the potential to be really good, as some of the record elements borrowed from the sci-fi actor THE HIDDEN. And Dolph always makes a cheesy appeal to his roles. But somebody somewhere really hit the ball here. <br /> <br /> Dolph plays a kicking monk (!), traveling to New York to pick up a key that locks a door under his monastery that has imprisoned the antichrist for 2000 years. He has to fight with the minion, who is a spirit that jumps from body to body, just like HIDDEN and JASON GO TO HELL. Of course, the minion wants the key so that it can let the antichrist out. In continuation of the trip is an annoying female archaeologist, and together she and Dolph are hunted by minion-possessed bodies. <br /> <br /> If I make this sound entertaining, forget it. The pacings are very awkward and sluggish, the optimal subpar at best, and the battle scenes staged badly. Dolph Sleepwalking through his role and spitting some of the worst dialogues in his career. The cheese factor really comes to an end when the minion struggles with an army of machine gun-handling monks at the monastery, but the rest of this flick is a snooze test. <br /> <br /> Too bad, I really wanted to like this.
