Oh, where to start. The cinema was amazing. When the movie first started because of the original country scenes, I thought I was part of a good movie. Then cgi Bigfoot showed up. It looked like a cartoon drawing of Lion King and King Kong's love children. It completely ignored the sign's credibility. Now I knew that there wasn't a Bigfoot chasing people walking around in the woods for no apparent reason, but a cheesy cgi cartoon.So from then on, the whole movie was shot for me. The money they washed down on the toilet for cgi they could use on a costume that Roger Patterson did. His was the best Bigfoot costume ever, no one else could match his. I am a hardcore cheesy Bigfoot movie fan and I was warned about this movie, but my compulsion led me to watch this movie and I was disappointed that the previous reviews warned me. I know after you read this review, you will still say "I need to see Sasquatch hunters, must see Sasquatch hunters." Then you will say why I wasted my good, hard earned money on such a horrible boring movie!
