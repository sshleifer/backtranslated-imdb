(There are Spoilers) Homicidal nymphomaniac hooker Miya, Kari Wuhrer, takes over the life and car of 18 virgin, even though he is too embarrassed to admit it, collage freshmen Trent Colbert, Kristoffer Ryan. At the end of the movie Myia deflowers not only, but give poor innocent and naive Trent a lesson on how to spot a dangerous emergency job and stay so far away for him or her to stay away from end to end one. <br /> <br /> Hanging around a trucker rest stop Miya is picked up by Roy, Burt Young, for some hot and heavy actions, in the back of his buggy. Roy is either too full or stupid to realize that Miya is no other than his alien daughter! Afraid that Miya is reluctant to get it on with him. Roy only stretches her to death to be interrupted by the first-year collage student Trent Colbert, who plows into the remnant area, which flings one of the trucks. <br /> <br /> Watch her chance Miya jumps into Trent's car and the two are off in what turns out to be the weirdest cargo ever put in a movie. Going across the Northeast US, the two end up getting involved in a truck, smashing a murder and a shooting game with the state troops who then lead to Trent's parents home, where they are held hostage. It is there that there is another wild shootout between the mad Miya with a whole SWAT team reinforced by the local police and state troops. <br /> <br /> You'd expect a movie like "Hit and Run" to be intentional or unintentional fun, but it's not. In fact, the film is very disturbing about how Miya treats everyone in the film that she comes in contact with even her perverted and child-killing father Roy. Get Trent to run her all over the Northeast Miya gets the bad slob full of having it on him in a motel room with handcuffs and a lit candle. Miya also gets it with the motel owner the horny Mr. Foster by fooling him into giving her his gun as part of a strange sex game. Having kept Foster up, she takes off Trent's, who is cold in his motel room, with some $ 400.00 in it, but doesn't bother driving her car. <br /> <br /> Need the money to pay for gas to get home to her parents for Thanksgiving Trent gets a call on her mobile phone from Miya to pick her up at a local dinner to get the money back. As the smoker, he is Trent, Miya, now a refugee from his law, later becomes involved with his father Roy on the open highway as he tries to drive both Trent and Miya off the road. <br /> <br /> The chase ends in this deserted sled house, which Roy shocks Miya and drives him on a muddy road in high heels, into him getting it in where you know where with a blast from his own shotgun. Roy was so busy trying to take off his pants that he forgot he left the gun unattended. <br /> <br /> With both a holdup and a murder, as well as a hit and run, let the two desperators stop at a S&M / Tattoo store where Trent gets the ear and nose hole and dressed in leather and chains, by Myri, along with a matching his and her dog requirements. This is to accommodate his straight-laced and conservative parents for Thanksgiving Dinner. <br /> <br /> With a continuous shootout with the state troops, one of them ending up being badly wounded, the two refugees end up with the law of Trent's parents Mr & Mrs Colbet, David Keith and Elaine Martyn home with the entire local police force, with a SWAT team waiting for them there. <br /> <br /> Obnoxious movies with a really disturbing final end that made you wonder what the movie was trying to tell the audience at all. You felt very sympathetic to Miya at first, but when the movie rolled into the creepy ending, it was evaporated as fast as an ice pile in Death Valley. Although Roy was the most unlikely person in the movie only when the film ended, Miya was completely obscured by him.
