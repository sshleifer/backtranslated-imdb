This movie was really bad if you take it as a sci-fi movie, as a horror or as a comedy. It's all ridiculous. The film looks (and is) absolutely cheap, the actors have no idea what is acting, and the manuscript clearly shows that it was made with the shooting. It is obvious that the monster in the closet was added because the living head wasn't scary at all - it was even beautiful - and they thought they needed something more impressive; They also failed here (the makeup is horrible even in the late 50's, pretty funny). <br /> <br /> The film clearly shows why director Joseph Green's career as such and as a writer has never been realized; he was really bad in both. The same goes for the actors who lead and support. <br /> <br /> "The Brain That Would Not Die "'s best performance is its short run time.
