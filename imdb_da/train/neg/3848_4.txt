The movie is almost ridiculous with Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters who act like mothers of convicted murderers. With the horrific aftermath of the trial, the two women go together and leave NY for California to open and sing and dance study for Shirley Temple-like girls. From the beginning it becomes clear that Reynolds made a mistake by taking Winters with her to California. Winters play a deeply religious woman who increasingly seems to be away from her rocker. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the women living together get opposed to threatening phone calls. Reynolds, who puts a blonde wig, will soon be romanticized by the rich father of one of her students, nicely played by Dennis Weaver. <br /> <br /> In one of her last films, Agnes Moorehead is seen briefly as Sister Alma, as Winters is a faithful listener to. <br /> <br /> The movie really belongs to Shelley Winters. She is heavy here and heaviness seemed to make her work even better. The winters are always good in roles that test the nerves. <br /> <br /> The end is of the macabre, and who can forget Winters on the piano that turns away with the completely insane look?
