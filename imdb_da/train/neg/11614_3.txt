Lady in Cement is a real course on social anthropology in the late 60s. The scripture, not the play, is at the center. I said - clean camp! Prepare to be offended if you are a woman or a gay person. Wide and lady are standard terms, and gay baiting and bashing are represented by what they were today (camp-wise). Most of the lines are thrown, though there are amazing performances by a very few excellent character players. The action scenes are earthy, but it is fun to see Dan Blocker playing a hard guy who likes to base hard. And Lanie Kazan and Racquel Welsh are at the top of their career. Great to note they were both 28 years old and Mr. Sinatra was 53. The musical score, wait. . . was there a score? Well, you get points. See it with friends who want a good laugh. it is full of them.
