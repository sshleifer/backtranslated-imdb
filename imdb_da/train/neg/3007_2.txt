Well, on the endless quest for horror, we come across this movie, apparently re-released on DVD recently for some wicked reason. The transfer is horrible and the quality just sucks. I don't think this is due to a bad remaster or anything I just think the movie is badly done. Of course, admitted to an abandoned school with a budget that was undoubtedly wasted on cheap beer and no talent hacks, "Slaughter High" starts slowly and does not take off until approx. one hour in. First we'll see a 'geek' as he is chosen by a group of ... I actually don't even know what they should be ... jocks? The ringleader, with his ultra hooknose is so ugly, he should definitely have been thrown like geek. Then there is a 'big guy' and a couple of stupid losers and chickens to be 'warm', but it is not. It's a mystery why this group rejects choosing one of their own, but I suppose the viewer is assuming these are "cool kids" who choose a dweeb. The cast options are terrible, as most colleges are played by thirty somethings. As other reviewers have pointed out, the actors (if you can call them that) are a bunch of Britons whose accents slip out several times throughout this piece of shit. We are back to assuming that this group of 'children' were the only students in this school, as their 'reunification' is only those in school who now turn out to be abandoned are just them. <br /> <br /> The killers are lame, gore is not amazing and the manuscript is like Scooby Doo with real people; lines like: "This place gives me the creeps ..." and "Someone gets a beer" are highlights ... It's just not good. Skip this one unless you are wasted with some friends and will laugh at a real slap of a slam. If you want to look good, you get Bava's "Bay of Blood" which is done 14 years earlier and a lot much better. If you want to see a good BAD slasher, see "Just Before Dawn" or "The Burning." 2 out of 10, children.
