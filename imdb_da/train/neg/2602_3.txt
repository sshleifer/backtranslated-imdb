Drew Barrymore still sees his alter ego all over the city, and it really starts to become a pain in the ass. When Dee rents an apartment from a hack writer, her meetings with 'the other Drew' become more frequent. Writer-dude feels it's his responsibility to snatch the real Drew out of her stupor so he does what he can to help seduce her as soon as he has free time. Not very interesting, and even less frightening, but Drew is sexy as usual, especially when she gives a group of rude builders the finger ... yes Drew, it's hot! <br /> <br /> Best scene can only be where Drew sticks his real life mother, Jaid, with a big kitchen knife ... hmmm ... and how was your day?
