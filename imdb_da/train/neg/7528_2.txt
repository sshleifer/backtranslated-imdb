This is even worse than the original Game of Death. A jumbled, incoherent story causes "Billy Lo" to fall from a helicopter to the ground below and kill him as we return to follow his younger brother, Bobby Lo. So not only do we start after a Bruce Lee clone, the movie kills one and has us following another thirty minutes into history. The main reason for seeing this is when Bobby Lo is fighting with a lion, which is clearly a guy in a lion costume. Jang Lee Hwang is also the villain, who is usually pretty amazing, but his screen time is significantly small. Mostly seen this and the original Game of Death because they are part of the Bruce Lee boxed set. It is no wonder that they are included in Lee's finished works. No one would buy them otherwise.
