This film deals with two former football players, Fred Williamson, Mack Derringer and Gary Busey, who work as private eyes and meet all sorts of ladies and men with some bad backgrounds. Mack Derringer is addressing his former wife's Vanity (Jennifer Derringer) who is working on having sex talk over the phone. Jennifer is being threatened by a caller who wants to do horrible things for her, and she asks for help with several other ladies. Mack & Lenny have more time on their hands and often go to Miami, Fl. golf courses or hang out in a sports bar where all kinds of city types continue. There are lots of battles, murders and lots of double meaning words that bring this movie down to a great ZERO. Don't waste your time, this movie cost me only 50 cents and it was too much.
