I was totally disappointed with this movie. I had read some of the other reviews here and had much higher expectations. I expected a drama with more intense character development. But it never happens in the movie. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor, but not as good as some reviewers here would have us believe. I learned to repeat the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the movie. I would rate his performance 6 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Works: 6 out of 10 Direction is 5 out of 10. Script is the worst: 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I deleted the movie from my DVR in 70 minutes. into the movie. Much better movies out there than this ...
