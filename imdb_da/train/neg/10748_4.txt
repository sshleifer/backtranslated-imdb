Nothing to say but Wow! Has anyone actually had anyone sneak up on them in an open field? Well, this movie is about 25 times (clearly the director's favorite scare tactics). In one of the opening scenes, the smooth speaker / hot shot producer must ride in the back seat, so that the camera man could sit in the front for film. Shortly after, he comes to the field, shows the 5 participants, and although it is clear no later than 2 in the afternoon, they are all convinced that the sun will set a moment. After approx. 30 minutes of unbroken waste we are privileged with a feedback of the clown's history, where we see some of his former victims. If you look at this movie, check out the ladies' coffin. Her rib goes all the way to her throat, it was flat out disgusting. Most horror movies act during the night, but without a night vision camera chaos is forced to happen during the day. The few night shots that made it into the movie look as if they were stolen from Blair Witch Project or random shots from the director's backyard. The movie admitted something in the end, as there was a matrix like shooting out with the clown we rewound and watched over and over again, laughing hysterically. Definitely Rent this movie if you've ever been turned up in an open area. <br /> <br /> signed, the answer
