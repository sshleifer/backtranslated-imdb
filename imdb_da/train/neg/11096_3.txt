I had great hopes for this movie because I thought CLEAN, SHAVEN (Kerrigan's first feature) was amazing, the most assured cinematic low-cost movie I had ever seen. <br /> <br /> But much of the CLAIRE DOLAN is completely meaningless and flat. The scene after scene randomly looks into the mix, without thinking of narrative or character. <br /> <br /> Is Claire trying to escape being a prostitute or not? Hard to tell Why does she pick up the trick at the airport if she wants to escape that life? Why doesn't she pick up tricks when she needs money in Seattle? Why do we have to see her color hair for what is almost the same color? Why does Claire accept some johns and not others? The filmmaker does not seem to know. It feels like everything is improvised (though I understand it wasn't the case) and the filmmakers just kept a camera on it as if they were making a verite documentary. After the screening I saw, Kerrigan defended his lack of narrative by condemning film narrative as politically conservative. It sounded like learned rhetoric. I think it was a copy. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry that the maker of a movie as exciting as CLEAN, SHAVEN would continue to make such a lame movie like this and then defend it with tired old "political" clich√©s.
