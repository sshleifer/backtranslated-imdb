*** SPOILERS *** As part of the evil Tinkers-to-Evers-to-Chance double-play combination, in "Omen IV" we have the evil seed of the late AntiChrist Damien Thorn coming back. Terrorizing his parents, his schoolmates his neighbors and finally the whole world as she was named Delia York, Asia Vieila. After receiving a "deserved" couple, York's Karen & Gene, Fay Grant & Michael Woods, of the Catholic Church St. Francis orphanage. <br /> <br /> When she got the peasants scratching her mother at a house party, Little Delia didn't waste anything. Later, Delia is almost killed by a runaway truck only to have saved this "Devil Dog" named Ryder. Go to school Delia takes care of the local bullying by getting the big guy to get wet in front of all his classmates. Later, when his father threatens Yorks with a law package, she's cut off in a self-induced traffic accident! Delia is a person you never break with if you know what's good for you. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Dalias father Gene becomes a great man in the city alone, or he believes in being elected to Congress as a master of clean air and green trees crowds rather than letting smog and concrete boys take over the neighborhood with his eye now on his White House himself! Does his bratty and weird daughter Delia have anything to do with Gene Yorks sudden happiness? <br /> <br /> It is only later when Jo, Ann Hearen, is hired as Delia's nanny that the truth comes out of her strange and evil powers. Well, a New Age type realizes that Delia is a little odd after turning all of its white crystals black, and calls on its New Age Guru Noah, Jim Byrnes, to come over and check her out. Noah is so sorry he sees in Delia Kirilian color vibrations, all black and blue with a small pinch of red that it throws him so badly that he almost crashed into Delia's VAT car. <br /> <br /> Taking a trip to a psychic festival of Jo Delia, the whole event becomes an inferno setting, through mental telepathy, on fire and raising all those who drive for coverage, including poor Noah who was at the festival and ended with his legs broken. The shaken and violent Guru was so shaken by the whole experience that he later checked out of the country to become a hermit in the Tibetan desert. <br /> <br /> You yourself are later thrown out with the help of the sweet and cozy family animal Ryder, from another floor window to her death, because she knew and talked too much. That's when Karen is pregnant again, she finally decides to find out the truth about Delia's true parents. That's when she and we in the audience come to face the truth. She's not just the dreaded AntiChrist of Revelations, she's his twin sister! Her brother AntiChrist herself is coming on stage as her little brother, her unborn Alexander York! <br /> <br /> Three times was more than enough for AntiChrist to return to Earth to get Armageddon. The movie that was public was already a little tired of him and his evil adventures. With a fourth really not necessary since Daimen Thorn, the original AntiChrist, had been dead and buried for years. Was reviewed the usual ringtone without believing that the little Delia is "Thee" AntiChrist until it was almost too late to stop her in her deadly rounds to destroy all of humanity. The movie as bad as it is too long, 97 minutes, for a horror-flick who might well have told that its story is as little as 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> Having a private eye Earl Knight, Mchael Teacher, and later a former Catholic nun sister Yvonne, Megan Lehch, and now the devotee Felichy in the movie that was only turned off, also didn't help the plot. It only extended the suffering of those who saw the film. You can see the surprise ending almost as soon as the movie "Omen IV" began with the bases being cleared of Delia's possible takeover of the civilized and uncivilized world. What was a surprise was that Delia did it with a little help from friends.
