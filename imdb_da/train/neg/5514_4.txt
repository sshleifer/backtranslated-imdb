I don't know about you, but what I love about Tom and Jerry cartoons is the (often violent) interaction between the two characters. Mouse In Manhattan, Jerry looks to leave Tom behind to have a New York adventure and, as far as I'm concerned, suffers from a lack of cat! As magical as Jerry's exploration of 'Big Apple' can be for the other fans who have commented on IMDb here, I couldn't wait for this self-rubbing nonsense to end so I could see the next cartoon on my DVD. <br /> <br /> In fact, the only part of the whole episode was, I really enjoyed Jerry almost buying the yard, hanging out of the end of a broken light, hundreds of feet over a busy road.
