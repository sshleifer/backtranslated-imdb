Must admit having seen a few in my time, but this one is up there with the worst of them. Plot worrying to follow. Gender and violence are thrown into confusing and distracting from the really poorly composed film. <br /> <br /> I can only imagine that the cast will look back on the end product and want to collect dust on a shelf, not to disturb a generation or two. Unfortunately, I have the DVD in my case. It will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time.
