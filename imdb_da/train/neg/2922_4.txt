Take young, beautiful people, put them in an exotic location, hold on to some bad guys, get the two protagonists to find romance after a couple of heavy breaths, make the shrewd plotters, and then draw a happy end for everyone (except the three or four being murdered, of course) It is the classic (and successful) format of Harlequin Romance. It's not that good, but it's not as bad as most of the little yellow wallets. And the place things in Budapest are especially interesting, though they didn't use the wonderful old train station (designed by Gustave Eifel) or show the city's famous thermal baths.
