No redeeming qualities may be expressed. I wish I could get my time back. nice reason face broad smiles really, bright on the camera when the disease has already widespread chaos on the uninformed script. I was ((spoiler)) happy to see all the signs that were dead or seriously incapacitated at the end, especially the party that drinks the tainted juice on the way to the alleged sunset. Eli Roth shines for moments with maybe ten, telling the theory of how well-known smoking is in the forest when others have really come out of beer consumption. Overall, I found most of it meaningless, but not without gratuitous violence and not enough nudity, happy to witness the death, in a way even though the desire for the journey had never happened (probably should have been put in place of see TBS late night, ugh).
