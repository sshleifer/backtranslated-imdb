I'm a big fan of Stephen King. I loved The Running Man. So of course I was very excited that someone had made a movie of it. And when a local network showed the movie, I was in heaven. I was ready for a good night! <br /> <br /> The first indicator that something was wrong was when I saw someone throwing Arnold Schwarzenegger. I simply couldn't believe that a man who became famous for a movie filled with a "shootin" could play a more clever part as described in the book. I was still convinced it would be a good movie, though. Who knows, maybe Arnold had some hidden talents? <br /> <br /> Well, he didn't. I quickly found out that the only reason he was thrown himself was that someone had rewritten the whole story to make it into the 'shootin' fight. Yup, it was a standard Arnold movie: Totally made wrong, the hero solves problems by bending his powerful muscles and scaring everyone away and the hero gets the girl. <br /> <br /> I was stunned. This is not what the book said at all. I know books can't be put on the screen literally, but it didn't even have links to the book. Stephen King should have openly condemned any affiliation with the movie and he should have banned the title The Running Man for this shameless movie. I don't say that often, but this movie was bad. If I wasn't at home, I'd have thrown red tomatoes on the screen. Once again: poor. <br /> <br /> (note that I used "someone" a lot. I did because I am sure many people are ashamed to have worked on this and I will not give them any further by naming them here)
