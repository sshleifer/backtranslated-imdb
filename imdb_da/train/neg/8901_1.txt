I want to make this short and sweet .... this movie sucked !!!!!! <br /> <br /> I saw part 1 earlier today and thought it was one of the biggest movies ever, giving it 9 out of 10 stars. So I thought maybe part 2 and 3 would be good followers I was wrong. This movie bored me to death and was so different from the first one it had plotted on and that is it. It was like bad outbreaks from part or something. <br /> <br /> I love Walken, but I was sorry for him here. I was so happy about Glenn Danzig being in this movie, but I don't blame you for missing him. There was a full cast full of crappy actors and people I didn't like like Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals. But it was a fresh air to see Ethan Embry, he is one of the funniest people on earth. <br /> <br /> This movie will make you the first little bit smaller so don't watch it because you feel owed it to yourself is a fan of part 1. I will wait a few days before I see part 3 and I ask it is better than this crap. <br /> <br /> The last scene of the movie with lightning was one of the most beautiful things ever shown on film. Fast forward or jump to it if you can't stomach the first part. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10 stars - this was terrible!
