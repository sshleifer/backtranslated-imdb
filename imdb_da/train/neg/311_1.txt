I just finished watching Going Overboard. I have to say that we should send each copy of this movie to Iraq and have them watch. I even tried to get blind women to see this and she knocked it off like for 20 min. Adam Sandler couldn't find a better project than this? As for the writing, if that's what you want to call it, those responsible must be forced to watch this movie forever in hell !! I think a place I read that the budget for this movie was $ 10,000 and they were far below. Did wallmart get a good deal on this? Each store has a great big box of this crap sitting on the sale. The only good thing about this movie is that you can use the DVD as a coaster or trade it to a friend, but then they may not be your friend anymore !!
