The film is about two stories: One is a political murder of a call-girl, the other a political party in the upper class. The crossing point is Al Paccino's public relation as he is witnessing the crime and the successor to the evening. <br /> <br /> If the manuscript is terrible without any decent dialogues and controls the lap of any sense of drama, Al's achievements are memorable: how many fellows can be as convincing as a strong and feared man (like "The Godfather" ) as here as a small servant (see also "Donnie Brasco"). /> <br /> In fact, the big young lion has become a tired old one. This aging is very moving because it causes the audience to think about getting old. <br /> <br /> But his slowness is just a make-up because he can get his energy back in the church scene. <Br /> <br /> Maybe it's good that the movie is so awful because it puts the starlight on Al's talent!
