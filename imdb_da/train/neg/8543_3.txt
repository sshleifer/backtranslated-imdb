I admit that I had to accelerate through this badly transmitted DVD after approx. 30 minutes - Nothing happened and everyone has already described the "plot". But has anyone mentioned the opening scene - a butcher's knife has been thrown through a wig and it has been looted on the grass in the front yard! I guess the bratty child did it, set it is never explained. Really trippy opening. <br /> <br /> I wish this was a better-written or well-thought-out movie because what we are left with if it is beautiful and a movie that doesn't make sense is not a "smart" movie It's just a badly executed movie. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see a cleared version, and if there were missing pictures, I'd like to see if it would help. Otherwise, this is a strange little movie that is best if it is accelerated quickly!
