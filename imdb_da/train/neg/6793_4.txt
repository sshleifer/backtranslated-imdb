Gritty, dusty west from director Richard Brooks, who works extensively in the genre, while keeping all the usual clich√©s intact. In the early 1900s, horse racing joins a low key cowboy (Gene Hackman), a suave gambler (James Coburn), a horny kid (Jan Michael Vincent) and even a FEMALE (a surprising game of Candice Bergen). When the predictions are out of the way (with the predictable arguments over whether or not a woman should participate), this becomes a pretty enchanting entry, even if it doesn't break anything new (it looks like something from Gary Cooper's era). Good looks, whose overlapping piece has macho embroidery and a fine cast, but the mechanisms in the plot become tiring rather quickly. ** from ****
