This movie is a rather weird mix of musical, romance, drama and crime with a sniff of film noir to it. It is basically a messy pile of different genres, none of which really works as it should. <br /> <br /> This movie is an attempt by Mickey Rooney to be taken more seriously as an actor. He is a former child star who always used to steal in happy comic and musical productions at the start of his career. In this movie, he chooses another approach (although the musical aspects are still present in the film). But his role is actually quite ridiculous in the movie. I mean Mickey Rooney as a hard player? He is an extremely small boyish looking man. He was actually in his 30s already at the time of this movie, but he looks seriously like a 16-year-old. Hear him say treasure to women and hear talking hard to the gangsters who are about 3 times bigger than he just doesn't look and feel right. He is simply not convincing in his role. <br /> <br /> Because the movie mixes so many different genres, the story really feels like a mess. Somewhere in it there is a crime fair and somewhere in it is a romantic plot line and one about living your dream, but none of it really works because of the messy approach and handling of it all. It's just not an interesting or compelling movie to watch. László Kardos is also a director who has only made 10 films in his lifetime despite his career ranging from 1935 to 1957. He must have been a struggling instructor who had a hard time getting work in the industry and instead once in one while getting a smaller script to work with. His films are all unknown and usually not too high quality. Also, let's not forget that this is a 50's movie, yet it feels more like a '40's or maybe even as one from the' 30s. This is of course mostly due to the fact that this film was shot in black and white. Generally, black and white films from the 50s often appear to have a cheap look at feeling over it, and this film is no exception. It is a rather strange sight to see Mickey Rooney and Louis Armstrong and his band as they perform together in a sequence. It wasn't the only movie Armstrong showed up in, and he would often pop up in this type of movie, often simply as he did. I think jazz lovers can still enjoy watching this movie because of its music, as there is quite a lot of it present in this movie. The film actually got an Oscar nomination for best original song. <br /> <br /> An unfortunate little movie and excursion from Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> 4/10
