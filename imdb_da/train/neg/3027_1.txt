If it smells like waste, and if it looks like waste, it should be garbage. This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Tony Scott's poor management style is ashamed of an already uninteresting and somewhat untrue story of Domino Harvey's life as a bounty hunter. The story is completely discontinuous and confusing to see. Certain aspects of the plot were ridiculous and incredible. It seems that all action scenes were loosely tied together by bad plot points and horrible actions. Keira Knightley, however, becomes completely nude in this. It's the only end to this movie. If you want to see her naked, just play the movie up to approx. An hour and a half into it, and you get a lot of nipple. I strongly suggest that no one sees this movie ever! <3
