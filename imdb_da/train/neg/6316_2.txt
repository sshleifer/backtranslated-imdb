A movie like Amazing Grace and Chuck is a perfect example of how left in this country just doesn't get it. They never did. And liberalism continues to slip further into political oblivion. <br /> <br /> This movie deals with a small league baseball star who decides to stop playing ball as a protest against the existence of nuclear weapons. The boy is understandably ridiculed until a wealth of professional athletes, led by former NBA star Alex English, join in his case. Not just a few of them participate in the cause. When his movement reaches its peak, entire leagues in professional and collegiate sports must cancel their seasons as no one will play any more. Just to move this review together, I'm ready to give them this premise. Although it would never happen for a million years, I would just imagine it could, and then go from there. I can't quite remember how, but some kind of agreement has been reached and boy decides to go back to the game he loves in an incredibly juicy and ridiculous scene. <br /> <br /> Before I criticize the announcement of this movie, let me just say that this movie is poorly written, acted and governed. Even if you agree with the boy's attitude, it would be impossible to overcome how badly the film was built. And it's a shame as there are lots of good actors wasting. (Peck, Curtis, Petersen). Alex English does as well as he could have with his character, and I wish he would try to act in several movies. Unfortunately, it is probably much easier to find work in the coaching world of the NBA. One wishes Mr English would learn more of these thuggish NBA types today how to shoot the rock a little better. Alex knew for sure how to put the ball through the hanger. <br /> <br /> As far as the film's message is concerned, it's just wrong. Simple and simple. All these nuclear warheads tucked away in these missile silos out west Expected war !!!!! It would be a thing for this boy and his party to protest against an actual war or the use of nuclear weapons. These weapons were never actually used, and it was genius behind their existence. Neither during the Cold War was crazy enough to shoot a single missile. Without these weapons, who knows what might have happened between the US and the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Of course, the actors in this movie were meant for kids in America to take their case and follow in Chuck's footsteps. However, children in America are more intelligent than the left-wing cooks who created this boy. <br /> <br /> The movie is only worth 2 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> To watch a fantastic movie about the dangers of nuclear war, stick to Dr. Strangelove instead. </ br /> <br /> Mr. Newell, you're no Frank Capra!
