I just saw Adam having four sons for the first time, and what struck me was that I think the model was Theodore Roosevelt and his four sons. They were about the same ages as the four boys in this movie. Warner Baxter in his portrayal of Adam Stoddard spoke of the same values ​​and family tradition that you would have heard from our 26th President without some of the more intriguing aspects of TR's character. <br /> <br /> Like the TR all the Stoddard sons serve in the First World War, in this case, even though the youngest only loses an eye instead of being killed. <br /> <br /> But what if a female minx enters this entire male household and disturbs things? It's Susan Hayware's job here. In one of her earliest prominent roles, Hayward is a flirtatious amoral girl who marries a son, has an affair with another and begins to make a game for the third. It is an early precursor of the kind of part that later brought her an Oscar in. I'd like to live. <br /> <br /> I assume that with as strong a model of decorum as Theodore Roosevelt was, and Warner Baxter portrays everyone is afraid to tell Dad what is going on. The son and also their governing Ingrid Bergman. Here's where the plot gets a little silly. Bergman is introduced to us as governor employed by Baxter and wife Fay Wray for their children. Wray dies, and Baxter suffers some economic reversals in business. Bergman must be solved. She goes back to France and later returns to the family when the children have grown up. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but I can't believe the kids need a governor now. Hayward is right when she confronts her that it was not the children who brought her back. In the normal course, Bergman would have settled with his life. <br /> <br /> One of the previous reviewers said that a quarter to a third of the movie I have been edited out. Maybe it could be the cause of the many plot holes we have. It's too bad that Ingrid and Susan couldn't have made another movie together in the 50s when Hayward was at her heights and Bergman had just made a comeback. <br /> <br /> Susan Hayward is the main reason why Adam saw four sons. And I am willing to believe that a large part of Ingrid was left on the floor.
