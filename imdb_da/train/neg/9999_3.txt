It's the kind of movie my enemies love, I'm constantly watching, but that's not true. I only look at it occasionally to make sure it is as bad as I first thought it was. <br /> <br /> Some kind of mobsters hijack a Boeing 747. (It's at least an improvement over having Boeing capsules a good part of the Pentagon.) The plane crashes into the Bermuda triangle and drops the pressure to the bottom , a kind of post-facto submarine. <br /> <br /> It has one of the all-star casts, the stars either falling or barely over the horizon. <br /> <br /> "We're on our own!" says pilot Jack Lemon. He's right. Except George Kennedy. He is in all these disaster films. <br /> <br /> See another movie instead. Oh, not the "airport" original. It's not good either. Instead, you should see a decent flick on fixed planes like "Phoenix Fly".
