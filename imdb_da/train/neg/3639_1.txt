This movie sucks from the beginning to (especially) the end. You probably won't get any worse, play, history, photography, camera work, etc. It's all bad, very, very bad. <br /> <br /> But it makes a good look will give you more than enough good laugh. The worse, the better! <br /> <br /> I really have no idea what so much of what these people were thinking of making this movie. A serious Viking movie? The story is wonderfully ridiculous, it's more like a comedy in disguise, like Mafia, also meaningless, but marvelous fun. <br /> <br /> Beware of the very end of the movie ... uhum.
