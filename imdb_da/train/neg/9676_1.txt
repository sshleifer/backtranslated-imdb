Movies have put me to sleep before, but no movie has ever done it twice, so it took me three meetings to finish it. The dialogue was poor. Women spoke stylishly and the men were caricatures. And two of the allegedly Japanese women saw Chinese, had Chinese names and spoke with clear Chinese accents. I still try to find out why the emmental men were sexually wrapped with each other. 10 minus 8 1/2 equals a hard choice: Do I rate this movie? or two? <br /> <br /> Movies have put me to sleep before, but no movie has ever done it twice, so it took me three meetings to finish it.
