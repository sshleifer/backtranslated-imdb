Ziab la ta'kol al lahem is a horrible movie. This is only a superposition of scenes without a clear link. The spirit is also very bad, despite the presence of a good actor like Ezzat El allayli. But something is really amazing in this movie that speaks of sexuality, the liberation of women, naked scenes are very rare in Arabic cinema, even these days. I would like to congratulate the director and the actors for their courage. We want to see more of this style in Egyptian movies, but with better quality. The reasons why I voted this movie as a horrible is not just scenario and action, but also the lack of professionalism. This movie looks like an amateur one.We can see many errors on the screen. If you want a good Arabic movie, Ziab la ta'kol al lahm is not the recommended one. But if you want to encourage the uncensored movies across the Arab world, watch it and make your friends and family do the same.
