Possible Spoilers, maybe. I have to say that "Cinderella II: Dreams Come True" is one of the worst movies ever made. First of all, the film was made under the height of Disney's successor ramp. It was created around the same time as "The Little Mermaid II", "The Jungle Book II" and "Peter Pan II", all of which were disservices to their original movie classics. (Disney also made "The Hunchback of Notre Dame II" and "Atlantis II", but I will drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place.)) Let me go further and say I am an avid supporter of good Disney movies, and I absolutely love the original Disney "Cinderella." However, the successor to "Cinderella" was a waste of time. Cinderella's character in the sequel was so much unlike the original girl that I grew up looking at. In the original, Cinderella was sweet and loving. The new Cinderella had very out-of-character moments with current era formulation like "I'll make this beat my way!" Let me also tell you the new Cinderella (which I have lovingly called her) says, "Ewww!" It's anti-cinderella. I try to find the best in people, but in the sequel is Anastasia, one of the stepists, good! notch? Why? They made it all seem like Lady Tremaine and Drizella are just terrible family members for poor little Anastasia. My question to the world: Have the people of Disney seen the original "Cinderella" when making this sequel? Well, it certainly doesn't work that way. If I remember correctly, Anastasia was just as offensive to Cinderella as Drizella and Lady Tremaine. I'm all for redemption and forgiveness, but there was no redemption for Anastasia in this movie. In the first, Anastasia was hurt. In the other she is good. You just can't leave a story like this. I hope Disney understands that this movie, among other films, is shaming Walt Disney's name. Maybe now that Michael Eisner is gone, things will start to shape around the House of Mouse.
