Alone In the Dark is a BAD movie and tied with Deuce Bigalow for the worst movie of the year. I wish it was all I had to say, but of course IMDb determines a word count and all that. <br /> <br /> I have two thoughts about what kind of bad movie is a worse kind of bad movie. A low budget drink like Red Zone Cuba, Monster A Go Go and Manos. Or a big budget disgrace like Gigli, Superbabies or this guff. You see movies like Monster A Go Go and Manos because the instructor doesn't have a clue. Movies like this happen because the instructor is a stupid, money-loving idiot who just doesn't care about his audience. It is more shocking when you consider that Uwe Boll (Mastermind behind this shocking crap and already has some real waste under his belt) has created something that only happens once in a blue moon. The really horrible bad horror movie. Everything about it is a mess. Cheesy CGI, bad plot, crazy random camera cuts and shaking soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Alone In The Dark is a horrible movie that should be seen by absolutely none. Woo hoo! Review over. Give me a bid, roll on 2006 and I can never talk about it again. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie.
