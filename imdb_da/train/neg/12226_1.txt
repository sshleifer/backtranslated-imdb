I know I know "Plan 9 from outer space" is the worst movie, or maybe "Manos, the hands of fate". But I can't get worked up over the sock-monkey movies. By * course * they are bad. How could they be good? But if you're talking about movies with respectable production values ​​and bankable talent, T. rex of all turkeys must be "Yentl." All the treacly phoniness, all of the self-absorbed asininity that stains everything Barbra Streisand has done since 1964, reaches its culmination in this movie. From his lonely summit of horror, "Yentl" looks back to "A star is born" and on to "The mirror has two faces". There is nothing else like it. Which emotional underwear Streisand pulled out to make this movie, I'd rather not speculate and what audience she played for, I may not be able to imagine even if I bet, there are nine out of ten chances you are not a member of the. /> <br /> Nobel laureate and saintly guardian of Yiddish literature Isaac Bashevis Singer was so upset about what Streisand did to his story that he publicly blasted her for it. It is a tribute to Streisand's impenetrable vulgarity that she not only did not commit suicide, but continued to make more horrible films.
