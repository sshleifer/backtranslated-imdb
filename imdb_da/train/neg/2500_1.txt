Van Dien must be embarrassed in the memory of this ridiculously poor movie, which actually needs every person involved. To be honest I am rather embarrassed to admit that I saw it from start to finish. Production values ​​are somewhere between the original series of 'Crossroads' and 'Prisoner Cell Block H'. Most five-year-olds would be able to make a more realistic dialogue and a more plausible plot. Regarding the imagined notions, if you can imagine the most rubbish porn you have ever seen - one of them where the action is padded with some endless 'stories' to explain how some pouting old peroxide blonde kettle is come to be spit-roasted by a couple of blokes with mustache - you want an idea of ​​the standard to shop in 'Maiden Voyage'. Even worse, you can't even speed up the sex scenes because there's no one. An awful horrible movie.
