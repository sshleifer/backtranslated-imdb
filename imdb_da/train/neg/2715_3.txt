The 1960s were a time of change and awakening for most people. Social uprising and unrest were commonplace when people talked about their views. Racial tensions, politics, the Vietnam War, sexual promiscuity and drug abuse were all part of the daily matter and daily news. This film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining movie, and managed largely. <br /> <br /> In this movie, two families are followed: a white, a black. In the first half of the film, the story follows every family on equal footing through social and family struggles. Unfortunately, the second half of the film is almost dedicated to the white family. Admittedly, there are more signs in this family, and the lines of history are mixed, but equal to the aspects of the breed of this century. On the whole, the play is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie. The film is a work of fiction, but clips of known historical figures are used to set the timeline. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie, but the situations were predictable and the story was one-sided.
