Painful. Painful is the only word that describes this horrible reproduction of such a fun and interesting Shakespeare play. I gave it a shot, but was terribly disappointed and couldn't just finish seeing it. To the person who wrote a novel about how wonderful this twist of much Ado was, I apologize to you and your bored brain. May your notions of young viewers be lifted without retribution. Please do not even bother with this intense, vile excuse for a performance of a recognized Shakespeare drama. You will be forced to induce vomiting and will require a chest of drawers near the TV that you choose to look at this scream because involuntary stools will take place.
