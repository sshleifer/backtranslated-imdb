Max had the V-8, Trace (firelight last and only hero) has a jet engine on the back of his car that allows him to make unintentional humorous faces as he rockets around halfway desert deserts. Astonished as Mad Max 2 (aka The Road Warrior) is being dissected and reassembled as a new movie though filmed in a noisy way with bad actors and miserable stunt work. Why is WoF put in a post-apocalyptic wasteland? Simple, Road Warrior was! In fact, questions can be answered by: it was so in the Road Warrior! Except for out of work, mutant actors from the original 60's The Time Machine movie are making a como look for giving the audience some non-vehicle actions to chew on for a few minutes. In the typical 80's fashion, all cars driven by bad guys that are bumped or slightly burst, explode into a huge rolling explosion. Inevitably, all car journeys will be close to convenient cutting sites, and cars will inevitably fall off them. Along with the cinematic wildlife tours of this 80's, the general creepy misogyny of this style is cheapie movies. Generally, I was waiting for Trace's rocket-driven car to accelerate and shoot flames so there would be another shot of him scrunching up his face, which he should be hard to come out more when he sees the constipation. Poorly choreographed action combined with bad acting makes this movie a real low. The unintentional humor value even manages to wear thin. Rat: Bruno Mattei's nights are superior. And that in itself says a lot! With this figure 2020, Texas Gladiators is a cinematic masterpiece compared to Wheels of Fire. A bad Road Warrior turns off, which doesn't have nearly enough cheese factor to make the movie visible. <br /> <br />
