No one is a bigger fan of Geroge Macdonald Fraser's Flashman papers than I do. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see that Richard Lester ruled Royal Flash when I also saw that he had made the three / four musketeers with Fraser, which I myself showed quite well. <br /> <br /> Not so Royal Flash. <br /> <br /> I was 12 years old when the movie was released and could not have been more enthusiastic since I had read all the Flashman papers published until then and was drunk by A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowel (I'm still but he was never really given a chance after that). <br /> <br /> A disappointment (I saw it again when I was about 20 on TV and it seemed even worse). None of the sharp dialogue in the books is transferred to the screen. Comedy by Flashman's characters seemed to have been mistreated in the same way as one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody what it would do. The dueling and the fences were terrible and untamed. <br /> <br /> Looking back with more mature eyes, but the film failed to exploit the possibilities of direct satire of previous film versions of the Prisoner of Zenda. <br /> <br /> If you've read the book and not seen the movie, I can only say that the movie ends with Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg becomes fast friends and play a game Rudi has just invented: Russian roulette. <br /> <br /> A pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about. <br /> <br /> My comments would be more direct if I had watched the movie recently, but I'm glad I didn't. <br /> <br /> If Fraser certainly reads this, I can only say that I think he is a genius - perhaps the greatest comic author of his generation, but it's so hard to believe that he Based on my understanding of this workforce, the manuscript wrote of this movie as he did all the horrible Roger Moore James Bond movies.
