... a couple said out of the cinema just as I came in to see this. Hmm, not a good sign, but who knows? Different strokes for different people. Well, no. They were friendly. Godard has published work that is passionate (contempt), entertaining (Band of Outsiders), sometimes both (my life alive). This is just boring intellectualism that congratulates the nerves quite quickly. During my viewing, literally half of the audience had gone out at the end of the movie. If only I had been so clever.
