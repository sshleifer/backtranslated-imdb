This was another big screen outing for an American television show from the sixties. It's funny enough, but was a lot of formula. Intelligent Martian lands on Earth and does not meet too bright people, in his view. <br /> <br /> The usual wackiness accompanies man, Bridges, eventually joins him and helps him come home. Along the way he also gets the girl, Hannah. <br /> <br /> It is a lovely outing for some cozy Hollywood stars that I hadn't seen for a while. <br /> <br /> Pleasant enough to pass a little free time if you have nothing better to see.
