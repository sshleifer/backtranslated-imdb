A previous reviewer said the movie is not that bad. What?!?!?! The film glorifies children's smuggling. Oh, but Sylvia Kristel was naked in it, so let's give it 5 out of 10 stars. Why not a full 10? Because the filmography was "agonizing", the baby's appearance of shock was "unrealistic" and the obese friend was "annoying". Nowhere in the review, the reviewer expresses any act of violence that an American film in 1981 highlighted scenes by a child having sex with an adult woman. I happened to catch this steamy loaf of a movie while staying at a hotel that had Showtime. Even though the fat friend had acted a storm and was deserving of an Oscar, I would still have to give the movie only 1 star. The fact that the television Howard Hessman starred in the movie while appearing in the WKRP is particularly ridiculous. But don't take my word for it!
