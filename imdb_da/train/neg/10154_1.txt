how can this movie have a 5.5 this movie was a piece of skunk s ** t first the actors were really bad i mean chainsaw Charlie was so retarded. for at the beginning when he pokes his head into the wooden cabin (it happened to be about half an inch thick (it was really cheap as * flimsy piece of wood) and he didn't even think he could cut it thrown) Secondly it person who made the kit sucks like * delivering things that they can build with. The only good thing about this movie is the idea of ​​this movie. show. bottom line Don't waste your hard earned money on this hunk if they call a movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0.3
