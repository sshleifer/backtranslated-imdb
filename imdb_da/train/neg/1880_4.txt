Despite being a big fan of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers' films, it was only about 6 years ago that I first saw 'Follow the Fleet'. I knew all the songs from an old Astaire / Rogers post (yes vinyl), but knew nothing about the plot. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while the songs are captivating and Ginger Rogers' character is sweet and fun, just don't like 'Bake Baker'. While trying to compensate for his long-term partner, he continuously sabotages his career. His character does not have the usual humor and elan in the other films' Astaire characters. Worth watching the songs and a good solo tap routine by Ginger Rogers.
