At least the seats in the theater were comfortable, and I ate popcorn as high as possible to drown the inferior dialogue. This is definitely not a girls movie. Any blocks that like it are those us ladies can be sure to stay far away from. Stupid history, mediocre dialogue and an overall pictorial film. I've seen many, many movies, but this is the new winner in the bad category. If you happen to see it, it is one thing you look forward to, the end. So you can finally run out of the theater as soon as possible.
