I usually have no incentive to comment on movies I don't like, but in a case like this, I just have to say something. This movie is horrible, illogical and stupid. There are so many mistakes in the story that I do not even feel obligated to deepen myself, because it is time for me to move on from this experience. The most annoying point, however, is that nowhere in the film does it explain in any way whether the motivation for Bacon's character is madness caused by a power trip or a physiological reaction to his condition. <br /> <br /> Given the special effects are impressive, and in the past Paul Verhoeven has done some good things (the director's cut of Robocop on DVD is great). However, this film is stupid and generally does not come close to explaining the point or technical aspect of the subject and instead settling for predictable action without any pleasure. In short, so many other reviews here say (wish I had read them before ...) - Stay away from this movie!
