Being the only movie I could see on this year's "Nordische Filmtage" at LÃ¼beck, this year's festival will be remembered as an all-time low for me. <br /> <br /> This movie, announced as an erotic thriller, is no more than a fun piece of shit! Excuse the language, but there are no decent words to describe it. <br /> <br /> First of all, the actors are not the best. But even better actors would not have saved the movie. Eg. the plot: after the first 15 minutes, it was quite clear that john was ill, neighbor girls were not right and that he killed his first girlfriend. The so-called "sex scene" was nothing but disgusting (hitting each other until the blood flows to me, has nothing to do with sexuality), but unfortunately it was not the only obnoxious images to appear. Everything else was copied by other directors such as Lynch, but of course without their brilliance. <br /> <br /> So to sum up the whole movie and to save other viewers time and money: guy loses girlfriend returns girlfriends back home, guy kills girlfriend and gets sour afterwards, guy imagines hot but crazy neighbor girls, guy has very disgusting sex with one of them (or he thinks), eventually he realizes he is crazy, and his girlfriend and her new lover are always in her apartment. A bad story, bad actors, pictures that make you throw up ... <br /> <br /> 1 in 10 (1 point for the fact that you realize how well you can understand Norwegian if you learned Swedish - at least an advantage for the evening - and you can't choose 0 points here).
