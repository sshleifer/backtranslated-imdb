This movie made me feel like I had missed some important scenes from the beginning. There were continuity errors and plots that stopped as abruptly as they started. I was very disappointed because I love Whoopi Goldberg & Danny Glover, in addition, there has always been confidence and respect for Danny Glover's taste in his choice of roles, such as "Grand Canyon". I just couldn't finish this movie for what seemed like an eternity, but was probably just over an hour; we had to turn it off. There was no comedy, there was nothing about the signs to make you empathize or sympathize with them. There was no induction of emotion about this movie, and clips from their past were poorly edited, confusing and unnecessary. What could have been a good idea for a movie, even as a drama and not a comedy (although I think a comedy in this situation would have been better because I love watching white people freak out and start acting like complete idiots, it makes me laugh) was wasting my $ 1 credit on the video store.
