The book on which this movie is based changed my life seriously. But to say this movie was a disappointment is an understatement. The play, director, filmography and storyline were all terrible. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I have told countless people about the book, but will now tell them everything they should definitely not see the movie! I do not expect the plot to follow the book exactly, but they have omitted too many key elements in the book. The film tried, but failed, to deliver a strong and inspiring message and only excluded the central theme of prophecy. While sitting in the position that hadn't read the book, I saw Celestine Prophecy as a bunch of hoax B.S. I am very disappointed with Redfield for the way this movie appeared.
