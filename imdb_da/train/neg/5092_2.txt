Shocking! <br /> <br /> In 1965 I saw Jury Gagarin alive. He was sincere, unpretentious and kind, he was calm and looked like a well-educated and intellectual person. In this movie I saw a clown! The actor resembles dummy with affected movements and imitation. They made a cartoon! The real Gagarin was another! Don't believe this movie! <br /> <br /> I watched this movie after the movies as "Taming of Fire" and "Apollo 13" and after reading books "Rockets and People" by Chertok and "Korolev: Myths and Facts" by Golovanov. I was shocked by the tiring scenario, malfunctioning and producing, and a lot of inexactitudes of "Space Race". <br /> <br /> The movie is the dull reproduction of known historical affairs in Russia. A lot of interesting known facts in the space projects were not proven. Some facts and details were perverted. For example, in 1945, Korolev was not already a prisoner (liberated in 1944), and in 1940 he was not already in the Kolyma prison pit but in a special prison design agency. Korolev was a designer in the prison design bureau and he was not buried by the dead prisoners. But in the film Korolev worked as a grave pitcher after 1940 (because the prison has shoulder straps on uniform). IMHO does not have the film authors any in-depth knowledge of this part of the story, and they cannot make interesting films.
