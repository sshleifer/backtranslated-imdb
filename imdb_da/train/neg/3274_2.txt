Once again, Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget and Thunderbirds, become a full-screen TV series and destroyed for all hundreds of people watching. Basically, the cousins ​​Luke (Johnny Knoxville) and Bo (Seann William Scott) in Hazzard County spend a lot of time driving very fast in "The General Lee". But they have to get their action together and stop their family farm being destroyed along with almost the entire city by ugly Jefferson Davis 'Boss' Hogg (Razzie nominated Burt Reynolds) to make room for a big coal mine. They get help along the way from their sexy cousin Daisy (Razzie nominated Jessica Simpson) and Uncle Jesse (Willie Nelson) while being chased by as many Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (Lost's M. Gainey) and police. Also starring Joe Don Baker as governor Jim Applewhite, Jack Polick as deputy Cletus Hogg, David Koechner as Cooter Davenport, Michael Weston as Deputy Enos Strate and Lynda Carter as Pauline. I think the only reason I give the movie an extra star is because of a few impressive car breaks, and of course Simpson's beautiful body (I admit that the legs are not quite Catherine Bach, but still!) But, besides that, it's pretty boring. It was nominated Razzies for worst picture, worst director for Jay Chandrasekhar, worst Remake or Sequel, worst screen saver for Simpson & her "Daisy Dukes" and worst manuscript. Very poor!
