While watching this movie, I came up with a script for a movie called "Making of 10 Items or Less": <br /> <br /> Manufacturer: I have good news and bad news. The good news is we can get Morgan Freeman! <br /> <br /> Writer: It's amazing! But what are the bad news? <br /> <br /> Manufacturer: We can only afford to hire him for one day. I'll probably get another one. <br /> <br /> So we hire him for a day. A movie is an hour and a half. A working day is eight hours long. I fail to see a problem. <br /> <br /> Manufacturer: But ... he'll have to spend time getting into character. <br /> <br /> So, we have him playing a character that is essentially himself. <br /> <br /> Manufacturer: But he still has to understand his motivation and all that. You're not saying we have him playing a big-name actor making a low-budget movie, are you? <br /> <br /> Writer: Why not? <br /> <br /> Manufacturer: That's ridiculous! But fine, at least we have Morgan Freeman in our movie. And I think we must also put the film in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Author: Of course. Manufacturer: This script is a lot of crap. We would rather make money on this. Just in case, Morgan Freeman's character trait has Wal-Mart or Target or one of those stores, so at least someone would like to sell the DVDs. <br /> <br /> Author: Sure Things! <br /> <br /> Manufacturer: Wait a minute ... What is it about a little bodega with a "ten or less" express lane? <br /> <br /> Writer: Oh, I think it's pretty strange. But we can't change the title now! <br /> <br /> I doubt my script actually has much similarity to reality, but it also did not "10 elements or less". This is a case of good acting, but poor writing, and I hate to see it happen. When you see an independent movie, you expect to try to convey some kind of message. I think they might have tried the tired old "Don't let anything hold you back" that has been killed in much better movies. In any case, with "10 items or less", the only message I got was "Look! Look at Morgan Freeman!"
