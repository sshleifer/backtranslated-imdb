This review may include some spoilers. <br /> <br /> The remake of the classic 1974 car film Gone in 60 Seconds begins well. In fact, it is well traded and the plot moves quite well. But even a large Hollywood budget does not change the fact that the original plot was more credible. For those who do not know, the original plot had the twenties as insurance inspectors. Who would suspect them. But even with a change to almost every aspect of H.B. Halicki's original, remake is a very good movie until we get to the last chase scene, the part of the 74 version that did well. The one in this version is the water down, only 10 minutes, and it culminates in a monster special effect that takes all credibility out of the hunt. Where the original hunt was very credible, the star was a stunt driver who made all of his own stunt, remake falls flat in the last 15 minutes. My advice if you want to see a classic car chase movie, fine the original in Copenhagen at your local rental link and get rid of the new remake.
