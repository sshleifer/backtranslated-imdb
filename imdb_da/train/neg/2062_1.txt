I read all the reviews here after watching this movie and it took me at least 2 pages to find out that someone else did not think that this horrible unfunny montage was not humorous in the 70s or indeed in any other era! If this is not the least fun set of sketch * comedy * I've ever seen, it will do so until it comes together. Half of the sketches had already been done (and infinitely better) by actions like Monty Python and Woody Allen ... If I were to say that a nice piece of animation lasting 90 seconds, the height of this movie is Still don't get close to summarizing where the mindless and drive-driven this 75-minute waste is. Seminal comedy? Only in the world how common does really mean semen. Scatological humor? Only in a world where scat is actually stool. Prior jokes? Only if we think this is a handbook on how NOT to do comedy. Breasts and pimples and the odd beaver. Nice ... if you're a pubescent boy with at least one hand free and haven't figured out that Playboy exists. Give it a break because it was the early 70s? No way. Sketch comedy had been back at least ten years earlier. The only way I could even forgive this movie, even though it was made, is if it was in danger. Retro? Almost. Sketches of clowns that are subtle perverted children can be groundbreaking in some circles (and it could actually have been fun), but it just comes out as really pretty sad. What kept me through 75 minutes? Believe that they might have saved a real fun shit at the end. I gave the movie a 1 because there was no lower score ... and I can only recommend it to insomniacs or coma patients ... or maybe people who suffer from lockjaw ... their jaws would finally fall open in disbelief.
