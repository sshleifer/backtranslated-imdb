I liked it, I really did. Don't think I'm an idiot, but I have to admit I enjoyed this movie. I was expecting to be a shed, it was scary, but sometimes it's good to relax and watch a crazy movie you don't have to concentrate on too much, isn't it? I didn't expect any hidden meanings or morales, and there was nothing but it didn't matter because I only saw it for entertainment, and it entertained me all the way. Movies like this are the reason why Ben Stillers (sorry "there's something about Mary") and Vince Vaughns (but you spell his last name, I couldn't be bothered by checking) have jobs. It's okay to watch a crap movie as long as you don't expect too much of it, and I for one must take a stand, jog, maybe run, but don't drive because I don't have a blockbuster video car, or even choice, and rent a bunch of these toilet humorous movies and stay for one night to watch them. Good day to you reader. P.s if you don't say this comment helped you, then I don't like you if you say it helped when God bless you, you will go to heaven.
