But Thomas Ian Griffith just doesn't have the Polish, which a great buck actor has given it was made 5+ years ago. Some of the humorous lines could have been timed to do this not only for action but comedy. And how do you get KC out of Katia Koslovska anyway? Plummer's character was so corny, he would have looked better in a bullwinkle toon. Personally, whose action flicks should show skin - I would have liked to have seen the time between woman / man, otherwise no one shows.
