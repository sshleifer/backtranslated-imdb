*** SPOILER ALERT *** <br /> <br /> I love Tim Roth, I really do, and he does his best with an incredible role. I can see how this is a movie that looks good like a script, but it is outdated, unlikely and ultimately stupid. I saw the fatal death ending one kilometer away. Rene Z. tries hard with a signed part, as does Patricia Arquette. The detective whose name I can't remember (the one who isn't Chris Penn) is a great sweat over the actor. Look, if you're not smart enough to distinguish between a movie so clever you can't follow it and so confusingly you can't understand it. See it if you like cheesy camera work that makes you seasick. See if you love to watch Tim Roth work with a cumbersome script. See it if it comes late in the evening for free. Otherwise rent the usual suspects.
