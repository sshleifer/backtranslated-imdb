I can't believe that those presenting this movie are not thinking of another movie. I was prepared for the possibility that this would be terrible, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a movie that is also meaningless. On the plus side, the general level of craftsmanship in the actors and technical crew is quite competent, but when you have a sauce ear to work with, you cannot make a silk bag. Ben G fans must stick to almost every other movie he has been in. Dorothy S fans must stick to the Galaxy. Peter B fans must stick to the last picture show and goal. Fans of cheap laughing at the expense of those who seem to ask for it must stick to Peter B.'s incredibly horrible book, Killing of the Unicorn.
