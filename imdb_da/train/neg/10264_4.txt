The leader of a common New York family, Jane Gail (like Mary Barton), works with her younger sister Ethel Grandin (like Loma Barton) at "Smyrner's Candy Store". After Grandin has been abducted by dealers in the buying and selling of women as prostitute slaves, Mrs Gail and her policeman boyfriend Matt Moore (like Larry Burke) must rescue the deeply-threatened young woman. <br /> <br /> "Soul Traffic" has a hard-to-support reputation - it is not remarkably well done, and it shows nothing quite unique about having a "virtue" of a youth threatened by sex dealers. Perhaps it can be supported as a film that treated the subject at a greater than usual length (claimed to have been ten wheels, originally). New York City Place scenes are the main attraction after all these years. The panning of the prisoners behind rods is memorable because nothing else seems to enable the cameras to move. <br /> <br /> **** Traffic in Souls (11/24/13) George Loane Tucker ~ Jane Gail, Matt Moore, Ethel Grandin
