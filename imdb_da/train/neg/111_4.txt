My interest in Dorothy Stratten made me buy this video. Although it had great actors / actresses, there were just too many sub-plates in the process of preserving interest. Plus it was just not that interesting. The dialogue was stiff and confusing, and the story just turned too much to be credible. I was pretty disappointed with what I think was one of Audrey Hepburn's last films. I will always love John Ritter best in slapstick. He was just too pathetic here.
