I had great hopes for this movie as it has Charlton Heston and Jack Palance. But these hopes came down to earth in the first 20 minutes or so. Palance was ridiculous. Not even Heston's play or Annabel Schofield's beauty (or short naked scenes) could save this movie. Some of the space effects were quite good, but others were cheesy. The reason was ridiculous. Even sci-fi fans should skip this one. Grad F
