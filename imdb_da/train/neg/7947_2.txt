When I watched this movie at FearNet, I thought it would be a scary movie. It didn't seem to be. I have no idea how this movie was allowed to appear on this site. FearNet is a site that shows scary horror movies. <br /> <br /> The act is wonderful from all the actors. I hated the story. The story was stupid. The movie starts with a man with a scroll with a signature stamped on it. He breaks the seal and some disasters happen. The water turns to blood, the oceans die out, the moon turns red, etc. <br /> <br /> The female character was also annoying. Many things she did not make sense. Like when she sees a piece of paper with a date on it. Coincidentally, it is the date she is expected to give birth to her baby, and she begins to confuse it and begins to examine it and ask religious people what it all means. <br /> <br /> * Spoiler Alert * <br /> <The two worst things that happened in this movie are the performance of a mentally retarded man who claimed that God told him to murder his parents and the end where Demi Moore dies after giving birth to her baby and transferring her soul to it. br /> <br /> Here's what happens. The mentally delayed person is shot and killed and the apocalypse begins. Demi Moore enters a hospital in the middle of a massive earthquake and feet his child. She touches her child's head and transfers her soul into the child and then dies. Then the apocalypse stops. <br /> <br /> Why does God suddenly have a change in heart? He becomes furious when the governor allows the execution of a mentally delayed man, then he acts all about forgiveness when a single woman transfers her soul into her baby? <br /> <br /> * End Spoiler * <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty stupid. It is another religious end of the world propaganda piece. The action by Demi Moore and Michael Biehn and everyone else is excellent. It's all about everything. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 2 stars out of 10. Good performance with a lot of nonsense!
