The movie should be shown here in Bangkok with all the fanfare and even in the theater, it failed miserably. <br /> <br /> Apparently, the story just doesn't hold the author's water. Something was absolutely missing. In my opinion, people must have a reason why they see it as nothing but historical glimpse of the past. The accuracy of the story is not what we are looking for entertainment. <br /> <br /> The movie just lacks some fabric. The only way to make this movie was to make some changes in some way, as a kind of legend rather than just a story. And a legend will have certain elements that try to tell you something that people have forgotten over time, such as. The significance of the sacrifice, nationalism, etc. It is called the central theme. <br /> <br /> The movie fails to answer, why would I see it anyway? In any case, some weird legendary flying elephants, psychic king or the eccentric king like the "King and I" would have been lovely, something would have added a lot to the film's appeal. I suppose there was no appeal other than an ordinary vanilla film. <br /> <br /> Once you've got the appeal, history is the next thing we focus on. In marketing terms, we call it "must see". After hearing the title of the film, people would say: Oh, I have to see it. Where's the appeal in Kingmaker? Why not just repeat the title and call it, "How is it NOT to be a king?" and make a black comedy from the ancient Siamese days to the style of "Dr. Strangelove". It would have been much more interesting. Narrative-like experiences of the king's sensitivity from first-person gone away would have made the movie extremely fun. <br /> <br /> Most movies today have the "must see" appeal, like Spiderman, Men X, these titles speak for themselves. If they do not have known signs, some other films like The Island themselves have appealed when the ad asks, "Do you still think there is an island?". <br /> <br /> Or for the movie that was resumed "How not to be a King", the question "Then will you still be a king?" <br /> <br /> Parhat
