In fact, this is a lie, Shrek 3-D was actually the first 3d animated movie. I bought it on DVD about 3 years ago. Hasn't Bug's Life also done so? I think it was at Disneyworld in that tree, so I say before going and using it as that logo. Shrek 3d was also a movement simulator at Universal Studios. They should still consider it a movie because it appeared in a "theater" and you could buy it for DVD. The movie was cute, at least the little flies were. I liked IQ. I agree with animaster, they did a god job of making a movie out of something that is just an out-and-back adventure. I recommend it to families and children.
