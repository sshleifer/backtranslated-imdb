I really didn't like this movie .... mainly because of the protagonists! They are both immature, selfish and self-centered people. They wounded everywhere around those who played their stupid games. The visual effects were good, but how good are they if there are no signs that you associate with or a story line that is interesting. Should I be happy when these two psycho-people finally execute their love for each other? <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I thought "This is supposed to be the # 1 smash from France?" ........ <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br /> <br /> About the end: GOOD RIDDANCE! They both deserve each other! <br /> <br />
