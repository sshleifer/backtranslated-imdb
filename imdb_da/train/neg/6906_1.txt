Not only does this movie have a bad plot, poor direction and terrible action, it opens up a whole new meaning to racism. In this movie, "white" chickens are sluts, "white" boys I'm just wondering what would happen if I made the exact same movie with exactly the same story line and script, only I made it about Caucasians. "He guy, it's good to finally see that you've stopped dancing the black chickens". No one seems to notice it, but watch this movie again and you will throw up on how they have portrayed the new Zealand "white boys". Suddenly, the white people are the main cause of gang aggression, and are choking off a quick bang. Only Samoan girls have a heart, there is no such thing as a non-slutty white girl. It frightens me that they could not make this film without giving the Caucasian community in New Zealand a repulsive profile. If you think I'm overgeneralizing, see this movie and see what you're doing about the "white boys". Just because the Samos choose to call us "white boys" in real life, that doesn't mean fun. If I said hi black boy, I would lose my teeth. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. Don't waste your money. Don't be racist.
