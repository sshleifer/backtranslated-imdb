In spite of some moments of heavy rain, a drunken meeting and an organ rifle with a gypsy and a monkey and a stay in a sanatorium, this rosette "Fatty" Arbuckle quiet comedy card with the support of Buster Keaton and Al St John is only fun, even though there is quite a funny sequence of moves in a row that flirts with Buster, which is ultimately in "meet cute" scenes, especially as it is one of the few times we see The Great Stone Face smile and laugh in the movies! Also, many scenes seem to have been the jump clip edited possibly due to excessive use of the movie store. Still, if you're an Arbuckle or Keaton completist, good night, nurse! is definitely worth a visit.
