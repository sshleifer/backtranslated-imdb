How unfortunate to have so many of my "a" list and good "b" list players agree to make this movie, but they did it and that was what sucked me into seeing it. I had never heard of this movie, but there was Cuba Gooding Jr. right on the DVD cover, and James Woods in the background, how bad can it be? In a word a lot! This movie starts etc. has some terms, then it just puts an egg. The end was so weak, it was as if the author was called away and his 4 year old son sat down at the typist and chopped out of the end. How ironic one for a movie titled "The End Game" to have such a bad one. These are the types of movies that can move "one" list actors to the "b" list at speed. I hope Cuba Gooding JR and James Woods are not doing this.
