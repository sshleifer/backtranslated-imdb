The last Tarzan movie with Johnny Weissmuller (looks surprisingly aged one year after "Tarzan and Huntress") is bad, despite all the trivia you can add to make it look better. It is obvious that RKO tried to make a big goodbye to Weissmuller, shooting in beautiful surroundings in Mexico, with a top star in that country (Andrea Palma) and several award-winning filmmaker Gabriel Figueroa and involving the prestigious composer Dimitri Tiomkin to score. While it may have cost less to record abroad, it seems to be more expensive than any other RKO film in the series that exploits Acapulco beaches and real pyramids such as Aquatania and with impressive decors for all stages of the temple by God Balu (especially the exterior, built on steep cliffs.) Kurt Neumann should have been as an instructor instead of Robert Florey, giving it very slow pace. Neumann had done a fine job with "Tarzan and the Amazon", "Tarzan and Leopard Woman" and "Tarzan and Huntressen" and completed his career in instructing the classic "The Fly" the year before his death; while Florey became the television director, after a career of few notable films. If Weissmuller looks tired, the chimpanzee playing Cheeta is not as good as the others, but the worst character is Benji, an unpleasant letterman singing horrible songs (having a Caribbean air in a place that should be Africa and shot in MÃ©xico!) Drilling and determined by questionable taste, it was a sad farewell to Weissmullers Tarzan.
