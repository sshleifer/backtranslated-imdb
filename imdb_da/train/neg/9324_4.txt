OK, I own this DVD, I got it new on Amazon ... I mean, I think it's badass and a beautiful, cool flick and melissa bale. The slutty / bitchy girl they get is hot as hell ..., the play sugar and the whole pole just sucking the clown are some great guy wearing a mask and its obnoxious but it's OK, I wouldn't recommend it if you wanted to rent a good entertaining flick after a hard day's work, but if you have nothing else to do and you obbsessed with those stupid movies as i am, watch it once and i dont know how artisan DVD has SICK in his DVD collection, sick is not good enough to be owned by a half decent movie company ok, that's all
