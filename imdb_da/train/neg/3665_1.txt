It is apparently what happens when a director allows his 14-year-old nephew to rewrite the dialogue on the set while he greets himself in the meantime; as I said earlier, although I have always wanted to catch one of Paul Naschy's werewolves, then this cruelty was my introduction, and as terrible as it certainly is, I will still pursue other items in the series, albeit very gradually. <br /> <br /> In spite of some high-profile disappointments like Joe Dantes' THE HOWLING (1981), I generally love werewolf pictures, but to be honest I quickly lost interest in this movie's "plot" and stood right there staring at my tv screen counts its absurdities as it was. There were far too many to mention them here, but I have to say two who beat me as particularly funny were the schizophrenic character of Werewolf persona (ie, going from a raging animal into a shot to a dazed, zombie-like state in the whole next - as if he is on a leisurely midnight tour of the country and sports a completely different wardrobe to start ... and yes I already knew the reasons for this) as well as "Phantom of the Opera" Appearance of the Wolfstein character! But what do I know maybe - perhaps the unpleasant full-length version of this mess might well have been a bona fide horror classic!
