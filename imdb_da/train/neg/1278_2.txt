Imagine a woman alone in a house of forty and five minutes where nothing is happening. Then it goes on twice more. The scripture is flat and lifeless, and the jokes unfunny, and the bad plays keep you from breaking any of the characters, even when beating wolf packs and being turned up by brotherhood goons. Anyone who ranked this movie higher than a two is not quite healthy.
