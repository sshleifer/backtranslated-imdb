For anyone who wants a remake of 1989's slaves in New York. What are you, seven of you? Here it is ... was. <br /> <br /> This undercooked movie has studiously vapid characters (Now they are club kids, you're great jerk!), there are in hold patterns. The big question seems to be how long can a young adult be young? It took three people to write this 'story'? Good god, it was easier to come up with Citizen Kane. Instead of returning viewers, this movie should just scare anyone who was a stage star in the early 90s. <br /> <br /> The idea that a fifty-year-old woman enjoys a bunch of self-absorbed children from another era is the world that only self-absorbed, twenty somethings could imagine. The odd sidebar about the library's work is not the part-plot expected from the corresponding Parker Posey's Breakin 2: Electric Bugaloo. Her "I'm serious about graduate school!" while a stripper laughs at her is hysterical. Posey's shtick is always entertaining, but there are projects below her. I slept before it crossed the 40-minute mark.
