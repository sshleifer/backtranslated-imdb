Some movies that you record for a pound turn out to be pretty good - 23rd century films released dozens of spooky Italian and American movies that were great, but even though Hardgore released some Fulci movies among others, the bulk of Their production crazy like The Zombie Chronicles. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it is not as near as annoying as Stink of Flesh. Apart from that, it is a very clumsy anthology film with the technical competence of a Lego house built of a whelk. <br /> <br /> It has been noticed elsewhere, but you really have to worry about a movie inserting previews of the Action into its credit sequence, so when it comes to the zombie attacks, you've already seen it all. Bad movie fans want a ball that looks at the 18,000 continuity errors and the diabolical play of the thrower (especially the hitchhiker who was so bad, he made me laugh a bit) and kudos to Hardgore to get into the spirit by dropping one press so bad it felt like I saw some beat up home video of a camping trip. <br /> <br /> Terrible, horrible things. We've all done things like this when we have tackled a camera, but common sense prevails and these movies slip into our creations somewhere. Avoid.
