At the end of this thriller, Ally Sheed's haughty last-day image is used creatively to pose more than a ghostly evil image. She convinces one that if a scary Bette Davis-type role should come to her, she could burn it brilliantly. Unfortunately, I can't find many other reasons to see this. If you've wondered what Sheedy looks like in a pair of old-fashioned glasses (but why should anyone?) So here's your answer. Incidentally, Sally Kirkland's sex-hungry crazy woman is very tiring, and although you like this kind of thing more than I do, you must admit that the excitement is bad during these scenes. Savage's drunken brute of an insurance agent is just as unpleasant, but at least it's a small role. Of the leading actors, Nicholas Walker does not inspire sympathy for Paul Keller's situation and his play is wood. Dara Tomanovich is better, and during her scenes with Sheedy the level rises slightly. Sheedy's meticulous, underestimated performance (although she often seems to be on auto pilot) is admirable in itself, but out of context with the rest. The sets are boring, the camera work seems undisturbed.
