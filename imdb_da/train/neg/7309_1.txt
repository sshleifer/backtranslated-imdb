I have rented and watched this movie for the first time on DVD without reading any reviews about it. So after 15 minutes of viewing, I noticed something wrong with this movie; It's terrible! I mean, in trailers, it looked scary and serious! I think Eli Roth (director) thought that if all the characters in this movie were stupid, the movie would be fun ... (So stupid, it's funny ... FALSE!) He had to see and learn from better horror comedies like: "Fright Night", "The Lost Boys" and "The Return of Living Dead"! It is fun! "Cabin Fever" is the reason why I signed up for www.IMDb.com so I can release my thoughts about dissatisfaction with it. <br /> <br /> I've decided to watch the movie again> AAARGH! <and make notes of my partial "review" to show how stupid the movie is. "Resident Evil" (horror) or "Dude, where's my car?" (comedy) I can see again and again and still enjoy! But this ...! <br /> <br /> How bad can a script and a director be ??? This bad. Here are the horrible scenes in chronological order: <br /> <br /> In the early stages we see Henry who is unaware that his dog is lying on the ground with his tongue hanging out of his mouth and the door glass is staring dead! <br /> <br /> The film doesn't explain anything about the blonde long-haired child who likes to bite people. <br /> <br /> And my answer to Marcy's unanswered questions ("What's wrong with the forest?") is "nothing". The scripture has the bearded guy who warns them about the forest just for "excitement". <br /> <br /> So the "smartest" of the 5 pack Bert, gives us almost an example of how to start a forest fire. He now meets infected Henry, who asks for help, and from here the movie wants to break the record using the "F-word". Bert starts freaking out because Henry looks terribly ill. Bert: "Don't let me shoot you!" (he forgets to add: "... with my BB gun!") Bert goes back to the lodge, but what about it? He meets Marcy and Jeff who had sex but now suddenly decide to go on a trip! Marcy wisely takes the unprotected campfire Bert had started earlier (A moment of clarity for a change?) Bert does not mention a word about Henry because the fool thinks he has killed him with his BB gun. <br /> <br /> Later, as the five Estupidos sit around their campfires, another villain shows up with his dog. (Maybe that's what the forest warning is about? It's full of weird ... and their dogs!?) They let him sit with them only because he has a large cannabis-filled bag. (Their brains are drunk! No wonder why they are so DUMB!) This is the last time we see this forgettable character ... alive! <br /> <br /> Henry shows up at their cabin, (NOTE: He was lying a few feet away from their cabin !!!) looks worse, almost like a zombie covered in goo! He says he needs a doctor. But young Einstein's refuse to help the poor sucker. He enters their unlocked truck, which of course also has the key in the ignition. Henry seems almost smart enough to drive the hell away from there, but instead begins to puff blood over the dashboard, seats and windows. The Fantastic Five comes out, armed with: a BB Gun, a knife, a baseball bat (* huh? Have you ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the forest ???), a poker and an (insecticide?) Sprayer, Ready to fight the single, unarmed and terribly ill man. (wise script!) Bert manages to kill the car with a single shot of his BB Gun, which is only possible in the mind of director Eli Roth. "What should I do?" Bert shouts in his defense. Jeff and Paul try to beat Henry down with their bats and poker, but miss and strengthen the truck's windows instead. Henry goes up to the stupid girls who say, "He's coming towards us!" (Thanks for info, stupid broads, I can see it! But I don't think he'll hurt you!) Marcy squirts and makes Henry yelp! And our "hero" Paul touches Henry's arm with a burning log from the campfire, which the inadvertently left burning while inside the cabin! (Where has all that wisdom gone? I think cannabis was beginning to take its way! :-) Henry turns into Human Torch and runs away and screams. next to a mechanic. And Marcy decides to "go for help" in herself in the woods that Paul keeps on Karen ... Doesn't that sound idiotic? Marcy could have stayed with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bert were already "on their way to help"! <br /> <br /> I skip my comments now on how we suddenly see Marcy in a canoe praising a huge and winding river! How did she get a canoe? Does she even know where she is going? In any case, she goes to the river bank and finds a very large and apparently abandoned cabin, and as in most horror films, he enters the cabin and says, "Hey, is there anyone there?" Bert suddenly pops up behind a piece of furniture and scares her (and at first). And then Jeff also comes. How did they get here? Did they swim over the river ?? Can you see how the brainless script is? <br /> <br /> Deputy Winston meets Paul in the cabin. He somehow doesn't notice the blood on their truck. This happens about 35 minutes of viewing, and I have decided to stop torturing myself longer and popping out the DVD. (Before I take my own eyes out! ... Now it's fun!) <br /> <br /> If you liked this movie, do yourself a favor and see "Fright Night", "The Lost Boys" or "The return of living dead". Then you will see that they are more entertaining than this ... thing. Even "Toxic Avenger Party 2", which is also a miserable movie, is far more fun than "Cabin Fever".
