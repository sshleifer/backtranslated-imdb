Never ever consider seeing this apologetic excuse for a movie. The way it is shot, lit, acted, etc. does not make sense. It's so bad it's hard to see. Many clips are repeated beyond boredom. There seems to be no 'normal' person throughout the movie, and the existence of the 'outside world' is good, it just doesn't exist. And why does the bald guy suddenly become invincible? This movie is beyond stupidity. zero.
