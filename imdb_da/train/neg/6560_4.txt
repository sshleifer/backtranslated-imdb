"Shadrach" was not my favorite type of movie. I found it too sentimental and the actor was under par. Harvey Keitel and Andie MacDowell were good, but some of the other actors were not credible at all. I also didn't think Paula's parents would go away and leave him with the Dabney family, especially since they had a housekeeper living in the home. Their social classes were too far apart to consider this credible. It seemed that Dabney's lifestyle was too exaggerated. There was a scene in the beginning of the movie that showed that Andie MacDowell got out of a car after having sex with someone. Who was it? Her son? What was the scene to show us? Why was the scene also included? It had nothing to do with the rest of the movie and was never actually referred to again. It seemed to be free and didn't fit into the story at all. There were too many inconsistencies in the movie for me. The story of Shadrach was nice, but I wasn't convinced that Dabneys would have been as kind and generous as they were portrayed.
