Bucks role as The Kahn brings in mind Bob Barker (of the price is right) runs a country the same way he runs his show. But there is much more to pour and sniff through in this turkey. Kurt Thomas as the baby-faced "hero" shows some significant acrobatic skills, but not a bit of acting talent at all. There are a few scary moments (in Crazies Village, for the most part), and some mildly impressive martial arts sequences. But any given "Ninja" movie will give you much more entertainment and you won't feel so guilty of laughing.
