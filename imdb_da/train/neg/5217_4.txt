Meet Peter Houseman, rock star genetic professor at Virgina University. When he is not ballin 'on the court, he blows his mind and releases panties in his classrooms lectures. Dr. Houseman works on a serum that will allow the body to constantly regenerate cells that allow humans to become immortal. I would also be immortal if I looked like Christian Bale and got the sweet female lovin that only VU can offer. A selection of old and ugly university professors does not care about the popular Houseman and cut off funds for his project due to lack of results. This causes Peter to use himself as guinea pigs for his serum. Much to my amazement there are side effects and he gets it, metamorphoses! Into something that is embedded in our genetic DNA that has been suppressed for "millions of years". He also has beds dr. Ms. Crushed Sally after a full day of knowing her. She has a son. His name is Tommy. He's an angry little boy. <br /> <br /> Metamorphosis is not a horrible movie, just a well-made movie. The whole time I saw this, I couldn't get past the fact that this was filmed in 1989. The film's appearance and feel is the late 70's. It doesn't help that it's packed with the 1970s movie, as Metamorphosis is part of the mill creek's 50 chilling classics entertainment. There is virtually no film quality difference at all. The last five minutes are pure bad cheese cheese, which actually, for me at least, stores the film from a lower rating. Pay attention to the terminology of the computer as "chromosomal anomaly". No wonder Peter's experiment failed. Your computer can't spell! This is worth looking at, followed by a trip to your local inn.
