Anurag Basu, who participated in the KUCCH TO HAI flop, made his debut in this movie <br /> <br /> The film was ahead of time in a way, even though it has a story that is no different and it came closest to HAWAS which released 1 week before and fortunately it was better and did a better business <br /> <br /> The movie starts well, Malika's fault is well shown at first, although the scene with Emraan-Malika is too raw / vulgar <br /> <br /> The scenes between Emraan and Malika are handled well, and twisted in the narrative, where Ashmith confronts Emraan, is brilliant. The pace is moving fast and the viewer is kept on the edge, but the other girlfriend tracks the emrane is not entirely convincing <br /> <br /> Also the polar path seems half-baked <br /> <br /> The final is too cinematic. > <br /> Direction of Anurag Basu is good Music is a winner, all songs were amazing Camera work was fantastic <br /> <br /> Emraan played his naughty streak very well, that was the role that gave him the star And although he continued to play such roles and got annoying in this movie, he was amazing Ashmith was also good in his role for once. He did a good job and one of his only good performances, and so well too, Malika was brilliant in her role esp in the second half, but her dial delivery was sometimes not up to the mark Unfortunately she rarely showed such potential in other movies Raj Jhutsi is okay
