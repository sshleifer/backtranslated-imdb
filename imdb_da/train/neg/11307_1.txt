The totally stupid weapon. I think the boys are dancing at the start of one of Steven Segal's films intended to mock Jeff to make his forms of dancing music at the start of this silly movie. The reason is predictable, the battles were fair and Jeff is about as well as the couch he beats with some kind of weapon in a scene.
