It only begins with a nice note to fall quickly and fail expectations. Macs (Akshay Kumar) and Sam's (John Abraham) characters are not properly built until the Mac's boss decides to hitch him with three hostesses. The rest of the drama is about how Mac, Sam and Uncle Mambo (Paresh Rawal) deal with situations that sometimes seem compulsory. <br /> <br /> About the cast, Paresh Rawal is a very talented actor I thought was wasted in the role of a moody cook. Akshay Kumar is tolerable, John Abraham is very poor, stumbles over furniture and Rajpal Yadav is the only saving grace in the movie. <br /> <br /> The other half of the movie is fun at times, but in all a DUD (songs are boring) and a big disappointment if you hope for a healthy entertainment and comedy.
