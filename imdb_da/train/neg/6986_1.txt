I can't find Al Pacino out. I see him in Godfather, Scarface, Carlito's Way, and I think I see one of the greatest actors in the last thirty years. Then I see him in Two for the money, any given Sunday and the revolution, and I wonder what the guy is thinking. <br /> <br /> I stumbled upon the revolution a few nights ago and thought I would invest the next two hours on this. Here's a news flash: Do you want to catch prisoners? Forcing them to see this over and over ... they will confess something. <br /> <br /> I don't want to rehash the plot as there is no coherent plot, but it does take place during the American Revolution and Pacino plays an uneducated farmer who doesn't want to get involved, but ultimately does it. Although he does not have money, no education and dress like a cave, a very hot Natasha Kinski falls in love with him for no apparent reason, as they only have two minutes of dialogue together. Frankly, if "Al Smith" star in this movie, instead of "Al Pacino," it would have ruined their career. The script was terrible, but Pacino's demotivated performance and obvious fake accent made it even worse. Donald Sutherland's role was ridiculous. I really can't describe it. Natasha Kinski is a protagonist, but has 5 lines in the film. In fact, no one speaks much in this movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most ridiculous assumptions in the film is how Al Pacino and Kinski have this eerie ability to continuously run into each other on the battlefield. Its like the whole Northeast is a Starbucks. "Hi fun to see you here again, on another battlefield 100 miles away ... see you in a few months." <br /> <br /> I am obliged to give this a star of IMDb as there is nothing here for a negative score.
