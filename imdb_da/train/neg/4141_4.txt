Well ... the movie was a fun watch. The main problem with this movie is that it goes against everything that most vampire myths adhere to. Like vampires who go in the sunlight. Although there are parts that just make you enjoy the way society does movies. A scene where a vampire gets stung and screams "Ow it hurts ... It's really stuck." Then it seems that there may be missing scenes, but you get used to it after a while. And there are random dream sequences' that really don't help with the plot. Come to think of it, nothing had real meaning, but I just got a bunch of friends and saw it twice to get the full effect. Come to think of it, battle scenes were aweful, and the zombies were just fun to watch. Slowly as I write more of this, I like this movie more. But you know, all in all, you can't expect Schindler's List, but it's a fun watch.
