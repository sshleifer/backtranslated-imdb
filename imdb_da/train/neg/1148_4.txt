Pedantic, overlong fabrication attempting to chronicle the birth of the Federal Bureau of Investigations. Beginning quite promisingly, with an ever-relevant probe for an airport explosion, but the melodrama with James Stewart and wife Vera Miles just get in the way (Miles had a habit of doubting living wives and her fringed nerves arrive here by schedule). The valued director Mervyn LeRoy killed this adaptation of Don Whitehead's book, but despite the talent involved, the picture fails much of an impression. Best performance is set by Murray Hamilton as Stewart's partner, but most of the dialogue is ridiculous, and the dog-shaped pacing makes the movie work twice as long as it is. * 1/2 from ****
