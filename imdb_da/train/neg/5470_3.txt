Tromaville High has become an amorphous wilderness, thanks to the aftermath of the neighboring nuclear power station's unintentional release of toxic waste. <br /> <br /> Unlimited chaos filled with absurd violence and gross behavior. Rather terribly, of course, intended to be, cluttering on a movie with the filmmakers cut loose the reins, so the outspoken cast-free rules it for him. The craft was by far down Troma's list of goals for this gory sleazefest. Honor the community are punks with spooky face painting jobs and wacky outfits. The German teacher who joins, through a "poisonous kiss", has the lines down on one side of her face that really gave me the cribs. However, the poisonous monster that sent the ANNOYING punks to the end is pretty cool. <br /> <br/> A kind of movie waste fisherman will embrace wholeheartedly.
