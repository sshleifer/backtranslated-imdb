This is the worst movie I've ever seen. The Avengers kept this dubious honor ?? but no longer. The action of "Jill the Ripper" is horrible and was only obscured by the plot. This film is as intellectually stimulating as the Tellenubes. It doesn't know if it will be an S&M flick or a really bad thriller. Just look under extreme poisoning or if you are bedtime and need a leather-covered distraction. This script should be reworked into a porn, it would not take much work and would have a longer durability. A porn, even a bad porn, would not hurt the injury of Dolf Lundgren's career as this film has.
