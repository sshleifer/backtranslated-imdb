A wonderful TV mini-series completely destroyed by a 45-year-old woman desperately trying to pass herself as a 16-year-old ingenuity! No exaggeration - it's the real age of the character played by Ali MacGraw when the film opens just before surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor. This TV mini series is really the most classic example of the title of this post and one that I refer to when the topic comes up. <br /> <br /> It alone makes it unmatched, despite being one of the best filmed worldwide worldwide dramas ever produced by television. If you have your stomach - or a decent fast forward ability - you might enjoy late Robert Mitchum in a very strong performance. <br /> <br /> I am stunned by some of the comments that refer to the love story (pun). Did they watch the movie with their eyes closed? Or are they aging boomers who never cease to amaze me with their "selective memories" and "selective vision". I'm a Boomer myself, so don't think for a second I'm a little hubris young punk. 45 will always see 45. Get used to it. Deal with it. Age gracefully damnit. <br/> <br /> Winds Of War could have been ... so good. How much more will we talk about this mini-series today, approx. Twenty-five years later, had an actual influence been cast into such an important and critical role? Right now, with the constant agitated old biddy distraction, it alone excludes most of the wonderful aspects of The Winds of War.
