Short summary: This movie dampens everyone it touches. That means you. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say I'm not a purist and it could have been fun for a few minutes. Imitations are not bad. But in general, it is just boring and scary not fun. A few simple jokes are repeated over and over again. Clearly, these movies exist only to squeeze the last few dollars out of the now trademarked Laurel and Hardy. Producers cannot take proper account of their place in film history or their talents. This is what offended me most. <br /> <br /> Of course, my daughter loved it so I'm also a parent error;)
