I was waiting for this movie to play with great anticipation. Provided it would be more accurately portrayed as the movie "The Christmas Box" based on the book by Richard Paul Evans. I sent many emails to friends and family and asked them to please this show and hoped they would better understand a small amount of my "new" life. After watching this movie I was so disappointed. As a mother who lost her only child in November 2003 and really knew the pain, I had hoped that this movie would shed light on parents who "think" they understand the grief a parent is going through who has lost a child . This movie was a very light hearted film, and Diane Keaton silliness was a blow to the face of parents who buried a child. It was very unrealistic from start to stop. I had a couple of calls after the movie every time it says the same thing: "It was so marked and it turned out that you are on the road in a short time and listening to songs on the radio and life is back." What a bunch of bulls! Clearly, the director and Keaton have never lost a child because it would not have made the film so marked. I think it's Hollywood.
