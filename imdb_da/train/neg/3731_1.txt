I was raised in a "very Christian" household since birth. I was rescued before I watched this movie and the rest of the series and was forced to see it in a youth group in my church. This movie was very disturbing. I saw it when I was about 12 years old and had literally nightmares about it for years. I used to wake up in bed and listen to the sound of my mother's footsteps upstairs. If I didn't hear her footsteps, I'd sneak upstairs to make sure she wasn't raptured. I used to pray so hard every night for salvation because I was afraid that Jesus forgave me. This is certainly not something I want to show to my children before they are much older, if at all. It took me years to shake the fear that this movie gave me.
