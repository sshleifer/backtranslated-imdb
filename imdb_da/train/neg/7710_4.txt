"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" mostly consists of wandering, poorly composed images after a movie. The reason makes no sense, and the various characters fall in and out of the picture without any explanation whatsoever. When you see this stupid spoof, you get the feeling, so many other comments have been taken so precisely: that it is easy to make a cheap low quality movie and then use the "parody" angle as an excuse for its fairness and low quality ( In A scene, female swimmers are afraid of tomatoes that float close to them, how far can "suspension of disbelief" go - even in a parody?). The title song is fantastic though. (* 1/2)
