You might say to yourself, "Don Johnson as Elvis? Can it work? Is it possible? It looks like a terrible choice for me, but maybe I should have an open mind. Maybe I'll be surprised. Maybe he might pull it off. "<br /> <br /> NOT! <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is not a bad actor. But he's a terrible Elvis. He's too short, too weak a voice, too sharply highlighted ... Well you've already imagined how bad he would be. Add to it a hokey black wig and gloves eyelashes and mascara, and it is a great fat embarrassing mess. The best thing I can say is that since Johnson's play is decent, and since his imitation is so far away, after a while, you don't even think of him as Elvis anymore. You see him as another crazy pop star instead. So at this level the film becomes visible. <br /> <br /> Also, Stephanie Zimbalist is not ideally cast as the tall, beauty queen, Linda Thompson. But she is attractive in herself and plays the part with honesty, elegance and intelligence we have expected from all his roles. There may be too much intelligence in her performance. You have to be able to hold onto a dope that abuses dope. There is nothing new in this story; We have heard it many times before. If you are looking for new info or insight, you will not find it. It is told as a love story - an unjustified: Linda for Elvis and Elvis for drugs.
