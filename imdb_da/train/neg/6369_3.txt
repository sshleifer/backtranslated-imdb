The only reason I rented this was because of the article in Fangoria Magazine. The article made this movie look interesting. Well, it's not. This was a very boring, amateurishly written and directed movie. All the actors in this movie are horrible, except Faye Dunaway, who is always a joy to see. But too much time was focused on Gina Phillips and her ridiculous encounters with the ravens and Duilio Marzio. Marzio has such a thick Argentine accent, you can only understand every few words he says. Also on hand is Nicholas Pauls, who plays the ultimate love interest for Gina Phillips. Bottom line: This movie is not scary. There is only one good scene, and it's the last five to ten minutes of the movie. I would have given one star, but I gave it three just because I like Faye Dunaway so much. But herself was not that big in this.
