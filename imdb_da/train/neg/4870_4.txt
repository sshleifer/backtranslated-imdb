The movie is bad. Nothing special - just a "kid" movie without serious stuff in it. However, there is a reason to look at this: the animal count. Some of them are so funny in what they say you just can't stop laughing. So if you want to hear a dog in the dogsled saying "I am Keyser Soze" or another animal that says "You're a dead cat going" or many other fun lines then watch it. Because there is no other good movie to see. Vote: 4 out of 10.
