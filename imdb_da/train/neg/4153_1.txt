I really have no idea how to comment on this movie. The special effects were defective, the play was terrible, and if there was a plot for it all, it was on the back of the box. I don't think I can remember that a movie is so bad for a long time, and I'm a big fan of lesbian sex and boobies !! ;) Even it couldn't save this movie from being just a terrible excuse to pay someone to stand (or put in this case) in front of a camera. I was pretty much let down by the overall "zombie" effect. Since apparently in this movie, zombies are so common to drive over a couple here and there and unfortunately talk about it at a gas station (one with an internal windshield repair but no interior bathroom), the zombie movie genre isn't even a factor to end. Still, a como with a dozen zombies ripping from a girl's clothing does not really make a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> On the vampires: Apparently all the zombies are male and all the vampires are female, which is ok to me. I'm not sure how vampires are out in the daylight or why / how a soldier vampire came to stand in the middle of the road and still keep his gun with a rod through his heart, just waiting for the queen of the vampires to change it all through the road. The last segment of the old nunneri made no sense and when a hot lesbian vampire asks the other hot lesbian vampire "Do you think we did the right thing?" By killing the two apparently heroes in the movie, it's about putting it over the top. <br /> <br /> The play and special effects were also on low times as well. You could almost see the snakes that the fake blood was pumped out during the proximity of the zombies, which was skipped by the general. Talking about the general, where did they find this Kenny Rogers look-alike anyway? No idea what he was General for, except generally confusing and misplaced. <br /> <br /> All in all, watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have the strong urge to waste $ 3. Just min $ 0.02.
