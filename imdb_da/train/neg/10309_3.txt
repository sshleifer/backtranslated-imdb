"CIA Codename: Alexa" is an absolutely horrible rip off of Luc Besson's classic film "La Femme Nikita" (1990). The film is basically about a woman taken in and trained by the CIA and forced to make a secret mission for them. (Exactly the same story structure of La Femme Nikita) The working combo of Lorenzo Lamas and O.J. Simpson is perhaps the worst in movie history. Lama's "acting" is simply a bad Steven Segal imitation. Watching the Orenthal act in this movie is a monstrous experience. <br /> <br /> Writing and acting is so bad in this movie at times it's ridiculous. There are so many action films "conventions" in the movie, it's ridiculous: unnecessary car explosions, people flying through glass windows, terrorists, bad ponytails, etc. The musical score is similar to David Michael Frank's "Hard to Kill" score (1990) that promotes the Steven Segal theme of this movie. There is a lot of martial arts in the movie, and it's pretty well done for a low budget US production. The thoughtless act and the supreme play never ceases, and I must admit that I was mildly entertained. <br /> <br /> Lorenzo Lamas had the appearance of an action star back in the early 90s, but he is certainly no action star, so he is acting soap operas and not action blocks. My recommendation is that you skip "CIA Codename: Alexa" and check out "La Femme Nikita" instead.
