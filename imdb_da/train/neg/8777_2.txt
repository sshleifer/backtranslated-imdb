Okay, I struggled to set aside the fact that in selling EVP as genuine, the movie was basically lying to me from the get-go. I justified the hell, I don't believe in vampires, but I still liked Dracula so I could live with this. But even with the accepted, the film is just not very good. It is competitively made and acted, but not at all at all. There are several "jump" moments and I just looked at them and thought "yes, I didn't expect that" without actually jumping at least. <br /> <br /> The resolution also doesn't make sense. If the power behind this is capable of doing the things it seems to be, why does hell need a proxy? Finally, the final text was absurd. Of course, they put that as part of "giving the film credibility by claiming it's all right" thing, but to work it really has to be in the beginning. But they can't put it in the beginning, because then they give away the plot ... stick it in at the end, it just got out like a sore thumb.
