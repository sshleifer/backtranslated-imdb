A meteor hit Crater Lake (hence our title), waking up a Plesiosaur who continues to snack on the hick population (in California, who hacked the capital of the world.) <br /> <br /> There are bad movies and so are there "The Crater Lake Monster" which somehow managed to escape the MST3K. With lattice action, a decent stop-motion beast and more, this is a terrible piece of 1970's low budget utilization / monster movie drink. While the film is guilty of many crimes, the biggest one is Arnie and Mitch, two unpleasant rednecks that serve as our comic relief. They murmur, struggle to store "banjo music", ankle women, and act as pathetic excuses for humanity. The characters are so bad they should count as a crime against humanity.
