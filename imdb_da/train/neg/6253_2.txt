Not a very good movie, but according to info, it is quite accurate to portray torture techniques. The purpose of the film was to show the brutality of the NK POW camps, and it has been done effectively enough, with surprising frankness for the time being. Whatever technical flaws there are (and there are plenty) of seeing this, you'll see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some pretty ugly things - again, uncomfortable because it's being done north of DMZ and not in Guantanamo Bay. <Br /> <br /> I don't think any of the Korean veterans traveled their torture when they drove to the office and if you watch the movies like this and Pork Chop Hill compared to the Vietnam movies. I don't know if it was the people of '54 who were captured in World War II concepts (boys tend to erase a lot) or war or whatever, but it is interesting to see it from the same system as 16 years Later would be to make movies like "Go Tell the Spartans".
