** SPOILERS *** Slowly as a molasses mummy film involving this confusion in the Kingdom of Egypt to be interrupted to keep the indigenous people, who at that time revolt against British rule, from finding out. <br /> <br /> Given the task of coming to this archaeological grave of his superior British storm storm Mark Dana along with a couple of British soldiers and Mrs. Sylvia Quentin, Diane Brewster, the head wife of husband on the tomb Robert Quentin, George N. Neise , make their way to the excavated mother's grave. Along the way Capt. Storm Sylvia and his men into this desert-like princess Simira, Ziva Rodann. <br /> <br /> Simira seems to be superhuman in her ability to withstand the reigns of desert life, she doesn't drink water or get tired, but also knows what Capt. Storm & Co. seek and warn him and his group to remain as far away from the grave as possible to Pharaoh's Ra Ha Tet tomb. <br /> <On Ra Ha Tea's tomb Robert Quentin and his crew of archaeologist, along with his Egyptian guide Simira brother Numar, Alvaro Guillot, has already opened his tomb before Capt. Storm can come there to stop them. Quentin violated Ra Ha Tet's body by having Dr. Farrady, Guy Prescott, cut his bandages. This act on Roberts and Dr. Farro's part has Numar's weak death in his tracks. It later turns out that Numar was somehow obsessed with Ra Ha Tea's spirit or soul who took over his body and made him 500 years per hour to become a 3,000-year-old mummy. <br /> <br /> The movie Numar has dressed in what looks like a pair of pajamas slimming around the grave of Ra Ha Tea and its surroundings are attacking and sucking out the blood to survive, like a vampire, of any man or animal that he comes in contact with. This blood-sucking adventure at Numar, where he later loses his right arm, continues for a while, until the scary Quentin so far tries to find the entrance, you actually thought he already found it, until the grave of Ra Ha Tets himself is killed an indoor rock slide. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, we learn that Numar, for absolutely no surprise, is actually Ra Ha Tet reincarnated to another, some 3,000 years later, person or life. Numar's sister, the mysterious and sexy Simira, is not only the sister of Ra Ha Tea, since he and Numar are truly the same person, but also the Egyptian cat goddess Babesti! Also not so hard to find out. <br /> <br /> With Numar / Ra Ha Tet back in his grave and all the deaths, because of Pharaoh's curse, now at the end Capt. Storm Sylvia and what's left of his men and the late Robert Quentin's archaeological expedition retreat to Cairo and modern, this in 1902, civilization. Pharaoh's survivor Ra Ha Tet Curse retains what they found and excavated only for themselves, since no one believed them anyway.
