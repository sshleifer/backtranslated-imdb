A trio of low-living criminals, led by Matt Dillon, smuggles a Sennat burglar. They fly, but quickly cross paths with the police, who are just fighting for a terrorist. Of course, the police fail the burglar singer, the real terrorist comes away, and the burglars have to take refuge in a small dive in a hostage bar, ignoring why the police intend to catch them. And guess who else has chosen the bar as a sanctuary for the night? <br /> <br /> Incredible? Absolutely. And it goes down the hill from there. Spacey got a good bit of acting talent; Matt Dillon, Faye Dunaway, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen and M. Emmett Walsh, but they are all wasted. Mostly because all the characters are stuck in the bar, all they do for the rest of the movie is argued. Infinite and aimless. Long before the end of the movie you have stopped wondering what happens to them.
