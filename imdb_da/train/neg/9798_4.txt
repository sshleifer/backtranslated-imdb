15 years ago, Power Rangers was one of the shows that swept the nations, especially the youth. When I was a 3 year old child living in the Philippines, I would see this show every Friday on ABS-CBN (Channel 2 over there). When the movie came out in 1995, it was too shocking and awe to me when I saw it with my father and 2 uncles. My grandparents even sent me a "Balikbayan" box full of Power Rangers stuff (including the easy to build Megazord figure and the tense rangers of Rangers). I even played video games and just loved one of them ("MMPR: Fighting Edition"), which was really sad. Still, it was the show that took a step on my interest in robot series (especially anime mech series like "Gundam") Now that I'm 18, I would like to think that this show is pretty cheesy to me now. To prove this, I took a trip down the memory path by buying a 2-set DVD collection with "MMPR: The Movie" and "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie" and watching them both. I was like, "Uh, how terrible. Just another counter on the ceiling for me." For all of you in my generation, this is NOT a show that you would like to see again and again. I'm not saying to leave it for the rest of your life, but in the meantime it's not a bad thing, is it? Instead of "Power Rangers" I would recommend something like "Mobile Fighter G Gundam" ("HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"), "Ninja Senshi Tobikage" (aka Ninja Robots) or even ORIGINAL Sentai shows that were the basis of Power Rangers.
