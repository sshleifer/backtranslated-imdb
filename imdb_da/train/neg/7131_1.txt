I like bad movies. I like to rent bad movies with my friends and tear them for their duration. Then there are horrible movies like this. Not only is Redline a bad movie, but a narrative sign that perhaps the American film industry should look forward to the viewer, at least proofreading scripts before financing a movie. <br /> <br /> If a stereotype took a crap, this movie would spawn from it. The story is unbearable and the actor around is ridiculous. Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin may have the worst screen chemistry I've seen for quite some time, and even they should be isolated from humanity and hit with a bag of oranges until they change their profession to street vendors (about the only thing they can legitimately qualify to). Moreover, how Angus Macfadyen was convinced to make this movie is so far beyond me that I can't even think of an analogy. I am a loyal fan of his, but it has made me ask him. <br /> <br /> To sum it up. More people will avenge for various reasons (and if you worry enough to know what they are, you are a bigger person than me), so much that it turns into violence (I guess). The movie is like Ouroboros, the snake that swallows its own tail, being an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue that does not fit human ears. This movie is essentially a big car commercial in the first half and an inexplicable action movie for the rest, it should be avoided at all costs. I want me to find a positive aspect for this movie, and I think it's in the end that the credits roll. <br /> <br /> PS Nadia Bjorlin, if it were you singing the two songs in this movie, then you are a hack and I hope the elders rage you. <br /> <br /> P.S.S. If you rent this movie looking for a ridiculous experience, listen for the lyrics of Nadia Bjorlin's amazing songs.
