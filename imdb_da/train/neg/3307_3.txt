My comments may be a bit of a spoiler for what it is worth. Stop now if you don't care. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace should have been titled "A paper-thin excuse for old British women to get high on the screen." This movie is stupid. The random music is an annoyance, just like the obvious, hackneyed melodies that occasionally pop up to comment on the story ("Spirit in the Sky", for example - Oh, I understand it!) This is basically a Cheech and Chong movie done trustworthy by its stodgy English attitude and Brenda Blethyn's overwhelming power to inflict feelings on an audience using her voice alone. I could literally hear the folks over at the High Times magazine receiving their jollies over the huge "buds" that collide this image. Worst scene? Easy. Brenda tries to peddle her illegal goods on London's street in a blaring white dress suit. Not funny. Not original. Not interesting. Not a good movie. The 7.2 rating is the result of violent abuse. Do not waste your time ...
