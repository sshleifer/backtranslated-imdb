William Lustig's follow-up to "Maniac" clearly shows that without Tom Savini's spectacular effects and Spinell's convincing performance, "Maniac" would never have become the cult strike it did. "Vigilante" is badly targeted, with a simple mind-boggling script spelling out for you and predictable at every turn, and also mediocre notions by all actors. Judging from the feeling of "deja vu" this movie gave me, Lustig had seen "Death's Desire" several times for many before you did this! (* 1/2)
