Its spelled S-L-A-S-H-E-R-S. I was happy when the protagonist flashed his breasts. It was pretty tight. Before and after the movie blows pretty much. The play is like an E-list, and it appears well in the movie. Not to mention it is so low budget that Preacherman and chainsaw Charlie are played by the same person. The whole movie looks like it was shot with a camcorder instead of halfway decent movie. The only other reason I liked the movie was because chainsaw Charlie and Doctor Ripper were fun. They said many stupid things that made me laugh. Apart from that, if you watch this movie at Blockbuster, everyone hides a favor behind Lawnmowerman 2. Anyone who thinks this movie is good should be judged mentally.
