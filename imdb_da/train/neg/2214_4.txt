This movie wasn't terribly horrible, but it was pretty bad. The action was actually pretty good! jeffrey combs did a good darn good job as the mad scientist, which is kind of his specialty if you don't know such things: D. Bill forsythe .. Well, I'm not quite sure why he was in this movie. He's too good at this kind of thing, and his role wasn't exactly demanding. I rented this on the strength of these two leaders and I was not really disappointed. I mean heck, it's a half-man / half shark movie. It's not Shakespeare people. Apart from the plot, which is full of holes and the poor dialogue, I would like to note that the cinematography also left many things to be desired. There were shots where they tried to look "cool," but it ended up dampening the scene or just getting out of the ordinary cheezy. they also blew it many times as they had a decent dialogue and cut away early before the person could deliver the line himself. It was pretty bad. But if you are a jeffrey cam fan, this is worth checking out. he gives a good performance and does what he can with the character. forsythe is not bad either, nor is women's management. heck if i can remember her name herself. bottom line, I would not otherwise waste your time.
