Autobiography of the founder of the zoo in NYC starts by being very sweet and would be a great family movie if it stayed there. But we are becoming more and more involved in reality, as gorilla grows up to be a wild thing that cannot easily withstand his "mother's" desires - it can frighten younger children, especially. scenes where Buddy tries to hurt Gertrude. fairly quick resolution at the end. below average.
