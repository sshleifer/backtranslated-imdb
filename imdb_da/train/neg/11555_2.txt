A great slasher movie - too bad it was the producers and not part of the script. Basically succinct summary - Man with red-haired fetish goes inviting such women to his apartment only to go into some kind of freakish coma and continue to postpone them to different degrees of success. Only the cutting herd behind the scenes must have thought that the movie was like an ad that I did and cut the heel out of the movie. Nothing feels you are lost on what redhead he is with at that time (didn't he have the previous one?), And most of the time it looks like the cameraman went out and resumed the movie when he woke up. Not that I can blame him, I went 2-3 times and had to rewind and resume trying to recover the little plot that exists. Warning When You See The End DO NOT attempt to connect it to anything that happens before - you just get an aneurysm. Not worth the time, effort or God forbid money. Only reason to get a 2 instead of a 1 - the small chance that the hacking occurred between movie release and the horrible version I was watching.
