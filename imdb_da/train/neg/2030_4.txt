The commentary of "eliz7212-1" hits the proverbial "nails upside down" for this turkey by a program. But it is a hoot to see William Shatner's "cavort" and "dance" (yes, the "" marks on the word dance are necessary for what Bill does). This show would be a good shit on SNL or MAD TV - and it considers a few stars for a show or so to see Shatner, who seems to have taken "camp" to new heights - either in a role or as himself. But the guy is fun. <br /> <br /> The girls in the cabin dwellings with the game data roll, are pretty much unlucky when this turkey is canceled - unless there is a revival of whiskey-a-go-go genre with a revived demand for successful young women dancing in raised cages again. <br /> <br /> I saw the first participant, who was annoying and literally "stupid than a: post", yet through great luck, walked away by a quarter mile or so. The other participant, a little more intelligent, but who is fortunate enough to get $ 1,000 on Jeopardy !, sank at the card that requires answering a particular question - which he didn't know and thus remained with zilch. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, this abundance of games that dangle and sometimes assign big sums to everyday life is a cheap effort to try to look at the viewers. Although the host is well compensated and they give away six characters in an average episode, I suppose the revenue versus cost may be beneficial - since you do not have a sitcom cast, where more stars receive six or seven characters, per episode, with some great remaining deals too. <br /> <br /> But I suppose even the better ones will wear thin before long. This has already largely reached this point. I think his offerings, especially with James Spader and the others on "Boston Legal", should give us a satisfactory amount of Bill Shatner's offer. Again, the above rating is simply expedient to see Bill hoot and prance, perhaps once; It should be sufficient.
