I didn't really enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I saw it in a camp and we didn't rave over what we laughed at. It is certain that some parts are touching, but the play is terrible, the effects are terrible, and the whole of the overall film idea is horrible (now I know it was based on a book I didn't read, but I hope the book was better than this, for honestly I thought this movie was very bad and boring. As I said, I went to it with a bunch of people from a camp, and we were happy to be there, plus I got a caffeinated drink, yet I struggled to keep myself awake. The only thing that kept me up (except for my fear of being embarrassed when I woke up) was the shot, it was also totally unnoticed. I just didn't like it.
