Well, the writing was very sloppy, the director was slack, and editing made it worse (at least I hope it was editing). The action was not bad, but it was not so good either. Virtually none of the characters were sympathetic. at least 45 minutes of that movie was wasted time and the second hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential. It was a good idea, but another wasted good idea is over. It could have been completed 3 different places, but it just continued to go to a presumably predictable Hollywood finish. And what wasn't predictable was done so badly that it didn't matter. the end was not worth seeing at all. Sandy bullock was out of her element and should stay away from these types of movies. The movie also looked rushed. The movie was just not really worth watching, and if I had paid for it, I would have been very angry. maybe I was more disappointed because I expected a really good movie and got a bad one. The movie over all wasn't terribly bad, but I wouldn't reccomend it. I gave it 2 out of 10 b / c I liked the idea so much and I liked a sign (Justin I think, the super smart). and it also had some very cheap ways to cover plot holes. It was like trying to cover a volcano with cheap masking tape, it wasn't beautiful. Anyway, if you see it, wait for $ 1.50 theater or video unless you like just about every movie you see, then I think you'll like it.
