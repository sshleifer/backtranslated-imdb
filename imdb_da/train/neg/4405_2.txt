All I can say is before I saw the movie, I didn't have a clue as to who Annemarie Schwarzenbach was, or what was her life story .. and I have to admit that the movie was hardly helpful in reaching that data .. and even it was not successful persuading me to do anything by writing some words on the google website; But all I can say is that actress Jeanette Hain was great with her dumb facial expression, she played really well and showed a mental state of depression as it is in reality. After all, based on the script the movie happened in Turkey and Tehran as well as Afghanistan .. but believe me, I am familiar with the area, it was about an Arab desert in Morocco. Turkish people and Persian people are completely different in face and culture as well as in a non-Arabic language. I suppose a movie like this documentary-type must be made a thorough examination of whether all these minor elements are mandatory.
