Such a long-awaited film. But it has disappointed me and my friends who had gone to see the movie on the first day. From trailers it looked like an action movie, but it turned out to be an out and about comedy (a bad comedy). But one thing that deserves understanding is to act by these professional actors, they have done their part of the movie very well. Good play, but I don't think it can save the movie. India has been shot beautifully. Kerala, Rajasthan, (Ladakh?) Were all saturated with color, okay. Still, the way in which these inner beauty of these places were shot made me find out where they were and when I could go there ;-) Sequences were shot very rarely, no one could make out the stumps, they have used Akki (akshay kumar) very well, but it could have been done much much better. <br /> <br /> Animation is the worst I have seen in recent movies (90s movies had better animation scenes I assume (first scene where the car falls off 'flying must be better word' way into the lake). <br /> And the movie name has been mentioned almost every 20 to 30 minutes just to make sure the audience doesn't forget the file name I guess ..
