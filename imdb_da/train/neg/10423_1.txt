so ... it's really sexist and classic, and I thought it might not be at the beginning of the movie, as when Stella tells Steven she really wants to change and start talking the right way and he doesn't tell her to change. Well, he certainly changed his tune, and it seems that the other reviewers followed. What initially seems to be a love story is really about social placement and women who sacrifice mothers. The end of the movie doesn't make her a hero, it makes it all sad. And it is boring that people think it makes her a hero. Maybe it's the movie movie that people have to take away. positive reception continually reflects patriarchal flows in the social conscience. yuck.
