I watched this movie after seeing other comments on IMDb, even convinced my wife that it was a "unique horror movie." I wanted to like this movie but was unable to. <br /> <br /> The "love story" was good, but the horror aspect was pretty bad. If the story was about a young man who fell in love with a girl suffering from parasomni, it would have been a better movie. The care center stretched well across the borders, in fact it was quite ridiculous. The doctor ignores the privacy and professional protection laws. A nurse enters a room for routine feeding of a dangerous patient (without a companion), and drops the tray and runs out of the room, screaming without apparent reason. The forensic patient (and the movie's villain) is tied up in standing position fully dressed - apparently for years? None of it makes much sense. <br /> <br /> The movie even had some actors I've seen in other things, like the detectives, but I still can't recommend this movie.
