It's just Robert De Niro's movie that I really hate. It's silly movie with horrible plays (of course not De Niro). For me, Brian De Palma must make his mafia movies as always as Scarface (1983) or The Untouchables (1987). I also loved De Palma's mission: Impossible (1996). De Niro worked with Palma also two different times, Greetings and Wedding Party. I though The Wedding Party was also ok (I didn't look at greetings). Manuscript is really bad and unfunny. There is no scene where I can smile again. Movies lost a chance to be a fun style even a bit in a "Be Black Baby" scene and also I don't like the scene where a guy's sexual organ appeared. So it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen! just the worst. I hate it.
