If you're the kind of movie-maker who enjoys original content and intelligent excitement ... then look elsewhere, kids, because Sleepwalkers really suck. Usually I am more eloquent than that, but ... wow ... that was bad. I especially love it when Charles offers Tanya a trip home, she buys, and then he sees WALKING HOME. Where's his car? Anyway, just don't see it, people. I really want to be more specific, but words escape me. Cats jump on people. A guy gets stung by corn. Cheesy lines up the wordy "wazoo". Just don't see it. Wait, I'll take it back! See it for author Stephen King's cameo as the guy who owns the cemetery. He is actually pretty good. Even with guest shows from Mark Hamill and Ron Perlman, King gives the best movie performance. But other than that ... wow ... BAD.
