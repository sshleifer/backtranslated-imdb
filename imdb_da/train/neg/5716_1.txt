This movie is not deserving the next few minutes I will use to criticize it, but I know many people, like myself, rely on IMDb.com to help decide movies. For that reason alone I write this. "Live Feed" is like an Asian version of 1976's "The Incredible Torture Show" (also called "Blood Sucking Freaks") http://www.imdb .com / title / tt0077247 /. Torture, dismemberment, murder, cannibalism ... surely, it's all together with a third-class script, pathetic action and a perverted failure in an attempt at black comedy. <br /> <br /> The movie takes place in China, but everyone speaks English. There is an abundance of girls in the movie, horrified by the girls' slaughterhouse in a marketplace, but are sexually excited about entering a porn business. A gal who is disgusted by the dirt in a toilet stalls moments later, is still having with his girlfriend's boyfriend (how he himself came in who could be the only engaging thing about this whole movie). even for a B movie. Even if you were to download it for free, it would be an insult to your hard drive.
