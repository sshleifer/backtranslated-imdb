"The Deadly Look of Love" is essentially "Fatal Attraction" with a few phrases added to the back half. The end will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three movies a week. It's another warning to give in to the temptation, and it doesn't add anything new to the genre. <br /> <br /> Brett (Vincent Spano) is engaged to a beautiful woman who just happens to have a substantial trust fund. Although he has it all, he risks losing everything by starting a steaming side affair with Janet (Jordan Ladd). Janet, a shiny blonde from Cedar Falls, goes hard for Brett and she doesn't take it very well when he comes clean about his commitment. Shortly after the wedding, Mrs. Brett becomes dead in the bedroom of the large luxurious home she shared with her new husband. When the police ask Brett, he immediately points his finger to Janet. After her arrest, Janet seems to be more legal at the moment - not that she was the image of stability before. Her defense lawyer (Holland Taylor) is convinced that Janet is innocent and is hell bent on proving it. <br /> <br /> Did she do it or didn't she? How will it end? You can find the answers to these questions next time "The Deadly Look of Love" flies at your local station. And don't miss out on morally this beautiful story: men are pigs and women are crazy.
