It was supposed to be a parody of the LOTR Trilogy. But it was one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen. Bad play, bad manuscript, bad everything. THIS IS MY STAFF OPINION. I have no doubt in a matter of seconds that there are people who like this humorous feeling, but there have been better parodies of movies from renowned directors such as Mel Brooks or Zucker Brothers. I work in a cinema and in the DVD Shop, and the success of this movie was similar in both areas: In the cinema it was a good (but not great) success during the first two weeks, but then the reviews of those who have seen It was not too good, the film dropped very quickly. In DVD sales, it was good for a short time, but no one asked for it anymore. For the past ten years, the two worst movies I've seen are The Ring Thing and Torque. I can't decide which one was worse, but I'm glad there are so many good movies, so I don't have to think too much about this issue.
