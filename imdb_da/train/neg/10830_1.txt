1999 will go down in history as the year the film critic leads the public wildly. First they sent us to EYES WIDE SHUT. Then they hailed BLUE WITCH PROJECT and now MAGNOLIA, which is by far the worst movie of the year. What is it about? Who knows. Its full of complacency and filled with bad acting. I like to stay and see the credits, but since this thing was over, I couldn't get out of the cinema fast enough. Most of the audience who participated in the show I was on felt pretty much the same. Dates were argued with each other as well as strangers. It's a nasty and hateful movie that makes you feel ugly and hateful.
