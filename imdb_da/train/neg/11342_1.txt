I should explain why I gave this ... "artwork" 1 star rating out of possible 10. Simply because it is difficult or almost impossible to judge it impartially. Probably it would have been the same if I had given it 10/10 - explanations would nevertheless have followed. <br /> <br /> I'm not fond of these pointless goraf movies like HOSTEL or so - I think it's disgusting and beautifully horrible (in all sorts of contextual meanings), but I found out after watching this movie - there is a genre called "historic drama" - and probably it would have been 10/10 because it has lots of it and Tarantino would have been more than happy with it (and got Kill Bill 3 to waste even more blood on screen than here to show that it is possible). but the subject of "historical drama" genre is that it is a subcategory of "garbage film" where John Romero is the undead gory emperor-of-the-guts and so it cannot be judged as your standard movie - as it are movies that are bad for that purpose and you can't really tell if the comic bad moment was supposed to be, or it was simply bad. It is for those people who like to suffer bad plays, bad manuscripts and badly everything else. And by some reverse belief - I'm also one of them. There are days when I want to watch a really bad movie and look for some trash and here you go - the day is saved! but it is certainly a perception of me, and it does not match anything else. <br /> <br /> What I would say is that if you want to see some horrible movies - then Fellini Casanova is definitely the choice, but pay attention to my advice and don't rate it by default.
