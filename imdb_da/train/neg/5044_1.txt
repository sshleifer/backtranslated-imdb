I was looking forward to watching this movie after reading a positive review in the New York Times. In addition, I am also Shanghainese, so there was more than just a passing interest in the subject. But after seeing it, I was extremely disappointed. <br /> <br /> The movie's pace was terribly slow and monotonous. The director long in long scenes on certain scenes. There was no passion or chemistry between the lovers. There was hardly any dialogue. The dialogue was urgently needed to compensate for the lack of action. At the end of the movie, you didn't feel compassion for the characters. This movie was lacking in all. The script was weak, the actor was poor, and editing was non-existent. The director tried to imitate some noir movie styles but failed miserably. A good movie is one that catches your attention, maintains it and succeeds in ending without feeling the time has passed. This movie felt like it would never end. Don't waste your money on this movie.
