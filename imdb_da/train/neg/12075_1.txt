This Hamlet made one of the most boring MST3000 episodes ever. I'm not a Shakespear fan, but I don't think he'd ever thought his works were so slow and boring. It is also one of the hardest movies to find because there are so many Hamlets listed. As I said, even though this one is pretty boring. It is in black and white, the pacing is slow and there is minimal scenery. The actors are all called too, so it doesn't help. This is the one MST 3000 I can't see in a meeting because the way the guy plays Hamlet says his lines can put someone to sleep.
