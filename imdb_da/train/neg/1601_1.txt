Stereotypical sending of slasher flicks falls far short of supposed entertainment. Gerrit Graham, Michael Lerner, Zane Busby, and actually the whole cast is completely wasted. Lame jokes abound, and each punch line is well telegraphed. The stupid lines come at a fast pace and almost everyone falls flat like a squashed grape. The musical figures only contribute to boredom that sets in and dwells on the whole movie. Another negative is the claustrophobic setting entirely within the walls of an upper secondary school. Avoid this and search one of "Lampon's" really funny movies like "National Lampoon's Golddiggers" - NOTE
