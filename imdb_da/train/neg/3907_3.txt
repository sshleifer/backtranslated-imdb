I'm glad I rented this movie for a reason: its shortcomings meant I would read Allende's book and get the full story. <br /> <br /> Benefits: The movie is beautiful, the period is depicted well and consistently (to my best knowledge), and Meryl and Glenn do good jobs. Cons: This is the worst trading job I've ever seen from Jeremy Irons - I wondered if something was wrong with my mouth. (And I hate the terrible English way he says "Transito.") Winona Ryder does nothing credible except to look young and idealistic. Most of the other performances are okay, but so few things are related to the character arches and relationship development that I became frustrated and angry well before the end. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm curious if this movie is typical of Bille August's work. I might have to drop another couple to rent Smilla's sense of snow.
