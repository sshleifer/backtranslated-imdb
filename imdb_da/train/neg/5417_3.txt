Three Russian aristocrats suck Monte Carlo's decadence, despite being down to their last franc. To support their lavish lifestyle, the three services use a counterfeit and use the notes at the casinos and hope to exchange the counterfeit currency for a jackpot. Andrew Hughes, an American envoy, arrives in Monaco with his wife Helen and the three decide to make friends with the visitors and hope for financial help. One of the three Russians, Count Sergius Karamzin, is planning to move forward with continuous progress toward Helen, while disappointing the Count's girl who loves Sergius. Eventually, the circumstances play their hand against the three aristocrats. It is obvious that Von Stroheim tried to convey a message (with the American women's folly and the inappropriate behavior of the aristocrats), rather than telling a story, and the movie can really drill modern audiences, like me, easily doing it. Even the play, which is fantastic in later Eve like Grass and Wedding March, is just run by the mill here. The movie could have used improvements at different levels. Rating, 3.
