Woman with wig as "dyes" her hair in the middle of the film (= wigs) probably does not see what the audience can see from miles away: <br /> *** the spoiler starts alerting * ** to her hubby have an affair with her best girlfriend and they both try to get rid of her. *** End of spoiler alert *** <br /> <br /> And what a spoiler it was: The title already gives it away, right? Bad play, bad script: Waste of time Oh yeah: finally she happily ever lives after .... <br /> <br /> If you liked this movie, you will really love "Cannibal Women in the Avocado Death Jungle" ....
