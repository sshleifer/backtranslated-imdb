The most embarrassing moment in this movie is when Brady Corbet says 'You have blossomed' at the end of the movie. I almost died. I'm still not quite sure why the writers put that line in there. Was it meant to create romance? Because it almost made me sick. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script was almost as bad. <br /> <br /> I never liked the original Thunderbirds, but a Thunderbird movie had the potential to do so much. This movie doesn't. If it did not have the large Thunderbird branding card, it would have been shot directly to the television or can in the post production. Maybe even before. <br /> <br /> As I said, the best thing about the movie is when the credits roll up and they play Busted song 'Thunderbirds are go'. I can't believe I wasted $ 7 to see this through pay-per-view.
