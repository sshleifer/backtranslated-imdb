A fun concept but poorly executed. Apart from the relatively good makeup effects, there really isn't much to it. There are obvious problems; For example, after taking what seems to be weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size, the protagonist seems to go from normal size to deadly thin in days ... and when he is dead thin, he remains just as deadly thin for it seems to be a long time. The film has at least far worse problems than that - the filmography is certainly low budget TV show quality and most of all, the play is quite awful around. Robert John Burke always seems to be trying for some kind of whimsical Charlton Heston imitation and is literally painful to see ... the only scary thing is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are both even worse. <br /> <br /> The only reason I give this movie as high as I am is that when the movie comes into its last 1/3 or so, and Joe Mantegnas character takes over, the film is developing a fun, the campy 'cheesefest slaughterhouse' feel and the gangster's crazy schemes to torment the totally unpleasant gypsies are something fun to see. The end, if predictable, is also good means. Avoid unless you are a King-o-Phile or really psyched up at the thought of the voice of Fat Tony from the Simpsons who are terrorizing a gypsy camp.
