Together with 2 days in the valley, I think this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Just one of the long lines of Tarantino rip-offs that have emerged since Pulp Fiction. The atmosphere created by the film is entertaining for the first five minutes, but then the filmmakers make the unforgettable mistake of allowing unnecessary and grotesque violence to offset the "hip" quota. You better skip this one.
