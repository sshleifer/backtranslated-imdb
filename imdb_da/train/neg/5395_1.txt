Kenneth Branagh tries to transform William Shakspeare's unclear, rarely produced comedy into a musical 1930s, with the result being both poor Shakespeare and poor musical comedy, as the actors rarely are proficient at either of the two styles and in some cases are badly floundering in both. Particularly painful is Nathan Lane, who seems to be under the impression that he is completely hysterical as Costard, but is very wrong, and Alicia Silverstone, who handles the Shakespeare language with all authority from a teenaged Valley Girl reading the script high her musical classes. <br /> <br /> The musical tracks are staged with the expertise of a high school production of "Dames at Sea", leaving the cast looking awkward and amateurish while singing and dancing, with the solitary exception being Adrian Lester who proves a great song and dancer. The only other scanty grace of the movie is Natascha McElhone and Emily Mortimer's eye-catching contribution, but they have provided far better performances than in this movie, and you will be wise to check out some of the other titles in their movie films and give this innocent root passport.
