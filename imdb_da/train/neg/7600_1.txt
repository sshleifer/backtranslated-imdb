This film shows that good acting comes from good direction, and it does not happen in Ask the Dust. Colin Farrell is usually a fine actor, but in this he is young. Donald Sutherland comes across as an amateur. Why? Because the manuscript is terrible, the adaptation is terrible and the actors seem bored and half-hearted. The movie's atmosphere is bad - I could only think when it would be finished, and I hit it halfway. The director has done a very bad job, and although I have not read the novel, it is certainly a disadvantage. The atmosphere this movie is trying to evoke and the message and history never reaches the audience. In one word, it's a TERRIBLE movie.
