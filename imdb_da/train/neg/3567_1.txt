A family with father Louis (Dale Midkiff), mother Rachel (Denise Crosby), 10-year-old Eileen (Blaze Berdalh and about 3-year-old Gage (Miko Hughes) move to this beautiful house in Maine - apparently unaware of the semis that roar on the highway in front of their house every 90 seconds or so! The neighbor over the road (the wonderful Fred Gwynne) makes them feel at home ... and shows them a pet cemetery where the kids bury their pets, but a little further on is a sacred reason that can bring the dead back to life ... but the dead come back in an unpleasant mood. "" DEFINITIVE SPOILERS ** The novel by Stephen King was good - it was a long time, but it developed characters and situations that made you worry about what happened. This movie tells ALL character development and just plays gore and violence. The animals are killed on the camera (I know it's faded, but it's still repulsive), a little boy is hit of a semi and his coffin e poper open during the funeral (in a completely ill scene), he is brought back to life and attack and kills people, including his mother (I wonder how a 3 year old was able to hang her); a ghost jogger (don't ask) trying to help the family for no reason ... The movie just seems to crowd the crowd into pushing any cruel death or violence into your face. It just goes out of her way to shock you. ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> There is no help shopping. Midkiff is just awful as the father - he is beautiful and dew, but completely empty. Crosby is not much better. The two children are just annoying. Only Gwynne hides this picture alone with his effortless good acting. <br /> <br /> This picture shows a total disdain for the audience who take great leaps in logic and have signs doing incredibly stupid things (especially Midkiff at the end). This movie was (inexplicably) a huge box office hit in 1989, which led to the even worse sequel in 1992. I saw it in a theater then and was disturbed how the audience kept cheering on the violence and were just horrified by what I saw. A sick repulsive horror movie. A 1 all the way. <br /> <br /> When you think it's all over and can't get worse, Ramones sings a title song !!!!!! ("I won't be buried in a pet's cemetery"). Really convinced.
