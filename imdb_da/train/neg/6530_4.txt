** Possible Spoilers Ahead ** <br /> <br /> Gerald Mohr, a busy B-movie actor in the eighties and fifties, leads an expedition to Mars. Before we get to the red planet, we are entertained by a romantic patter between Mohr and researcher Nora Hayden; resident doofus Jack Kruschen; and the sight of Les Tremayne as another scientist with a billy-goat beard. The martian exterior has fake scenery and colors ranging from red to pink - the "cinemagic" process spewed into the ads. Real cool monsters include a giant amoeba, a tree-lined insect, an oversized Venus Fly-Trap, and the unforgettable rat / bat / spider. Whole bizarre adventures are recalled by Hayden survivors under the influence of hypnotic drugs. THE ANGRY RED PLANET supposedly has a pretty cool sequel, and it probably fetched most of its followers during the psychedelic 60s.
