I bought this movie on DVD so I could get an episode of the Mystery Science Theater 3000. Fortunately, Mike, Crow and Tom Servo are ready because the movie itself is not. Although there is a plot, a story to follow, and a few actors who can act, there is nothing else. The movie was so boring, I have confirmed that I will never see it again without Tom, Crow and Mike. However, as summarized above, it was better than the movie featured in the MST3K episode that preceded it; Mitchell.
