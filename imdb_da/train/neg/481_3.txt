Whenever a movie is so myopic in its desire to present a particular endpoint or point of view that it simply does not bother with a real story, it is annoying. These are the types of movies where the end or viewpoint is first devised, and the story simply struck. For this reason, we often talk about the story "jumping through hoops" as it twists and tries in vain to move on to the predetermined end in a logical way. The story of "Comet Over Broadway" doesn't do You just have to jump through hoops, it's a three ring circus. It is so ridiculous, so unbelievable, so unfortunate that if you tend to talk loudly on the screen, you will be quite ranting before it is through. <br /> <br /> The key theme of this cesspool manuscript is for a woman who chooses between family and business. Since everything is so terribly muddled, it will end up being offensive to some kind of people. So in the end there is no point on the story, the theme becomes irrelevant, and as is often the case with bad screens, the actor does not save anything.
