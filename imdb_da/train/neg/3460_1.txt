Oh man, this movie ever bites! If you were ever scared to see a rebuilding of the slash genre, made as cheap as possible and then cautious at the same time (PC friendly doesn't mean nudity, a classic element of slasher film) Cut is it. Each clich√© is rendered without a hint of self-consciousness and the play. Oh, the play redefines the word horror. I should have known better as the direct Dutch translation of the title would have turned me off.
