I am a good guy, and I like to think of myself as genuinely tolerant. And I think that I think I'm trying to consider a movie in the context of the genre it is in. If nothing else, I save myself from feeling that I should say really ugly things about people or movies, like me i dont like to make. <br /> <br /> The reason for this was obviously obvious, production is very low and puts, uhm, simplistic. The actor rose from time to time to "good for high school". My feeling was that this was filmed in one day - please tell me it was. Worst of all was sex, while it was reasonably abundant, pretty everyday, hampered by, at least in my copy, a "sound-over" that was incompatible with the action (climatic moans and shrieks while lying on a bed where you avoid a bra ???). There was absolutely no "edge" at all - nothing different or interesting, and with surprisingly quick cuts. My vote is a "1" so with the following summary statement: would have been better if the stuff in the club was expanded and the rest of the movie condensed.
