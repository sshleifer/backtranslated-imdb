Based on the personal experience of director John Singleton's time at the University of Southern California, Higher Learning is coming. A film centered on race policy that takes place in modern college. <br /> <br /> There are three main characters the movie bases its reason for its story: Malik Williams, a carefree lowbrow athlete who is an African American man. Kristin Conner, a protected soft white girl, and Remy, an unsophisticated independent white man. All three are overcome by the sudden realities that university life is not as good as it is announced, as all three go through disappointment by being unprepared (Malik), by being naive (Kristin) and by being unwanted (Remy). <Br /> <br /> A good thing about the movie is that it shows that modern American colleges are just high school writing. Colleges are not places to build character, develop potential or improve personal progress, but they are institutions used to gather all sorts of students in a one-size-fits-all atmosphere. It is an experience that is usually built for failure by most students. It would have been good if the film built the story of this travesty rather than racist politics. <br /> <br /> But it didn't and that is where the movies are falling apart. Singleton seems to have a rather bad experience in Southern California. Through this movie he lets it all hang out. There is no need to turn around the bush here. Singleton lets the hero and villain in this piece be seen. <br /> <br /> The black figures in the film are seen almost like the heroes here, while all the whites in the film are seen as villains, hiding for Kristin, who was raped by a fellow human being. <br /> <br /> Who can understand the inconsistencies of this movie? Black gang members coming to the aid of a white girl after she points to those who probably raped her? The lightness of the black team members at the university, while a bunch of skin heads meet in a dark little sleeping violence? <br /> <br /> The performances of Omar Epps (Malik) and Kristy Swanson (Kristin) are disappointing. They act as the third choice for the roles they played in this movie (Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore were to play Malik and Kristin, but they were not available). O'Shea Jackson aka Ice Cube, Busta Rhymes and Regina King were all annoying in their respective roles. And Laurence Fishburne became violently mistaken here as a history professor. Only Michael Rappaport did well in this movie, and he considered that his character, of the three main characters, changed most in the movie. <br /> <br /> John Singleton wanted to address the issue of race and inequality in American college life with this movie. And he did very badly. It was like killing a fly with a shotgun. Life is far more complex than it seems, and people are alike everywhere and he must know this. Higher Learning is proof that he didn't understand it at all. Watching the movie, then and now, would only confuse, disappoint, and regret the same public he would like to talk to. Not to mention it wouldn't entertain them at least.
