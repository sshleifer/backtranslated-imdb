I've seen about four other Japanese horror movies, and they weren't too impressive. However, I noticed that there was a sensible script to guide the road. <br /> <br /> Not here, no way. It's about a detective trying to tie similar murders that have taken place. When he finds a suspect questioning, the suspect loses because they still see a ghost. Then, the ghost begins to follow the detective around FOR A CONSIDERATION NEVER DISTRIBUTED AND TAKES OVER MORE THAN HALF OF THE FILE. <br /> <br /> Bad enough? Oh no. The film keeps changing perspectives to different characters that have little to do with history. I've seen this before in other movies, where it shows a different perspective. Not the case here. <br /> <br /> Whatever happens on the screen, which is actually acceptable, ends quickly. For example, there are a few scenes with a small instrumental score that builds up and ... then it just cuts to another scene. I realize that this can be a dramatic effect. It is certainly not the intention here. It's just bad editing. Finally, there is the "ghost" who just screams in a way that is not scary or unintentional fun. It's annoying and it happens a lot throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> All the horrors have been done before in better ways so you can see them all coming. So after one of them, the movie is over. At that time, a wave of confusion over the audience celebrated as I felt we all felt we had wasted our time. Someone did a mock pat and laughter followed. It was better than the whole movie. Simply put, avoid.
