Andy Lau stars in another policeman. Daniel Wu plays Nick who works for the police and is also close to the top of a drug dealing gang (Lau). The movie begins when we see the police trying to make a drug break just to see it break. We are then introduced to the young drug-abused mother and her daughter who lives near Nick and to his companions and the police, and 45 minutes in I closed the film and started the news. Well done and good to look at this is like involving a movie that I have seen for a long time. It's not bad as such it's just you really don't care. I don't care at all. In fact, I started to do something completely different from forgetting that I had a subtitle movie, that was how much I didn't care. I wish I could have hated the movie, but the film is such a nonentity that it almost didn't give me any impression (it wasn't even something I could sleep for it just to ignore). Getting on the box did it call the Chinese scarface what after he was dead? This is one to avoid.
