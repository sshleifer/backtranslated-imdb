There is no artistic value in this movie to deserve any price. Well, it doesn't deserve an audience either. Ironically, one of the prices for filmography is, but frankly, the camera's movements are at least disturbing. Every frame you feel you get the "full picture", it's like someone "prunes your vision" from the edges. The story is pathetic. Well, I want to be honest, I couldn't bear to watch the whole movie. The part that sucked the most was when I saw the soldiers sticking in their barracks and one of the soldiers coaxed to drink spirits. These and many other similar scenes reminded me so much about Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> Take my advice, stay away from this piece of shit.
