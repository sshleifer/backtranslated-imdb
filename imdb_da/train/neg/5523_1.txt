Georgia Rule must be one of - if not the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The whole movie has a very surreal feeling that made me grab what? loudly at least 7-10 times during his naughty two-hour course. <br /> <br /> Announced in her trailer as a movie of three generations of women - Jane Fonda as matriarch, Felicity Huffman as her daughter and Lindsay Lohan as the rebellious, chained, little-dressed granddaughter, the viewer believes it will be a clich√©, light, the chicken to grow up and come together as a family. Talk about false advertising at worst. After many shots of animals, "funny" things do in the background for "pivotal" scenes and not to mention a full five minutes focusing on an old woman coming into a doctor weekly to have her bladder changed or to this film is actually about Lindsay Lohan's character being sexually abused by his stiffer, Georgia Rule creates his own genre of cinema: The unearthed, horrible act, inappropriate comedy that deals with extremely serious issues in the most awkward, surreal, strange way. If Garry Marshall wanted this movie to be a drama / comedy, then he should have seen The Royal Tenenbaums. Sideways. Junebug. Etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> The only way I feel I can get a reader to understand the horrible genre that Georgia Rule falls into is to create a hypothetical situation. Say the movie, The 40 Year Old Virgin, was about the protagonist who was celibate because he was sexually bullied as a child. But instead of getting the movie to take a more dramatic turn, stomach grunts and comedies would cause all of the characters' reactions to be the fake, lifeless people who pretend to care. Throw a yellow parakeet, Dermot Mulroney as the flattest, most non-dimensional character that could have been cut off completely from this poorly written script along with a male character who throws all his religious beliefs and morals to be with a seacolor , pre-tanned girl who does not share the same interests as he, as well as an unnecessary cargo scene, unreal moments of characters trying to relate to each other, and you have the Georgia Rule. <br /> <br /> I found this movie to be an insult to any of the people out there who are fighting filmmakers, writers, actors, editors, etc. Who has much more talent and does not get noticed. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie: my rule. <br /> <br /> And if you have to, be full enough in your hand.
