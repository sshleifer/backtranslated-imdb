Seeing this movie made me think constantly; Why do they make such a problem out of some broken brakes? There are a million possibilities to slow down the car! In the movie Speed, the authors at least thought about a good reason why the car could not stop ... <br /> <br /> There are not many good things to say about this movie; All the usual narrative cliches have their appearance, the actors are very bad, the story is like leak like a sieve, etc. It makes this movie a waste of time and money. <br /> <br />
