Many seemed to want the movie, so I feel a little bad, which gives a bad review. But after sitting for 96 minutes I feel it necessary. Where the heck is plotted in this movie? I must have missed what I was waiting for the story to unfold and nothing happened. Sure, the end was "somewhat shocking," but they didn't build it up. I forgot who was who half of the time, so they didn't really develop the characters. The action was half-bad, most of it was credible, but I could see through most of the time. So ... without giving anything away, I have to say that unless you like the actors in the movie, there is no real reason to watch this movie. I could confuse, but I just didn't understand why there was so little or too much of the movie. I can't decide which one would be, so I say judge for yourself. I don't even know about renting it would be a good idea, the price and everything ... Plot: 0/10 Ratings: 1/10 Applicable: 2/10 Overall: 3/10 It feels like I'm too high really, I stay with my voice at the top.
