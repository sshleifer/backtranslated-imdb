Alan Rudolph is a so-so director without the special touch. As an example, there was a shot in The Secret Lives of Dentists in the dental office that could have expressed the whole relationship between husband and wife. Rudolph wasted it. The camera is in the hallway and looks through the doorways of the two dental clinics, where Dana and Dave are alone in their respective rooms. You get the idea of ​​their destiny and isolation, but not much more. The lighting, the colors, the body language, the facial expressions could all have been significantly improved. If I instructed, I would have spent the whole day if necessary to get it shot right. It's the beauty and power of the movie: it can express so much, throughout life, in seconds <br /> <br /> The shot with the toddler, which rose in the pillow, could have been improved. The child should have shown more fascination with the pillow, should have stumped and mixed her feet, should have had her head bent down to look at the pillow with all her attention. <br /> <br /> Campbell didn't deliver. He plays an uncomplicated man, true, but instead of conveying his inner turmoil in voice, gesture, body movement, the movie depends on voice-over narration and dialogue with his imaginary macho alter ego played by Denis Leary.
