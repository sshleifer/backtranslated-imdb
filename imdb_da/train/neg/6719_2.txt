This is a good idea for a movie, but unfortunately it does not seem to be a good movie. What begins as a sweet and almost greasy romantic comedy about a Fluffer in love with his Fluffee spirals out of control for a bizarre combination of genres and a true stowage of plots with liberal loans from BOOGIE NIGHTS, THELMA and LOUISE, SHOWGIRLS, FRESH and even a curious "dash" of 400 BLOWS thrown into the end. (At least the director did his research!) The result is not necessarily boring, but ultimately, this smooth, well-produced flick does not really add up to anything. But the actors all do a game job with the material, and there are a few good laughs on the back-scene world of gay porn. <br /> <br />
