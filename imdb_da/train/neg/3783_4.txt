It wasn't the most meaningless animation movie experience ever, but it certainly can't be admired as much as it tries to be good. Combining Dreamworks animation and computer graphics, this is the story of a mustang, later named Spirit (Matt Damon, who delivers the first person's story) and his journey across the Old West's borders. Basically he is born free of all the other horses in the beautiful landscape, so he is kidnapped to be used as a saddle horse, he manages to throw everyone who is trying to ride him. But when he escapes his cage with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), the two make up a friendship, oh, and of course he has a thing for Little Creek's horse. Eventually, after a couple more flies, being chased by the Colonel (James Cromwell) and his men, making a final leap over a ravine, Little Creek lets Spirit go, and he also solves his female horse and they run home landscape and co-horses. Also starring Chopper Bernet as Sgt. Adams, Jeff LeBeau as Murphy / Railroad Foreman, John Rubano as a soldier, Richard McGonagle as Bill and Matthew Levin as Joe. I expected to see the horses talk in this movie, but it turns out to be more like a Dumbo thing all the time, and the song of Bryan Adams is not the most engaging, but it's not a horrible movie. It was nominated Oscar for Best Animated Feature, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Song for Bryan Adams' "Here I Am". Okay!
