There are really two parts of this movie. Firstly, there is the ridiculous prologue of the movie, which is so hysterical and cornball, that it would almost feel appropriate that 'The Simpsons' Troy McClure should do the story. <br /> <br /> Then the rest of the movie (starting with a title song that doesn't really fit in with the rest of the movie), which is technically OK is killed by a vague, inconsistent and inconsistent plot and not just uninteresting characters, but signs that don't make sense. <This is especially true of Mickey Rooney's Spiventa, who apparently was in the plot and part of the "organization" all the time, but what would have happened if Hackman had the seemingly arbitrary decision to bring him together when breaking out? In that case, he would have been a completely superfluous and unnecessary character, as he eventually is. <br /> <br /> The overall problem with the movie is that it is completely unwilling to put details on who or what is behind this conspiracy. It is as if the filmmakers did not have the courage to suggest that a particular part of society would be able to create such an organization and instead set themselves the hope that lack of explanation would be sufficient and the audience would form their own conclusions . <br /> <br /> The movie simply fails at all levels.
