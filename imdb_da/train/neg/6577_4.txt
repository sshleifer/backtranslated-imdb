Small school town coed OD's? (Why do we care?) The working sheriff examines the incident. (Why doesn't it matter?) The interviews show us the comatose topic (Kirshner) that is as diverse as the opinions of the topics being interviewed. (Why doesn't it matter?) Result? A mess of flashbacks in this mess of a movie with a handful of one-hit wonders and B-flick divas asking the question ... Why don't we care?
