I was lucky enough to see a Chorus Line when it came to my town. I was younger then .. but it was an excellent game .. then someone would tell me why in the name of heaven they should make a movie out of it .. and why Michael Douglas ??? He didn't fit the role .. this movie really sucked BIG time !!! <br /> <br /> My advice is NOT to rent this movie .. save your money for something better as "cats" ....
