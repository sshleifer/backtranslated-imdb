I don't often hand out "them", but if there was ever a movie that deserved this kind of attention, it's "Gas!" This is a self-sufficient crap that reaches some of the mood of M * A * S * H ​​and falls flat on the face of the experiment. <br /> <br /> I see what Corman was heading for - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould tried to reproduce Gould's deadly role in the original movie version of M * A * S * H ​​with a similar plot (in the movie "Whiffs" - see it here in IMDb, http://www.imdb.com / title / tt0073891 / for more information). <br /> <br /> Marble stone and Gould came closer to the brass ring with "Whiffs" than Corman did with "Gas!" But don't come right there. None of these films have even been close to the success of M * A * S * H. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with "Gas!" What isn't it? No one comes close to really performing at a level above junior high school theatrics. The production values ​​stink. Someone else here mentioned the magically regenerating headlights on an escape car, and there is more of the lack of attention to detail. Nothing works as it should in this movie and nobody cares. <br /> <br /> "Gas!" actually put me to sleep. It is not a safe cure for insomnia, but really close. On the biographical sleep induction scale, "Gas!" falls somewhere between "last year at Marienbad" and George Clooney's re-enactment of "Solaris" (which in itself was remarkable for being more boring than the Mosfilm original, despite the fact that the study's seemingly lacking in the idea of ​​keeping the audience aware judicial editing). <br /> Judicious editing would have decimated "Gas!" to approx. twenty minutes. The result would be meaningless, but no more than the original film. <br /> <br /> Certain films are so bad that they have a compelling quality that makes them worth seeing anyway. This is not one of them. Do not waste your time. It's not even funny bad.
