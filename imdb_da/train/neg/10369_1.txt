As a writer, I find films this bad makes it a complete flap in the face. Talk about insult. I wrote better stories than this in the 8th grade. Poor acting, poor writing, poor conducting and when added all together, the result is complete and total error. <br /> <br /> The only thing this movie manages to do is trick the unsuspecting consumer into wasting their time. Who would green light write so badly? It is not artistic, wise, smart, exciting, mysterious, scary, dramatic-nothing. The signs are flat and dull without development. The reason is as recycled as an aluminum container. They somehow managed to throw a few well-known actors, all of whom must be quite desperate for work or hope that one of these low-budget movies will turn out to be the next "Pulp Fiction". This script should have been used to lens a bird cage, not a movie. Oh and last but not least, a 5'2 105 lb woman of course has the strength to kill men and women twice its size without a fight and in a single stroke. <br /> <br /> Avoid this bomb as it will infect you with an STD.
