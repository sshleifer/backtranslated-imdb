Must I say - it's a stink! (I gave it a rating of 2) <br /> <br /> Look at it only if you suffer from insomnia. <br /> <br /> There are lots of scenery that chew and hammer it up, but nothing else happens in this movie. There is no tension, no deep, shocking secrets revealed, no real threat to the heroes' welfare. A few disagreements, a small increase in votes - that's pretty much the case. The secrets are nothing that could not happen to anyone - the last "secret" revealed in the movie is completely predictable at that time. The plot, as it is, is about a young woman named Faith (Meg Tilly) who is an artist who is employed to paint a series of murals in a large ballroom in a large mansion of a very wealthy, elderly widow woman and a growing mother / daughter type relationship that older woman wants with her. It turns out that the older woman's daughter, Cassandra, is dead. You can fit the rest of the pieces together. <br /> <br /> Even the scene of the mysterious man who threatens our heroine does not go to the point where you really fear her security beyond maybe a second or two. Why is he still hanging around years after Cassandra's death is a good question. There is also the question that in this large mansion there is only one servant, a faithful butler who seems to do everything - cooking, cleaning, serving the meal, answering the door, etc. All except to obviously lock the door - as it would be the only explanation for how one of the characters just goes into a room where faith is. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to get you into your chair arms and lean forward on the edge of your seat because there is no "mounting" tension in this movie - just gentle pathetic revelations that are cast out from time to time. <br /> <br />
