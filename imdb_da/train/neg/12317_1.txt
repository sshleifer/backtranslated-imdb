I'm sorry fans of this movie, but it's the worst I've ever seen. Slowly, poorly cast and badly acted, it's a movie that tries to escape the deadly romcoms of recent years and fails! McDonald and Parker seem unable to convey true emotions and are lifeless. They seem to be in this for any paycheck they get for it and not because they thought it was a good idea. The reason is DULL !! I love big chick movies as much as the next girl and it's not one !! If you avoid a movie this year .... let it be
