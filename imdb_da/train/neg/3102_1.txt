No matter how you look at this movie, it's just awful. <br /> <br /> If you see it as a horror, it's a rude movie where the monsters are puppets. <br /> <br /> If you look at it as a comedy, then you will notice that most of the humor falls flat and is just lame. <br /> <br /> If it's a romance, you'll wonder why a guy would stay with such a B ** ch! <br /> <br /> If you look at it as an act, you can't really draw on the whiny hero. <br /> <br /> As you can see, this movie just fails to deliver any distant entertainment. As mentioned, monsters are obvious dolls, and this film was another attempt at a Gremlins-type movie. However, this has the worst looking monsters of that genre. Critters looked pretty good, so saw the Ghoulies, even the puppets from Munchies better than these. The characters in this movie are terribly unlikely. The hero is a whiney security guard, his girlfriend always complains, they have a tramp friend who has a jerk military girlfriend, and another friend who is a spaz. At some point in the movie, the hero and the military guy are fighting with rake ... this movie is just stupid. I like the scene when they are in the dreaded club foam (obviously not a club, but more likely a dinner) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them is 21. Give me a break, I'm 25 and I look younger than any of them.
