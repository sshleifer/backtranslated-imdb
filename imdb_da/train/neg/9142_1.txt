Just looked for this after hearing about how bad it was and wanted to see for myself. Seriously, even if you read all the negative comments here, you won't be able to understand how horrible this movie really is, even if it should be one of the most fun things I've ever seen! Never bothered to write a comment on this before, but this piece of crap really guarantees it. <br /> <br /> First, the whole plot is ridiculous and obscene. Brother of the protagonist (either Ben or Arthur, I forget what is, and frankly it is never quite clear) wants to stop some kind of gay marriage by killing everyone in sight - because homosexuality is abominable to Christian, but apparently mass murder is 't. Then there is another shot thrown around one of the homosexual's ex-wife trying to force him to regain her on the gun. This leads to nothing, but gives us one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the whole "movie" - "I don't make sense, you don't make sense! That's what makes sense!". Brilliant. <br /> <br /> There's the play that's just awful. It must be seen to be believed. My personal favorite is the seemingly stony civil rights lawyer woman who clearly reads her lines out of anything but still manages to destroy them. Enough said. Homosexual couples couldn't be less convincing. There is the vaguely appealing and utterly helpless guy, and his girlfriend, resembling the little comic book of the bisto ads. Only fatter. And less talented. <br /> <br /> "The movie" has also been filmed by a person who is unable to keep a camera even distant and the number of errors throughout is fantastic. The whole thing starts with the cool man in bed with a pair of boots on. Yep. But yet we all know how awful this thing is, so I would like to highlight some of the most invaluable comedy moments that "movies" provide. <br /> <br /> - When the fat guy fires the church and then prances like a six year old girl across the parking lot to get her escape. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> - Mildread! Whatever relationship she is to the protagonists - sometimes they know her, sometimes they don't, but she comes in a couple of scenes. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> - The stoned lawyer. Already mentioned her, but she is so funny she is worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> - The evil brother's dinner of biscuits, which he puts on for his guests. <br /> <br /> - The evil brother's anti-gay potion. <br /> <br /> - The evil brother's cats. <br /> <br /> - The end that I will not give away because it must be seen as belief. I warn you though, make sure you don't eat at the time !!!! The bar of pig protagonist / instructor / producer becomes naked. It's ugly. <br /> <br /> Basically, Ben and Arthur are indescribably bad, but unintentionally the most comical thing you will see for a long time. Literally, there is nothing good about this excuse for a movie, even though a director's goon himself manages to open the opening credits in a joke by writing his own name about. 15 times.
