Boy, this movie had fooled me. I honestly thought it would be a campy horror movie with absolutely no humor in it at all, boy I got that cold shoulder back then. This movie was, and I'm truthful, pretty damn good. It was not scary at all, but the campaign and the slyme humor really made this movie interesting. Some of the horrible plays and cliché killings were so painful to see, I almost laughed at how bad it was, but to some extent I enjoyed it. The killings are all vaguely related to snow sports and Christmas, which made things more exciting. POV camera angles were awesome. The film is about a viscous killer who dies in a car accident collision with a chemical truck while being transported to prison. He later re-emerges in the same fabric with snow spliced ​​into the mixture. These were the ingredients that were chosen to make the perfect killer snowman. He even takes his revenge as the snowman on the police officer who sentenced him. <br /> <br /> This movie had such a bad act, except for Christopher Allport, it was fun. I would say that I am also quite disappointed that this movie was not a horror, but actually a dark sitcom. They had a great story with a good plot, but it wasn't done right. All in all, I like the movie at first, but now it's really annoying. But this movie is way better and darker than the sequel.
