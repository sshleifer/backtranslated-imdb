Tashan - the title itself explains the nature of the movie. <br /> <br /> This type of movie is actually made for the flop. What a shame that Yash Raj Films produces such films, they are worthless than C-grade movies. Or even some C-grade movies have a better and comfortable story than Tashan. The very hypocritical and convincingly conveyed Tashan badly bombed at the cashier's office, which it certainly deserved. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is the worst movie ever made by the honorable Yash Raj Film banner. How have they handled such a heavy project to the new Vijay Krishna Acharya who has no real sense of action? He tried to imitate Sanjay Gadhvi's ways of doing as Dhoom, but he finally suffered. The action scenes are more similar than cartoons or comic books that are exhausted to challenge the audience. <br /> <br /> History also loses its meaning and substance to tenderly win the hearts of the public. In most scenes, Anil Kapoor reminds me of the southern Tamil star Rajnikant in her body language and proverbs. I'm not a fan of either Saif or Akshay, but the award of Kareena should finally have gone to Saif's hand instead of Akshay. Right from the start I expected it, but in the end it made me dissatisfied with the climax truth. Saif is the head of the whole adventure, while Akshay joins in the middle. In any movie, the final must be judged by the entire character throughout the story, and the prize or reward must be given to the one who deserves credit. And Tashan loses this way and unexpectedly failed to become a hit. <br /> <br /> Akshay has nothing new to show his comedian talent here, but still reminds of his previous movie. He seriously needs to create a new image for his fans who would impress them again and again. Between Saif did a good job in Race, and now he returned again in his fun character through this movie. But he has evolved fully into the play. And last but not least about Kareena. She looks really hot with a bikini dress, some of which she complains about. But I don't think so, instead she became slim. Yes slim !!! It is a good factor for a female to attract the great people (or say male). Beside them, it is nice that Saif's son Ibrahim appears in the beginning and last as young Saif. I now hope he will lean forward in the goal of doing trades as his career. <br /> <br /> Those who like this Tashan, they are either mentally unsaturated or will still go back to childhood or say they will be enrolled in an asylum situation. Thumbs down to debutant director Vijay Krishna Acharya who mistreated the project offered by Yash Raj Films. In the future he will have to experiment and study the script at least 5 years before going in practical directions. Sorry, I don't like judging good stars for this type of junk movie.
