I usually enjoy movies like this one. It's shot documentary style, but acting and writing are just awful. The action is wood and stiff and the writing is just so clich√©, but not at all good. As of writing this, I am surprised that it is on a 5.2 / 10 on IMDb. I'm sure most of these voices have come from relatives to people in the movie. I assume, if that is the case, you can do a couple of laughs as it is always fun to watch your relatives / friends make a movie. Well in a way, I think it gives hope to everyone who comes to writers, directors, actors, etc. For if they can do that, you can do it. Although you may not.
