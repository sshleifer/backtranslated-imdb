Many moons since I was seven years old, I remember seeing a trailer for this movie. It appealed to my naive sense of curiosity and I decided to ask my parents to take me to this movie. Being the wise adults, they are, they told me "Absolutely not! It's a lot of trash can." Of course, I was very disappointed that I wouldn't be the first child in my block to see "Incredible Melting Man." Little time passed - maybe a few days. I forgot "The Incredible Melting Man" and my disappointment faded. Twenty-five years passed, until it came back to the front of my mind. While surfing through channels on digital cable, I found this far lost relic of a movie. My curiosity was piqued and I finally decided to join this fruit banned by my parents. I should have listened to them. The "amazing melting man" is perhaps the worst movie known to man. It makes movies like "Def-Con 4," Metalstorm, and "Freddie Got Fingered" look like Oscar nominees. I feel offended to waste almost two hours in my life and look at this eerie filth. The story was incoherent and the effects was raw though for 1977. How someone convinced a movie company to produce this movie beyond me. <br /> <br /> Don't make the same mistake I made. Listen to your parents if they banned you from watching this movie They were right.
