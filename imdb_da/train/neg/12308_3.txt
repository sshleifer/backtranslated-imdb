Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd couldn't save this movie from putting an emu big egg. Based on the classic Phil Silver's TV series, it bombed because: A) It was updated for the 1990s, and B) The television set's simple premise was transformed into a confusing, weak and silly manuscript. <br /> <br /> The original TV series used a small cast of talented actors to portray loving characters that appear from simple but hilarious pranks. To extend this premise in a 1990s, movies were asking for problems and it shows. No one could pay me enough to sit through this stink another time.
