Of course, the previous poster has worked with the film. It's a joke, how bad it is, and no one will go through this kind of movie he did. By mentioning all the actors' names and what they were in the past is a sure sign that he is involved in it somehow. <Br /> <br /> It's on Cinemax right now and I was sure it was a movie where porn stars (the one named Ava is beautiful and well-equipped) were forced to do something else for a crazy tax cause. <br /> <br /> Even when I first saw it, I was sure it was made in around 1986, and I was born in '73, so I thought I knew what I was talking about ... but no ... it was made in 1993 !! Unbelievable! <br /> <br /> Although I'd call it one of them so bad, it's good movie. Like watching a train wreck.
