This is the most depressing movie I've ever seen. I saw it first as a child and even thinking about it now disturbs me really. I know it was set in a time when life was difficult, and I know these people were poor and the crops were crucial. Yes, I get all that. What I find difficult to take is I cannot remember a single light moment in the whole movie. Maybe it was true for life, I don't know. I am absolutely sure that the play was top notch and the direction and quality of the film etc. Etc. Be wonderful, and I know that every movie can't have a happy ending, but as a family movie, it is fierce in my opinion. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to be entertained by a movie. I can't stress how this movie hit me as a child. I talked about it recently, and all the sad memories came back over the river. I think it would have everything but the heartless reach Prozac.
