I am grateful for one thing and only one thing - that this woman will now be thousands of miles away on a completely different continent !!! Yay !!! This program summed up exactly where obsessed Victoria Beckham joined in celebrating himself and his family to the media in the name of self-promotion and 'Brand f * cking Beckham'. <br /> <br /> Some years ago I used to really like 'Posh and Becks', I still greatly admire David's talent, but I have no respect for him anymore. How can you respect a person who has his wife's hand pushed up on his back, working him like a doll. <br /> <br /> It was clear that Victoria's hand was over Beckham's early departure from Manchester United, and now the same has happened in Real Madrid. I hope Beckham can live with the fact that even though he may be pounding - he has sold his soul to the American Buck and will end his days playing for a team that would fight to get promotion from Division One in England (no offense America - but in Baseball and Basketball you rule - football you do not!) <br /> <br /> Anyway - I'm digging. It has been years since I have seen such an over-the-top, totally false performance from 'Posh' - this is only topped up during her cringe worthy red carpet performances after Rebecca Loos 'debacle' when instead of throwing all cr * At David she desperately deserved her arm and tried to save millions of pounds of money-spinner her marriage has become. <br /> <br /> This entire PR stunt was pathetic. Why can't she just go over there quietly, support her husband through the biggest mistake in her professional career and keep her head down? When was she so self-important that she felt that the move to America should be enveloped by this huge fan price? <br /> <br /> By the way, I saw the David Beckham documentary last night. At least he has preserved a river of grace and humility. Two things his wife could do with learning. <br /> <br /> One thing for Victoria - you're complaining that you're constantly hounded by dad. Little hint - stop tipping them about your place you're stupid woman. <br /> <br /> Good Happiness America !!
