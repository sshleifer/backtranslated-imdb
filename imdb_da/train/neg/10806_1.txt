If you are a fan of really bad movies and you think it's fun, you want Shaq's great acting. First and foremost, putting proxies in movies hardly ever works. Shaq had to be the worst actor I've ever seen next to Dennis Rodman, who also made a few bad movies. Now this movie is also bad because of the hideous child. I would give this a zero, but it is impossible.
