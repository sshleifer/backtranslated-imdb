It's not just my contemplated judgment on this movie, but also on most of what is written about it. Don't make me mistake, I'm not a total philistine, I didn't hate the movie because it wasn't enough like 'police academy 9' or anything I enjoy more than my fair share of high forehead or artificial things I swear . 'Magnolia' is poor and I am honestly mystified why it seems so praised. Far-blown, of course, amazing, turbidity from start to finish, which is as little as could be credible as to what people love about the film. There are some high caliber actors fair enough and no one goes on average or inferior performance. In addition, my wife (a self-known Tom Cruise hater) tells me that it's his best performance career. But the plot is so completely inflexible, distinguishing between the stories of several loosely connected figures with such a snail that even when significant life-changing events are seen, they seem to be so meaningless and uninteresting that you find yourself shouting to someone can be blown up or something. <br /> <br /> It doesn't help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathize with (well I didn't think so, but I don't like most people with security). They play out all their rather unspoiled life stories of great length and demonstrate their character errors and emotions in ever so intricate details and play their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffle-soliloquy along the way. Yadda yadda yadda. The soundtrack is also bad, with the puzzling annoying quality that I had so far been unique to Alanis Morisette's music. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was just as much fun to be forced to watch repeatedly an "Friends" episode, while intermittently bumping into the ribs of a disgruntled nanny goat. The bit with the frogs is good though.
