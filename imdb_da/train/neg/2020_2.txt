It seems to be two films: a boring, pretentious, long story about an actor taken over by the parts he plays; the other a brilliant social commentary on a medieval divorce picked up by a waitress. Shelley Winters is wonderful as a waitress with another business on the side. She speaks twenty hints about the need for connections, her certificate of massage and her desire to enter the modeling game. I love glimpses of his seedy surface with a kitchenette behind a curtain and her awful seductive clothing of belly-revealing, puff-sleeved crochet top. <br /> <br /> Do the actors get Oscars to Shakespeare? We know the Oscars to be disabled, have many dentures or pretend to be evil. The Shakespeare scenes (which go to and from) are embarrassing and dated. And then they are "crazy" scenes where Tony looks distracted while listening to his own voice-over. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony John is not aristocratic. He makes it clear in an early stage that he used to be a boy. When he quotes his father's advice, he slips into a Cockney accent.
