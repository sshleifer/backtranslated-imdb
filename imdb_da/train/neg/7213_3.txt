While I am thinking that the Exorcist should be a horror classic, I must admit that I do not do as much as many other horror fans do. As a result, I have not seen many of The Exorcist rip-offs, and if Exorcismo is something to pass by, I must say it is good as this movie is boring as hell and certainly not worth ninety minutes to do it! In fairness to the other exorcist rip-offs, this is often considered to be the worst, and perhaps it might not be the best place for me to start. It's not hard to guess what the plot will be: basically it's the same as in the Exorcist and sees a girl get obsessed with a demonic spirit (which happens to be the spirit of her dead father). The country priest is then called to perform exorcism. Like many Spanish horror films, this is a star Paul Naschy, the best thing about the movie. Exorcismo was directed by Juan Bosch, who had previously directed the derived Spanish Giallo 'The Killer Wore Gloves'. I have not seen any of his other films, but on the basis of these two: I believe that originality was not one of his strong points. There aren't many good things I can say about the film itself; It mostly just plods together and the exorcism scene is not worth waiting for. I definitely do not recommend it!
