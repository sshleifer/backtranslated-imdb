This movie is a perfect fit for the English Flick Unfaithful. Ashmit plays the role of Richard Gere, Emran the of Olivier and Malikka the perfect cheating wife role Lane. They have changed the other half of the film to adapt to the Indian masses. <br /> <br /> Even then, the movie has got the full trace of unfaithfulness, even though it couldn't get the original. It was a cheap soft porn from Bollywood lovers, where Mallika showed much more skin than anyone dared to show. Emran did several roles like this and was even nicknamed the serial killer. In the future, if Indian directors are planning to reuse an English film, then they should explore the possibilities of the plot with the Indian censors. Although the film was bombed at the box office, the actors got the unnecessary recognition. In the future, the directors should be a little more cautious about restoring an Oscar nominated movie. <br /> <br /> Everyone said this is not a family movie, so take that extra care while watching it at home with the family.
