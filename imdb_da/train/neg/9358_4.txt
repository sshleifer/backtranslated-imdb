From the moment the movie begins, there is already a discrepancy. As this film is on the borders of Normandy and the Middle East and is also an international film, one would expect proper accents to be portrayed. This is not done as most of the cast sound American. Also I find the play at best, the story is a little difficult to follow from the beginning. Who is who? Otherwise, the film is very accurate in costume and landscape. If you want to watch a movie to get a feel for what it was like in the past (though the lack of accents), then this movie is worth renting. If you're looking for a movie as epic as the kingdom of heaven, look elsewhere.
