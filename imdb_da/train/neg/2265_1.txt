I love to see Jerry as much as the rest of the world, but this bad excuse for a soft-faced porn girl is unnecessary offensive, lacking something that looks like white, and serves only as a means of promoting Springer. Though it runs a fast 90 minutes, the movie pulls pampered and I should have had common sense going out. Just awful.
