This Hal Roach comedy card, A Tough Winter, is the fifty-nine in the series "Our Gang / Little Rascals" and the eleventh talkie. Bascal a showcase for the black cartoon Stepin Fetchit, which gets a special billing here, we see him go to his cabin where the band hangs out. Farina picks up a love letter from the post to him and is told by Stepin to read it as he cannot read it during the day when he goes to night school. It comes from his girlfriend in Tennesse, so Farina must have her ears filled with cotton as it is too hot for him to hear! In another room, Weezer relays instructions to Mary Ann to make taffy from the radio, but because he continues to drive back and forth in the kitchen, he misses the lady's ad's story for rice pudding and Spanish tamale confusing Mary Ann with additions of Tabasco and Lux! After the composition is completed, Jackie and the rest of the band help with the horrible taste, but very sticky substance, as all are stuck to the walls as a result. As they all try to clean the mess, Stepin works in the basement of various pipes and sockets that mix variable appliances' features a phone that vacuumes, a vacuum that rings, and a refrigerator that plays music! The end. What I have just described highlights the meandering nature of this "Our Gang" card, which served as a pilot for a potential Stepin Fetchit movie short series. It's just as good that it never happened when Fetchy's characterization of the lazy Negro was entertaining only in small doses and would be considered very offensive today. Many of the scenes I have just described are good at some laughs, although the final sequence was so confusing that the results were just too blue for me. So in summary, a hard winter is worth a curiosity to see at least once. By the way, Stepin's real name was Lincoln Theodore Perry.
