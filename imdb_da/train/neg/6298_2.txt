An awful story (Amis on his worst), meaningless and self-conscious 'decadence', obvious shock tactics and eerie action make this movie (rather as "Rancid Aluminum") legitimize everything that went wrong with the very sharp British film growth. The mood is at best lukewarm, and the whole set-up (including some "internet terrorist group" - ooh, how modern) really begins to congratulate. Final summary - A half-baked attempt to be 'edgy' does not make anybody any favors. Still, it is always a pleasure to see Katy Carmichael on the screen ... <br /> <br />
