There is a fantastic moment in * Christmas survivor * that almost makes it worthwhile: James Gandolfini cracks a shovel over Ben Affleck's stupid head. <br /> <br /> This movie is yet another unfortunate example of James Gandolfini, who shows what a great actor he is at the same time defiled at his career by performing in this movie. <br /> <br /> Young and affluent ad exec, Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) has been inculcated to believe that you should never be alone on Christmas. (And from the beginning there is the underlying problem with our suspension of disbelief in this idiotic movie: How many people in Drew's social position in 2004 really care somehow about Christmas being spent alone or with half of the family or with one fifty dollars prostitute?) Storyline finds that Drew buys a family to spend Christmas, assuming they pretend to be his own, ignoring all the indications, on the other hand, that his money hasn't bought the emotions he was looking for. For $ 250,000, a surly suburban driver, Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) and his disheveled wife Christine (Catherine O'Hara) agree to be Drew's ad hoc family against protests from their son, Brian (a very one-dimensional Josh Zuckerman) and daughter , Alicia (a very soft-focused Christina Applegate). Drew then probably uses the rest of the movie to regain his youth or something. The messages in this movie are so twisted and illogical as its dry moon history. Filled with blatant psychoses, Drew plastered a fake smile on his face and blindly remained in denial against any degradation that he was supposed to buy for the Valco family to avoid. <br /> <br /> Which asks the question: If Drew pays these people to regain some mediation of happy family feelings, how psychotic does he have to be happiness among their barbs and mental anxiety over his presence? It is not the case for the Valco family to save their true feelings and pretend to be happy, while those around Drew - three of the four members make it clear that they despise him. Is he so aware that he cannot see that his money does not buy him the "family" atmosphere he was dedicated to believe was a truth in the first place? As with all the movies, this is scary, wondering how * four * scriptwriters might be so confused in their own narcissistic dreams of being shown in a credit sequence that they will overlook any kind of credibility or intelligence. <br /> <br /> Director Mike Mitchell, who was responsible for * Deuce Bigalow: Man Gigolo * - stop right there. "Said Nuff. <br /> <br /> Gandolfini and O'Hara are somehow shining and proving their mettle among this mess. Christina Applegate is willing and cutesy and blonde and fiery in all the right places, scarce cut Drew into small strips of carcass for most of the movie and then make a face and fall in love with him because the script tells her. br /> And I would not go as far as to say that Affleck is a bad actor, but John Schneider looks better over his shoulder, there's a whole new level of Desperately Seeking Talent in town.
