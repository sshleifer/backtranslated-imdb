Like most people, I love "A Christmas Story". I had never even heard of this movie and maybe for good reason - it's terrible. The same site, the same narrator, same director, but the original warmth of the original was lacking. Charles Grodin was a bad choice to replace Darrin McGavin, but I can't imagine anyone being able to replace him. The story seems forced and lacks the sweetness of the original. The interaction with the neighbors, Bumpuses, is ridiculous. In "A Christmas Story" Ralphie's obsession with the BB gun seems sweet, but his obsession with this movie is boring. Scud Farkus, the original neighborhood fight, is replaced in this movie by another child with braces and a strange hat, but with a bit of Scud Farkus threatening appeal. It would be pretty hard to match the original, even though this movie was made with the original crew.
