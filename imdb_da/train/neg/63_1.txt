Holy shit. This was the worst movie I've seen for a long time. All performances are fine, but there is no plot. Really! No plot! A bunch of clowns talk about this and that, and that's your movie. Ug ... Robert Duval's character is senile and asks the same people the same qestions again and again. This serves him the same answer over and over again. I'm pretty sure this movie got up to six because people think they should like it. Good performances with famous and thoughtful actors, but the actual complete work is a steaming ride. Well, maybe it's a little misleading, as steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a bit like something happens, and in this movie nothing happens! Sack
