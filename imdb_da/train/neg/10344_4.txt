So this movie ran in the bad hours on TCM. Several problems with the film were evident from what I saw. First, the adults did not grow when the children did for 10 years. Several parts of the film had continuity problems. For some reason, the actor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when they were 10 years old. <br /> <br /> The copy I saw lacked about 20 minutes or so, at least a large hole with black screen appeared. It is too bad, because even though the manuscript left something to be desired, Bergman & Russell both put well into the film in their roles. It is a shame that the big lump is missing, but what is here can be seen. <br /> <br /> I just wish it was all intact. Scripture does not make sense that Bergman's character has been sent away when the children are small, but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults? Some of the timelines also do not make sense. There is a market crash that resembles 1929, but the children grow up to fight in the First World War. All that goes on by the support people in this movie is fine. Just wonder what was in the 20 column of movies I couldn't see as it was missing.
