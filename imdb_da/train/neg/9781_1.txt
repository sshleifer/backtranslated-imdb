I don't think I'm too far from saying this might be the worst movie I've ever seen. I've been working on a list of my favorite war movies: "The Longest Day," "To Hell and Back," "The River Kwai River" (all black and white), all of which have good plots, rich figures and great plays. I have seen better dialogue and appear in the student school, an action player. The reason, however, is not a bad premise - just poorly implemented. It's a bit like a traffic accident, though I couldn't seem to turn it off! A movie doesn't need big money or big sets, ie. "Twelve angry men" and "lifeboat" to be good ... so the budget is no excuse. What did they think?
