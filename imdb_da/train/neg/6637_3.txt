They should have named this movie ... Blonde women who needed to get their roots colored. Also the protagonist, the fire, the too tight jerseys. The giggle. Thought the guy did a good job though. I hope we find a good 8-star Christmas movie to watch this week. Darts Checkout. Had to laugh too. We still have 3 more on the DVR to see, maybe we will be lucky. Oh yes, I figured the guy right and nailed it when he took up the flowers and then drove out with his cousin. I told my daughter they were going to the cemetery. And how stupid was it that the two gals followed those who spy on them? Spooky.
