How can a larger German TV station emit a mess like this? It's amazing how the main actors avoid any acting talent - even the well-known Gottfried John seems very bad - especially in the double-kill scene - how amateurish .......! The screen plan is very, very extended - maybe to fill 2 parts of the movie. Be careful not to fall asleep while watching! Of course, the set is very often a blue screen, e.g. scenes on the ship with unreal sea in the background ...! In the German version the sound and duplication are very poor - probably due to the different actors' languages ​​- but: other international productions handle this much more professional. Advice: Don't Look - It's a Diabolical Waste of Time!
