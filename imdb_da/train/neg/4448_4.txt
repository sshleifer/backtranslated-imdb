What a powerful start to a movie when Julia Robert's character is punched in the face of her fierce and anal man played by Patrick Bergin, and I felt ready to experience a strong movie on the same level as Farrah Fawcett's The Burning Bed. Well, as the summary says I was misleading. This movie was not like The Burning Bed which had power and Farrah played the part of a woman you really felt for and felt her pain and her need to survive. Sleeping with the enemy struck out after the first act of cheap tensions with Roberts faking her death to flee her husband and go to live in Iowa. Her husband initially believes that she is dead, but begins to grow suspiciously so that she can still live and sit down. The rest of the movie is basically a cat and mouse game with Julia getting a house in this small town in Iowa and changing her identity .... there is nothing to mention how she got the money for this but on this Time in movies I didn't care about all that much. She meets a guy (Mr. Nice wimpy) and falls for him, and her husband finally catches up with her, but not before he re-arranges his soup cans and straightens up the kitchen. This I supposed to give a cheap excitement to the audience. But I didn't care if she was an abused wife because the movie, as I have said, cheated the audience. If it had been the course I might have felt for her and her situation. Of course, the man is killed, and all is well too little ol Mrs Roberts. If only the real world was something close to this .... See the burning bed and you understand what a movie is supposed to be like the subject of house abuse.
