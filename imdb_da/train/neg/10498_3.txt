I caught this by a test screening. All I can say is: What ... the ... hell? This movie plays about as smoothly as Mickey Mouse reads the script to "Scarface." It is bizarre besides making the slightest sense; And even if you leave your brain in the car, the movie is still so bizarre that it's not even fun. The plot involves crocodile hunter Steve Irwin attempting to "save" a crocodile containing a CIA probe. The CIA comes after Irwin to get their probe back, Irwin fails them for poachers and sets out to "stop" them. <br /> <br /> It's about the whole story there is; The rest is over-the-top lampooning of Australian culture ("Did see see?" And "Crikey!") And strangely choreographed action sequences. At one point, Irwin assembles a faster RV and knife fighting with a CIA agent on top of it. Yes, that's right: Steve Irwin knife is fighting a guy on top of an RV. Let it be your guide to this ridiculously bad movie.
