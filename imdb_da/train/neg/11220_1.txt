For a movie with so much promise, it was disappointing, sparsely plotted, and the play ranged between terrible and incredible. The plot had more holes in it than Swiss cheese, and it's the worst clich√© end I've seen in a movie for some time. The final scene would have torn my heart out if the whole movie had not been so painful to begin with. I was numb! From the very first scene there was once wondering if the sister was trying to reach out to her twin for help or just scaring her to death, which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hours of the worst deal I have seen to date. It was a horror in the true sense of the word.
