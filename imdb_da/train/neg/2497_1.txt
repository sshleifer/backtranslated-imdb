There is only one problem with this website, you cannot give a negative assessment. In addition, a friend rated this as a D-grade movie. I say he was too good. A piece of wood could show more emotions that the actors in this movie and the money used to produce this movie would have been better accustomed to starting a fire. This is absolutely horrible, 2 hours of life, that anyone staying in this unsagnetic carnage never comes back. After seeing 5 minutes, myself and the boys asked if it would be more entertaining to sink large weights. Half of the carto and a bottle of 151 later I finally found some of this G class that was extremely fun. It is an insult to this whole planet that the director thought someone could find something beneficial from this more that he should go and buy a rope. And to the actors in this flick, I hope you paid well to be in this joke because I doubt you will ever work again. In summary, I fined everyone in this movie 100 grand and 12 demerit points from your play.
