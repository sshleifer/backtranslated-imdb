Dave goes through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love. "Wanders" is probably not the word. I should say he fixes on the former girlfriend. He recalls the day when the relationship ended. The dream sequences lack only the lazy transitions. He recalls his favorite songs and places where they went. I'm not an advisor, but maybe it has something to do with the failed marriage ???? Dave goes to a support group and meets with a lady half of his age (also divorced) who, instead of being "turned off" by his fate, begins to become interested in him. Did I mention how scary Dave is? He sometimes refers to himself in the third person. He does not move his arms when he walks either. It's just weird. To make a long story short, Dave suddenly chases Mary (the old gal friend) and kills her ... err ... I mean confront her. He does. It was really scary. He believes she must be married, but he still flies halfway across the country to meet her. He jumps out of the house to make sure she is alone before he "falls in" on her. He has an awkward conversation with her who ends up sharing the gospel of Christ with about 10 words or less, and flies back to the new young girlfriend. We enjoyed the movie most for unintentional comedic value. I still entertain wife with my Dave impressions .... "I heard another Dave & Mary sing!"
