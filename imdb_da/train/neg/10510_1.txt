oh god where do you start ...... bad acting .... characters you just don't care about ... are they american or british ... they seem to believe they are in america because where else is this huge forest in the midlands ... a big mistake ... they run all night through these forests ... unless they go around and around they would have been in Scotland come in the morning .. when it whiny one knocks the poor wandering woman over .... <br /> <br /> and they are mobiles do not work .. so what do they ... split of course, make it easier to get picked up ... so three are looking for a house that can be who in the middle of the sky and two stays behind to "care" for the unconscious woman ... so what do they do, rather than making her pleasantly polish her head, cover her up or even move her away from the thriving road, leaving they just lay her on the hard road as they go and make a guy 100 years away .... and all the time they have a camper they could put her in ... <br /> <br /> and on horned angels who would have liked human nature so much that they were expelled from heaven to live among us ... so what do they do? get started with sexual relations with some men they encounter ......... no they bite big chunks out of them and rip their heads away ... i think they lack the point ... <br /> < These are not beautiful, sexually deprived past angels, they are cannabalist vampires ... and as if Tom Savini says how good they are, they are .... Well, they have good organs, but nothing special on the face. starring was far more beautiful than these so-called irresistible sirens ... rubbish movie waste at Â£ 2.30 from my local library ...
