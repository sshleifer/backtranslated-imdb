I thought I watched this movie twice, actually. Then I read all the other reviews and they didn't quite match. One man and three young students, two girls and one boy go to this city to study alleged bigfoot observations. I still feel convinced that this is the movie I saw despite the discrepancies in the reviews. That's why I return my review: If you like the occasional 'B' movie that I do, then return to Boggy Creek, the movie is for you! Whether it's setting the sleep timer and nodding to your favorite movie boom or just hanging out with friends. Boggy Creek, the mute button and you have a fun night for improv. Beware! Is the Legend Real? I think we can just find out, along with a not-so-cast. Will there be errors in the equipment at particularly important moments in the movie? Does our blonde, male, young hero have any breast hair? Will the exceptionally high tech Technicolor last the whole movie? You have to look to find out for yourself.
