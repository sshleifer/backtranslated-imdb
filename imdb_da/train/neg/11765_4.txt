You know what you get when you buy a Hallmark card. A juicy, tired verse and it will be $ 3.99, many thanks. You get the same with a Hallmark movie. Here we get ninety-year-old Ernie Borgnine, who comes out of retirement to tell us that he is actually not dead as we thought. Poor Ernie, he is the poor soul who married Ethel Merman several years ago, and the marriage lasted a few weeks. In this flick, Ernie jumps first in her feet and portrays her grandfather, who ties with her far-lost grandkid. We've seen it before. You like this movie, but please don't say you weren't warned.
