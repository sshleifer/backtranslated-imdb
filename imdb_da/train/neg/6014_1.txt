The left behind is an incredible waste of more than $ 17 million. The action is weak and uninspiring, the story is even weaker. The audience is asked to believe in the totally incredible and many times ridiculous plot and give nothing in return for their good faith. Not only is the film badly acted and the manuscript is seriously lacking in all the technical areas of filmmaking. The production design does nothing to contribute to the credibility of the action. The effects are completely unoriginal and flat. The lighting and overall continuity are incredibly awful; even compared to movies with one tenth of the budget. However, none of this will mean that millions of families will no doubt embrace the movie because it is healthy and it is religious fate; and who can blame them. However, it is unfortunate that they are forced to accept 3rd rate amateur movie creation.
