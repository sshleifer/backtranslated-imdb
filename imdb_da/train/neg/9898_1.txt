This version of "Moby Dick" offends the audience by claiming that it is based on Melville's novel - even go as far as showing a fake first chapter sentence instead of the famous "Call me Ishmael". Besides having terrible action, even from John Barrymore, this is perhaps the best example of how far Hollywood (especially early Hollywood) would go to revise and change a famous novel just to increase its chances at the cashier's office. The novel's beautiful, poetic language has been completely eradicated, and Ahab has been transformed from a bursting, blasphemous, obsessive madman into a dashing, misguided hero who only wants to kill Moby Dick after his fiance (!) turns away from him after having seen his wooden leg. To this is added the standard evil brother who wants the fianc√© for himself and another end!
