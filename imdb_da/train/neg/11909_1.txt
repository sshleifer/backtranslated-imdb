I think I found the most misogynistic movies of all time: Darklight. <br /> <br /> The film was Lilith, Adam's first wife, and she was considered imperfect and banished from the Garden of Eden because she considered Adam straight and refused to submit. Look, I took these words right from the script. Then the movie continues and even though she is the movie's heroine, the only time she becomes acceptable is when she does what the men tell her to do! She ends the film under the control of The Faith - an all male group! <br /> <br /> Except that the script was predictable and FX was terrible. Apart from the obvious hatred of women, who are usually much more subtle in modern films, there was no original about Darklight.
