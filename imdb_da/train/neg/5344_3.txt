You remember the Spice Girls movie and how bad it was (besides the songs), and their manager Simon Fuller (also this band's manager) made the same mistake of putting S Club (one of my favorite bands) in their own movie. S Club: Tina Barrett, Jon Lee, Bradley Mcintosh, Jo O'Meara, Hannah Spearritt and Rachel Stevens (what happened to the seventh member, Paul Cattermole?) Basically ask their boss for a break, they move on and while they are watching themselves on tv! Three of them switch, and vice versa, half discover that they are clones made by a greedy scientist, and the other half just comes into trouble. Also starring Gareth Gates as a clone by itself. This movie may have more of a plot than Spice Girls' movies, but besides the songs "Bring it All Back", "Do not Stop Movin" and "Never Had A Dream Come True", there is no goo reason to watch this movie . Not too long after the band split for good. Sufficient!
