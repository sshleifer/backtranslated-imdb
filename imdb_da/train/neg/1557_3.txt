The film is basically a boring series of scary cliches that do not provide a true cross-cultural insight. The eastern part of the journey is described in a particularly annoying way: there are, of course, mudflat villages, dirt tracks in the middle of the desert, women dressed in black clothes and belly dances. I wonder how camels and data palms were missing from the whole picture. Personality of the two main characters is very wisely outlined, and many situations are hardly credible. <br /> <br /> The original idea might have been interesting, but at the end of the day, if you're looking for cultural insights, skip this movie.
