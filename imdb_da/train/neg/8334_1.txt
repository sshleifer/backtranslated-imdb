This has the utmost worst performance by Robert Duval, which resembles William Buckley throughout the movie. His hammy melodramatic plays take away from any dramatic interest. I'm not sure if this was intentional or unintentional, but that's the only thing I can remember from a truly forgotten movie. This image should be displayed in each amateur acting class of an example of what not to do. God God, Duvall went on to bigger and better things and stopped trying to influence a cultured accent. He's a good character actor, but it's about it. Klaus is so much better. His performance is subdued and remarkable.
