The story has been rehashed a number of times; "a breath of life in the guest house". More games, movies, novels, short stories, poems and news articles have hit the subject at no end, but it is still an excellent platform for character studies. <br /> <br /> If 'Gideon' was created more enthusiastically, it could be brilliant, but the dialogue is painfully boring, and the story is completely flooded with clich√©s (even the subtitle and summary of Gideon's "simple wisdom" almost made me able to laugh at its inefficiency). For the most part, indifferent action is the last straw for this weak film, but the rest is gentle enough to make the actors' lack of focus almost irrelevant.
