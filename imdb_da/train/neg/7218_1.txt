There is a scene near the beginning after a shootout where horses run. If something red catches your eye, it is because a white van is parked behind a shrub by the path. I thought I had looked bad, but it is. A white van in a western. Didn't they get this? Oh yes, and I paid top dollar on the rent. It will make you grab your friends and get them all set in 10 grand and make a better movie. The speakers were so slow, the play was mostly OK, but could not be taken seriously because of the bad character of the film. There is a sheriff's door that looks like a door today with the special trimming. I say watch this movie and move Cabin Boy to # 2 at worst worst time.
