It was hard to see this movie and be quite fair and objective as I am a big fan of the original 1944 movie. That, for me and many others, is one of the biggest movies noirs ever made. Realizing this is simply a shortened movie for movies and that most people had wasted it, I don't expect much, but you can't help comparing this with '44 movies. Scene after scene I found myself comparing what I looked at and remembering how it played out with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson and others. Now I saw these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by Richard Crenna, Samantha Eggar and Lee J. Cobb. <br /> <br /> When it was over, I didn't find it as bad as I expected but it's no match for the 1944 original. The two main areas where this television for television was not so good were (1) the electricity between the two leaders was lacking and (2) only 90 minutes, they hastily hastened the story to develop the plot, signs and chemistry between these leaders. Crenna and Eggar were flat, and simply no match for MacMurray and Stanwyck as "Walter Neff" and "Phyllis Dietrichson" respectively. <br /> <br /> Where this re-husband held his own was in the other characters, such as "Barton Keyes" and "Edward Norton." Cobb was great as Keyes and Robert Webber as Norton, the head of the insurance company. It was also interesting to see the time frame changed, so the houses, cars, phones, dictation machines, etc. Were all early 70s instead of the mid-40s. Otherwise, the storylin was very similar, just rushed. <br /> <br /> But a view was enough and I will happily go back to the original version for the rest of my pictures of this classic story and movie.
