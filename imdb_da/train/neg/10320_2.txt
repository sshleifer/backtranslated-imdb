I really hoped this would be a fun show, given all the hype and the clear preview clips. And talking about hype, I've even heard an interview with the show's creator on BBC World Today - a show broadcast worldwide. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this show doesn't even come close to delivering. All the jokes are obvious - the kind that looks funny the first time you hear them, but after it looks paralyzed - and they don't get any new treatment or twist. All characters are one-dimensional. The actor is - well mediocre (I'm delicious). It's the classic CBC recipe - one that always fails. <br /> <br /> If you are a Muslim, I think you will be stupid to believe in the white characters, and if you are white, you will probably be offended by the fact that almost all the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted, ignorant or both. Not making fun of white people is a problem - most of the better comedies are rooted in it. It's just a problem when it's not fun - like in this show. Canada spreads with fun people - so many that we export them to Hollywood regularly. So how could the producers of this show not find anyone?
