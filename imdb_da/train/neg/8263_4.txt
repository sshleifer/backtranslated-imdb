'Mojo' is a story of the fifties of London, a world of budding rock stars, violence and forced homosexuality. "Mojo" uses a technique to shoot the 1950s, often seen in films that emphasize the physical differences of their own time, but also represent the dialogue in a very exaggerated manner (due to the way the speech was represented in films made in that period); I have no idea that people actually spoke like that outside the movies, but no movies made today and in modern times use such a stylized language. It is as if the depicted discourse of the 1950s is scriptwriters serving a common shorthand for a past that apparently is a very distant country; and therefore emphasizes the special, rather than the universal, in history. 'Mojo' has a strong performance from Ian Hart and annoying from Aiden Gillan and Ewan Bremner, the latter still struggling to build a post-trainspotting career; But feels like a period, a modern film incomprehensibly structured in an obsolete idiom. Rather boring, actually.
