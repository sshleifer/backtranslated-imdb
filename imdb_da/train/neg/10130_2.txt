I own almost every Seagal movie (yes even such as this is low budget) and it has to be the worst, not just of his movie, but of all the movies ever made. The only highlight of this movie, and only the reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, is that A. it's Seagal, and B. Seagal has some cute action sequences, especially in the store, and also when he otherwise takes it out a whole army with a knife. Next time, giving me 90 minutes of Seagal killing people and not even breaking a storyline because the story not only stinked, but it also made the fact that F-18 and F-14 were somehow changed to F- 16s and also the fact that Stealth was as fast as an F-16. Also Stealth never had to revive ??? And since when is Afghanistan considered a hostile territory from an air force stand. Lastly, I checked that Afghanistan has no air force, we (the United States) control the sky. Also, this secret mission was played through loudspeakers for all the crew in space, but the admiral still whispers to the other guy that it is secret. Also, how did Seagal go from the bottom of the truck to the top? PLease tell us why they imprisoned him. Since when are Air Force pilots great commands (unless they are Owen Wilson?) And since when are their drunks in Arab countries because Muslims do not drink alcohol? Also on top of that since Arabs listen to orders from women as # 2 responsible? The highlight of the movie was certainly Seagal killing people in the store, and the other 50 people he killed with a knife, as well as the very short and completely random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere.
