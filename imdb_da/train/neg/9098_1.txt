There is a reason why some movies go directly to video, and of course the obvious reason is that if it is too naughty for theater publishers, drop it directly to video. It would of course not be reasonable for the movies that are good, and yet they are also released directly to video. This is not an exception, although the film has good actors or at least potential actors: Amy Adams (Oscar nominated and talented actress), Robin Dunne, who deserves better or at least a better agent, and Sara Thompson who deserves roles that are a departure from teen melodramas. The film is also erroneous: this movie takes place before Terrible Intentions, therefore this film is actually a prequel and rather stupid. This was a waste, and it is really a movie that is at the same level as softcore porn and pay-per-view masturbation movies. Fortunately for those actors, they will hopefully delete this from their resumes. So if you are looking to see something crazy but don't have the courage to buy porn, then rent this movie as a starter.
