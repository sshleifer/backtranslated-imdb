Stupid and just plain strange movie about a child being traumatized when he finds out Santa is not really (???). He grows up and becomes an adult (Brandon Maggart) who makes lists of people who are naughty or cozy. One Christmas, he snaps and sets out to kill the naughty people - dressed as Santa Claus of course. Drilling and just plain killing Santa movies. If you're looking for things, it's not here. Only a few of the murders are shown and they are not so crazy with very false effects. Most of the movie contains just Brandon Maggart, who speaks to himself and slowly becomes crazy. The script is tired, the play is terrible, and it leads to an end that made me stare at the bed in the TV. Seriously, I had to rewind the tape and watch it again to make sure I wasn't hallucinating! Really really bad end. <br /> <br /> If you want a scary Christmas girl rental "Black Christmas" (the original 70s version - NOT the horrible remake). Avoid this at all costs.
