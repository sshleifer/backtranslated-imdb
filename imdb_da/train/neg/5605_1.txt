I was very disappointed with this movie. I was expecting more of a Thelma and Louise female crime film. Instead, the woman's prison escapes in this flick, had no sense of loyalty to each other. They were an extremely vulgar package of hyenas that beat each other, double crossed and even committed lesbian rape to other women in the movie. <br /> <br /> Instead of being screwed thieves who are stuck together to plan their escape and find the hidden stash of money, the women refugees were too selfish and evil to trust each other for too long. These women were not liberated in a positive sense. They ended up being a bunch of loose cannons, unable to respect themselves or each other. If you like 70's female crime movies, skip this bomb and watch The Great Texas Dynamite Chase, which stars Claudia Jennings and Jocelyn Jones.
