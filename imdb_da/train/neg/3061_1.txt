This movie is horrible. Give me the dentist anytime! Can you believe that one of the biggest TV stations here in Arabia had this as their Christmas movie! I can only assume they expected to entertain the crowds with Dudley Moore rather than this. The last time I looked at my hot water bottle, it had more plays, better plot, more drama and much more interest than this celluloid waste. Don't see it if you're full!
