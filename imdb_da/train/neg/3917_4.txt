"The House of Spirit" is quite terrible. I live in South America in a country that suffers from a military dictatorship like what the film is trying to describe, and although everyone knows that movies can be far away from reality, this film treats those viewers as both ignorant and stupid. Things are not as simple and linear as here, and of course political process is much more complicated and interesting to plot in "The House ...". If you can't show that the complexity of the screen is better, you can't make a movie at all. There are many examples of how politics can be taken seriously in the cinema, without so many common places. In some parts, I felt that Carmen Miranda might appear in parrots and palms. When you talk about certain things, be careful not only but respect for your public intelligence.
