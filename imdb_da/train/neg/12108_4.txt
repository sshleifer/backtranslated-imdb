Just write one liner, but it really is. I love the gangster genre and this is the weakest entry I've seen in recent years. I praise everyone involved in most aspects except the most important, script. It's a faint story about a petty criminal. No amount of fine or black and white film styling can make up for a complete lack of substance. I love Kevin Spacey and I hear he will make another movie about the general. My advice is not wasting your time.
