In the title I write that the story is ridiculous. below I will elaborate and tell you why it destroys this movie in my humble opinion. Gere and Danes do their job, and although it is not their best work, it is quite ok. The rest of the throw, however, does a really bad job. Imagine, it's not quite the actors' fault. The problem is that Gere and the Danes are the only ones who have characters that even have the smallest space in the film to really give depth. All other characters have too little space in the movie to create depth, or the character is such a cliché that it doesn't matter how hard the actors try. <br /> <br /> The manager has suffered from a Se7 complex, but only looks in the direction, I think he does an OK job. <br /> <br /> But the story. This is the type of script that is bad in two ways. First of all, it's a bad movie script. The characters are superficial (except Gere's and Danes' characters), the bad guys are clichés, and the actions of the characters are absolutely incredible. In addition, the authors must have an agenda where they want to bring back our views and ethical hundred years. It's the kind of movie that says some criminals are still criminals, even though they've paid the price that society has given them. It is also the kind of film that says, though only between the lines, that any form of sexual deviation must be punished without trial, judge or jury. And of course, everything that is not sex in the missionary position of a married couple is, according to a film, a sexual deviation. <br /> <br /> So if you are going to film school and need an example of a bad script or if you write script yourself and want an ego boost. See it. For everyone else, I recommend another movie.
