I spent almost two hours on a movie I thought, with all the good actors in it, would be worth watching. I couldn't believe it when the movie ended, and I had absolutely no idea what had happened ..... I was angry because I could have used then to do something else ... I was trying to figure out of all but really had no idea. Thanks to those who figured it out and explained it .... right or wrong, it's better than not knowing anything !! Who was the lady in the dark hair movie that we saw a few times away? How did the first lady know that her husband was cheating on her? At the end of the movie, Kate said she would eventually find out the truth. Does that mean that we will be exposed to End Game 2?
