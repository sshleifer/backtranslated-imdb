I watched this movie last night and hoped for the best after seeing all the cool trailers. Although the DVD's cover looked good. As soon as I started to see it, I thought as others "Oh my God what is this". There were some moments that were a little scary, but the mood was ruined by silly music. There were rock and opera under what were going to be exciting scenes. It just ruined it for me, and I shook my head and thought wrong. I wasted money again on a rental and was stunned by the cover. Nothing against the music itself, it was just in the wrong parts of the movie. The one who edited the film has no idea what they are doing. The cover showed lightning strikes, which meant that they were caught in a storm on the sea. It would have been more interesting, but it did not happen. The action was not the worst I have ever seen in view of the fact that they are all unknown, and this is clearly their first film. Another reason I was disappointed was that the plot had no meaning. In the beginning, 2 men saw all teenagers on a boat, so at the end apparently there was only one girl, and the others were either her imaginary friends or ghosts, I'm not sure because it was very poorly portrayed. WhyteFox, who wrote a comment here, claims that this is a true story. He or she believes in ghosts and spirits and says there is a haunted boat in the area where the film was filmed. There was no mention in this film that it was a true story. I have never experienced anything like it personally, but do not say it is impossible. I guess if anyone is interested in renting this movie, do it at your own risk. If you like amateur movie movie, you might like it here.
