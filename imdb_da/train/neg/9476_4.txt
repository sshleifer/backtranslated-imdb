Pretty crazy whodunit with a black black cast trying to figure out who murdered the philandering trumpet player who was just going to Hollywood to make it big. Was it his wife? His girlfriend? His will-be friend? Her father? His Butler? Newspaper guy? Who knows? And who cares? The result of this is just a little overwhelming, and the actors here don't really make me break some way to find out. Why snake poison like a weapon? Who knows? So what? The music in this is okay but there is a bit of it and most of it is beautiful "let's get it over with" This is not worth your time. There are better all-black casted movies out there.
