I just happened to stumble upon surfing this movie channel. my first reaction was 'oh god not again!'. it is so hip to play retard these days it has become pretentious and honestly despicable. For some reason, however, I was and saw it to the end. Maybe it was my belief in the actors, hoping they would give me something to cheer about. <br /> <br /> And surely you can know and helena act. Also the film progresses to something better towards the end and actually makes a point. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter also surprised me with her character. Jane has a medium side that she uses to keep away and reject pity. so again she has a soft side that is just looking for love. the only thing that surprised me even more was Branagh's character ... it was a triumph of acting, the film itself is not unique. <br /> <br /> See if you are an acting student ... if you are looking for pure entertainment you can skip this one. it's sean pen seriously! Oh my, it was a little hard, it has a few jokes ... not for escapists.
