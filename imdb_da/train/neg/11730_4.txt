Investigative reporter Darren McGavin (as Carl Kolchak) is back; this time he is after "The Night Strangler". Once again, police authorities and other journalists do not believe or will cover the supernatural angle. Producer Director Dan Curtis presents the same basic story as his previous "Night", with understandably less success. <br /> <br /> Mr. Curtis brings together a fun entertainment casting that is included is "Dark Shadows" alumni George DiCenzo and Ivor Francis. Jo Ann Pflug (like Louise Harper) leads a sexy collection of belly dancers. And although I have never seen it mentioned anywhere, it must be Roger Davis as Mr. McGavin's dining companion in an early stage that fails to disbelieve in the existence of vampires! <br /> <br /> **** Night Strangler (1/16/73) Dan Curtis ~ Darren McGavin, Jo Ann Pflug, Simon Oakland, Wally Cox
