So much is wrong with this extremely small, wet wing of a movie that is hard to know where to start. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, it's a remarkably scary scary movie, even by Amercian standards. The dialogue is clich√©, the characters are two-dimensional, the writing is high, and the small story is neither coherent nor externally interesting. <br /> <br /> We meet the following stereotypes in order: Balding Loser Guy (probably divorced, but who knows? This movie does not tell us) with a brave heart, the young hero (who does nothing heroic at all), Brave Little Kid (with a murderous strike a mile wide) and Black Bad-Ass Bitch (with more bend than brains). These guys are struggling with the Tall Scary Reaper Man and his evil Ewoks. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the movie is full of evil little metal orbs jumping around threatening people. Given a chance, they perform improvised brain surgery on those who do not have mental acuity to appear when they come to them. Booh! In fact, one of them is haunted by a good ghost (but then again, it can be a fraud) that seems to be intending to help our brave contraceptives fetch their young kidnapped friend. There are no sign backgrounds or even an introduction to any of the characters. It starts with a kind of resumption of the end of the previous movie, but it doesn't explain much. If you've seen the first two movies, fine. Otherwise, you do not know who these people are, how they are related, why they are not in school or at work, or why you should care about whether they live or die. That's why you don't. The only point of interest is some splattering effects. And there aren't enough of them to keep you awake. <br /> <br /> Of the potential interest / amusement, the three Raider Punks are as stupid as they are evil, threatening Our Heroes. But they do not get much screen time. They are offed almost instantly. Then they are buried (why someone should take the time beyond me), then they are again shown as Evil Raider Punk Zombies. Only to be turned off again, literally within a minute. The rest of the movie seems to consist of Caspar, the friendly Ghost that arises and disappears, drives around and looks for places, and Balding Loser tries to score as Bad Black Bitch Booty, using pickup lines that would scare a mentally retarded teenager. No dice there; Not even any gratuitous sex could have saved this movie, so good things are never there. <br /> <br /> The head baddie, called Tall Man, fails to scare anyone older than 3 years; howling "Booooy!" every five minutes is not enough. Why is he, with his amazing telekinetic powers and grim upper body strength, not just squash our heroes as errors are not explained. Instead, he delegates the job to his inactive, retarded small minions, who never manages to kill anyone before being shot to hell. <br /> <br /> Moviegoers who like masterpieces like "Friday 13th XXXXVIII: Jason goes to college" might find some entertainment. The rest of us who have developed pubic hair will get bored with our skulls.
