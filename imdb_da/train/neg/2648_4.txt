I just finished reading a book about Anita Loos' work, and the photo in TCM Magazine of MacDonald in his angel costume looked stunning (impressive wings) so I thought I'd see this movie. I had never heard of the movie before, so I had no predictions about it at all. Thought it was a great start with Eddy as a playboy and MacDonald as the secretary he doesn't know exists. The scene where she experiences on the costume party in her simple angel outfit with an uncooperative halo and wings that will not continue was really endearing. I was even with the movie when Eddy slept and imagined her as a real angel. But after a while it just started to fall apart for me. Eddy becomes "sleeping" for the rest of the movie, so it's quite a dream. Whatever happens from there, it doesn't matter because he just dreams. The rest of it was largely plot smaller and meaningless. I had to force myself to hold on to it. And the final number where MacDonald goes from musical number to musical number in some crazy hallucination was simply freaky. Had Eddy "woken up" an earlier and the original story continued, or had he really married an angel, I think it would have been much more interesting. I wanted to see more of her real character. <br /> <br /> There were not enough music to call it a musical. The first few songs were good, but the jitterbug number that MacDonald performs was like nails on a blackboard. Absolutely wrong for her operational voice. Still, Eddy and MacDonald still manage to shine and show what true stars they were.
