This is a weird hacked movie, you get the feeling that the bond company had to get into this, I'm not surprised there are no credits on it, who would like to be affiliated with this movie. The action of everyone involved is horribly stolen and the plot jumps all the way through, all of which makes very little sense. As I said before, it seems that the bond company had to come in because it seemed that there were many recordings that were not shot to be, and the whole music was very poorly mounted on library music. Very, very strange. I can actually buy a DVD about it if it could tell me what the hell was going on and what happened to this movie.
