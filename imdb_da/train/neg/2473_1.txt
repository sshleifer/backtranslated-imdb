If my grandmother made movies they'd probably do much better than this one ... incredibly bad ... the protagonists (mother, father and son) are okay. Especially her mother is a wonderful actress and the child also turns out to be a good one especially on the scenes, where he should be frightening. However, the instructor knows the meaning of the words Plot Point, Triller and Good Script. The script has no evolving atmosphere to become an exciting thing. If you like being chased by trees, you can probably enjoy it, or just stay home and sleep. Oh ... actually there was something funny: The movie is from 2001, but we couldn't realize it because the picture is so bad (as on mini-dv) and the cars are so old (like the 70s and 80s).
