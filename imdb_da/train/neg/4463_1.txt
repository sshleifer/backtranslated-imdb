This is one of the movies that will allow you to have the time you spent watching it back and watch some of the time you accidentally picked it out, the time you spent for the video store etc <br /> <br /> First, the look: It's grainy, it's low budget. Now it does not in itself make a bad movie. But the way it was filmed makes the action look unnatural, so it's a little distracting. <br /> <br /> So the story. 3 gals go on a crazy weekend away from guys. Of course, as everyone does when they go on a camping trip, they stop for earrings. When they arrive in the area where they will stay, they are pulled over by Mr Ranger Sir, who scolds them to throw a lit cigarette out of the car during the fire and then drive them where they go (a remote cabin). Of course, 2 cute boys wander into their vicinity, and Bambi (yes, Bambi) and Aubry are immediately beaten, but Bambi is apparently knocked off with two legs. Mady is quite disappointed with this development because she was looking forward to a weekend of forgetting her items by getting sh ** - face and rocky with her galpals. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I almost forgot there is an average old hermit that lives up to the way it might be a person who doesn't get in the way and the area and cabin where they live , has a kind of "reputation". So of course, soon or later (unfortunately much later) some of our weekend tree visits begin to die and find different booby traps (though a few of them actually hit a little lower than that) and of course the remaining campers are understandably disturbed. No cell phone reception of course (who would miss a chance to check their cell phone for reception in a movie anymore?). Mr. Ranger Sir keeps popping up at odd times and his behavior seems a bit odd, but he has said he will get help. <br /> <br /> There is a great twist to this that you just won't miss if you are still awake. Ask that you wake up to a blank screen. <br /> <br /> The action in this is terrible, the production values ​​are awful and the whole company is just lame and I find it great it was even released. Avoid at all costs 1 in 10.
