There are lots of great people in this movie. That's probably the best thing about it. Maybe it even makes it worth seeing. <br /> <br /> "Loaded" tells the story of Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe), a young man who is putting his mark on the world. He is the son of a wealthy family with a good reputation, and he is on his way to law school. But like so many such settings, things are not quite perfect as they look. Expectations in this family far outweigh the love. With the exception of school, Trista's father rarely lets him leave the house. This seems to be the result of a previous traumatic event that shook the family, which is partially revealed through flashbacks, but is not spelled out to the very end. The Tristane's claustrophobic environment causes him to loosen in very extreme ways at the first possible opportunity when his friends take him to a strip club to celebrate his graduation. The celebration soon follows some strippers back to a beach house party, and from there, Tristan befriend Sebastian Cole (Corey Large), pulling him into a drug dealing underworld. <br /> <br /> While technically well-crafted, movie is suffering from a noisy script and a story that's not very engaging. Also counting against this movie are some constant camera tricks that generally seemed to be annoying and out of place, such as slow motion, fast movement, freezing frames and echoes. These are the types of effects that an instructor can usually use to show a sign perspective while on medication, except in this case, they seem to have been sporadically thrown into random points, in some cheap style attempts. <br /> <br /> Despite its relative unfamiliar caste, the performances were good everywhere, especially with respect to the Corey Large. I suppose we will see at least a few of these people in bigger and better projects in the future. <br /> <br /> Of course, when you mention the actors, I must mention their appearance. Rating based on hotness, score these movies a 11. The women in this movie are incredible looks and almost distract you from what a boring movie you see. I'm sure the male characters are also quite attractive, but you'll have to ask someone else to comment. <br /> Overall, I can't recommend this movie, not to buy, rent, or even watch for free. Unfortunately, it's just not the effort it takes to get through.
