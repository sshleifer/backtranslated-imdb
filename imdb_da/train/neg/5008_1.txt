There is no need to watch this movie. A good plot idea is handled very poorly. In the middle of the film everything changes and from there, there is little meaning. The cause of the killing has not been clarified. The action is horrible. Nick Stahl obviously needs a better director. He was excellent in the bedroom, but here he is horrible. Amber Benson from Buffy has to change his character one day. Even those of you who enjoy sex and violence are disappointed. Although the movie was 80 minutes, which is too short for a good movie (but too long after that), there are no deleted scenes in the DVD, which means they never bothered to fill in the missing parts for the characters. <Br /> <br /> Don't spend time on this.
