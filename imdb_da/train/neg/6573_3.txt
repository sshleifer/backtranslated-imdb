I read the reviews for this and do not expect to save private Ryan, I expected a movie of some substance. The movie starts very lob-sided with the usual history story and how the device came to be. But immediately it is 1944, and you are not sure where everyone is. The centers etc. are very poor as this unit is supposed to be Hawaiian / Asian American, but everyone speaks in a very bad take on Harvard English imitation of a Japanese person. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 3 out of 10 as after 10 minutes I couldn't see more of it. The signs were one-dimensional, and although they were most likely based on real people, I had no sense for them, and it didn't care for them. Very poor direction for a very average TV movie that will be shown at midnight on some cable channels. I would avoid and look for better efforts. <br /> <br /> This is a good story, but it deserved a better story. You have a feeling that the director had seen bands of brothers and thought it was enough to sell his movie. My advice, avoid and watch bands of brothers, Tuskegee airmen, Glory or any other movie as when trumpets fade ...
