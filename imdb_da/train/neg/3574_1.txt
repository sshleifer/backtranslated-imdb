I simply couldn't finish this movie. I voted for what I would say is my nomination for the most miserable attempt at sexual suggestion: a scene where Pia Zadora in a picnic stands between two boys who want her. One (the good boy) encourages her to see the error in her ways. The other (the bad boy) simply asks if she wants a hot dog, which he then endures for her. At step level. I hope I don't spoil anything to say she turns and takes the hotdog with a smile. Just pathetic.
