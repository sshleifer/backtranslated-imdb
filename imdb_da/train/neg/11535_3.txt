Gillian Anderson is an arrogant, driven career woman who occupies working class and Danny Dyer for a night of fun. After a stupid accident in the country, they are brutally attacked. After taking care of and after an adventurous meeting with one of the attackers, their thoughts become vengeance of revenge ... I thought "Straightheads" was terrible. Violent, brutal, misogynistic and unpleasant. If I do not deviate much from the phrase, I will call "Straightheads" a video nasty. It was certainly the kind of movie that would have had no budget release just for video in the dark days of the 1980s. Frankly, I do not know how "Straightheads" got a cinema release. <br /> <br /> I'm not a prude. I don't care about sex and violence in the movies, but they must be married to a movie with a) a good plot or b) good characterization or c) preferably both. "Straightheads" had neither. No progression in the plot or signs and too much left inexplicable and invisible. Fortunately, "Straightheads" went nowhere fast. It was only 80 minutes long. It was a shame because there was a germ of an interesting movie here, with a particularly interesting trip in the plot in the last third. How often do I say this, but it could have been good if it had been done properly. What a shame. I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer, but they were hiding for nothing with this movie. She is particularly undervalued (and is still very suitable). <br /> <br /> To see a good British revenge movie, rent or buy Shane Meadows 'Dead Man's Shoes'. It is a small masterpiece. Last weekend I should have seen his "This Is England" instead. Ce sera sera ...
