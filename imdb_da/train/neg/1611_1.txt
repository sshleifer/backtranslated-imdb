I think this is horribly produced and directed movie. Benicio Del Toro should not work with the production of films, he should focus on his plays and that is it. Steven Soderbergh missed the whole idea of ​​the idea of ​​revolution, of its ideals and most importantly of Che Guevara's life and so on. The camera is terrible as if someone with 2 days work experience shoots with it, music is ... I don't know .. is there any music in the movie ???? I would not recommend this piece of sh .. to anyone. It just wastes about 4 hours in front of the TV or anything .... I can't figure out how anyone can rate this movie more than 3 stars. FAST .... FAST .... FAST .... ADVICE Do not look please. Save yourself from this misery of "movie"
