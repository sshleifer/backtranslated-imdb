This can be one of the worst movies that ever makes it into production, ever. <br /> <br /> 1. The most exciting part is the beginning where the guy goes ... and goes ... and goes (spoiler). It's about. 15 minutes walk. How? <br /> <br /> 2. Not to mention there are many problems with the lighting and it is almost as if they even shot night scenes during the day. <br /> <br /> 3. The action was horrible. It seems that they found a community theater (in Mexico) ... and then they took people who were turned away. <br /> <br /> For all the love of love, don't rent this movie. If you know someone who owns it, excuse them. The director should be punished through the war crime court to pursue this on the public.
