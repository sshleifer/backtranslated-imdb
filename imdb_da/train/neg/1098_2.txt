I got this movie in $ 5 bin on walmart. I would not recommend seeing this feature. I can give it to one of my friends if I'm angry with them and want them to suffer for 2 hours. <br /> <br /> I looked at the cover and the foam through the summary and thought it was a war movie. I wish I would have known how boring this movie would be before turning it on. It was my mistake to think that something should happen in this movie. It's just a group of people who go from one boot camp to another. Drilling margins treat the soldiers very badly, and the protagonist tries to help people fight in Vietnam. Okay, here's my rant about this movie: For me, this movie is slow and hard to see. It was just one of the movies you put in and stuck because you want to turn it off, but you're connected with a hope that it can pick up at the end. It doesn't. After the movie was over I was through it behind my T.V. because I was angry that I wasted almost 2 hours in my life and looked at it and another 10 minutes wrote this review to warn people about it.
