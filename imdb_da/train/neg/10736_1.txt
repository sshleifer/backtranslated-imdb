The movie starts with an exciting scene, three people drink and make a small talk in a bar. Everyone is making a bit of monstrous stories. When the film unfolds, it turns out that the most monstrous story is true. But besides that, the film is not very interesting except for the stage in the bar and the scene where the main secret is revealed. This revelation is almost half an hour in the film and honestly, there is not much left to be seen. The rest of the time the director is lingering in a God-forsaken Russian village full of pitiful and eerie old ladies. Sure these are fascinating and somewhat shocking images, but admiring them goes too long and sacrifices any possible plot or character development. I found this movie as another example of either miserable or lazy film making, instead of trying to make an interesting story concentrating on strange fascinating images and through a couple of almost unrelated stories (the case - history of the meat dealer) spectator to find out all odds and goals. On a surface it is artificial appearance, but in this particular case nothing but a lack of talent.
