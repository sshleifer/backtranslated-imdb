This is the second movie I saw for Horrorfest last weekend, The Gravedancers was the first. Gravedancers were better. I can only guess from looking at this that the production must have been quite limited. I will admit the story started interesting but really fizzled for me in the end. We didn't really get the time to sympathize or understand any of the signs that only made each of their irregular features even more annoying. I must mention that there was also some misconception with a 12-year-old boy who served as a sheriff. The only reason I sat through the whole movie was to find out what the big secret was, which turned out not to be so interesting. Something more background about the family would have helped, but they didn't really seem like a family at first. <br /> <br /> For me, this movie is so amateur that I couldn't even put it on DVD. The four ratings are for the initial potential that history may have had. This was one to skip horrorfest.
