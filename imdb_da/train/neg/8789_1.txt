I checked this out on DVD for a dollar so I could easily smile as this terrible movie unfolds. Every time you think it can't get worse, it does inevitably. The action is absolutely horrible. the plot does not make any sense at all. The title "cold revenge" in the American DVD version has absolutely nothing to do with the script. The action scenes are so clearly taken in their first tag. There are many errors in dialogues suggesting that there is nothing to do once again to at least try to make this movie bearable. I can't remember seeing a worse movie, and I sometimes get bad - well except for unstoppable Wesley Snipes. No, who am I doing fun, while a bad, unstoppable deserves best picture prizes on the Oscar's compared to this piece of crap.
