Richard Dreyfuss is actually in this flick, but in a rather small part. He is NOT the "obsessed" filmmaker - he is the group's business administrator / accountant. Even the box describes the film inaccurately. There are no erotic scenes with Sondra Locke as advertised unless you use the term "erotic" rather loosely. I would not have considered watching the movie without Richard Dreyfuss being in it as a great character. I might have realized that the famous 60s anthem, Leonard Cohen's "Suzanne," was an artistic influence. Apart from the short recitation of lines from the end of James Joyce's "Ulysses" and an interesting visual reference to the end of Ingmar Bergman's "The Seventh Seal", I found the slight attempt to symbolize symbolic elements and moods immortalized in films as "Last year at the Marian Bath" and "Un Chien Andalou." If you like the idea of ​​the eccentric artistic troupe, there are many superior films ranging from "Bye, Bye, Brazil" to "Cecil B. Demented."
