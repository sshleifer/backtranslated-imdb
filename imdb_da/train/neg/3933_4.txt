A big hit on the Australian audience release, it can still be fun today, but its overall political inaccurate and blunt, uninhibited humor can make it a bit of a warrior. It goes too long; some of the contents could have been hidden for the successor, Barry McKenzie keeps his own, desperately needed some new stuff anyway. Granted, his ocher Aussie attitude is fun, but also gets annoying when the movie pulls on. Some say Crocker's songs are the best bits and they are definitely original, but "funny"? Barry McKenzie's fairy tale goes down as a landmark in Australian cinema, but we should do everything possible to ensure that overseas audiences do not see most of the Australians as Barry McKenzies (or for that matter Mick Dundees!). Rating: 5/10
