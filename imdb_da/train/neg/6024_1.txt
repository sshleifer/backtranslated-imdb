I watched about 30 minutes in this movie before finally getting sick of getting bludgeoned over the head with this movie. The soundtrack, the so-called 'plot' and every actor. It's like they all think they're the bulk of the movie and screaming "KNOW ME!" over and over again. The bad guy has his stupid music going on and saying malicious stupid-like things just in case you don't quite catch. The good guy does brave and noble things, just if you didn't know he was the good guy. And oh gentleman, the plane of the plane. "My Husband Is Possible! My God! (And yes, I know his clothes were still there, but honestly she had woken up and began to panic before she even had time to look at the marvelous seat he had been in.) <br /> <br /> As a religious girl, I apologize to the world for wasting the movie it was printed on. <br /> <br /> And I want my 30 minutes back.
