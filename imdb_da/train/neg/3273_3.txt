Hukards dukes are quite an achievement ?? a $ 53m movie that is worse than any given episode of a downmarket 25-year-old TV show. The reason is useful enough, but rare fun is rarely found, and the casting is pretty awful: Johnny Knoxville is more passenger than protagonist, M.C. Gainey's Sheriff Roscoe is a gentle thug, Michael Westons Enos tiring, a seemingly ideal cast Willie Nelson just seems to wait for the check to clear and Burt Reynolds, who is stuck in some purgatory where he is doomed to relive his old films as A bit of play is a curious choice for Boss Hogg to say the least, but have a good moment with a heckler and a hundred dollar bill. You know a movie is in trouble when Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson are the most charismatic screen preferences ?? But worse than the script or casting is Jay Chandrasekhar's hopeless direction: apparently born without the notion of comic timing, unable to do much more than basic two shots and apparently clueless about how to shoot a car chase, let alone the couple stunts in the movie, He must be sure that the sap film of any sign of life before they materialize. There are a few nice postmodern moments that revolve around the Confederate flag and Daisy's stereotypical role in each episode, but no movie that makes you pine for the days when Hal Needham ruled this kind of thing (and badly) could be a good thing .
