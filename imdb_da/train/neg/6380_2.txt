Well, what can I say about this movie. I am speechless. I could go on with how stupid this movie is forever, even though the only thing that really struck me was the music. And to top it all, someone commented on how much they looked. For them, all I have to say is that it was ripped off by one of the best martial arts films of all time. Fistsof rage with starring Bruce Lee. If he still lived and ever encountered this movie, he was horrified. The rest of the movie is completely ridiculous and a waste of tape. I say tape because a movie like it couldn't have been shot on film. I now feel more stupid to waste 30 minutes in my life and see it. The only reason I saw it myself was because my roommate pulled it out of morbid curiosity. What is this world coming to?
