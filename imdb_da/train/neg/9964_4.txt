In a recent biography of Alec Guinness, I couldn't find too much about To Paris With Love. I'm sure Guinness made the movie to get a free trip to Paris out of it. The movie has no other reason for existence. Of course, Paris is nicely photographed with the wonderful opening of Guinness and his son driving down the Champs Elysee with the Arc de Triomphe in the background. Unfortunately, it goes downhill from there. There is no chemistry at all between Guinness and the young girl with whom he has a short fling in Paris. According to the recent biography of Guinness by Piers Paul Read, Guinness found the girl positive that her behavior was unprofessional. What Odile Vernois thought of his fellow star there is no record. They have as much chemistry as two neutral cats. <br /> <br /> Guinness has a good moment in the movie, ranging from one of his Ealing comedies, as he climbs a tree trying to retrieve a badminton shuttlecock. But I didn't want to wait through the movie for it. <br /> <br /> At least Alec was a trip to Paris out of the deal.
