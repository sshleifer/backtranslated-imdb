I'm a big fan of Ivan Reitman. I loved Evolution and didn't like Ghostbusters? From the trailer, you already know that Uma's character is being dumped by Luke's.So the structure is obviously at the moment when she releases his superpowers on him. But the payoff is just not there. Hajens threw managed to get a (small) giggle, but once again it was all in the trailer. No one does breathless like Uma and Luke is diet Owen on his good days. If you do not want to be Riann Wilson, you will sit there with a constipated smile until your cheeks begin to hug. This is a comedy, right? <br /> <br /> It's not terrible - it's just like an outdated cracker behind the fridge. This could have been such a brilliant send-up of Superhero movies and feminism, but fails both sides. Let's see if Jason Reitman can save the family name.
