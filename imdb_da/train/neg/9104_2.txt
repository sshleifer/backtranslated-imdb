<br /> <br /> When I first watched this movie last night at Cinemax, I was shocked that it had been made. Terrible intentions were, in my opinion, one of the best teen-oriented films made this year. This prequel had certain things contrary to the original. (Sebastian's father is married to wealth, why does he have a rich aunt on long island?) <br /> <br /> Today I found out that it was not meant to be a new movie, but rather a TV series, Manchester Prep. After hearing it, it made sense to me that it was not the same as the movie, just as Buffy the Vampire Slayer is different in TV format. <br /> <br /> I think Roger Kumble probably added the end of this movie after the series was not downloaded by Fox. It just seems like something that would happen too quickly (Sebastian becomes the male version of Katharyn) and I just don't know where to go with the next episode as it wouldn't lead to the 1999 movie (like the newer One thing I did not like it was suggesting Sebastian, and his father was married in fortune, which is not typically well looked after in this area of ​​New York, and sinus Katharyn's mother was just an adult version of her, it didn't seem like a woman in his position would do, marry a man who was not of her social class. <br /> <br /> As a prequel, it is quite lame, but I would have been interested to see where this had gone as a series.
