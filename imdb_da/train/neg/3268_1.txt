It's a real challenge to make a movie about a baby that is consumed by wild dogs, and the mother is mistakenly accused of murder fun, but against all odds this succeeds. Meryl Streep delivers the performance of his life, melodramatic, flooded, but with the comic genius that keeps you laughing even though a mother is struggling with the ultimate horror. If the infant comedies that are eaten by dogs are not your cup of tea you may be uncomfortable seeing this and yes it is an odd choice of subject for a farce, but really very little of the movie has anything to do with it then It focuses on giving Streep a showcase for her Aussie accent and facial disorder. <br /> <br /> Throwing in a slam on media bias and sensationalism and disregarding either the truth or the ethics gives the film the chance to make the bold point that these things are bad.
