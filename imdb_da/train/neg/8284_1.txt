Who wrote this? Some guy called John Cohen. I think it was the first manuscript he ever worked on. Someone should have told him to write a dialogue that sounds like something that someone could actually say. <br /> <br /> And who controlled this? Scott Marshal? Son of Gerry Marshall. My nut has fallen far from the tree. Someone might have wanted to let him know that you can actually shoot a scene in a cab in New York and it will look right and you don't have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason. Maybe he also wanted to let him know he should stay away from Jessica Simpson, but hopefully he has learned this lesson now. And Jessica Simpson ... of course she can't act. Hell, she makes Jessica Alba look like Audry Hepburn, and yet she plays in this movie. Oh wait, it was produced by her father. Okay, so she got part. That is really the only reason I can think of. <br /> <br /> So, should I be surprised that it's bad? No. Should I be surprised at how bad it is? I think many people would if they saw as much of it as I did. I mean, you expect a movie starring Jessica Simpson to be bad, but this ... it's not just bad, it's the opposite of a classic movie. Think of a great Woody Allen movie, this movie is just as bad as that movie is good. It's Anti-Annie Hall. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad I didn't pay to see it, I stopped seeing ten minutes as I couldn't continue. I would no doubt have gone out of the theater before. In fact, I wonder how many of the 6 people who saw it per theater, actually stayed and looked at it all. The movie starts to be ridiculously bad, and then it gets so bad that it becomes a kind of Chinese water torture. And then, when the first action ends, you realize that it only gets worse and that is when you either have to leave or kill yourself. <br /> In conclusion, this movie goes under the category of being so bad that it should be used instead of water boarding at Guantanamo Bay. Although some prefer water boarding.
