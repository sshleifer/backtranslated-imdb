I expected much better from the Battlestar Galactica franchise. Very boring prequel to the main series. After the first 30 minutes I waited for it to end. The characters talk a lot about religion, computers, programming, retribution, etc. There are gangsters, mafia types that perform hits. However, Caprica does not have the original series action to compensate for the slower parts. <br /> <br /> Let me give you some useful advice when watching movies: As a general rule, if there is a lot of over-exploiting titillation, then you know the movie will be a dud. Caprica has lots of this. The director / author usually tries to compensate for his bad abilities by throwing in a few bare bodies. It never works, and all that does is demean the (very) young actresses involved and I'm sorry. Directors / writers doing this should be banned from the company. <br /> <br /> If you want to get bored for an hour and a half, hire Caprica. There are (free) porn on the net if you really want to see naked bodies. Otherwise you move together, nothing to see here.
