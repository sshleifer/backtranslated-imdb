Life did it again. Can we say stupid? I couldn't wait for it to end. The reason was meaningless. The action was horrible! Especially by teenagers. The story has been played a thousand times! Are we just desperate to give actors a job? The previews were attractive and I was really looking for a good thriller. When a lifetime comes up with a good movie, it's not one of them. Unless you have nothing else to do, I would avoid this at all costs. This was a waste of two hours in my life. Can I get them back? I'd rather have scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours and lowered it into peroxide. It would have been more enjoyable.
