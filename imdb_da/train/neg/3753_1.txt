Because of the 1988 strike's Guild of America strike, they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. It is basically crap that consists of repetition + sticky clips from Season 2 and was described by his author, Maurice Hurley as "horrible, just horrible." <br /> <br /> Why the producers couldn't just wait to shoot something decent, who knows. I guess because of the strike, production runs out of money and could only release a flashback episode, or maybe Roddenberry was sick at the time of vetoing this half-ass. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series.
