I watched this DVD in my friend's house and thought this was a Turkish action movie with some Hollywood not very big names in it. Interested enough, I decide to give it a shot later. It was a tough experience to believe me. Then, after finally seeing the credits, I rolled, 'We really do sugar in Hollywood style film production. This is an insult to the hoist | the guide's movie genre .. 'but then wait! I checked some names and no, they were not Turkish names and no, it was not a Turkish movie; on the contrary, it was literally shot in America with an American instructor and crew! It made me think again! - How on earth can you persuade names like Micheal Madsen, Edward Furlong or even Arnold Vosloo to participate in such a project? with probably money. It made me think further. How can you raise so much money to offer them and a presumably international cast? Then all my meditation paid and I came to find the answer. By hiring the cheapest equipment and crew you can find. And if you still have trouble adjusting your budget then: by writing and managing the movie you're trying to produce - or vice versa, I have no information about it. So the bottom line is not a bad movie, as everyone is so eager to present as .. It makes you think - in my case even meditate - and there are many movies out there that do not give the same thing that influences .. This one at least makes you think; It makes you strange .. It leaves you with disbelief .. and then it makes you wonder again ..
