Much like we all love Al Pacino, it was painful to see him in this movie. A publicity hacked by the gruesome end to what apparently has been a prominent and idealistic career Pacino plays his role as an unmade bed and attacks everyone with a completely fake and inconsistent southern accent. <br /> <br /> The reason spools out this way with so many loose ends and unlikely that the mind rolls (and then retreats). <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger is there and doesn't do much. Her scenes with Pacino are flat and unconvincing. Hard to believe they meant a lot to each other. There is no energy there. <br /> <br /> Tea Leone, on the other hand, lit the screen. She was electric and her scenes with Pacino were by far the most interesting in the movie, but not enough to save Al from embarrassment.
