Really awful, pretentious, endless movie. Director Bellocchio seems to be pampered with the beautiful face and figure of his actress Detmer - and who can blame him? But maybe, maybe just, he should have focused a little more on making a good, exciting movie. I hate it when a sex movie is an "art movie" just to become more "respectable". The frequent, occasionally hot sex scenes are the only reason for this movie's existence. Whether they are worth sitting through the rest of the picture, it is totally sensual. (*)
