As an inspiring director himself, this film was exciting to see with criticism in mind. Shot with low-end digital camera probably with 35mm adapter for DOF. Editing is good though decent, sound effects are not also over the top. I would have given it a 7 for an indie film, but the story is not that interesting. It's more on the drama side, the sign development than a horror-flick. <br /> <br /> It's not for those who want to get spooked scared, frightened, or sit down with popcorn just to enjoy. <br /> honestly, this movie would be good if we were still in the 50s. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a family that has a dry field, and that's just that.
