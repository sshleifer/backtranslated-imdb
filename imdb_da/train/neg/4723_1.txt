First of all, I apologize for my English. <br /> <br /> Anyone from ex-Yugoslavia who is no extreme Serbian radical would agree with me. This movie shows Serbian side and only Serbian side. No Serbian crimes were represented. Fortunately, everyone can see that this movie is made of Serbian, so there is no neutrality. All '' professionals '' who were interviewed are not at all professional. Some guys only read a book written by some radical Serbian, the other is genocide denier etc.etc. Even Slovenians were accused in this movie. And the whole war in Slovenia lasted for a few days, and only because the Slovenes were lucky. There were not many Serbs in Slovenia, and YNA could not reach Slovenia through Croatia (after the war in Croatia and Serbia). Any Slovenian is horrified by all the accusations in this movie. <br /> <br /> All reasonable Croatians will agree with one thing: Independence was premature. Perhaps all major conflicts could be avoided. But to mention WWII and some independent things was really pathetic attempt to justify everything. Imagine Japanese throwing nuclear weapons in Seattle and Washington and say it was justified by Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You will find no evidence of swollen YNA soldier and murdered Serbian civilians near Vukovar. But you can find the bond with the reporter who commits his claims of Serbian civilians near Vukovar were lies. All over the internet. And the director forgot to mention the entire bombing of Vukovar by YNA (now in Serbian and Montenegro side - and 100% full of Serbs and Montenegrin) and let's not start the Chetnik movement. In the beginning, it was simply a resistance movement. But the director somehow forgot to mention cooperation with the Nazis, including Ustashe, ethnic cleansing and fighting again the Yugoslav partisans. There are thousands of other things, but everything can be easily controlled. There are many misleading things in this movie. Only a few of all accusations are true. Every Croatian is upset by this movie. <br /> <br /> I don't think I need to mention Srebrenica genocide denial, the genocide that has too many evidence. Imagine the film about Holocaust denial. This movie is the same. And according to this film, the Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo bombed themselves. Every Bosnian Muslim is upset about this movie. <br /> <br /> Somehow, the director forgot to mention the short occupation of small pieces of Macedonian (FYROM) land of Serbs. <br /> <br /> Croatians, Slovenians, settlers and Macedonians never entered Serbian borders. If you are not Serbian and you actually began to believe some things from this movie, you know that Serbs have some kind of propaganda, that Croats, Bosnian Muslims and Macedonians are actually Serbs who made their story. So ... Even 50% of Serbs say this movie is '' small '' extreme and pro-Serbian. <br /> <br /> Serbian radicals are very happy with this movie (there are about 40% of Serbs voting for radicals). I think everyone understands my points here. In this so-called documentary film is very little truth, and my advice to everyone is: Inform yourself before you see this movie. Then you will only laugh at all pathetic accusations. <br /> <br /> See true, neutral documentaries on Yugoslavia's death.
