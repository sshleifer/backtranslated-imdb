Given the risk of showing relationships between the same sex by the end of the 1980s, Personal Best could have made it better to play the same sex relationship between Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tory Skinner) as a more than experimental phase of Cahill's life. br /> <br /> It seems to me that the creators of this movie threw in the same sex relationship between two pretty attractive women to attract viewers. Also consider the 90 seconds to postpone the steps of several women jumping backwards over a high jump bar. This random scene had very little relevance to the movie, and it seemed like it was made to keep the audience interested in this intense movie. I suppose the manufacturers were trying to counter the tedious plot and the even more tedious setting of the movie (1980 Oregon Track and Field Competition). This review may seem tough, but it is the truth. The exploitation of the young Muriel Hemingway's body and the same sex relationship destroyed any credit I would have given to this movie. <br /> <br /> Pepper Thompson
