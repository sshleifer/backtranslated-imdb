The cover of the DVD and the disc is freaking awesome, you think they made a movie about sweet tooth from twisted metal black, which is still a great idea, but this movie is the worst actors than Ben's performance in pearl port, porn has better quality and better players. I had to buy the DVD, but fortunately I rented it first, the plot and the script are also terrible, nothing seems to go together so the movie really never makes sense. The poor attempts to scare you by flashback scenes are worse than those used in 80's sitcom shows, and eventually it will leave you wanting to hit the head of the house.
