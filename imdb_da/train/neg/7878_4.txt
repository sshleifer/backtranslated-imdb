I'm a big fan of the original book, and this adaptation is simply poor. First and foremost, it had trouble deciding whether it was a kiddie tone or an adult that caused a weird mix of adult history and some rather violent scenes with a silly little duck still giving "fun" moments in the beginning. But it's hardly important, the movie is simply boring, unmoving and not true to the original story. It simply does not transfer to the picture all the points Orwell tried to make to his book. <br /> <br /> {SPOILER} <br /> <br /> Second Revolution? !! Haven't they learned anything? Who is the next Napoleon then? Benjamin? !!
