The box to "die for" suckered me in - a shirtless hunky guy and the promise of some laughs and sex. There were lots of Thomas Arklie (Simon) who are easy on the eyes, but no laughs and little sexiness. The couple, Mark and Simon, have reportedly been together for years, but no sign is interesting enough to care about, so it's hard to imagine they care about each other. The error seems to be in the manuscript, not the performances; both actors do the best they can with what they get. The ending is juicy and unaffected (well, not quite unaffected; I felt relieved that it was over). <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie about gay and AIDS fun, "Parting Glances" is much better.
