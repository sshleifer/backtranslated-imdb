This movie is not that interesting, except for the first ten minutes. The pace and editing is a perfect introduction to an ensemble piece, even better than saying Gosford Park. Then it is inexplicably delayed, loses focus and starts resembling a traditional French movie to regain focus ultimately with the love relationship between Antoine (Depardieu) and Cécile (Deneuve). In the middle there are too many sidelines and loose ends in history, several started threads are not completed. <br /> <br /> ******* SPOILERS AHEAD The main story is the relationship between Antoine and Cécile. He has been loyal to her according to his relationship with her many years ago, despite his relapse and establishment home in Morocco. As a builder, he rebuilds his own life and restores her by taking the mask of Céciles marriage. After achieving this, he is buried after a freak accident (literally) and becomes a comatose. He wakes up only after she has burned their old image as an indication that they are united with the past and can start their lives together again. ******* END SPOILERS <br /> It is still unclear what vision this director wants us to see because there are so many other stories here: Illegal immigrants want to enter Europe There are frequent radio broadcasts on the degradation of Iraq's former regime. Céciles child is bisexual and is bitten by dogs (loyalty) when he meets his girlfriend, while the girl he lives with seems to be sick (of it?). Her sister is traditional Islamic and goes into a relationship with Céciles husband. It depicts Morocco as unnecessarily backwards, despite the whole building, there is a strange colonial vision that shines through, which almost glorifies the past. It portrays Islam as a step backwards and exposed to extremism, which can sometimes be true, but certainly not general. Finally, it can best be described as adding some couleur locale and l'art pour l'art. <br /> <br /> Deneuve and Depardieu are great. With this material, they are so confident that they are able to spin something extra in each scene: lifting an eyebrow, body language, radiant pride, awkward behavior. The film itself is disappointing and only confirms the limited role of the French cinema in the world today. With some notable exceptions of course.
