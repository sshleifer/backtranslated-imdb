The ALARMIST is so abysmal the script that you have thought about yourself, why in the world an up and coming actor like David Arquette came in to be in it. It must be one of the weakest plots I've ever seen and without humor at all, it borders on the edge of boring. It sticks together to a terrible conclusion that apparently only happens because the director was bored and just wanted to unpack quickly to get home for his dinner. Stay away!.
