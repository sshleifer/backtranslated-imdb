I remember seeing "Lost Missile" (actually throwing a fit for my brother and cousins ​​whose home I was an overnight guest agreed to see it with me - I was from time to time Eric Cartman from the 1960s - sorry, guys) and are a little embarrassed when the persistent wave of million-degree heat arose as a plot unit - even as another degree I knew that a clean missile just couldn't carry the energy for so much heat or destruction over more than The duration and the limited radius of a nuclear detonation. <br /> <br /> I claimed that turkey on loving relatives was a self-punishing crime. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​of the film were very good. The action is not bad (except for the actors' shatnerism, which played the governor's aid as someone else mentioned). <br /> <br /> But the idea of ​​a missile Easy-Baking Earth's surface using the heat of its exhaust ... no. How would the people at "Mystery Science Theater 3000" miss "The Lost Missile" anyway? <br /> <br /> It's a great classic of unintentional comedy - watch it if you want something to drink beer for a weekend.
