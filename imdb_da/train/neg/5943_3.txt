This movie reminded me of the Soprano, and not in a good way. <br /> <br /> David Chase's seminal mob opera just puts his foot wrong twice, the most devastating and inexplicable occurrence occurring in his fourth season when Junior Soprano was tried for his life. Instead of pursuing this exact (and pivotal) plot line, the authors instead chose to ignore it completely and instead focused on Bobby Baccalieri's constant whimpering over his newly born wife's frozen pasta bowl. <br /> <br /> When something of genuine interest happens in Notorious - for example, the first mysterious assassination attempt on Tupac Shakur, which ignited the entire East Coast / West Coast sweep at first and ended up leading to the deaths of both Tupac and Christopher Wallace - the movie treats it as just a little bit of plot to plod through. Why was Tupac so convinced that he was sold out by his own people? Did he alone help his subsequent affiliation with Suge Knight? And was Lil 'Kim's transformation from head office drone to sex-obsessed, vampish diva really as banal as it looks here? <br /> <br /> None of these issues are even dealt with quickly by the film's writers, who are much more interested in portraying Wallace's turbulent love life to zero convincingly dramatic utility. These sequences (including a brain frazzlingly clich√©d groupie indescretion in a hotel room) are so toothless and blown manipulative that the only real comparison to be made is with a television set. <br /> <br /> The story, in both structure and content, is simplified and thin. But more fundamentally, like a biopic; As something designed to celebrate its subject and educate the uninitiated on the intricacies of their life and work, the film is almost completely worthless. Trust in meat-and-potato genre plotting combined with lifeless musical performances (an area where a movie like this should float) results in a movie that is apparently designed only to satisfy the lungs and demands of those involved leaving Wallace's dubious status as a giant in his field as preserved by it easily persuaded and only converted. <br /> <br /> And the last twenty minutes when Wallace's posthumous cultural identity is widely painted as being related to the last Saint, I honestly made myself want to throw. <br /> <br /> On that score is much like with others, Notorious crass, calculation and compromised.
