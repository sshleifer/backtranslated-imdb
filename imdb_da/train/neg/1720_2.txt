A handful of non-professional actors are terrorized by a prehistoric creature. This creature appears in about thirty seconds with marginal stop-motion animation, but oh how do you long for this margin when the rest of the movie is replaced with production assistants waving around an inner tube of teeth. No time for terror when this movie is hijacked halfway by these comic relief boat rental doofuses, which suddenly become the protagonists; But again you have to admit to seeing them try to be fun, are better than blowing around for the sheriff. Only at the end is one of them eaten and the other is sitting on a stone that cries tears of solitude - it's not fun!
