I saw this in a sneak two days before the official opening and I have to say that I was very disappointed. And I have to put most of these problems on the decision to cast Claire Danes in the lead role. Depending on what you think of Danes, she was either terribly dissatisfied or so far above her head that she should be the first favorite for 2007 Razzie for worst actress. I think we should be sympathetic to her. Instead, she is completely uneven. The other "big" actresses do an OK job, but certainly the screen doesn't light up. Out of all the "big" actresses in this movie, I would say that the one who did the best job was Natasha Richardson. Streep is hardly in the picture and only appears at the end. <br /> <br /> Terrible manuscript too. It comes out more like them reading lines than really being "in character."
