How Irish critics rage about this movie is beyond me. Exaggerated by the usual band of Irish actors dragged out for every Irish film. Terrible script, forcing character quirks (the brown sauce). Romantic all that is bad about Dublin. The attitude of 'ah, it's a dump, but it's certainly not the same'. Lots of goodies exclusively for American audiences (the supermarket manager and his terribly forced catch phrase). And the nail in the coffin was Colm Meaney's character. A great actor forced to play this part that could have been written by a five year old. Cringeworthy stuff. The best thing about this movie is Farrell, and that's bad when you have to say it. Well, at least he wasn't at his terrible American accent. International audiences are warned: Stay home and see Snatch and Lock Stock. You get a better time. Intermission is an outside walk-out
