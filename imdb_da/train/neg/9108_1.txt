This so-called prequel is just a poorly remake for a better version of dangerous substances. The drawings are identical to most of the script. I loved the book, it was based on, and I loved the first movie, but I won't even break the third movie. The meaningless bias between the two main characters in the prequel was completely predictable and unoriginal, and ... I just can't stress how bad the movie was. If you don't want to take my word for it, just watch it and you'll see what I mean. If you have read a review that says 'If you like the first, you will like the other'. The only reason for that is because it's the exact same movie! Although the plot is not even so good. They took so many lines from the first movie, it's hard to tell which movie you are watching.
