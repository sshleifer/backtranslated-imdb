His costume drama is ill cast and without charm. <br /> <br /> George Sanders was a wonderful character actor. But he is thoroughly unreliable here as the driver, an eighteenth century rogue known for his philosophy and great good looks. His costar is of all people, Akim Tamiroff. Some Frenchman! Then there is Signe Hasso, in a dark wig, as the virgin daughter of a wealthy family. Carole Landis fares best. The film opens with her in the silhouette. She is a soubrette and a cheeky girl on it. She disappears for a while, but appears in an unlikely situation. But she's good. She was always an appealing actress. Here she is thrown closest to her usual type of role. <br /> <br /> It is supposed to be a bit naughty, kind of ooh-la-la. It should have had a slight touch, but it is a lead affair from start to finish.
