If you've ever seen a series of fours, there's not much reason to see this. Originality is often not one of slasherbio's strong points, and this is something that this movie is seriously missing. There really isn't much that can say about Pranks, so I do it quickly. The movie was one of the 74 films included on the DPP Video Nasty list, and that was my only reason to see it. The plot follows a bunch of children who stay behind a dormitory during Christmas time. As they are in a slasher, someone decides to start picking them out, and it leads to one of the stupidest mysteries ever seen in a slasher movie. The fact that this movie was on the Video Nasty list is bizarre, because despite a few spawn scenes, this movie is hardly capable of destroying or expelling anyone, and gorries slashers than this (eg Friday the 13th .) did not end up prohibited. But then again, there are banned movies that are much smaller than this (The Witch Who came from the sea, for example). Still, the end of the movie is the best thing about it, as if the audience really couldn't care less about who the attacker is at this point; It is quite well done. On the whole, it is a boring and gloomy slasher that even slasher fans will do well to miss.
