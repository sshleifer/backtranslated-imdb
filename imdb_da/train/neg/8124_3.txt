The film that shoots scenes of a scenic hole walk. <br /> <br /> Remember no one from this movie except Michael Pataki who killed extreme pain like JC in "Five the Hard Way". He is the really annoying sheriff that I did applaud when practicing night sticks on our healthy doctor. Most people are probably laughing at you, with Dr. Beck's epileptic seizures out of nowhere. Can Mrs Beck be more wood? Seriously, if you took a 4 foot branch, put it in a hot tub, you wouldn't notice a difference. Fear and excitement look at the clock and wonder when the credits roll. <br /> <br /> Watch it as a movie, MSTified, but don't go out of your way.
