Let's start by saying that "JAWANI DIWANI" is just a pathetic movie. I agree with the last person who said "I missed joyride". laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> The jokes were just awful. Performances were average. Something went wrong with the movie. Emrano deserved something better. All CELINA JAITLEY were postponed. Hrishitta bhatt was OK. Emraan hashmi was also ok. <br /> <br /> MANN (EMRAAN HASHMI) is a desperate guy who wants to be famous. therefore, he uses RADHA and pretends that he loves her only because her father is a music director and can help him become famous (since his father keeps everything his daughter says). One day MANN and his friends go to GOA to have fun. There he meets ROMA (CELINA JAITLEY) and falls completely to her appearance and tries to flirt with his BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> So at night, ROMA can't open the door to her room and MANN decides to help her. As he is not so good, ROMA goes for help. While she is away, MANN can open the door and decide to come in and sit on her bed BLA BLA BLA. ROMA comes in and they have a night stand. But in one night, ROMA is in love with him. That morning, the underground donors (MAHESH) who see it all meet. Don loves ROMA and couldn't stand what he saw. He orders them to get married, and to be scared, MAN follows the sound and Merry's ROMA. Then their marriage news ends in the newspaper. You later find that he loves ROMA after they have made a music video together. He is now caught between love and fame. BLA BLA BLA. <br /> <br /> The movie is horrible. The songs "SINI NE SINI NE" are fantastic, the remix version is even better. "DIL DIWANA" is also fantastic. The title track is also fantastic. GUYS, AVOID TO SEE THIS MOVIE.
