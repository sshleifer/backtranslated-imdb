Shiri Appleby is the cutest little execution of evil that became a good girl demon-kicking Buffy clone, Elle. But I go before myself, you see Lilith was the first woman made by God as a companion to Adam. But she got the whole opity evil feminist, so God pursued her from Eden. A secret order known as The Fath captures her but does not kill her, so now with amnesia (which is not really explained so well) Lilith (now Elle) is free to become the aforementioned Buffy clone to fight with a mad scientist who received an injection of Lilith's blood. <br /> <br /> If the previous piece sounded awful, it is because it is. The film is also boring, generic, and for a movie with a plot imbued in theology, it doesn't seem to know a lick about it. This bargain basement lousy-CGIed movie was apparently a failed series pilot. All I can say to the fact that it was not retrieved is a resounding amen. <br /> <br /> My character: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Comment from Writer / Director Bill Platt and co-author Chris Regina; and Hill's gallery; video effects samples: before and after (it also has a "also available" choice that you think would lead you to some trailers, but not on DVD covers for other movies, which is a stupid idea) <br /> <br /> DVD-ROM extras: Final shooting script and Delete scenes transcription both in PDF format
