Of course, my first opinions about this movie were bad. I was expecting a horrible, crazy actor, bad entertainment, ridiculous special effects movie. What I got was actually not that bad. Special effects were absolutely horrible, but I found the film itself quite interesting and the script was actually pretty good and decent. It didn't work that bad, and generally I had fun watching this movie. It's still a pretty bad movie, but it's not totally worthless as I thought it should be, and I'm happy to know that this movie managed to wow me, even though it wasn't so good. Overall, it's a movie that should be avoided, but for me it wasn't as bad as I expected it to be.
