The subject is certainly convincing: A group of people love their game one step further by creating a fake medieval world full of warriors, kings, princes and castles. Wargaming is an interesting phenomenon that kills our collective need to "escape" from reality and our existence sometimes the mundane - something almost everyone can relate to. The characters are the predictable mix of Lord of the Rings nerds and Star Trek enthusiasts. It's enough to get most people to see. But very quickly, the film becomes an insider view of wargaming with an almost stereotyped thumb of the nose to viewers who "don't get it". The filmmakers appear to be the subject of wargaming, and this particular, looks too serious rather than once for a while and recognizes humor and fun in making a film about adults who dream up in medieval tools and ponder each other with foam sword. It is quite difficult for anyone who is not sitting on their computer for 7-10 hours a day, playing games or designing the latest star destroyer to understand what the characters are talking about and why we should even take care. However, the filmmakers do not seem to like to choose to focus exclusively on the subject of the game itself rather than building a strong story with a clear story that everyone can understand. Moreover, the sign itself is not so convincing and you get bored quickly of them: a big no when trying to keep people's attention for 90 minutes.
