I totally disagree with the other viewers of this miserable movie. The only reason I didn't rate it 1 for terrible was due to Carmen Miranda's great talent. The beginning and the end are the best parents because of her gifted song and dance. <br /> <br /> The problem is with the rest of the picture. Alice Faye is completely hollow. Don Ameche has a great singing voice, but with the miserable writing material he comes out so terribly corny. The plot is a really stiff here with Ameche, who assumes two parts as a song and dancer and a baron not happily married to Faye. It seems that by playing the song and the dancer, Ameche's marriage gets another change to regain. Some stupid nonsense about the baron to clean up and be gone allows him to play both. <br /> <br /> S.Z. Sakal is given a little to do here, and his comic gifts are not allowed to shine. Dito for J. Carrol Naish, who actually seems uncomfortable in his role. <br /> <br /> This is a chic chic boom bomb of a movie.
