This movie is not worth the movie it was photographed on. The dialogue is flat, filled with clich√©-over-the-top lines and provided by amateur actors similar to reading a script for the first time. The choppy, shocking film style is a cheap imitation of visual effects of the "The Ring" style. The signs don't even seem like a normal person would. For example, the person looking for his twin sister in her home forces her way through the front door, crawls around the house, scares and creeps, and doesn't even call her sister's name to see if she's home. What? You would think she had just buried her sister instead of searching for her. Too many flashbacks for her childhood. For many unnecessary flashbacks, a typical sign of an amateur director is. It is actually fun to see the many pictures of the woman driving her car down the street, up the driveway, around the corner, over here, over there, and a side view, now a front view. Now it is enough. You'd think you're watching a TV commercial for Solaris! Horrible movie. 0 out of 100. I'm really disgusting someone who has spent money making this movie or watching it.
