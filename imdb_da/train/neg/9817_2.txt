Wow ... pure shine. <br /> <br /> Turns on a thriller / thrill / horror in comedy. <br /> <br /> After seeing this, I never laughed so hard at a horror movie before ... a ridiculous plot with 3 characters that was just insanely developed - either not written deep or too much depth. <br /> <br /> If you want to see an absolutely written horror movie with stupid dialogue, plotted up, useless scenes, wasted characters, bad sound and wretched development in general, this is the one to see. <br /> <br /> Make sure to stay focused on the classic "food processor" scene and the completely inappropriate police surveys scenes. <br /> <br /> This is a remarkably new low-screen image and write and sit through it, for the whole duration makes you either stupid, bold or brave.
