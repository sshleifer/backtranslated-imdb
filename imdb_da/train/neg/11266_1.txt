Well, what to say? <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, do I still have to think what the hell really was? V.Dodgy camera moves in the yard at some point ... I had to look away from the screen, I felt physically ill ... Round and round and round .... You get the idea ... <br / > <br /> VERY VERY Strange accents on many points .... "Those who should know know" <br /> Unless you come in for free or get paid to see it or your partner is about to make you paint the house or something .. forget it ...
