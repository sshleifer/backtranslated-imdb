Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) has had his child killed, and his wife is maliciously attacked in an invasion of the home. Dr. Heller (Christopher Plummer) is trying to help him through post-traumatic stress. Then Archer finds himself confronted with a man (To Schweiger) tied and gagged to a chair. He is told that this is the man who killed his child and attacked his wife and he can do what he likes. And there is a huge selection of instruments to help him ... <br /> <br /> Movies are interesting first (and show true restraint in the form of blood and gore), but stupid per minute and have a lot of unlikely plot twists and turns. It all ends in a last twist that was so old and stupid that I was shocked that someone would actually think about using it more. How such talented actors like Eldard, Schweiger and Plummer became involved in crap like this is beyond me. This gets three stars for the play, but the stupid plot and really incredible twists make it a chore to sit through.
