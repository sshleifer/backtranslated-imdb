I found Darkness to be just for DARK. It had some kind of cool idea and some ambitious ideas, not bad action scenes and a few splashed moments to make you go UGH! BUT it was subject to the confusion point. You don't really know what's always going on in the dark scenes and for a movie recorded on Super 8 Film, you already have all the unpleasant grain to handle. As with the Nathan Schiff movie, it's just too much. Director Leif Jonker seems to want to make an original film, but he lacks the know-how to do it. The camera is never pointed to the right place, lack of basic conditions such as how to shoot simple dialogue scenes and how to ease a movie too. The actors are all pretty bumpy and hammy. But despite these negatives, the music is good, gore is plenty and ranges from stupid kittens to really good devices. Is it such a classic as it says? Is it worth the two slices worth praising? NONE. But it's a good first try. Now, if these guys stop clapping on the back of this movie (from what I understand here, the only ones they've ever completed) for a while and try again, they can do better.
