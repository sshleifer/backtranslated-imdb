I don't really get the rating for The Amati Girls, and I think I was really kind to give it a 4 out of 10. What could otherwise have been a wonderful story with actually a set of more or less decent actors being a total farce in mine eyes. There are so many clich√©s in the flick, the woman's hair is just awful, and most of the scenes are more than unrealistic or seem fake. There is no true passion in this movie, but a bunch of actors over-acting across all borders, it hurts. It's not fun enough to be a comedy, it's too fake-sad to really touch, so in my eyes it's just not good. I didn't see it, I couldn't believe how some of it made it to my TV in my living room in Switzerland. But .. maybe it was still OK and just lost in translation? Who knows. Definitely one of the strangest movies I've ever seen, and it's certainly not in a good way! Pardon.
