This movie is bad. I mean not just "bad" as in; "Oh the script was bad," or; "The action in that scene was bad" ..... I mean badly that someone should be held criminally responsible for causing this unbridled pile of steaming raw to an unsuspecting audience. I won't even dignify it with an explanation of (Plot ??) if I can refer to it as that. I can think of just another occasion in some 40 odd years of film watching that I found need to air my spleen on a movie. I mean, no one goes out with the will to make a bad movie, do they? So yes. Apparently they do ... and the guilty man is writer / director Ulli Lommel. But the worst thing is that Blockbusters actually leases this to their customers! Be advised. Leave this crap where it belongs. Stuck to the shelf, collect dust.
