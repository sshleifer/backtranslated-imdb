Now the nymphomania tells you dissatisfied. I don't know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac, but she is definitely into sexual relations with men. She is still investigating and trying to find "more data" so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it, even though in her age she seems to have a good idea now. (However, I cannot agree with anyone who says that Young is too old for the role. If she is, we should all age so nicely.) Mostly, this movie left me cold even though it is not in any way the worst of its type you will ever see. And, unlike the latest 'Eyes Wide Shut', something happens at least in this.
