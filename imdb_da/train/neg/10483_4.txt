I watched this movie on a westbound American Airlines flight. It was so bad that it actually made the flight seem longer. The reason had potential (who wouldn't love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills every Elvis impersonator she meets?) But it turned up a million different times with really bad writing. Towards the end is an embarrassingly bad scene where a gang of Elvis impersonators is on the roof of a casino that redistributes the sky and thinks he is coming back, then a group of stars moves into an "Elvis" constellation that quickly shoots a bolt of lightning on impersonators, sending them crashing through the roof. Bad ... really bad. Which is the theme of the whole movie. I would avoid this at all costs.
