This was not a well done Western. You have this nut in the burning sun in a buggy with a parasol over it and kill people for your own reasons. You have the same person sitting in a snow cave during a snowstorm, and cuts pieces of his anatomy that have been frozen. Then you have a woman in a house in the middle of a place that shoots wolves that are not there. What is the meaning of this movie? Couldn't Bruce Dern find anything better to do? This was a waste of movies.
