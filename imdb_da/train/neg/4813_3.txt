I have given up trying to find out which version of this I am looking at. The copyright at the end indicates 1983. And although this is not the important part of my objection to this movie, I would like to see a film made of course in the aquarium time (including long-haired hippie chicks and crazy station wagons), but with a 1980s synth soundtrack is disturbing. Extremely disturbing. <br /> <br /> My biggest objection here is how DARE FILMMAKERS BURY CUTE-AS-A-BUTTON PAMELA FRANKLIN ALIVE. WHERE THERE. <br /> <br /> She's all really sweet and exciting, but in the two movies I've seen her in - this crap party and the otherwise excellent Legend of Hell House - she kills her. <Br /> <br /> I want to alert the film industry. Pamela Franklin seems to have retired from the company, but if she ever decides to make another movie and a cracked cure for a director trying to kill her, I have to ask him to step outside. <br /> <br /> NO RECORDS ON PAMELA FRANKLIN AND WEIGHT WITH IT. I'm very cross. The FURY IS NOTE. <br /> <br /> For B-movie fans looking for a crapfest, you can do much worse than this. On the plus side, this is not a movie involving satanism on a peripheral and meticulous way - this movie is a hardcore satanic movie. Wall-to-wall satanic ceremonies, baphomets, hallucinations, a ridiculous rat attack - whatever else you could ask for. <br /> <br /> These splendid things are almost destroyed by the enchantingly grafted 1980 synth soundtrack, which is as inconsistent with a movie as it is possible to be. The soundtrack reminded me of something you wanted to hear on Equalizer. It's really bad. <br /> <br /> Also, they made Pamela Franklin in its charming English accent, which was also quite rude, if not a cruel cruelty (against the viewer) that you might find covered by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I say we have the right to hear Pamela Franklin speak in his own voice. Who's with me? I could forgive everything else about this movie if they didn't abuse Pamela Franklin. And then I throw the rubber boot down, gentlemen - Everyone who meets with PAMELA FRANKLIN MESSES WITH ME. <br /> <br /> Even in a fictional context. <br /> <br /> GOOD DAY, SIRS.
