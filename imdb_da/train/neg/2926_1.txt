It seems there is a curse out there when it comes to gay. Namely, happy endings are not very common. Beautiful things excluded, gay films tend to end in broken relationships or unnecessary death. And some, like Come Undone, just quit ... period. The creators of this horrible piece of nonsense have a thing or two to learn about plot, direction and timelines. Within the first ten minutes of this movie, I found myself confused and even more after the first glimpse of Jeremie Elkaim's character with a small psychic session. It seems that this movie was randomly pieced together without the slightest attempt at continuity or consistency. There is no real way to tell when you see the present or some kind of ethereal flashback. I could only take so much before it became really unappealing. <br /> <br /> Stephen Holden of The New York Times called this movie "... shining beautiful and truly genuine." Well, it seems that Stephen invested in goggles prior to viewing, as this is really far from beautiful. Because of all the praise this movie received, I expected something worth seeing. Unfortunately, the film lived for its title. And at the end of the movie (which made no decision, I can add) it is common to see that the authors, the director and the movie have all come out.
