An ever-famous but decadent actor (Morgan Freeman) has not filmed for four years. When he is invited to participate in a new project, he asks the director's lumpy cousin to drop him into a poor Latin district in Carlson to investigate the work of a small supermarket leader. He sees the beautiful Spanish cashier Scarlet (Paz Vega) and he is attracted to his ability. His driver never returns to catch him, and Scarlet gives a ride to the actor. But first, she has a job interview for the secretary's position in a construction company, and the actor helps her be prepared; then they spend the afternoon together a good time. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega. But the pointless "10 items or less" is absolutely disappointing. This low-budget movie doesn't seem to have a story, and is supported by chemistry and improvisations by Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega, and in fact nothing happens in 82 minutes. The ambiguous open conclusion is simply ridiculous, with Morgan Freeman's character returning to his silver world and telling the simple worker that they will never see each other again. Was he afraid of having a love affair with her and destroying his perfect world with his family? Or was there a clash of classes and he realizes that his fancy neighborhood would not suffice for a simple lower class worker? My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "About Astro em Minha Vida" ("A Star of My Life")
