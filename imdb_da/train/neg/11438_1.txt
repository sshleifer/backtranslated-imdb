If there's ever been a worse comedy than 'Gray Matters', I'm not aware of it. The "fun" premise of the New York Jewish comedy is that siblings Sam & Gray fail a couple and then decide to raise Sam with a girlfriend, only to discover that Gray is just attracted to their goals - Charlie. The revelation that Gray is secretly gay is apparently only a surprise to her. There is a deeply insulting wedding order, a deeply embarrassing "drunken act" from Moynahan and Graham, and a show that would frighten forests all over its timber from Tom Cavanagh. Sissy Spacek demonstrates a complete inability to do comedy and wants this cut from her resume. Molly Shannon plays the domestic friend with shabby insouciance. Only Alan Cumming shows up with any kind of credit, but is seriously underemployed and does nothing to work. The whole disaster is cemented by Graham's bizarre eye-rolling performance, culminating in the penultimate scene where she has a comedy mode and a cover despite the scene being put in a lesbian bar. It is amazing that this movie was ever released, it has no redeeming function and should be avoided at all costs.
