This is probably the best horror movie made since Ed Wood died. <br /> <br /> I can't ruin the end because I have absolutely no idea what happened. However, I will try my best. There are some kind of lesbian vampires, but they continue to swap bodies so any sign may or may not be the sign you should think it is, or it can be a lesbian vampire. <br /> <br /> Sound confusing? It's not as confusing as you might think since none of the signs make sense to begin with. There is no plot, no sign development, and random people show up, speak a few lines, and then disappear, never to be heard again. There are also zombies that may be * the enemies of the vampires, but there is also a dream-within-a-dream kind of sequence in a mental hospital, so maybe it is none at all and it is all the main character's hallucinations. <br /> <br /> Open Time? Both leading girls take their shirts off. The special effects are simply spectacular (I especially liked the incredibly slow, awkward battle sequences). Everyone has a really stupid Canadian accent that adds the general level of hilarity. Worth the price of renting. We laughed until we cried.
