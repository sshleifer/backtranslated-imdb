This film is horribly acted, written, directed and produced. But it's so campy it's actually semi-watchable. It's SEMI watchable. The story (how small there is) makes almost no sense at all. The Barney Drum character is the only real comic relief in the movie, and it gets tired after approx. 30 seconds. <br /> <br /> Many of the Canadian supporters can be found in TV commercials. None of them went on to something else that I am aware of. And of course, Sly Stallone's even less talented brother is well ..... = <br /> <br /> Trivia: It was filmed almost entirely in and around the small village of Claremont, Ont. (about 20 miles N.east of Toronto) I recognized many local landmarks / crossings / buildings. I think the Drive-in scene was filmed on the now demolished "Oshawa Drive-in" just before being demolished.
