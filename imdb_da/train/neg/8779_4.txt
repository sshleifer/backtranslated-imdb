As a movie fan, White Noise was a complete disappointment, as the filmmaker was the cinematography pretty good, nicely lit, well camera work, reasonable direction. But as a movie, it became as predictable as all the other so-called horror films that the market has recently been flooded with. Although it did have a little bit of the "chill factor", the whole concept of E.V.O (Electronic Voice Phenomena) did not seem to be credible. This film did not explain the reasons for specific events, but proceeded with them. The actor was far from blowing the protagonist, there was no feeling like many newer thriller / horror movies. Definitely not a movie I want to buy on DVD and would not recommend anyone who hurries to watch it.
