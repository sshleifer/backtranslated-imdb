Let's cut in the hunt: This movie is softcore pornography marketed for the masses under a name that the studio milks every penny out of the American Pie teat. Period. <br /> <br /> The whole plot (and it shouldn't mean that there is much to go around) serves as a means of showing the audience more breasts and sex scenes. <br /> <br /> If you are a Tween guy and you are too shameless to buy actual pornography, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, the film doesn't have much to offer. <br /> <br /> The play is underpair, character evolution is virtually non-existent, and history is a nonsense chore of nudity and pranks (none of them are particularly memorable). <br /> <br /> Buy real porn, if that's what you want to see, and if not, take a good movie. Animal House, Kids, or even the original American Pie are all fantastic film works, and all contain heavy alcohol and nudity. <br /> <br /> "That's not how much you use it"
