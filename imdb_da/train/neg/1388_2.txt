Went to watch this movie hoping to see some flashes of Jet Li, we were amazed at Lethal Weapon 4. Unfortunately, for many of his fighting stunts, it's so fake that it took that pleasure out of it. The flying kicks would be much more impressive if you couldn't see the wires holding him up as he flies through the air for 4 seconds and 9 kicks. <br /> <br /> For cartoonish and very disappointing.
