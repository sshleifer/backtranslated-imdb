I don't like this movie much. If you have read Puzo's books or at least seen very close to the first two films (especially the first one), you will agree with me. <br /> <br /> Compared to Corleone's saga presented by Puzo's novel, the movie of this movie is sometimes even ridiculous. The signs and relationships between them are distorted. The story ends with nowhere, even though it seems to go in some direction during the film. It is understandable that different times should be expected for Corleone's saga in the 90s and that we would not find things like they were before. But on the other hand, I do not know why they had to copy some dialogues from the other movies, in contexts, as they do not fit. Why this? It sounds like the badly made followers who just try to copy the original film's qualities. What will never be understandable is that Mario Puzo, Coppola and Al Pacino came together to do this. A man who led pieces like Apocalypse Now and Godfather must be forgiven for almost everything he does in the cinema until he dies. That's what Al Pacino does to be an actor he is. But Mario Puzo shouldn't have written this. Why? He damaged all his previous work. What a shame, my friend. Puzo's novel "The Last Don" is a 90's story of the mob and it is amazing. We can never tell the same about the plot of Godfather III.
