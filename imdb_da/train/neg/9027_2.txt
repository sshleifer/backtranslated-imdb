Raise on us to see the audience perhaps. I sat through this 2 hour movie and I waited for the second action to kick in so the movie lived up to its title. But Costner never deprives her lover's fate, she dies, and the movie ends. I was left wondering where the rest of the movie was. If a movie is called Revenge, then the hero gets better at the end of the movie. I had the choice to watch this or Black Rain at the cinema luckily I saw the other brother's movie in the cinema instead. I caught up with this turkey on video. there was a good thing about the movie and was its beautiful theme tune. Listen to cd.dont see this awful. 1 out of 10
