As has been noted, this formula has been filmed several times, most recently as "You've Got Mail", with Tom Hanks and Meg "Trout Pout" Ryan. Of the several versions, this is my least preferred. The problem I think is that the studio shook on the star charisma, which didn't quite cut it here. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between the two drivers never boils into this movie. There are no real sparks. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of day old donuts, pleasant but bland. And when the leaders are boring, the rest of the movie can only follow. Judy is particularly disappointing. She looks like she has no neck! I don't know if she had any problems with pain or something, but she looks like a turtle trying to pull her head into it, everything anchored and everything. I couldn't figure out what Van Johnson was so hot about. I would have made a bee line for the sweet violin player. And the van wasn't great either. I have always thought of him as a rather generic Hollywood-leading man, and he does nothing to remove the picture here. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the stars or early 1900s then you like this movie. But there are much more entertaining romantic comedies out there, and they give you a lot more than a mouthful of stale sweets.
