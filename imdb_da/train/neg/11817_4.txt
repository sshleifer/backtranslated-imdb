A pretty average scifi movie. The reason was more or less obvious from the start. Although the play was reasonably good, the writing seemed very clumsy, using ideas taken from many films. <br /> <br /> The Base Plot: Scientists working on a deep space research platform save a fighter from colliding into the red dwarf that they have been groundbreaking. On board you will find a stasis pillow, which randomly works flawlessly at that moment. After 2 or 3 minutes of the man in the chest, you wake up to being a complete lunatic. Something that completely escapes the research vessel's 3-person crew ... After that, it becomes a rip off every other movie involving a psychotic lunatic who is terrorizing innocent victims. In general, I think Speed ​​2 was a better exploration of the subject, which I also don't consider to be a good movie. <br /> <br /> Not a good movie, get foreigners out and see it again. <br /> <br />
