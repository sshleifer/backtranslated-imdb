It was a blow to me. I think little girls should strive to be nothing more than swimsuit models, homeworkers or mistresses, as it seems to be all they will ever be portrayed as anyway. It is really sad to see an artist's work and life being erroneously interpreted incorrectly. Undeniably (or perhaps it should have been expected), Artemisia's entire character and everything she stands for had been reduced to a standard Hollywood female character; a pitiful, physically flawless, helpless little creature who doesn't show any of the traits that actually got her in the story that was mutilated here. Sadder, however, was seeing that much of the audience was too poorly educated in the area to understand the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the movie and reality. To portray the artist as a person who is in love with her real rapist, one who she actually accused of raping her even when he was under torture, just horrified me. If the director had nothing more to say, she should have refrained from basing her story on a real person.
