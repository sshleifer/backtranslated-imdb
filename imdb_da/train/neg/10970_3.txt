This is absurd - except for the Australian who has reviewed this flick, I cannot help but believe that anyone else who has submitted a report so far was somehow involved in the production of Elektra, considering where generous they were with their praise. <br /> <br /> Of course, I'm not really a fan of comic-book-to-movie conversions, so I didn't go in with many expectations, but yet I found Elektra to be incredibly invasive. What irritated me most was the fact that there was so much in this movie that went inexplicably, and it left you thinking "what is the relevance of the plot?" or "so how did that aspect of the character come?" I can only hope that these are things that may be explained in Daredevil, which I do not intend to see. <br /> <br /> Also, the appearance of the characters in this movie seems to make a face at random moments that fit the big-line, and doesn't even get me started on the completely pointless romantic part-plot. I'm also (still) scratching the head of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's destiny, which seems to have gone inexplicably. <br /> <br /> If I can give kudos to this movie for something, it would be necessary to be the fantastic places where it was shot, but otherwise I got some pleasure from Elektra. I know we should suspend our disbelief in fantasy / action movies, but almost everything in this movie was so unlikely or confusing (even in action movie standards) that it just frustrated me. <br /> <br /> Well, hell, at least, Jennifer looks good at Garner.
