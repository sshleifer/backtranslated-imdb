I watched this movie today at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel after hearing rave reviews, but I think the critics just suck up to Willem Defoe and his wife (the director) who were present at the festival. It's definitely the slowest movie I've ever seen with many senseless, ridiculously long scenes of nothing. Besides Defoe who was decent, the two and a half other people in the movie, Defoe's wife Giada, were ridiculously horrible (how they threw part of the bakery sales is beyond me). This film is largely plot less with a lame attempt to be abstract and out of the wall. The only scene that touched any kind of reaction in the crowd was vulgar and came from nowhere just to add some kind of shock value to the stupidity that is this movie. Sorry to be so tough, but really this movie is a precious waste of time and money. I really appreciate the good indie cinema, but this movie is not worth the film's time.
