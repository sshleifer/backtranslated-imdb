This movie contains no humor for anyone who has lived with a family member who has a mental illness. So many scenes reminded me graphically of my own life experiences. This movie was the man's version of "Mommy Dearest." It shows both graphically and precisely what life many children of a mentally ill parent go through. It also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupt and act as if they were God. <br /> <br /> Someone told me it was fun. No way I say! It is at best fun humor. <br /> <br /> The movie is so intense and depressing that my son and I had to leave the room. The best use for this movie is for people who do not understand mental illness or do not believe what we families actually live through.
