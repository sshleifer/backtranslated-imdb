I watched this movie with some friends a few months ago, I still laugh today and think of some of the complete stupidity. The first few scenes alone were fun. I don't want to ruin anything for those who want to see it, I won't ruin the laughs. Needless to say all the time, I saw this movie, I was trying to figure out what was meant by everything the characters in this movie did. Towards the end, we were all bored, however, when the original hilarity and shock of a film that was this random was turned off. There is no plot and not a trace of decent acting. The signs are about as developed as those in a kindergarten "Learn to read" book. They even managed to make a lesbian sex scene unattractive.
