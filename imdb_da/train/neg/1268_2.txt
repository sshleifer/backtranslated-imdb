Oh what a disappointing movie! Seen in Los Angeles, the center of the universe from the POV of Hollywood filmmakers, this film tries to be a deep social commentary on contemporary American anxiety. Stereotype smeared characters with very different socio-economic backgrounds paths in their everyday life, humdrum life. The reason is uneven and desultory. Numerous imaginative plot contrivances keep the movie going, like: a drift shooter, an abandoned baby left in the weed, a gang of boobs scaring a lawyer, a guy flying through the night sky over the city, a child in summer camp. <br /> <br /> Throughout these events, one is constantly the generous help of sociological "insights" given through dialogue, as characters compare notes of their life experiences. One character tells another: "When you sit on the edge of that thing (Grand Canyon), you realize what a joke we humans are ... they cut out laughing at me, I could tell me and my worries it is really humorous to the Grand Canyon ". And another sign pontificates about the meaning of it all: "There is a gap in this country, an ever-growing abyss between the people who have things and the people who do not I ... It is like this great hole has opened up in the ground, as big as ... the Grand Canyon, and what is about to pour ... is an outbreak of anger, and rage creates violence ... ". <br /> <br /> Apart from the horrible unnatural and forced dialogue, apart from the low, clever characters, apart from the stupid plot, the pace of history is painfully slow. Acting is uninspired and perfunctory. The film's tone is complacent and self-sufficient, in the contempt of the manuscript for viewers. <br /> <br /> This was a movie project approved by Hollywood suits that fancy themselves as almighty gurus, looking down from high. They believe that their film will be a spectacular revelation to us little, ignorant filmmakers, eager to learn about the real significance of American social change.
