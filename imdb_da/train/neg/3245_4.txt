David Mamet's film debut has been hailed by many as a real thinker movie, a film that makes you question everyone and everyone. I saw it for the first time recently and couldn't understand what should be so good about it. <br /> <br /> The film is about a female psychologist named Margaret, who is also a best-selling author. Margaret has been disillusioned with her profession and her inability to really help anyone. She tries to remedy this by helping to settle her patient's gambling debt to a shark named Mike (played by Joe Mantegna, which is the only reason to watch this movie). She discovers that Mike is actually a professional confidant when she almost falls victim to a scam, he immediately draws with her. Intrigued she returns to see him and asks him to show her how con artists operate (she plans to use this as a subject in a new psychology book). She then falls for him and accompanies him for a long time, as he and his fellow players have set up. <br /> <br /> I don't want to go into details, but at the end of the movie it is revealed that the events throughout the movie were a thorough understanding of Mike and his cronies to scam Margaret out of $ 80,000. <br /> <br /> First of all, the big turn to the end was VERY CAUTION. Any scene where the royal men worked was made very obvious by the frightening action and the strange line sounds. Not only that, but the audience (and the protagonist) knowing that they are dealing with kingdoms, is it really such a great surprise when we find out that Margaret herself has been fooled? In addition, Margaret is apparently an intelligent psychologist who is an expert in reading people, but she allows herself to be heaped too easily - and remember, she knows Mike is a constructor. <br /> <br /> Second, we are led to believe that Margaret was preached from the beginning, but in order for the wife to eventually work, she had to do several things that the king could not have predicted that she would do. First, she had to decide to help solve her patient's debt so she could meet the kings in the first place. If she hadn't done this, the whole wife would have failed. I just have to say that it is quite unreasonable to assume that a psychologist should take it for himself to settle a patient's gambling debt. Not only that, but what are the odds that they would be in the right place at night, did she decide to show up? Did they simply show up on the bar every night and hoped she would come and see them? Another thing that might happen could not have been predicted is that Margaret had to return to see Mike again and ask him to teach her the tricks of his trade. What is the probability of this happening? And yet the whole conen is based on this premise. <br /> <br /> Another problem I had is the end. Margaret finds out that she has become a fool and decides to avenge Mike. Initially, Mamet leads us to believe that she is going to break, but it goes all the way, so the ultimate end is her entering a luggage area at the airport. Somehow it just felt like a clumsy and eerie way to finish a movie about con artists on their trade. Not only that, but she didn't even take back money he stole from her. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, the movie lets you feel empty and unfulfilled. And if you, like me, foresee that Margaret should be deceived, you will find this revelation as unsatisfactory.
