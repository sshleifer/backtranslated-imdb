The film tries to be a mockumentary shot in the documentary but with many obviously scripted parts - but fails to give the audience some signs to create the illusion of the documentary. It's also about finding true love in Los Angeles, but is no more than an uninteresting look at an amateur movie player trying to make his first "big movie".
