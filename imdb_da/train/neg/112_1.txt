This movie is just plain horrible. John Ritter makes talk falls, 75% of the actors deliver their lines as if they read them from cue cards, poor editing, awful audio mixing (dialogue is difficult to pick up in places over background noise) and a plot that really doesn't go anywhere. I didn't think I'd ever say that, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this movie. There are at least 3 others who suck more. Patti Hansen delivers his lines with Ben Stein's passion. I began to wonder if she was not dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's children are horrible (the oldest definitely reads his lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously awful. There is a reason Bogdanovich could not get another project until 4 years later. Please don't see it. If you see it in your TV listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it for you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to see it, you're better off finding another soul mate. I'd rather blow my eyes out with the lawn than sit through this garbage again. If I could summarize this movie in a word, it would be: Suckotrocity
