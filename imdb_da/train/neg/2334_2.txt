This had high intellectual pretensions. The main management intends to give a "deep" "meaningful" representation (with voice to his mindset naturally) and he was certainly influenced by the sixty-five / sixties "method" - which, when the manuscript and direction were worthwhile, gave amazing results (see Clift, Newman, Winters). But here's the story superfluous. In addition to moving too slowly, you can edit at least 20 minutes - including meaningless flashbacks - and the line would not have changed. It is often very doubtful that Bruce Dern believes in his "uncle" character, and he often portrays shades in parody. An interesting side is only skimmed over: the relationship young boy / hero, if we admit that the hero himself is some kind of child- When he tells the young child that he will not let anyone hurt him, some welcome tenderness comes up. But it is bare and only the final scene returns to it. <br /> <br /> Words to the wise: Take Foley's "up close" instead: it has two good actors (Christoph is Walken and Sean Penn together!), it's also an offbeat movie, but it's poignant , voltagefull.Here my hitchcock points sullenly to zero all the way through.
