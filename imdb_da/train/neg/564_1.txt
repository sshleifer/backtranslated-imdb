The producers made a big mistake by spelling Mark Lester, who could not act or sing, in the title role. Apart from his very bad "acting", the whole of Lester's song had to be thrown by a girl. I do not know why they threw him at all, as there would have been so many boys who could have played infinitely better and also made their own song. Shani Wallis was too old to play Nancy, who was supposed to be 16. The current West End version is so much better than the movie in every way. Ross McCormack is the best Artful Dodger of all time and he is certainly far better than Jack Wild ever was. It was clearly political to award this old-fashioned musical so many Oscars after the tumultuous events of 1968.
