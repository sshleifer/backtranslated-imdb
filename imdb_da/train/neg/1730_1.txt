First, I would like to point out that I only know about the show because my younger sister always looks at it. I find the most annoying program on TV. There is nothing funny about any of the 'jokes' and the can of laughter is unbearable. The show would work much better if filmed in front of a live audience. That way, the laughter would show how the 'unfunny' show is. But I give credit to the young cast's play. However, it sings me to believe they will look back on the show in the future and see how bad their first TV show was. The view links well with the overall annoying voices and style of the CBBC presenters. Why today's youth should shout so much is over me. That's all.
