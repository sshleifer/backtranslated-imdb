I am very surprised to see such a high rating for this movie and the few reviews that need to be positive. I watched the movie and was pretty disappointed. I didn't find it very pleasant at all. It was slow and lacking in entertainment value. Even the murder scenes are lackluster, with real close-ups of generic stabbings that don't look good. And the supposed big twist ends really is not much, I saw it coming, and then the ending seemed just clich√©. This movie may not get much mention, but by the small it gets, it gets overstated. I would not recommend this movie.
