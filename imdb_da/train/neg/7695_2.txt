I was in such great hopes of seeing an adaptation of a classical story like the Arabian evenings. Instead, I was disappointed with a movie that couldn't keep my attention right from the start even though I tried to watch it twice !! <br /> <br /> It was a bonus that Caradine was in this movie, but it wasn't as much as the actors lacked equality. For something, a little like Zorro with Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras is much better for action, comic moments and general pleasure. <br /> <br /> OK so the Dragon of Dragon has many possible fans out there, but if you're looking for something to wow about in martial arts and plot line, you won't get it. If you just want the kids to settle down on a Sunday afternoon, maybe that is for you with the 3 ninjas.
