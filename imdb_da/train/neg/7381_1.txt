Okay, first of all, Seagal's voice has doubled to 50% of the movie ... Why? For, apparently, there was rewriting of the manuscript and story as they shoot, and they need to change their dialog for history continuity as they have multiple versions. From the beginning you just scrape your head because the overbubbles not only distract, but they make no sense. That said, history still sucks and doesn't make any sense at all. When I got the end, I just scratched my head because the movie was so pointless, and the end didn't even make sense. <br /> <br /> Avoid like the plague. This movie made me stop watching Seagal directly on video because they just get worse and worse.
