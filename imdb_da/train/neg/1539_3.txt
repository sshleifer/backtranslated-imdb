I'm a big fan of western but this one .... whew what a stink! I think what struck me almost straight out of bats was the inane dialogue. I think I could have written a better dialogue than this when I was in eighth grade. And the poor actors! Considering this dreadful dialogue, none of them was cross-referencing anything but ridiculous. Really, I'm not talking. Some of this is a little better than what you would get in an Ed Wood movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest tragedy is Sterling Hayden. He was probably the "big" star in this movie, as if you called it a B-Western, you would be brilliant praise for it. This is what should be called a B-minus Western perhaps. Pity Sterling Hayden, who at other times was with Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Frank Sinatra and other great talents. For him to arrive in a vehicle, this poor must have been something he tried to downplay for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> An annoying thing about this movie is that all the men look like they haven't shaved a week and their faces are all greasy. I know in the old west that the guys were not always well-groomed, but for a man it is a movie that makes you just go 'EWWWW!' Really, this is a crummy Western. Denver Pyle also had to live this one down, especially after performances in so many Western countries. Bad, bad movie.
