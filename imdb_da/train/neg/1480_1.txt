He pulled the boys boys out of his shoulder! It's a spoof right ?! No one really writes that it just happens that improv has gone terribly wrong. I believe in some way. This movie should be a spoof because who would say they wrote that script otherwise. Can anyone imagine the whole role of sitting around as the instructor and authors go over the story. <br /> <br /> The director says, "Next, our inbreeding villain uses his 24-inch machete to loosen our token creepy neighbor. Get this, he'll pull his intestines out of his bunghole" <br /> <br /> "Brilliant!" The whole cast proclaims. <br /> <br /> It can't happen, no one writes it stupid! Must be a spoof. <br /> <br /> I loved the part where the skinny introspective gal strikes the burn-in frenzy to death with the cast iron bucket she finds on the cave floor. I was not sure that they were brewing cannibal types to cook a lot. Perhaps it explains why the kettle lay on the floor in the dark at the right time to kill the mallow hollow. Seems ironic that after the freaky guy had spent martial arts expert porn queens and a few out doors type jocks he fell so easily to the frying pan of a thin defenseless girl next door. <br /> <br /> What does Richard Greco's guy do in this? Did he find his agent or something? <br /> <br /> Can anyone explain the end to me because I didn't get it either? I can't quite imagine why the lovely girl would kill the funny lady who made her a little tea. Never mind I don't want to know.
