The year 1934 was when Shirley Temple played three big movies and really started making a name for itself. Unfortunately, the studies had to experiment to see what the public liked best here. Two of the things sang and danced. Another was a short, interesting movie that kept people's attention and got their thoughts from depression. You know the other keys to Shirley's successful movie. <br /> <br /> In spite of the star preferences of Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard, this film did not achieve any of the above, and despite a very good director in Henry Hathaway. In addition, there are too many talky parts here that simply become boring and too many arguments between a sullen Lombard and Cooper. To top it off, you didn't get the normal emotional end that the public wants. I think they learned this movie.
