<br /> <br /> The most important issue I ask for this movie is how to film a cole porter musically and use only 3 of his 15 songs! merman and lahr played the lead role on broadway, here they are replaced by the weaker red skelton and lucille ball. Plot changes change and fun is lost. <br /> <br /> SKIP IT.
