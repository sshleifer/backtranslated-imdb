From the blocked digitized footage to the play that makes Keanu "I'm so wood I could be a plank me". Reeves looks like an Oscar winner, this movie bites (saying not calculated). The best thing about it is the eRATicate box in the 2nd segment (which of the three seemed to be the strongest piece in terms of storyline and "twist"). Wanted I had spent Â£ 3.99 it cost me something else, like ... Natural Born Killers: Directors Cut. If you buy this, you are really for a disappointment, do yourself a favor and avoid it like the plague. If you're looking for something amateurish and with actors who are more than a 2x4, then move on. But if you want some quality werewolf action look elsewhere, like Dog Soldiers, Wolfen, Romasanta: The Werewolf Hunt.
