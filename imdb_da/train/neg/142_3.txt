Firstly, there are some good things about this movie, but it's all cliche slasher stuff combined with a teenage movie. In the advertising of this movie, which I have seen, there was a great emphasis on Denise Richards being in it, but she is a bad actress and not as nice as people trying to make her be (not what it has something to do with the movie). And what about that look she gives everyone? Maybe it's part of the character, but as I said, the actor ... Still writing is fine. You know who the whole movie is, and you can almost predict what is going to happen, but not in an annoying way. I think the book on which it is based is probably good, judging by the plot line, but next time I read the book to find out, rather than see it here.
