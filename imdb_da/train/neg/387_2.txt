One has to wonder if at any time in the production of this movie there existed a <br /> <br /> script that made sense. Was the hard cut 3 hours <br /> <br /> long and was it trimmed in the incoherent mess that survives? <br /> <br /> Why would anyone fund this mess? I mean that Tom <br /> <br /> Wlaschiha is a beautiful young man and he does what he can <br /> <br /> with the dialogue and dramatic situations he gets. But <br /> <br /> characters come and go without apparent reason, continuity is non-existent, and acting, filmography and direction are (to <br /> <br /> politely) amateurish. Not a sleeping place is an unfortunate <br /> <br /> choice of title as it is likely to be false if anyone actually tries to watch this movie.
