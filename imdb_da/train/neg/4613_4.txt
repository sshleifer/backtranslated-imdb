Well then what is it? I found Nicholson's character low and most unfortunately uninteresting. Angelica Houston's character killed my power. And Kathleen Turner is a dirty, no good blunt. It's not that I "don't get it". It's not that I don't think any of the ideas could have led to anything more. This is a movie with nothing but the notion that we must accept these ideas, and that is what the film is about to do. That Nicholson falls to Turner is absurd, but then again it is supposed to be like that. However, this does not strike me as one.) Fun, or b.) ... even remotely interesting !!! This was a waste of my time so don't let the hype get the best of you ... it's a waste of your time! With all that being said, the open church sequence is quite beautiful ...
