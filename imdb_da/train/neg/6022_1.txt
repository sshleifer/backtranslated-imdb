I get a little tired of people abusing God's name to continue their own bigoted view of the world. I do not dismiss the idea of ​​Armageddon or the coming of the antichrist. I reject the idea that only certain people who live really good lives (they seem to be mostly white Christian children) will come to heaven, while the rest of us will suffer through a millennium of hell on earth just because we was not good enough. God can be a judge, but I don't think he should measure any level of goodness. Give the creator some credit.
