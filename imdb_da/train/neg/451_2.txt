I don't care how many nominations this junk got for best this and that movie stunk. I did not know if I should turn off the kit or file a lawsuit with O.J.'s lawyer for improper harm to my mental health. I have rarely been bored; Calling this dungeon entertainment is a slap in the face of all movie gates across the planet. The whole story was stupid, the actor was uninspired, the 'drama was numb. I'm grateful I didn't have to pay for this unfulfilling experience.
