I haven't seen it for over twenty years. OJ was the bus driver, Arte Johnson was the tour guide, Lorenzo was kidnapped. Yes, Lorenzo as much at home as the villain, a natural one. I think I saw it again, mostly for OJ, as I had seen Towering Inferno and Cassandra Crossing, but also seeing Arte Johnson. <br /> <br /> I was a little sorry that Johnson was so serious. <Br /> <br /> And yes, the plots changed. By reading other posts, I remember that it was a plot that they had to kidnap some rich girls, but then the invaluable freedom of action stood out of the blue. I went to a stamp? If it happened like a late movie, I'd probably record it to check it again, but I wouldn't be nostalgic about it. Not afterall. <br /> <br /> There are better movies from the 70s like this to check out.
