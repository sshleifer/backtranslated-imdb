Phil Alien is one of the quirky films where humor is based on anything but better. <br /> <br /> Initially, it was very strange and pretty funny, but when the movie went ahead, I didn't find game or game fun anymore. <br /> <br /> It's a low budget movie (it's never a problem in itself), there were some pretty interesting characters, but in the end I just lost interest. <br /> <br /> I imagine this movie would appeal to a stoner who is currently participating. <br /> <br /> For something similar, but better try "Brother from another planet"
