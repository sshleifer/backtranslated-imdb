'Say Yes' is one of the flicks that you hope will improve, but it never does. It's the kind of "motive psychopath deciding to threaten an innocent couple" crapfest, so loved by just for video filmmakers. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is lumpy and in many places poorly translated. The play is uniformly poor, especially from the villain of the play played by Joong-Hoon Park. He seems to think that by not blinking and trying to speak in a deep voice, he makes his character seem threatening when all that really does, makes him seem a little simple. The reason deserves special mention as it is idiotic beyond all faith. The heroes do not think it is too strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them. The heroine twice fails to see the villain when he is no more than a foot away from her. The villain walks past a police checkpoint (while having a shirt in the blood and a bloody main connection) by showing the police a burned corpse in the passenger seat of the car he is driving. The villain is stopped, lumped with a shovel and attached with a shovel, but never seems to be hampered by these, rather serious injuries. And don't even get me started on the terrible 'twist' end. Sheesh. <br /> <br /> The only plus in this movie is for me Sang Mi Chu. Who is very beautiful but really no more than a mediocre actress. Overall, this movie comes out as a badly written, flaccidly acted and shockingly-directed attempt to copy 'The Hitcher' and 'Spoorloos' but it fails every time because of the lack of talent of everyone involved.
