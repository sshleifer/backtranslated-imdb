This movie was a mess. It had the absolute worst editing I've ever seen. It was almost like the end of a scene that the author wanted to go to commercial, and the filmmaker added a second of black screen to fulfill the author's dream. During the messy direction and editing there was a glimpse of something good. A good idea, a compelling spark. But somewhere went wrong. <br /> <br /> The story is about a quasi-psychic priest trying to solve a series of murders. The first thing that is hard to bite is Richard Grieco as priest. Now the part does not ask that he is a good priest, and he succeeds quite well. The second problem is Dennis Hopper as the crazy evil guy. He always plays the crazy evil guy. Very high hum. <br /> <br /> Oh, it was a thought for me that maybe all of the jumped, horrible editing and offline plot tried to add a sense of confusion the character (Grieco) experienced. And just to prove that it was constructed, they rolled the credits backwords. Not a good sign of any movie. <br /> <br />
