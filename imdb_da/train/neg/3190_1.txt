Jimmy Dean could not have been more hammy or absurdly loutish. Hysterical if seen through the eyes of the Mystery Science Theater 3000, which I consider to be a 10. I believe that the sight of this obese corn-lined swine fever around Malta should be enough to send you to the vomit if you make it so far into the movie . This ugly hysterical farce should be placed with e.g. "Booty Call", "Pumpkinhead", "Swarm" and "The Smurfs Go to Bangladesh". A-gulpfilm like this shows that sometimes actors, writers, producers etc. Comes behind on their mortgage or gets stoned into insanity. It asks the question "who was so stupid to fund such a whale?" But then, if there was good judgment and "Final Justice" was never, then we would not have the glorious Spoof Voice in the "Mystery Science Theater 3000"!
