Here is one of the educational short films that are made to teach the unknown people out there about life facts. This time, the audience is preteen girls, life is menstruation. This animated film, created by Walt Disney Pictures, apparently with some Kotex sponsors. <br /> <br /> It begins by explaining how hormones make you grow and develop. Using animation and a female narrator, it shows us how the body, especially the ovaries, uterus and vagina, work and why it all leads to menstruation. It is almost amazing to become the comic book here, how to avoid the subject of sex. Even the word is never mentioned, although "furtilized" will pass once. I don't really know why I saw this, but since it is one of those rare short films that could give an impression of an innocent time, you might want to try it.
