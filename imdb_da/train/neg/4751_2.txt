First of all when I saw teaser trailer for Wendy Wu, I was absolutely thrilled. Brenda Song, one of the hottest girls on the Disney Channel, would do martial arts, and that was fine with it ... until I saw the movie. The action was poorly constructed, the film could not have realized anyone, the fighting was unrealistic and it sucked ... along with the plot. If you are really thinking about it is a wannabe Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a girl who is the descendant of other warriors who were women, a girl will ignore her call and want to be the homecoming queen, the guard who bends to prepare a great fight against some old evil. The idea was just not so original, the movie is a waste of time.
