As others have noted, it should have been an excellent Hammer style movie, and it seems to me that most of the actors were instructed to play it ... but the manuscript is so loose, poorly paced and filled with a lot of dull soliloquies (poor Timothy Dalton saddled with most of them) that it is too crowded and self-meaning. This is an uncharacteristically weak performance from Dalton, although he quietly seams the climatic scene where Dr. Rock finally finds out what he has done. The only actor who looks really good is Patrick Stewart, who is a very welcome sight. Freddie Francis may have been a great film photographer, but he was a miserable instructor.
