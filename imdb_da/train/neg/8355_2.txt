Wanda Nevada is a public fantasy film that uses approx. 1979 ideas of what constitutes illegal romance for 13 year old girls. Script, pacing and direction are uniformly awful. Action sequences defy belief. Characters are spoken with the simplified diction one usually finds in movies directed at under 10 sets, but also contains several sexual references that involve Shield's character and graphic deaths. <br /> <br /> The movie wants to be a comedy at some level, but it's never fun, a fairy tale picture, but plot and action are insipid and a children's movie, but introduce pedophilia and rape as real opportunities. It will also be a buddy picture, an upcoming age picture, a ghost movie, an Indian spiritual movie, a travelog and a western. The overall impact is of massive stupidity with an unpleasant twist. Wanda Nevada is a complete waste of time unless you want to see many great shoots from the Grand Canyon. That it manages to do it fine.
