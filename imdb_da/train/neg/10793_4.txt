I watched this movie at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. Based on a novella by science fiction writer Brian Aldiss, this film tries to tell the story of Tom and Barry Howe, linked twins who are picked from their family by an impresario to form a rock band. <br /> <br /> Almost deliberately gimmicky, the movie is too smart at half (if you want to apologize for the pun). By mixing genres, styles and moods, the directors (whose previous films were the excellent documentary Lost In La Mancha) lose quite quickly. I was never sure whether to think about it all or not. Flashbacks, dream sequences, it was all just a little bit. Moreover, the promised rock moved and didn't just roll me. I was reminded a little too much at times with Hedwig and Angry Inch, a movie I found original and moved. But in this case the songs were not as good, nor were the main characters sympathetic. A more unfavorable comparison would be the correspondingly disappointing Velvet Goldmine.
