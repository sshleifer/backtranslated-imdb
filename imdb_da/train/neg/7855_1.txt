I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this movie. There is no point in it except blood and violence. Contrary to other scary movies that had done and an impact on it, this movie is just blood, doing and killing one after another. This movie is not interesting at all, has no meaningful plot or story line, nor does it have any intelligence in it. The blood looks very fake and this film is generally meaningless. Don't waste your time with it. It's just an hour or two of thoughtless violence. It has many bloody scenes that are not scary but just plain rebellion. This is probably the worst horror movie I've ever seen out of all the horror movies I've ever seen.
