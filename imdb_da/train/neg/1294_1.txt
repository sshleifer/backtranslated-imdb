The central theme of this movie seems to be confusion as relationships, attitude, acting and social context all lead to the same place: confusion. Even Harvey Keitel seems to be out of his element and lacks his usual impeccable clarity, direction and intensity. To make matters worse, his character's name is 'Che', and we're only told (directly by the narrator) well into the movie that he's not 'it' Che, just a guy named Che. Family relationships remain unclear until the end of the movie, and once defined, the family is divided - the younger generation into America. So clich√©. Other reviews discuss how the film portrays the impact of the revolution on a boy's family; But the director's political attitude is at best obscure, and we are never quite sure who is responsible for bloodshed. So they lost their property (acquired by gambling profits) - so what? Refusing to take a political stand when making a film about the Cuban Revolution is a strange and erroneous choice. Not to mention the movie was in English! Why do all these Cubans speak English? No wonder they didn't get permission for movies in Cuba. And if family life is most important to look at here, it would be great if we could find out who is - we are 'introduced' to all of them at the beginning - a cheap way to make the conditions clear across the movie! The play was mostly superficial, wood and incredible, the timing was from all around. The "special" visual effects were confusing and distracting. References to American films - and the black character as Greek chorus - strictly gratuitous, intellectually ostentatious and consistently out of place. I only saw the whole movie, because I was waiting for clarity, or some pointed to it all. It never happened.
