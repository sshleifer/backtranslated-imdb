One of the lamer wedding movies you can see. Smacked too much of his time, so it was outdated before it hit theaters. The ethnic stereotypes are like a Henny Youngman joke, except that they are just not least fun here. Molly Ringwald, what is to be said yet. Give a clue to the mess, she destroys a $ 10,000 wedding dress because "It just won't be me" do it in this cloth, with straps and put on a top hat, and everyone smiles boldly at her moxy instead of ringwalding her neck. It's also a cast, also check out how heavy Ally Sheedy's. Wheeeew!
