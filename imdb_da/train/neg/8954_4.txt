I had great hopes for this movie because I enjoyed so much in the book. But I don't think I would have understood the film's premise if I hadn't already read the book. The film is a noble attempt to show the despair of people trying to break the bonds of overwhelming governance, but the book portrays the suffering much more thoroughly. The corrupt officials have comfortable, almost luxurious lives, while ordinary people struggle to achieve just the necessities for survival. Perhaps most people feel against their leaders and rulers, whether or not they are actually suppressed or oppressed. Orwell's dystopia seems to exist in many places in our modern world. It has been several years since I read the book, but you hear references to Big Brother, The Thought Police and Newspeak often in the media and casual conversation. Probably many people who use these terms do not realize where the conditions came from. I strongly recommend that you read the book.
