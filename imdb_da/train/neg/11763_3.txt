Yes. I admit it. I believed all the hype about this work, about the trials and tribulations of 6 people living in Mexico City about their sexual lives. And I really expected to see a Mexican movie (in ages) that was both popular and interesting to watch. Unfortunately, the film was quite disappointing. The story presents us with two couples, both with very obvious civilian problems. When a third party enters each couple's life, their problems come to a crucial point. Or absolutely absurd. The reason then becomes a battle of the sexes. The attitude taken by each group (yes, they literally group, girls with girls and boys with boys) is blatantly stupid and childish (I think humor should be there). And everything goes from bad to worse. The performances range from good (Miss Zavaleta) to mediocre (Mr Bichir), with Serrano doing an acceptable job at his opera prime. But the flat circumstances that make up the plot, the one-dimensional characters, the very poor (if not stupid) perception of what sex represents in a mature relationship, etc., make the film erroneous. Pathetic. SPyL has had an (impressive) good reception at the cash register office. Believe hype at your own risk.
