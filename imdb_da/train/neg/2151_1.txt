This is a hybrid creature born in Carl Macek's mind. With Robotech's second generation (Robotech Masters) and Megazone 23 in a lousy movie that has no logic! The story is very, very bad, and you can't forgive Megazone's actions when you have nothing to do with Robotech. If this movie is so high rank is for the TV series and not for itself !! I said, the name can't save this!
