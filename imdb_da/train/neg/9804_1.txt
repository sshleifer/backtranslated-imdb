The Power Rangers, the moronic merchandising tv kids show from the 1990s, have to be the most pointless and ridiculous TV show ever created. What is the real point of this show anyway, apart from selling other review plastic nonsense to kids? There is nothing that even removes redemption or interesting about this show anyway. <br /> <br /> Look at the costumes that look like spandex bad. <br /> <br /> The early 1990s mullet style hair, earrings and fashion look ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Avoid this show at all costs!
