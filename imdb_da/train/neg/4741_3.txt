Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior has a very good, strong plot, but is destroyed by cheesy details throughout the movie. I'm a younger teenager and don't have much of this movie. I thought the effects were terrible, but they may seem entertaining to younger children. The matrix movements destroyed the action, you know it was completely fake. Then there was the Yen Lo, an evil spirit temporarily possessing random people and returning home, where Wendy tried to win. It all ends up as a typical good movie when Wendy and her Buddhist monk Shen defeat Yen Lo (and destroy him forever) at last. So Wendy teaches a lesson ... blah, blah, blah. I'm ready for the next DCOM.
