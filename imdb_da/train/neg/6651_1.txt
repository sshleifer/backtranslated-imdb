This is definitely the worst movie I've seen all year. <br /> <br /> First I want to say that the actor was very good and of all the cast. <br /> <br /> This was apparently meant to be very offbeat, and in that respect succeeded. Similarly, the story revolves around a self-centered wannabe, a clueless, talented chronic liar whose source of confidence comes from a pair of leather slippers. <br /> <br /> This was worse than looking at a car wreck.
