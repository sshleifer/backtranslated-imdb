As many agree, Origin is a beautiful anime artistic. The music, graphics and the created world are beautiful and really stand out over most other modern animated works. But if you are looking for more than this, then I suggest to look elsewhere. The beauty stops shortly after the look, and when it really comes down to the plot and signs, there is nothing special. The action is slow and minimal, and the people are sometimes flat, corny and do not seem realistic. Not to mention the plot hole here and plotted the hole there ... So in summary, oh my goodness, I've never seen an anime as beautiful as this; And oh my goodness, it's like ... -poke people don't work like that. It took a real step forward in graphics and music in anime, but it also took a few steps back sometimes with poor characterization, and unfortunately there is not even so much action to make up for it ...
