I always thought people were a little too cynical about these old Andy Hardy movies. A couple of them were not bad. Modern film critics are not the ones who usually prefer to be vague, as good-two shoe films as they rarely get praise <br /> <br /> Nor can I defend this movie anyway. You can still have a dated dialogue, but still laugh and cry over the story. When you see this, you just push your head asking yourself, "How stupid can you get?" This is cornier than corny if you know what I mean. It's so cool that I can't get too many people to sit through the hour and a half. The story is basically "Andy" (Mickey Rooney) trying to get out of junk because he is a story of being involved with some New York City debutants, as if it were the ultimate. People were much more socially conscious in the old days. You would hear the word "social-climber" as if knowing rich or beautiful people was the highest achievement you could make it to life. It is of course quite unclear and looks even more so today. <br /> <br /> But it's about being innocent and purely a story and series (there were half a dozen of these Andy Hardy movies made) that you could find. Also, if you like to hear Judy Garland sing, then this is your ticket as she sings a few songs in here, and she curls into Andy's heart. Oh man, I almost just throw up writing about this!
