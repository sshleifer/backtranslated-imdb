This is not as much a movie as a big budget children's TV. As far as I can tell, the villain is a huge swarm of chocolate-covered espresso beans. This theory appears to be confirmed by the fact that the subtitles refer to it as "insomnia". When you first mention that a civilization has been wiped out by insomnia, I thought "Wow! A Nihilist martial arts movie!" but not such luck. Even if you have to consider the experimental cinema when the villain is strangled by an old man's long white eyebrows. Zu Warriors makes just the same sense of whether the subtitles are on or off. It's not a good sign. I found the special effects to be somewhere between Ray Harryhausen and Xena: Warrior Princess. Primitive.
