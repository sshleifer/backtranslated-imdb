A small town is attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty vampires. The only hope is a lonely avenger and a group of ragtag survivors. <br /> <br /> Released in 1993, "Darkness" achieved some of a cult after the release. It's easy to see why - it's charged (and I mean freaking loaded) with gore, and it's energy and enthusiasm, as found in other non-budget cult fears such as "The Dead Next Door" and "The Children of Ravensback" is actually pretty contagious. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is not enough to save it. The movie was shot on a Super 8 so the picture is grainy and dark, making things very difficult to see (it would have been good if it had hidden the protagonist's horrible mud.) Also the lattice is the soundtrack consisting of annoying Casio Keyboard and Even more annoying Death Metal (seriously, what is it with these no budget horror flicks and bad Death Metal?) While not expecting Oscar's worthy performances, the play is still strictly amateur hour as the actors sometimes seem almost confused rather than frightened or threatened. <br /> <br /> Finally, I am sure fans of no budget gurus will love this. However, everyone else would like that there was a little more meat on the ribs.
