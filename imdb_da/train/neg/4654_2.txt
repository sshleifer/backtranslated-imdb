A female vampire kills young women and paints with their blood. She has an assistant who doesn't want to be a vampire so he has to do whatever she orders or converts to blood suction. After a few kills, the assistant becomes infamous and falls in love with a homeless girl. What can I say about this movie? That pacing is slow, it has some odd sound effects (never a bite sounded so strange) and mood (new jazz here I come), and that the lights don't seem to be included on the set. It looks like an "auteur" horror movie with all the self-sufficiency inside. <br /> <br /> The reason is quite stupid, and as you can guess, it is the female vampire who explains how to kill her even though she doesn't do it, of course, cross, light, garlic and sticks do not work. does not. <br /> <br /> It's not even a fun lousy movie. Perhaps with some friends and many beers, it may not have its funny sides (to be honest, it's fun for 10-15 minutes near the end of the movie). Don't be fooled by the Troma sticker, it's a bad movie they present.
