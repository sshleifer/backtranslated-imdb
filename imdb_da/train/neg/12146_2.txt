This apocalyptic zombie film is trying to be evil and shocking; but FEEDING THE MASSES comes from lamb as some of the stiff-bone zombies stalking the streets. In Rhode Island, a zombie epidemic known as Lazarus virus is played down by government manipulated newspapers and television stations. A few brave but stupid souls on Channel 5 TV News feel that the audience is getting false hope and no idea of ​​the real danger at hand. An avid reporter (Racheal Morris) and her cameraman (William Garberina) with the help of a military escort (Patrick Cohen) risk life and limbs presenting a live broadcast to show the verdict at hand. Do yourself a favor and not see. This thing is of course very low budget and comes across with the feeling of a high school play gone bad. Acting is terrible and the meat-hungry zombies are almost comical. Also shown: Michael Propster, William DeCoff and Brenda Hogan. FOODS OF MASSES should be left to starve.
