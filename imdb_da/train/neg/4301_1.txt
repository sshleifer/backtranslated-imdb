I stayed for one night and became very boring around 2:00, so I slipped effortlessly through the channels and happened upon H.B.O. where this "classic" played. I was initially happy to have caught something in the beginning, but my happiness fell for two minutes in the movie. The whole movie centered on an unattractive man who had fear of women, four beautiful but empty-minded women who worked as waitresses on his uncle's dinner and his hugely fat and extremely miserable cousin, who also works for dinner. There are a few odd phrases in this movie that make it a bit interesting but certainly not worth seeing. Basically, if you have nothing to do one night or just can't sleep, the medicine works much better. But guys who are very skin, so it can be okay to look without sound, but even that can be annoying
