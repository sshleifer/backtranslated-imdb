The protocol is a relentless film whose only saving grace is that the stars Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of supportive actors. The story is about a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after an inadvertent saving of an Arab dignitar. The story goes downhill halfway through the movie, and Goldie's charm just doesn't save this movie. Unless you're a Goldie Hawn fan, don't go out of your way to watch this movie.
