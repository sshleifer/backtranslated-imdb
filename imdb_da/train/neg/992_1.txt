This movie was disgusting. Their should be a warning that some sadistic unpleasant writers are trying to make a name for themselves before being held in hostages for an hour and a half and looking at garbage. What is garbage? Abuse of peoples' time, abuse of energy and waste of any type of education system that taught her how to read and write. Talia you are a sick demented loser. Your psychiatrist should prescribe stronger medication for your problem. <br /> <br /> The plot and plot gave me no choice but to fast forward through the center of the garbage. I ended up on a scene that was effortless for. To learn how to shock people, see a Larry Clark movie. I lost all respect for the whole movie of this movie "No more support from me." How could actors or actresses sit on a set, while such brutal portrayals of human behavior are manifested by psychic minds? I'm sorry for all the actors who participated in that scene. I think the devil now knows who the author of this movie is; Congratulations on winning your attention.
