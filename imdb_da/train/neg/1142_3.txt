You've been fouled and turned up in submission to my tough statements about "femme fatal" / "guns n 'gals" movies! Now another race comes in disappointing rediscovery: ninja movie! Many of these I've seen before and let me tell you they're not all that is blown up! They usually do not hold to that point. This among all others suffers from no originality! What does a ninja have to do with preventing a nuclear holocaust in Russia? And isn't it supposed to be a martial arts movie? Are there lots of gunfire as an incredible action movie for you? Is blood the first reason to love this to death? Want to waste some of your hard earned money over a lady singing in her transparent tank top? The answers to these important questions can be found in the NINJA MISSION, which must be in the fighting portal section of your video store. For even more nonsense ninja fun, try checking out the Godfrey Ho movies released by Trans World. You get what you deserve and that's a promise! Recommended only for hardcore ninja addicts!
