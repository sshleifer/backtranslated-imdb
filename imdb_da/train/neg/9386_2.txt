In the many movies I've seen Warren Oates, I have come to a conclusive conclusion, here is a talented person. I first saw Mr. Oates back in the 1960s television series called Stoney Burke. From then on, I followed his career closely and felt he was destined for great roles. It happened in 1974 when Sam Peckinpah gave him top billing in a movie called 'Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia.' Of course, his greatest claim to fame was his magnificent role in 'The Wild Bunch'. I always thought he could certainly bring a sign of some magic, that is, until I saw him in this flop. The film is called "Chandler", a tribute to the iron-fought detectives of the 1950s created by Raymond Chandler. Because synopsis said it was about a hard nose Private Eye, I was immediately interested. But I sat patiently through the entire movie and found it to be a dull, disinterested, slow pace, twisted, confusing saga, which, if it had a theme or plot, must have been left in a dark back room itself. Along with some of Hollywood's best supporting stars, such as Alex Dreier, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pinsent, Charles McGraw, Richard Loo and Scatman Crothers, this movie had enough power to reach Mach five, but it fizzled on the launchpad and went no where. As a result, one of my favorite actors got stuck in a badly made vehicle that never came out of the ground. **
