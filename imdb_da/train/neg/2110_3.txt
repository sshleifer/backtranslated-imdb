Now I love Bela Lugosi, do not understand me, he is one of the most interesting people ever made a movie, but he certainly made his share of clunkers. This is just another of them. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays Dr.Lorenz, a doctor who has received his medical certificate for inexplicable reasons. However, he tries to keep his wife young and beautiful. It is revealed that she is 70-80 years old, but Lugosi seems to be in his mid-50s so why he's married to this old woman, it's never really explained. <br /> <br /> However, these treatments or experiments involved giving brides who are married to the altar a kind of sweet smelling substance through which they pass out but are considered dead. Then Lugosi and some of his assistants steal the body on the way to the morning house and take it back to his lab where it is held in some sort of suspended animation or catatonic state. Then, the stolen brides a needle rammed somewhere in their bodies, perhaps the throat, and then the needle hit the body of Lugosi's wife to bring her back to youth and beauty. We really don't really see where Lugosi is sticking the needle or whatever he pulls out of the brides, but it recovers his wife. wife screams a lot until she returns to her younger state. Helping Lugosi in his laboratory is the only good thing about this movie .... a weird old hag and her two deformed sons .... a son is a big lumpy-looking slow-acting guy who likes to spoil the snoozing brides and the another son is a mediocre little dwarf .... small person, to be politically correct in today's world. At night, these three are just kind of raising and sleeping in Lugosi's boring downstairs lab.Who these 3 are and how they came to be Lugosi's scared assistants is like a lot of things in this movie never explained. <br /> <br /> Yet, a female reporter is given the task of her grumpy editor to find out where all the stolen brides must by one common thing among all the stolen brides is a rare orchid that found on them. So she asks around and is told that there is a world-famous orchid expert who lives nearby who is just the one who developed this particular orchid. This expert turns out to be creepy Dr.Lorenz.She quickly tracks him and disturbs his little house of horror. I'm not sure where the police were under all this, but they came in to dry up after the reporter had done all the dirty works. It seems that Lugosi's film always had some sort of unnecessary silly plot line that just made all things stinking in the sky. I mean a world-famous orchid expert kidnap brides by sending them a doped up orchid he himself is known to have developed? D'OH! <br /> <br /> Later, it revealed that the young ladies should not even be the bride of the procedure to work, why should Lugosi break kidnapping from highly guarded churches for his experiments and create all the attention and newspaper headlines? Why not just take a prostitute out of the street as a normal weirdo pervert would do? This clunker reminded me of a lot of Lugosi stinks, "The Devil Bat" .... same stupid plot lines and bad plays and the same stupid 'reporter gets bad guy'. <br /> <br /> But Lugosi is always good - he's scary and scary enough to keep you interested at least enough to keep an eye on him. The woman who played the reporter was just a horrible actress .... she had no feelings at all, she just gave her lines like a machine gun, spitting them out as fast as she could. Everyone else blew pretty much when it came to being good actors. <br /> <br /> But this thing can be seen if it is only for Bela Lugosi fans.Lugosi was always so intense even when the picture was a dog. He must have known that he was making horrible pictures, but perhaps he also knew that if he gave it all that he had a bit of that intensity could shine through all the evil spots and bad plays that surrounded him. <br /> <br /> And he was right ---- We scary fans will always have a love for Bela Lugosi.He gave it his all every hour He was in front of the camera. We give you two f ** ks for you, Bela.
