This is by far the WORST movie I've ever seen. I've seen some pretty horrible movies in my time, but this one takes the cake, no, wait, I mean the whole damn bakery. It is so bad that I believe in a word to describe the way you will feel after seeing this cruelty, not yet created. Please do yourself a favor if you ever want to see this and see thirty minutes of the annoying purple dinosaur Barney, multiply that thirty times and you will still only get a small portion of the horror you want to be in the store for. In summary, I think you can really call it a horror movie, but only if you are willing to be scared meaningless by the worst dealings in the business and completely pointless story. <br /> <br /> Real Rating, -10 Disgusting
