Okay, I've tried and I've tried, but I'm not getting this Guy Maddin thing. Stories From Gimli Hospital left me cold, the film about the Austrian villagers and the one about the ice nymph was beautiful to see but lacking in the history department ... and this nudity film about abortion and hockey is just boring. I'm glad Maddin has an appreciation for silent movies, but I don't like his movies for the same reason I don't like Quentin Tarantino's movie: they are empty tribute to better and more imaginative movies - movies that advanced art form or broke new ground - and is all style and no matter. No number of cuts and odd camera angles can spoil the fact that Maddin is an unoriginal David Lynch wannabe, though he has an advantage over Tarantino: he generally does not write embarrassing dialogue because most of his films rely on intertitles. The bottom line is, Maddins schtick is clever, smart film making for aspiring film majors.
