This movie was promising: My favorite actor in a historical drama during the War of Independence. It was reminiscent of "Dances With Wolves" for the great prairies, Indians, military battles and from "Barry Lyndon" for British and candlelight atmospheres ... Unfortunately, the script is terrible: Continuity of history is lacking (cuts by "5 months later"; 3 years later ") & the romance is so ridiculous that it's hard to believe in it: America is a big country, but the characters kept bumping into each other; Above all, wait for the end and you understand how to kill a story (imagine the same in "Titanic"). Sometimes a bad script is saved by a brilliant movie maker. Unfortunately bis, Hudson is a bad one. He has already committed "Greystoke" and I find the same mistakes again: no dynamics in scenes, in editing, in scoring: it is long, boring, flat .... <br /> <br /> I knew that This movie was a disaster for Pacino's career: now I understand. Finally, this last film for 2006 in this year's vintage is for me: A painful one ...
