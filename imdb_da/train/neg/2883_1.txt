This movie is just so horrible. So bad, I can't bear to use anything other than just a few words. Avoid this movie at all costs, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> None of the details of the crimes are re-enacted properly. Lots of slaughterhouses footage. Strange cuts and edits. No continuity in the plot. The action is definitely the most amateur I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Of course, this bomb of a movie was made to make some money regardless of the accuracy of that content. The camera's work is out of focus at times and always shakes. It looks like it was shot on video. In fact, now that they've got Dennis Rader with life in prison, I wish they would put the guys who also made this horrible movie in jail. <br /> <br /> Seriously, don't even think about seeing this. I would give it a negative star if I could.
