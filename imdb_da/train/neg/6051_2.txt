urgh! 3 things a movie needs: a good script, a good plot and good casting. I saw this movie expecting to be hilarious and unfortunately disappointed as it was just awful. I lost the will to live halfway through. The only thing that stopped me from sticking my eyes out with a fork was Rose Byrne (which was why I looked at it in the first place). She did a good job as Rastus, and her appearance hasn't changed much since she was 13. It was a great first action in a movie. the dog was also very good. both did a good job with such terrible material. Sandra Bernhard I think was the biggest mistake in the movie. She was completely unhappy and I don't think she's ever got the grade. <br /> <br /> I give the movie 2 out of 10 - and that's only because of Rose.
