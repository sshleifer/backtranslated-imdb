Well, TiVo recorded this because of Angelina Jolie. It had 2.5 stars. It seemed promising. It went downhill quickly. <br /> <br /> There is much exaggeration, even from Angelina. She is about 20 and plays a 16 year old. There are three characters to be Italian. Everyone else is Italian-American. The native Italian accents were good, I thought. The young male lead is sweet, my wife says. Everyone else in this movie is a bold Italian woman. Even the men. <br /> <br /> I should have known that when Dick Van Patten was cast as a randy doctor, it was a bad sign. The two couples chasing their children are like the four Italian Stooges. <br /> <br /> My wife wouldn't let go of the remote. Hopefully she didn't take makeup, clothes or decorating tips. It was a sick and twisted combination of horrible and rarely. It was hidegarishous. <br /> <br /> Cutting off my left ventricle was not enough to distract from the pain of watching this movie. If this movie is shown on your TV, do yourself a favor and ram your head through the TV screen instead. You will be glad you did. The only movie I've ever seen was worse than this was "Hamburger: The Movie". Or maybe "Deadly Friend".
