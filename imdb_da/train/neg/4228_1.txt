I can't believe how bad this piece of waste is! I want my $ 3.99 back! Word speaks the description of this badly made destiny! Dubbing in no way shape or shape adjusts with the actor's mouth. The movie looks like it was filmed with a 1970's video camera. I've shot better movies with my cell phone camera. Gore is ridiculous because of the stupid incredible plot. The action is what you would expect if you called all your friends on a Saturday afternoon and continued to be completely demolished, then try to put a game in your garage. Don't make me wrong ... I didn't expect O'Neil and I love Zombie movies, but the production values ​​are so low in this movie that they do it unmatched. Avoid!
