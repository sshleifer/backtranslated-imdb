I cannot say that I am all that has experienced in the misty Mundae flicks since they have only seen a handful, but it is obvious that this was made on a shoestring and while it could have been respectable that the filmmakers Could make a Tomb Raider rip-off inside a garage, it's not because it's quite obvious that this is what they did. The movie only runs for 45 minutes, and that is certainly a good thing, as there is hardly enough plot here to stretch it out anymore. It has something to do with a vicious Nazi scientist (who looks as vicious as a porn star playing a Nazi scientist ever could), a mummy that is clearly a man wrapped in toilet roll and Misty - this movie's Tomb Raider version who keeps her in much less time than Angelina Jolie did in the big budget version. I have to say that, despite its shortcomings, this movie could have been better. It has Misty Mundae for a start, and even better than that, if you ask me, it is also that it stars even the hotter Darian Caine. The couple are allowed to engage in all the lesbian sex that one expects from a Seduction Cinema movie, and this is at the expense of the non-existent plot, though not a bad thing. Obviously this is a rubbish movie - but it is short that it is short and if you are looking for some lesbian sex, you can do worse.
