This movie is a cringe party with bad acting and poor set design as well as sticky lines and a lame plot. But it is so fun to see. Everything about it is fun. The basic plot is a group of scientists from the future who travel back in time to capture their evil employee who intends to destroy them all. They catch him in 1146. The scientists' futuristic lab from the year 2033 is a quadruple room with a bunch of 'futuristic' flashing buttons and a time capsule that looks like a lawn. The actors deliver their lines of unenthusiastic aplomb, which is not hard to understand given that the lines are usually earthquakes like "I double checked everything twice!" He double checked everything twice? He checked it four times? Not only that, but they give you the whole premise of the movie in the first five minutes, and continue at a fast fire pace until they hit the medieval part. When Roger Corman ran out of money. And had to stop traveling through time and consequently different sets. The medieval set is a comic mish moss from the end of the 10th century to the 16th century. Any costume they could find, they used. I suppose chain mail was not on the budget, because the boys all wear sequenced shirts that are masquerading as armor. The fighting scenes are ridiculous, with men throwing themselves on cardboard swords with abandoned and dying in death throwing a blow in battle. It sounds really awful, but I enjoy it every time I see it. The lines alone are enough to get you fit and everything else pulls together to create a fabulous B movie that if you are a connoisseur of corny flicks, I suggest you look. And when you have, read the review on unknown films. I love to hear them point out all the fun, really horrible bits of the movie.
