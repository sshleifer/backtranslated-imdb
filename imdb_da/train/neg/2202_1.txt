This movie makes me believe that the others I've seen with Combs were an accident. The reason had more gaps than I think I've ever seen in a movie claiming to be more than a "b" movie. The action was so ridiculous that not even the memories of Combs' previous fighting triumphs were enough to save it. Considering the script, I have to imagine that there was not enough money in the budget for things like continuity and original ideas. I am very worried that I have paid Blockbuster prices for this bin. The fact that it was made for television was something that would have helped me avoid this cruelty and honestly that something filmed this poor should be required to warn you. Avoid this movie no matter what.
