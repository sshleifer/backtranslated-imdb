What was it here? Someone of course read Stephen King and Sartre in the same semester. We get existential anxiety mixed in with cheap horror. There were moments that were disturbing, but each was canceled by horrible music, CGI or acting. <br /> <br /> The problem of strange stories like this is that it feels lazy. Even David Lynch's work feels like this at times, and like his interesting shows and movies, it runs far too long. And unfortunately it is only 98 minutes. The game was attractive and it's about the limit of this. I suppose it touches the feelings of young people and the fear of loneliness we all have, but just don't do the characters that are nice enough to worry about their fate ... no matter what they were. The final scene leaves it all ambiguous.
