This one seems like a satire under the women's rights movement era. Of course, this does not mean that COACH (the film) is a wonderful experience to see. It runs into the same vein as FASTBREAK (which was better but still tame), and is basically standard fare. What I think this movie is uninteresting is easy to recognize. Anyone who earns time away from a normal job by training a lot of lunatics, earning a sudden victory, does waste. It's the same feeling you can get after seeing this. A good attempt to throw the opposite sex for a man's duty, but I expected better things.
