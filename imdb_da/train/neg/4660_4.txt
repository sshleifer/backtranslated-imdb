At first glance, this gives the impression that it becomes a ridiculous blaxploitation flick, and it contains moments where it goes in that direction. The basic story idea, however, is much stronger than expected, and is a respectable effort to highlight racial problems in the Second World War era. The recognizable cast is hit and miss, with Glynn Turman, Richard Pryor and the under-utilized Billy Dee Williams rushing best. However, Stephen Boyd stops as little as twirling his bushy mustache in an overindulgent star swing. <br /> <br /> The apparently low budget leads to inconsistency in production values. The location is great, the effects and the action are weak. Imagine if the "Saving Private Ryan" had consisted of half of the platon killed in the same way that Vin Diesel's Caparzo had (unless we see the shot because they can't handle it), then Hanks, Damon and Burns around in a jeep and shot five Germans for climax. Still, the conviction, with the heroic soldiers who do not respect their implementation, because they are black and Boyd's racist captain is accomplished by this, convincingly, as the character of the Turman is written in a journal of his imagined exploits whose soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging latrines. In short, the "Black Brigade / Carter's Army" is not entirely successful. But it's a respectable failure, not a bad joke. It could be recreated as a very good movie, and as it stands is an interesting effort.
