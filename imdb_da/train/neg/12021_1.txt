It can be a little hard for me to say that, but unfortunately so far in his instructor career it is true. Just look at what he has done so far. They almost make it past the 3-star brand. <br /> <br /> Why did I watch this movie? 2 reasons. Lucy Lawless and Heroes star Greg Grunberg. Lucy was excellent in this movie, her show carries the whole movie. I hope she gets a "blockbuster" and breaks into the players' major league, she has the skills. Greg was not that impressive, typical television spectacle. <br /> <br /> The movie is strangely categorized as a horror. The only "horror" is short flashbacks, and they last a maximum of 2-5 seconds with little blood in them. Personally, I would call this more a "drama / thriller". <br /> <br /> But no matter how interesting the story actually is, poor instruction, editing and action (app. from Lucy) destroys it. You get no real connection to the actors, something that is very important in a story like this. You just sit there and see nothing to feel. It's like watching a bad TV soap .... actually, I think the TV soap would be more interesting. <br /> <br /> My advice: Stay away from this movie ... or better, but just stay away from anything Michael Hurst is involved in.
