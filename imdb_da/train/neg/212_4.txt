Closer to reality and more depth than "Breakdance", Stan Lathan's "Beat Street" is still a pretty boring show. Again, this image is really only deposited on the 'breakin' craze, but at least we get some entertainment from the plot that concerns three young friends and a younger brother growing up in Queens, New York. Each has their own unique talent. One is a hustler, a DJ, another is an artist who creates' burners' while little bridge 'Lee is a warm' hip hop 'dancer. <br /> <br /> However, Lathan cannot generate any real public interest in history, and his young cast also fights with their characters. Therefore, it is almost all the way back to the funky music and the "fresh" dance to save the day. <br /> <br /> Choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes, but it alone is not enough to lift Beat Street "to greater heights. Unfortunately, the movie is really flat after showing a glimpse of hope that it just might be interesting. <br /> <br /> Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video
