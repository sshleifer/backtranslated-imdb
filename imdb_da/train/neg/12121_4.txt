Tony Goldwyn is a good actor who obviously tries to rule. "A trip on the moon" seems to have borrowed from other, better-made films. The current history takes place in the late 60s on a summer working summer holiday, not far from Woodstock. Screen processing by Pamela Gray doesn't have much to do for it, so it's a puzzle, why Mr. Goldwyn decided to tackle this movie as his first attempt at direction. <br /> <br /> The Kantrowitz family spend some time at the resort. We see them arriving at the little bungalow that will be their temporary home. Marty, the father, comes only for the weekend; He works in what seems to be a family small appliances business repairing television sets, for the most part. In a few days, the first man will go into the room, so the excitement is clear. The Kantrowitz women are left behind. Pearl, Marty's wife and her sister-in-law, Lilian, spend inactive days on the spot until the "blouse dealer" arrives. Pearl goes on the internet and she finds much more than a shmatte; she also gets the seller. It seems that Pearl and Marty have no sexual life at all. After two children, Pearl, who looks sexy and with a high libido, is ready for some extra marital fun. <br /> <br /> It is the basic premise for the movie, which becomes a soap opera when the young daughter, Alison, decides to play hooky and go to the Woodstock festival nearby where horror of horror she witnesses to her own mother makes out with blouse seller! What is a girl doing? Well, get ready for the final when all the parties are happily reunited by the little son's bedding when he is stabbed by wasps and the seller comes to use some home help, and Dad is called from the city after knowing Perle's treason younger stud. <br /> <br /> Poor Diane Lane, she went to do "Unfaithful" later, which is the exclusive version of this dud. Viggo Mortensen is the seller who caters to his lonely female customers, whispers little things in their ears! Liev Schreiber as Marty, the cuckolded man, doesn't have much to do. Anna Paquin plays the rebellious Alison, and Tovah Feldshuh is the unhappy Nana who wants to have stayed in the city and sees her soap operas instead of seeing the first hand playing in her own backyard! <br /> <br /> Watch It is at your risk or you can pop the DVD into the telly when you have a fun crowd at home and you really want a laugh or two dishing the movie.
