Okay, the box looks promising. Whoopi Goldberg stands beside Danny Glover parading the famous farmer and his wife painting. So you pop this baby in the DVD player and all hope is lost in less than five minutes. Supposed to be a comedy. And I must admit that I laughed about ten minutes before the end. This film has the following elements: A battered and abused neighbor to a neighbor, a boring trial, racism, talk of lynchings and death and arson. Hilarious, huh? No, please, if you never listen to any reviews, then here. You can't even force yourself to see this crap. CRAP! I told you, CRAP! Anyone who names this must actually sue.
