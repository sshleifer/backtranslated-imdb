All the internet buzz aside, this movie was god horrible. I expected the movie to be far better than anything. Instead, the filmmakers tried to make a serious thriller / horror movie, and they completely missed. There were few good parts and a few good lines by Samuel Jackson. Apart from that, it was a bunch of gore and some badly animated snakes. The whole internet was fun miles better than the actual movie. Now that the movie has actually come out, hopefully this joke will die. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of overheated waste. If you're looking for something fun and entertaining, just go to Snakes on a Blog.
