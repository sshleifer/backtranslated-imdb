Okay, I've always been a fan of Batman. I loved the animated series and even Batman Beyond. I even read a Batman cartoon now and then. So as you can imagine - I was a little excited when I heard about this series, and then I was very disappointed. This series is nothing. It does not even begin to compare with the original series. It's like a long TOY advertisement. No depths at all. And what was it about the joker? Who is in my most humble opinion the best Batman villain of ALWAYS and they killed him. I wish I could say that his design was the worst part. In fact, I want to say that there was something about this series that was remotely creative or interesting. In short (because believe me I could say so much more) don't waste your time on this show or your money.
