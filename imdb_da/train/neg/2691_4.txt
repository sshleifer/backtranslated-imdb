Richard Farnsworth is one of my favorite actors. He usually gives solid performances, as in The Straight Story and The Gray Fox. He also does it well here, but the rest of the film suffers from a low budget, poor writing and so-called photography. Miller-Movie formula gives it a 4. Richard gets a 5.
