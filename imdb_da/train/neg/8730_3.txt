The thing that sets me apart in this movie (unfortunately) is the introduction where John Berlin (Andy Garcia) enters the city. You see his Mercedes pass on a winding road through a forest that looks like it is filled with redwood trees. It's pretty beautiful. <br /> <br /> As for Andy Garcia, a character with the surname Berlin plays, yes ... Andy is just for Latin / Latin to be acceptable. Maybe a Caucasian father married his Spanish mother to this story? Who knows. But I can tell you that when you put him in a town with the farm's people and hicks, he stands out as a tender thumb, especially with his accent that flares up when he gets angry. Yes, I know really well? He is still a good actor. <br /> <br /> The title relates to a serial killer calling his victims Jennifer. All the victims are blind and he dismembers them. The murderer has taken a break, but suddenly resumes when a blind witness (do not ask) appears, Helena Robertson (Uma Thurman). Thurman does a good job of playing a blind person to my surprise. When I saw Lance Henriksen playing Sgt. Freddy Ross, I was worried. Henriksen played in some rather weird movies, especially late. I still can't forget about him in the bloodbath movie, Pumpkinhead. <br /> <br /> Berlin movie in a small town from L.A. as a detective. He begins to examine the Jennifer murders after finding body parts in the local landfill. His glory by discovering one of the victims was blind, seemed far out. So did the irony of * SPOILER * Freddy's murder, with the recording and names similarities. I became very confused with the logic of how there would be eight "Jennifers". And the killer's motive, which simply staggered, didn't pack much of a blow. In return, this movie is probably more true to life in showing an unsuspecting individual who is able to murder simply because they were a little wacko over time or perhaps were born looney toons. <br /> <br /> John Malkovich does a great job in his interrogation of Garcia! Although no policeman would legally be allowed to press a person who hard and egged them out without just being knocked out. As for the end, it is a little surprising, but it is very argumentable, like Sgt. Ross murder. The killer chooses to go after his sacrifice and instead chooses to frolick I guess. <br /> <br /> There are so many options he has to kill her that it's ridiculous. I do not want to ruin the end because it is a good surprise despite the shaking. Then you will probably say, as I did, "boy was she lucky!" 4.10
