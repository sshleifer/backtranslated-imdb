Can A-Pix ever ever do something right? This movie was intended to be viewed on TV in a letterbox format. When A-Pix doesn't even believe in pan and scan, we see whole scenes where a shoulder on the left side of the screen speaks to a shoulder on the right side. Of course, not that you are missing much. This movie is incredibly bad. It is very difficult to enjoy a movie where characters scream at the top of their lungs below 80% of the film for no reason.
