I really wanted to really watch this movie and waited for months to get it through our Blockbuster Total Access account. When it appeared in our mailbox, I threw it right into the DVD player. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed, which again made me angry. I give a movie a chance, though I want to leave the theater / hit 'stop'. I saw it all the way through, but got nothing more than frustration. <br /> <br /> The action was very, very good, but it was about it. Nothing is explained; while we understand that Mathieu becomes depressed and lands in a psychic department of some sort, we never get an insight into his "downfall". While we understand that he and Cedric are breaking up again, we don't see it or why it happened. During an interview with Mathieu's doctor, Cedric reveals that he had cheated him once, but it was nothing big. I expected to see this in flashbacks, but not - nothing. We also get the hints that Cedric was the one who was supposed to bring food to the hospital - but otherwise we don't see it. <br /> <br /> I know some movies are "take it as it is" but this movie honestly marked me. When Pierre, Cedric's ex appears in the club and starts troubles, we don't see hiding or hair on him until the end, and it took me quite some time to find out that Pierre was ex. His personality at the club and when Mat finds him is completely different. I could even be wrong to say this, it was so confusing. <br /> <br /> The movie expects you to know everything and move along with its incoherent, out of place and confusing pace. I can watch movies like 'Pi', 'Citizen Kane' and other movies that have flashbacks / flash-forward left and right, but CU didn't catch on and hold onto the style. At the end of the 'Citizen Kane' you know what's going on and discover the answer to the most important mysteries. CU just leaves you hanging. It has an enchantment in its 'we will not tell you a damn thing, find out for yourself' presentation. It's like reading a book with the chapters switched over and missing pages. <br /> <br /> Good acting as I said. I liked the characters, but the whole story was just too disappointing.
