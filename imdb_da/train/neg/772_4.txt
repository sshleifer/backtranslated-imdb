This movie is not as good as any of the movies from Christ I've ever seen. And I am very surprised that in this story Pilate will end Jesus when the scriptures (as well as the other films) indicate differently. It also lacks a very important question: Resurrection. None of the other films skips this very important part: the belief in us all Christians lies in this incident. As Paul says in one of his letters, "If Christ did not rise from the dead, our faith is in vain". A very impressive scene for me in this movie was to look at the streets the remnants of the palms used when Jesus entered Jerusalem. <br /> <br /> Finally, and unlike my Jewish co-commentator, Jesus was not a myth. And in fact he was also a JEW. There are lots of documents (relgious and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man (or should I say that God becomes a man) who really changed humanity. I highly recommend him (given he is a historian) to read about Flavius ​​Josephus, the most brilliant Jewish commentator of the 1st century.
