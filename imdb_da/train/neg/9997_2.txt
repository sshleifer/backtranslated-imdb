Capt. Gallagher (Lemmon) and flying companion Eve Clayton (Vaccaro) is a presumably hot thing in this death journey; a luxury 747 airliner decked out to look like a nightclub slash hotel ?? There is even a blind piano player who falls in love. Karen Wallace (Grant) is the hysterical b! $ 3 & who will do anything to get the attention of henpecked man Martin (Christopher Lee) and later the rest of the people on board. Memorable moments: The Boeing 747 makes a belly flop in the Atlantic, Karen gets her chops busted when she goes too far, and furniture (and screaming people) who become 'bearings' in a sinking 'pinball machine'. <br /> <br /> The action and rescue sequences here are relatively phenomenal, but not much is going on. Hitchcock should have directed this successor, but I forget the reason why not ?? He would have done wonders for the 1970s original, where this successor is partly inspired ('77 also got inspiration from `The Flight of the Phoenix '). <br /> <br /> The actors Cotten and de Havilland are reunited from their days at `Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte '(apparently they do not play heavily, just reunited Fall lovers). And isn't the actor playing Emily's companion the same one who played the hammered to death girl on "What happened to Baby Jane?" TV actors include the boyfriend of Mayberry RFD (her character's daughter wins a drawing competition, or something similar), 'Buck Rogers' Gil Gerard and `Dynasty's' Pamela Bellwood. <br /> <br />
