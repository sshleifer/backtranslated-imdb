(aka: BLOOD CASTLE or SCREAM OF DEMON) <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br /> <br /> This was a drive-in feature, included with THE VELVET VAMPIRE. A Spanish-Italian co-production, where a number of women in a village are murdered around the same time, is a local count named Yanos Dalmar, who is seen on horseback and drives off with his "male" dog behind him. The mayors have already suspected that he is behind it and wants his castle burned down. The murders began in the early days. Count Yanos' elder brother, Count Igor Dalmar, was terribly burned and killed in a laboratory accident. <br /> <br /> So a woman Ivanna (Erna Schuer), who Igor worked before his death to help him in his experiments, turns out. Yanos agrees to hire her instead of her brother and together they seek the formulas for regenerating dead cells. Yanos wants to bring Igor's cold body back to life. <br /> <br /> Of course, Igor still lives (though terribly burnt) and stalking and killing the women in the village. We see that his charred face appears at various points in the film, so we know he is still alive, so it all seems a little too obvious. <br /> <br /> Igor meets another burning end as he enters a fight with Yanos over Ivanna, with the burning candles falling on the same bed that Igor stumbles upon and meets another last charbroiled end. The Retromedia DVD is taken from a VHS source and looks pretty grainy and bad. Apart from a smooth scratchier trailer, there are no other extra features. Although it has a nice, crooked Spanish castle and good atmosphere, I found it to be quite boring and predictable, with no excitement or mystery at all. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
