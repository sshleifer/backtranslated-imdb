A movie with very little positive to say to it. First, it has a zero pace and lacks positive in any drama. Besides being remarkably slow The empty field seems dedicated to using the same stock footage over and over again. I lost count of how many times I had seen "it" field at night or the bit cracked ground. It also has the basic mistake of thinking that if the audience does not know about things, they will be caught rather than just confused. So, without any indication that there are problems that we suddenly find marriage, it is not what it seems to be despite the impression that it is fine. We find that Jacob is perhaps the worst farmer in the universe, as he apparently does not spend time in the yard and also seems to have bought land with a completely useless acre. Beth has a key to a stock of books? There are countless other issues, some of which have been resolved later in the film, much later, in fact, too late. And at the point of acre. Horror filmmakers note that large lifeless objects are inherently not scary ?? And even if they are supposed to be one hectare large, so do them. There is also a frightening lack of reasonableness as Beth (the best performer in the play followed by Jefferson elig synes æ‹· cop) suddenly seems to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on "medicine". <br /> <br /> With the full ten minutes plus running around the fields looking for the missing child (he crawled out the window? He's six months old). The movie falls into poorly written scene after a poorly written scene. Bad plinky plonk "horror" music fails to add atmosphere. Often, bad movies can be fun, but not The Empty Acre, which is just bad.
