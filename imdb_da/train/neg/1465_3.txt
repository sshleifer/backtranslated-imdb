Well, first of all I want to add that I myself am something of a historian, so what I am looking for in a film based on historical events is that it is actually based on historical facts. But this is not the case here. Sure the movie is entertaining and anything but it's not entirely true facts, it's more than annoying. Hitler was not anti-Semitic in his youth, he even worked for Jews before World War II. However, it was during World War I and then he formed his views on the Jews. His education in this film is also inaccurate, Hitler as a child was not a disturbed little one. He had a more or less normal education. Nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important pieces that add to the puzzle that is Hitler. <br /> <br /> Robert Carlyle is a great actor, but he doesn't really matter in the role of Hitler. Hitler was not as impossible and unstable as he is portrayed here. In his younger years, he was a charismatic person who "manipulated" people through his charm. His unstable behavior and outbursts began in the turning point of the war. <br /> <br /> I want to see a movie about Hitler's life based on real historical facts and not accusations. I really hate when people point to a guilty finger on eg. Hitler and others and tell inaccurate stories just to paint a picture of them as pure evil. It is much better to actually tell the story exactly as it was so that everyone can learn how it was! Those who are behind this movie should have done some research before they did. Because it seems like they didn't even know what really happened. Hitler was not even shot in the revolutionary march in Munch, his shoulder being torn out of the socket. <br /> <br /> It gives you more to see a good documentary than to see this.
