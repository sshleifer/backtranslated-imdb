This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I usually praise any movie for any aspect of its production, but the intensely annoying behavior of more than half of the characters made it hard for me to appreciate any part of this movie. <br /> <br /> The most common was the fact that the blocks that designed the building were causing an avalanche to coincide with it. Is ok. <br /> <br /> Also, trying to ski an avalanche slalom style won't work. Running 10 feet in some trees will not work. Alas it does here. As mentioned before, the native stupidity and sheer stupidity of some characters are ridiculous. In a confined space with limited oxygen, a four year old could tell you to start a fire is not a good idea. At least about 5 minutes of the movie redeems itself and acquires some gratitude. But if you have a modicum of intelligence, you will also find most of this movie difficult to tolerate. It hurts me that so many quality stories go unpublished, and yet someone will pay for things like this to be made. <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention the last five minutes? Good to give you a hook to watch out for the latest in combat avalanche techniques. Absolutely priceless.
