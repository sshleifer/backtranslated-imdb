I have to say I used to be a big fan of the series. The first 3 were great and the others had their moments, but this new BETA HOUSE is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a shame as it was a big series, and it just gets worse. I know they are made for DVD movies, but some work would be nice. <br /> <br /> There are no laughs, just a few good one-liners that will bring a smile if that. There are pretty nudity and very hot chickens. But neither the sexy thing nor the jokes really works. <br /> <br /> To add to the fact that this is also a RACIST movie or as a racist in a movie, one can do without asking to be called racist. I am NOT one of those who believe everything should be politically correct. But the notion of minorities is very offensive. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't waste any time on this waste. See the earlier versions they will make you laugh not sick.
