As it seems to be the general content of these comments, the movie has some amazing animations (I saw it on blu-ray), but it doesn't really fall into any real depth. First, the characters are all pretty boring. I have a hint of a kind of Laputa situation between Agito, Toola and the main antagonist Shunack. But maybe my mind needed it and it was desirable thought (Laputa is my favorite anim√©, original Engilsh dub). The characters are also not lovable, and as mentioned in another post, they become unnecessarily fast in love and leave the bad old Minka jealousies and rejected (she loves Agito who seems to be unaware of this). But she immediately seems to forgive Toola at the end without explaining the heart change, except that it makes the end a little more "happy". <br /> <br /> There's also a serious lack of explanation. Like who are the druids really? Are they people? and who are the weird women / girls who seem to hang out with them and drive the forest? There is nothing to explain why they are there and how they can give superpowers to ordinary people. The plants that come from the moon still do not fill the whites. It's almost like a strange version of Triple Day. <br /> <br /> And who calls Toola? Why bother with it if it is not explained? <br /> <br /> I really wanted to like this movie, but I found the plot no how nearly as deep as a movie as Ghost in Shell or have any real character like those of Miyazaki. I don't like to see it, but I want it, I hadn't bought it. My advice? Give it a ride if you have a few hours to save, but borrow it or buy it cheaply! Maybe if your new animated movies and don't have much to go by you will enjoy it. It is certainly visually appealing.
