Breeding out of the sky is a gang of horned naked female angels (with large plastic prisoners) embroiled in a creepy forest where they feed with no effortless souls to pass by. It's not long before a group of friends on a road trip sacrifices the bloodthirsty babies ?? An independent low budget scare made in the UK, Forest of the Damned takes an interesting premise and rinses it in the forehead with some of the worst actions, effects and direction I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Director John Roberts shows some occasional flair behind the camera ?? The scenes in the sub-partitioned house are quite tense, and there are some handled 'shocks' moments - but mostly the film is technically amateur. Throw in some really horrible performances from horror icons Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson, and you have a really bad movie on your hands. Some fun can be derived from the film's sheer shyness, and there are plenty of female nudity for the boys to enjoy, but most will find this a task to sit through.
