this movie was a great letdown. The level of relentless cruelty and violence in this movie was very disturbing. some scenes were really unnecessarily ugly and transparent. The main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with. the protagonist's character was as slim as they come. The nursing home / hothouse atmosphere lends itself to over-the-top theatrics. Little or nothing could be learned about the Spanish Civil War from this movie. Luckily I have been to Spain and realize it's not realistic! In addition, the use of the same sex attraction as a lurid "horror" was also very offensive and poorly handled while the DVD is packaged and advertised to attract homosexuals. the actors seemed unpleasant in their roles as if they were trying to renounce this mess. I think if you like to see children and pets being brutally killed, this movie can especially appeal to you.
