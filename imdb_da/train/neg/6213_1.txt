This movie made it one of my top 10 most horrible movies. Terrible. <br /> <br /> There was no continuous minute where there was no match with a monster or other. There was no chance of any character development, they were too busy running from one sword fight to another. I had no emotional attachment (except for the big bad machine that would destroy them) <br /> <br /> Scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies, LOTR, Star Wars and Matrix. <br /> <br /> Examples <br /> <br />> The ghost scene at the end was stolen from the last scene in the old Star Wars with Yoda, Obee One and Vader. <br /> <br /> The spider machine at the beginning was exactly as Frodo was attacked by the spider in the Kings of Return. (Elijah Wood is the victim of both films) and wait ...... it hypnotizes (slings) his victim and breaks them up ... hey hello ???? <br /> <br /> And the whole machine vs. The human theme was Matrix .. or Terminator ..... <br /> <br /> There are several examples, but why waste time? And will anyone tell me what was with the Nazi?!?! Nazis ???? <br /> <br /> There was a juvenile story line rushing to a youth's conclusion. The movie couldn't decide whether it was a children's movie or an adult movie, and that wasn't much of it either. <br /> <br /> Just awful. A real disappointment to say the least. Save your money.
