Stanley Kramer instructs an action thriller and leaves two important things: action and excitement. The DOMINO PRINCIPLE has Gene Hackman as a prison that has come from prison to perform a mysterious task. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert and Eli Wallach are his operations --- they probably work for the government, but it's like most of the movie's plot line never clarified. Hackman asks many questions that are never answered, so the movie goes absolutely nowhere. While striving to be like NIGHT MOVES and PARALLAX VIEW, the DOMINO PRINCIPLE blends ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom. The film is extremely well-photographed, but even it works against it. Hug's direction is without style. It's a very sunny movie! The play is fine with Hackman, who shows that he is virtually unable to be bad. Widmark and Wallach are appropriately nasty and Albert is well cast as Widmark's gruesome lackey. Even the normally unpleasant Mickey Rooney is pretty good as Hackman's sidekick. However, an inferiority is the casting of Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife. We are told she's finished in prison and she seems to be trying to put on some kind of southern twang. Kramer's idea of ​​getting her to work as a trailer is to have her wearing a nasty brown wig. It is a role that is better suited to people like Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell.
