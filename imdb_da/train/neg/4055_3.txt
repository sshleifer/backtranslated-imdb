I have read reviews that apparently should have been students in a very strict British school in the 1960s to understand this. Maybe it's true, if yes, then this movie is outdated. <br /> <br /> ************* SPOILER ALERT ************** ************* ************* The conclusion makes as much sense as all the kids who are anti-government and anti-corporation without having any better solution that does not burn the community to a Mad Max type cinder. Yes, the protagonists could leave, but they don't. The reasons why they go about this do not make sense. There is not enough character development to explain why. What shoots up a lot of innocent people is believed to mean, has never been explained or even suggested. It is mentioned that war is the ultimate creative expression, possibly the only revelation that any sign in this film has, and that makes no sense. People who go on a murder battle do not fight the institution, they just kill people. I thought they could have used all the explosives to burst the spot or at least the shrine at the end, it would have made more symbolic sense, but they didn't. <br /> <br /> t1; Dr - This film is a youth's daydream of struggle against authority that plagues them, but in reality they need. It has no moral, symbolic truth or significance for it; This movie simply plays the imagination of killing teachers and people in "power" that annoys you. <br /> <br /> If you think that a murder campaign / school recording looks like columbine or virginia tech is a rational and sensible way to deal with teachers and institutions you don't like, then I think you'll love this movie. If you are like me and are working to create a life for yourself rather than just blindly (very blindly in this movie) rebelling against the "man", this movie is young and boring. <br /> <br /> You can also tell in parts that financing was lacking and history seemed to have a hint of attention deficit. <br /> All in all, this seems like a very rough draft of what might have been an okay movie, but no effort is put into dialogue, character development, or moral, so it's just ... badly done. <br /> <br /> If I could only get my two hours back.
