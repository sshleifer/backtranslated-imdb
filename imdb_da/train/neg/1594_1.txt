Wow. This movie bored my pants when I saw it. Among, meaningless and unmoving. Probably, as and co. can travel through time using the "Spirit of the Forest" ('Princess Mononoke' very ??) There they meet a dorky child named Sam and the "plot" begins. <br /> <br /> So Tom (Ash) and Huck (Sam) get tall with nature, become hippies and try to release Celebi (the "Spirit") from some nice hunters. I don't even know what went on. It all passed in a blur. Ash's friends were hardly in it, and all the battle scenes were boring. <br /> <br /> After saving the day, Ash and his infamous friends will return to their time as they watch Sam fly away with Celebi (that scene was just scary. OO;) So after returning for their time, As teaches that his new friend is actually his rival's grandfather. And I think that's it. Right, isn't it? If you love your children, you will not expose them to this. (1 out of 10)
