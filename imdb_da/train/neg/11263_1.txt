To shame, too shame that a fine actor like Joseph Fiennes would allow himself to be thrown into this piece of unpleasant drift. The movie was not only bad but down right awful and without redeeming quality. The reason, (was there one?) Seemed to go no where. The Russians played stupid kills or were killed games, and the rest of the player was to be declared invalid for their pathetic performances. I gave up about 3/4 of the way through and turned it off. A "1" too horrible only because there is nothing lower. Don't waste your time on this, you won't miss anything.
