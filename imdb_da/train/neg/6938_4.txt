In this film, the old Amitabh Bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman again. He meets her in her restaurant. The younger woman, Tabu, flirts with him. He doesn't know what to do and asks her out. Her response to his invitation is quite strange. It should be fun. <br /> <br /> It annoys me about this whole movie. It wasn't that fun. The jokes and the script were terrible! The only jokes I liked were about the servant's teeth, but after several times they started drilling themselves. <br /> <br /> Amitabh has a little girlfriend called sexy. This was a strange relationship! A little girl with an old woman's mind! It was scary! I know someone can be linked to a child, but this man has adult conversations with this child. It made no sense. <br /> <br /> Tabu's father is Paresh Rawal. He must give Amitabh a hard time, but we all know Paresh, he can't do it. So even though the conversation at the end, when they sit around the table, it should even be fun. <br /> <br /> I just like movies that are really fun. I suppose I will never see this movie again.
