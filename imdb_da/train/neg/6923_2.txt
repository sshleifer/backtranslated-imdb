Absolutely horrible Mexican movie allegedly based on a short story by Edgar Allan Poe about a newsman who wants to go into a hidden asylum in the woods to write a story about how it works, etc. When our hero Gaston is you occasion of the Grand Show by Dr. Maillard, asylum seeker, we see all sorts of things that are supposed to be horrific, such as men who hang long in a dungeon, and comic, as our heroes are fooled by soldiers as he climbs down a ladder hanging over a building. Then there is a vision that might have been supposed to be both: A human man dressed as a chicken, yes it is really a chicken that peppers around the ground for chicken feed. The scene was to be a comical highlight in the movie, but at least for me it was the low point of the movie and really the most disgusting, when it was found that adult men and women thought this might even be distant. Ah! It's actually the real horror that is Dr. Tarr and his Legion of Name Changes. And that brings me to this important fact about the movie, which is most movies that undergo multiple title changes, usually have some sort of serious problem. Yes, this is obvious, but some have distribution problems and others, one of which, have many headings, so that someone may undoubtedly buy the same waste more than once. This is definitely garbage. It has very little to do with it. The only performer is worth watching, is Claudio Brook as head of asylum. He is a great slice of ham when he laughs maniacally, bellows orders, sashays with swords in his hand and praises the chicken. I was so tired of hearing him talk about the "soothing system" as his means of healing the mentally ill. What a bunch of ludicrosity (Hey, a movie like this with a script like this deserves this kind of word). It won't take you long to find out what's going on in the asylum area, nor will it be more interesting. Cinematic chicken brab!
