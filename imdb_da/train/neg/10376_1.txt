I watched this movie on a pre-release screening at Writer's Guild Theater in Beverly Hills. As I recall, the film's producers and director were present, presumably to make our reaction. Many scenes provoked happiness from laughter from the audience, which would have been fine if it had been a comedy, but it should be a horror movie. <br /> <br /> If the audience was not scared, it looks like the filmmakers were. They delayed the release for over a year. Out of curiosity I saw it again to see if they would cut it again; as far as I can tell, they didn't. It was the same miserable movie, just a year older. It almost qualifies as "so bad, it's good", but it's slow and boring.
