Don't make me wrong, the movie is beautiful, the shots are amazing, and the material is dramatic. However, it was a big disappointment and I actually left very angry at what Disney had done. The BBC's Planet Earth was all above and more. It was subtle. It had an overall sense of balance and showed the whole circle of life and death. There was tragedy and triumph, loss and gain. It was balanced. <br /> <br /> Disney's editing of the earth is none of this. They tried to make it a movie we Americans would talk about. They did it DRAMATIC. They put one over the top musical score there to scare us. They made predators evil. They made WALRUSES evil. They showed each meeting as negative. It tried to be exciting and succeeded, but at the expense of the lesson balance. The film was an hour and a half negative depiction and only approx. 10 minutes positive. <br /> <br /> I am all about preventing global warning, but it was over the top political and environmental unwanted. <br /> <br /> It's another thing I went to see on the big screen but was disappointed with the picture quality. It looked better on my TV at home. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something like this and get the whole picture, go out and buy, rent or borrow the BBC Planet Earth series. It's better lessons, better sound, and (if you have Blu-Ray) better picture quality.
