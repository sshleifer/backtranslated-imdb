Most of the French movies I've seen - and enjoyed - were more talk than action, but that's okay. I found them interesting, well-photographed and with exciting actors. (However, at one point I did wonder if Gerald Depardieu was in any French movie ever made! It seemed like that.) <br /> <br /> This movie has the same interesting visuals and has a good opening. But then it was talk, talk and more talk .... which is fine for a drama, but not for a killing mystery. After a while I almost fell asleep and looked at this. <br /> <br /> In fact, the movie was more like a game with almost every scene played in one room. So if you love acting, you should like this ... but I want a little more bang for a murder story.
