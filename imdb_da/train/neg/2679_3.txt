(SPOILERS AHEAD) Russian fantasy "actioner" (and I use the term loosely) which I have been trying to see for over a year. I have finally come to the end, and now I wish I did not start the repetitive action. <br /> <br /> In an effort to save two hours in your life, let me tell you he is a guy who has the ability to project a long knife out of his arm to see his mother. Things get ugly after being mafia girlfriend of an old girl friend. He takes revenge on the guy when he brings the girl home. The boy mafia mother sends her men out to get revenge while the police start looking for him too. <br /> <br /> Very little is said. No explanation is really given to anything (like why they lock id girlfriends in an asylum) and the action, mostly everything is on display. The film consists essentially of a guy who looks like Adrian Brody, looks intensely and says nothing, kills people (off screen - most of the action happens off screen). It looks good, is well acted and had there been any reason for what is going on, it could have been a good movie. Hell, I would have liked a sense of true character development or back story (all we know is that guy was chosen as a child). The movie runs the better part of two hours, and it feels like its six. If they didn't want to tell us anything, they could at least have picked up the pace so it seemed to move too fast. No instead we get the hero on a boat. Right in a bus, the hero goes, the hero looks disturbed. He with his girl. It has really annoyed me as I think it might have been a good movie if they had just done something or had someone actually said anything else other than giving instructions to "get this guy." <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 Its about four hours (all my attempts to see this) I will never come back. Only for those who want to see a bursting Russian action movie with very little action
