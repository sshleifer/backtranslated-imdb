5 minutes in this movie I was hyperventilating, shaking and writhing in pain. And not in the good way. The story is about a troop of idiotic children who make prank calls to a psycho, which is always a good idea. Turns out that psychos do not like prank phone calls because he is at the door for 2 minutes and kills poor Williams mother and father. Well over 15 years and guess what? Still prank phone calling people. You would have thought that a horrible murder would deter them from ever doing it again, but no. So after about two hours later and too many screams, I realized that this movie gave me nothing but a terrible taste in my mouth and a hard urge to take my own life. This piece of shit is not even worth laughing at the creepy production, the "actor" or Rutger has a dire career. I love crappy horror movies, but this is the most unsatisfactory piece I've ever seen. Just don't.
