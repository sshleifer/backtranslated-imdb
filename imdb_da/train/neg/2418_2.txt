The first mistake you make when title a movie is to use "the living dead" without really having a budget for real zombie FX. Sure, this was a low budget zombie flick - really low budget. I thought it was a film school project. Amateur actors and amateur effects. <br /> <br /> It wasn't really that bad considering the above, and it presented an interesting twist to the Zomer citizens. If you want an "R" for violence, you might as well give us some good pictures of the babies being attacked. The women were so little used in this movie that it could almost be classified as "gay". <br /> <br /> And I'm out of Oakland. There were a lot of shots going on and no police in sight!
