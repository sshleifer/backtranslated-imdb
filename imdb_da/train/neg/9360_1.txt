My score for this crap: 1/10 1 for the technical sole. Everything else is very bad. <br /> <br /> Another movie that doesn't make sense. It seems like creating a good script for movies or television is almost an impossible mission. <br /> <br /> Although it's easy to understand why politicians never say the truth, they're among the biggest liars on the planet, it's hard to understand how to make movies so pathetic. <br /> <br /> We have to believe in taking people to morons. Perhaps it was reason to believe that 99% of the films are crap. Because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios. <br /> <br /> Looking at the price, we give Oscars, we better understand why we continue to make movies more ridiculous than others. <br /> <br /> Strangely enough, it was always money for such nonsense. But it was not for education and health. <br /> <br /> If you still want to listen to this s ** t, press the Super Fast Forward button (at least 20X).
