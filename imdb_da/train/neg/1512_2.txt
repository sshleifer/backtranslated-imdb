A bad rip-off attempt at "Seven", complete with sub-second-grade plays, horrible camera work, half-baked history and strong aftertaste of lame propaganda. Yes, those "sex offenders" they live next door and you get raped, really. <br /> <br /> No surprises from the vice-terminatrix woman she seems to be always - as convincing as a piece of wood. Richard Gere continues to slide down and down - and is as low here as a late Steven Seagal. <br /> <br /> The singer with the crazy eyes is best when she is dead in bed; and even the wolf was underperforming (though she was the best performer in the movie) - perhaps they fed her before shots or anything. Unlike "Seven", which had a (made up but interesting) story that one could relate more or less regardless of country, this movie seems to focus on an American only occupation. If you don't care much about "sex offenders" - and the statistics are the lack of exercise and poor diet that cause more pain, suffering and death - there is little reason to see it or be scared. <Br /> <br /> There are some body parts fetishes and some snus, but gore is less than mediocre and fails both as an artistic entity (because it's meaningless) and that does because it's not gory enough. <br /> <br /> Don't waste time on this.
