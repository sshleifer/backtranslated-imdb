Boston Legal has turned its tail and is heading towards the door door and the pig slop it has created! When this show was aired almost four years ago, it was a humorous blow to the legal system that all actors seem to be proud of. It was fun, diversified and to some extent actually. The characters that were portrayed were acceptable and to some extent true in their depictions. The sexual comment and activity was limited and humorous. Julie Bowen is and was beautiful as in other series she participated in but is now drawn to the bottom depth of media programming of sex and violence. Julie is an excellent actress and needs a more stable platform than this "production". Rene Adjurdubois Is an excellent actor, who from the Benson days to this production kept himself in the entertainment, and always shows the humor and respectful action of production. Captain Kirk "is". Fun and humorous is Candace Bergan and must be admired for continuing in this production and being a good actress. James Spader, there is no doubt about his functioning ability, but he should go back to his XXX origin as "Crash", as it seems he has a lot of talent and inclination in that direction. We ask that this series be deleted as it is already and it really starts to smell !!!
