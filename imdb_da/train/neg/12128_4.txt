If half of this movie's footage looks odd, it means you see too much of this spawn Italian cult crap! To see, the infamous demigod Lucio Fulci not only produced this movie, he also took the liberty to reuse the most sadistic kitten sequences in his own (and more easily traceable) "Cat in the Brain". The opening scene, where a prostitute is brutally beheaded with an ax, has the features of Fulci's later movie and then makes another handful of murders and sleaze moments. Andrea Bianchi's "Masssacre" fails unsuccessfully as a giallo, as the search for the sadistic killer among a movie man shooting a horror movie is anything but compelling and exciting, but it is still good entertainment if you are in cheap new-fashioned fate. The incoherent script introduces a whole lot of conflicting characters, which are all potential lunatics, but none of the red herring Biachi comes up with is likely and you can point out the killer almost instantly. Regardless of what is left to enjoy, the really unpleasant make-up effects and the hilariously horrific appearances of the ensemble cast. When there is no bloodshed on the screen, as between the first and second murders, it is slow and almost unacceptable with its inane dialogues and thorough unexciting photography. Fortunately, in the second half there are women who are impaled on fences and men are repeatedly repeated with rusty spikes. The music is crap, and the use of movie sites is very imaginative. My advice would be to skip this puppy and go straight to the aforementioned "Cat in the Brain". One contains all the great moments of "massacre" and saw some.
