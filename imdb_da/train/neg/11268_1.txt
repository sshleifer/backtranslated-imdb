I hoped this movie would be at least watchable. The reason was weak to say the least. I expected much more considering the cast line (I wonder if any of them will include this on their CVs?). At least I didn't pay to rent it. The best part of the movie is definitely Dani Behr, but the rest of the movie is complete and complete PANTS.
