I'm a big fan of B5 who has only been at the end of season three. In spite of all the previous seasons, when I was syndicated, I saw that it was one of the most contemplated arcs of history that ever hit television. Even the filler episodes were interesting. Also the films were well-produced and as entertaining as anything to hit the theaters. <br /> <br /> It brings us to the 'Soul River'. Of course I had high expectations after seeing everything else. Martin Sheen seems to be performing in an Ed Wood movie instead of a serious Sci-Fi story. The story itself, could have looked good in the contour form, even made it to the storyboard. But of course it suffers when it was time to complete this concept in a two-hour movie. There are no special effects to keep us entertained in the total absence of a compelling story. There are places where they were obviously short-lived and just improvised the dialogue to fill the story. Had it done the regular season, it would have been rated among the worst episodes.
