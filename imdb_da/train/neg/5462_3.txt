This program bug me! There is no humor to it and is too serious to be called "fun"! It's just too educational for my taste! The characters are very stereotypical and unpleasant. The plots are redundant and the morality just repeated again and again. Where's the fun in it? Also I feel that this has been on the BBC for too long and broadcast too much. Does it really need to have a place on T.V every 2 or 3 months when a brand new show runs out of episodes? I think it's time for the BBC to bring back some of their older shows as: Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, Smurfs, Snoring, Mummies, Raccoons, and Count Duckula, except to continue contracting these newer shows! I thought the BBC's coming back Danger Mouse, so what's going on there ?! 3.10
