Exactly disappointing prequel to the first two films, it has none of the excitement of the first or second interest. By concentrating on the guys who 'run' the cube, it basically takes away any kind of tension within the cube, as we simply don't care about the signs inside. Much of the movie is simply boring, and it only becomes really terrible with the introduction of the eyeglasses superior and the green eyes crazy marine. Then it just falls into the over-the-top accidental hilarity. However, the termination is appropriate and ties it back to the first one indirectly. The script is terrible, it appears mediocre at best and the direction unimpressive. A much smaller follow-up.
