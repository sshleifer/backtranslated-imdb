Bought this movie in the buyer at Rogers Video Store for $ 2. I enjoy a good B movie every now and then and figured this looked like a good one. The movie is quite clich√© "1970s" and is quite groovy for it. Unfortunately, the story is hard to follow and not much happens in the film. In fact, I turned it off after seeing it for 45 minutes and figured a week later that I should see it all, no matter how slow it was. <br /> <br /> The movie has good spots in it, but you have to wait and wait and wait ....... for them. <br /> <br /> If you are in B-movie, it can only be for you, just warning that the movie is slow and not very real, and I don't mention much of the story line ... <br /> <br />
