I have never seen a movie in such a little time. The only salvation was fast forwarding on the DVD unit. It was like watching a poorly produced CBC movie. There was, of course, no money for lighting, movie recording, sets, location, screenwriters, editors, actors ... Oh, there was absolutely no story! I have to write ten lines of comment ... Poor, horrible, horrible, miserable, anxious, horrible, bilious, nauseating, sick, fraude, disgusting, flimsy, icky, yucky, pukey, smelly, smelly, silly -tumbs -down, and I don't know if I can continue to finish all ten lines of just as bad this piece of crap-o-matic production was!
