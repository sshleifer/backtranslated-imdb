*** LIGHT SPOILER ALERT *** The story sounds good, and if you've read the novel, you probably expect a deep and intense movie that can provide some insight into some interesting and inadequately explored human relationships. <Br /> <br /> Probably the script tries to do what the director is trying to do, but the main group fails miserably. Mary's plays are so dry that there is no sense whatsoever, her most intense moments seem almost comical. Sometimes she seems to be nervous because of the camera. Her only really felt scene is near the end where she gets dumped by her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Ioana seems even more tense than Maria and even worse, she doesn't seem natural at all. Maria had the attitude, though artificially pushed toward being obvious, but she had it, and her character gained some credibility. And to make matters worse, we do not have an insight into her: Where does she come from, how did she get into the lesbian relationship, how did the relationship develop? We only get some bits from her parents and their relationship just seems to be 'there': it has a content and ends, but no beginning. Like her partner Maria, she only once has a scene that really touches the scene where she dumps Maria's character Kiki. <br /> <br /> Tudor is the only person in this movie (except the landlady who is great there) who manages to prove any actor talent. He has his character set and fits him. Only once or twice does he seem to fall (the stage of his parent's meal, he tries to be blatant when not at all necessary). I love the story, Tudor Chirila is ok there, the host actually works and Puya delivers his few lines of style, but it doesn't save the movie. Too bad the whole setting had great potential, and the Romanian film could have used a movie on this theme. It is probably enough that the incident between brother and sister has more credibility than no background without feeling (well, Maria's spoken space is a good attempt in that direction) lesbian relationships between Maria and Ioana. I'm very sorry to spend money on a ticket, I'd rather have seen it from my room.
