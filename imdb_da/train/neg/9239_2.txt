Heavenly Days Commit to a Serious Comedy Faux Pass: It is desperate to teach us a social doctrine and it does not stop until we have passed the final exam. Fiber McGee and Molly take a trip to Washington where they see the Senate in action (or inaction if you prefer), have a spear with their senator (Eugene Palette in one of his worst roles in his career), knowledge of a gaggle of annoying stereotypical refugee children, and meeting a man on a train reading a book by Henry Wallace. Henry Wallace !! A year later he was considered an almost communist poem, but in 1944 he was A-OK. Add in some really horrible musical moments, a lot of flagwaving hooey and a dull subplot of newspaper journalists, and you have a movie to have had Philip Wylie ready for the Generation of Vipers 2: D.C. Boogaloo. Heavenly Days is drastically unfun, another reminder that the devil has all the best tunes.
