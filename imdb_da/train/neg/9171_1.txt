What can I say? I ignored the reviews and went to see it myself. Damn reviews were so right. What a waste of money considering the budget. <br /> <br /> Well, I went to see Kill Bill after this. <br /> <br /> To watch a really scary movie would be Crossroads! <br /> Bottom line - I like "Girl in Gold Boots" better than this crap.
