It's a really good cast, but the film has nowhere near the grace of the original Italian comedy "Big Deal on Madonna Street". Anyone looking for an entertaining caper film should visit the original. William Macy may be one of our greatest live actors, but here he is a little used. And his role in the original was played by Marcello Mastroianni, so I feel sorry for him trying to fill these shoes. Can just as well try to imitate Bogart or a young De Niro. The art direction is rich and structured, but brings nothing to the story, the extra bits they add to the story feel completely unnecessary, and the things they take away are missed. Even starting the way they do, seems bizarre free and takes away from the surprise of the original. Sam Rockwell has its odd and brilliant charm, and Luis Guzman has the odd charisma, but the love story part of the movie just seems lumpy and flat. It's too bad, no one has figured out how to make this movie, but it was first made, but again it is too bad that we live in a culture where we feel that we need to restore great things instead of just learning to taste the originals.
