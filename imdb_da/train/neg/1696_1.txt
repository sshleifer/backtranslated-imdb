I hate throwing out such lines, but in this case, I want to: The American remake of THE GRUDGE is by far the worst movie I've seen in theaters over the last 5 years. I said so. And now that I've got it out of my system, let me explain why. <br /> <br /> "When someone dies in a violent rage, a curse is born. and I will admit it sounds exciting. Unfortunately, the filmmakers no longer take it. Those who come across the "curse" are actually consumed by their rage, and that's all you get. You want more? Well bad. Some critics and fans point out that GRUDGE's only purpose is to scare you. The problem is that when there is no plot to talk about, scary images and sounds can only go so far. Director Takashi Shimizu, pulls a George Sluizer and re-records his own original movie (s), trying fiercely to create atmosphere in the first hour ?? by repeating the same scene over and over and over and over again. It basically unfolds like this: <br /> <br /> person enters the house <br /> <br /> - something flashes of the camera and / or a strange sound is heard <br /> <br /> -person goes to investigate <br /> <br /> -sound begins to get high <br /> <br /> person sees a ghost <br /> <br /> -free screaming and / or cat war /> <br /> - search for black <br /> <br /> Before the audience itself gets a hint of plot, the same scenario explodes 5 times in the first hour. In fact, the first time was somewhat creepy. Each subsequent use became ridiculous as the film continued. As the film's ending rolled around, my friend and I asked, laughing, whether this scene would end "with a loud scream and a cut to black." We were never wrong. <br /> <br /> The film has no liner history but unfolds in a number of vignettes that leave the audience jumbled. I have no problem with non-linear storytelling when it's done right. The movie jumps from time period to time period without rhyme or reason. I haven't seen a movie in such a state since the opening of the theatrical version of HIGHLANDER 2. And this storytelling technique Mars any kind of mystery that movies could have had. If you already know the ghosts have scared two signs of death, how is it shocking when their bodies are in the ceiling? And why should we take care when a detective tries to investigate the mysterious disappearances when we already know what happened to everyone? <br /> <br /> It was clear that the US version of THE RING was $ 15 million the first weekend, THE GRUDGE is nothing but calculated imitations disguised as a real movie. The scariest thing about GRUDGE is that it made $ 40 million its first weekend, and some people consider it the "scariest movie ever made". I wonder what happens to those who are consumed by the rage of paying to see GRUDGE?
