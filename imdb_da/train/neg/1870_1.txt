I always used to love the bill because of its great script and characters, but in the end I feel like it has become an emotional type of soap. If you look at promotional pictures / posters of the bill, you will now see two of the officers hugging / kissing or something to do with friendships, while promotional pictures of the bill long ago would have shown something to do with crime. This shows that it has changed a lot from being an amazing police drama to an average type of television soap. When I see it, I want to see a police version of Coronation Street or something similar. I have to say that I still like the bill as I am interested in policing and such things, but I really miss the greatness that the bill used to have. I will judge it as 2 out of 10 because you have to admit that it has been completely destroyed by the people who took the bill over. <br /> <br /> As for the script and the characters, they have both gone downhill, most of the big characters are gone now (although a couple are still left I think) and I'm not saying that the newer characters are poor or something because they are absolutely not, it's just that they lack the hard looks, personalities and script lines that all the old characters used to have because most of the new ones are currently involved in stupid relationships and family problems. Overall, one of the only police programs on television these days, The Bill will always be a boring interesting thing to look at, but as I say, it has lost its uniqueness (if it is the right spelling) and will now be classified as a horrible, unreal TV soap. <br /> <br /> Recommended to look for a good laugh over the deaf policemen's stupidity - 2/10
