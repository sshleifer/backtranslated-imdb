I appreciate the need to hire unknowns for these horror movies, but at least they have to hire some decent actors. The sergeant is especially guilty of using his monotone to bulldozer every line he has. But let's see, the lines aren't really important. There is not really a recognizable plot, so most of the writing involves the words f ** k, s ** t, m ***** f **** r and other different bad languages ​​instead of proper dialogue. <br /> <br /> The "story" as it is, mostly consists of seemingly random gore and death, with a few cross-over surprises that happen about 10 minutes after you have seen exactly what is going to happen. Not only this, but there are several sharp plot holes and continuity errors (why do they go in there? Doesn't he have a weapon? Wasn't he dead?), So it makes the whole movie seem like it has been cut down after the many hours it would take to correct them. <br /> <br /> Another movie that just relies on blood and does instead of any real movie experience.
