Losing Control is another offer in the erotic thriller genre that could be considered the pulp-fiction of the movie world. Usually, they involve a roundabout route for murderous intent, bursting with abundant disrobing. This is not a complaint, especially when done by the amazingly beautiful women who always live in this make-believe world. <br /> <br /> Kim Ward (Kira Reed) suffers from a writer's block. Just by chance (or is it?) She meets a man (Doug Jeffery) who engages in her in increasingly risky sexual encounters. The man refuses to pass on any information about himself, but Kim just stops the case. Her agent, Alexa (Anneliza Scott) believes it will do wonders for her book sales. As in most films of this type, the denouement comes near the end, but some things do not go up. I've seen plenty of this kind of movie to think, no change on it - but I like them. They are so exhilarating. <br /> <br /> Performances of casting vary. Doug Jeffery carries the movie as the psycho / sociopath you do not want to cross. Kira Reed looks good but fails to convince the woman at risk. Clay Greenbush as PI did not convince either. <br /> <br /> Finally, a warning about the DVD during review. Both the cover and the disc state R-rated and operating time as 93 minutes, but the maturity is less than 86 minutes. This probably explains why the sex scenes seem truncated and why Jennifer Ludlow's performance is shorter, as she begins. 4 stars.
