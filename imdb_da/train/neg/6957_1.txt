Avoid this unless you want to see an expensive but poorly made movie. Example? The sound is good, but the dialogue is not clear - a cardinal sin in a French film. <br /> <br /> This movie attempts to combine western, drug intrigue and ancien regime costume epic. What? Well, consider this. Cowboy music is fun during sword fighting. Or what about the woman in her underwear, holding a knife and jumping up and down the bed? <br /> <br /> Someone should make a 'What's Up Tiger Lily' on this bomb. Write about the script and then either dub or subtitle it. Heck, it's almost now. (BTW, Gerard Depardieu and Carole Bouquet, both known to American audiences, have roles.)
