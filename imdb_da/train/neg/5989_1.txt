wow I paid Â£ 3.50 to watch this movie at the cinema. Can't believe I wasted my time. The play is at best worthwhile, and the special effects are raw. Probarly the worst script in history some extremely embarrassing quotes I've ever heard in my life. I swear that God "swept away" is better than this. Madonna would have won and Oscar compared to these guys. Half an hour in my life I want to go back. Honestly people can't see this, even toddlers would find this movie an insult to their intelligence. I found this movie very strange in the fact that it was difficult to tell who there is more wood, here are guys here of the actual puppets. pleas guys don't waste your time on this movie you want to live to regret it.
