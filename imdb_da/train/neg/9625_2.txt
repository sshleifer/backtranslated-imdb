This movie offers absolutely no imagination in that premise or in its execution, but only two things come to mind after seeing the so-called comedy that has no energy to talk about. The story is about nit-picky over analytical insurance risk manager Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller), who finds his new wife Lisa (Debra Messing) cheated on him with a diving instructor (Hank Azaria) after only one day on their honeymoon. Upon returning, Reuben and his best friend Sandy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) go to a party and run into Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston) as they attended school years earlier. ***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************â€¦ Begin to change as a person as he begins to try new things like salsa dance and eat spicy food. But one day Lisa comes back and wants to stay married to Reuben, but he doesn't really want to, but Polly decides to leave as she doesn't believe in marriage at first. <br /> <br /> This movie is the second direct effort by John Hamburg, who wrote two generally uninhibited screens in "Zoolander" and "Meet the Parents", but the two films act as classics in relation to this stale piece of drifting. It is very easy to say that something is not fun, but I think with this movie it is even easier to find out why. This movie is completely and completely predictable from start to finish with all scenes that look as if it is only because of the script's ridicule. Hamburg, who also wrote the manuscript, seems to have written this without thinking about trying something different, and at times he seems to try to create the same energy as "There is something about Mary", but instead the events look incredibly forced. Does anyone really think the blind fritter was fun? If you do, it's easy! Sometimes during the movie characters would inexplicably have these emotional speeches that will summarize everything, but all they achieve exceeds the obvious. Stiller works a lot, but maybe he has to work less and just wait for the better scripts to come because this movie doesn't work as a comedy or as a romance.
