This movie is horrible. Bad plays, bad writing, bad music. It's just awful. Not only is it incredibly misrepresentative of role-playing games, but the main elements of the movie are poorly executed. May the God I do not believe be merciful about the souls of innocent misery who perceived and bore this abomination.
