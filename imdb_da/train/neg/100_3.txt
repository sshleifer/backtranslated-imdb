OK it's not the best movie I've ever seen, but at the same time I've been able to sit and watch it twice !!! The story line was pretty awful, and in the first part of the first short story I was wondering what the hell I was watching, but at the same time it was so horrible that I loved it cheaply laughing all the way. And Jebidia deserves an Oscar for his role in this movie the only thing that left him half way through he stopped his stupid name call. All in all, the movie was quite perfect, but if you laugh for cheap and you see it in pound land pass it by.
