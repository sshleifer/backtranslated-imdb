I tend to like character-driven movies. I also think Hope Davis is consistently good, so I had great hopes for this movie. These hopes were soon dashed. <br /> <br /> The main fault with this movie is the direction. There are many scenes that are daydream sequences. The film makes frequent use of Denis Leary's character as the alter ego of the Campbell Scott character. It doesn't work for me at all. This would have worked better as a game than a movie. <br /> <br /> There are also problems with the plot. It is important that the characters in a movie take a trip and end up in a different place from where they started. I didn't feel the characters grew in the experiences depicted in the movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, editing was not well done either. There was a very big case in the middle of the movie, which was unusually boring. <br /> <br /> Apart from acting that I felt was consistently strong, this film celebrated in almost every aspect of the cinema.
