I remember watching this movie when I was young but couldn't remember the title for it and then going through horror movies I find it and thinking to myself "it's the title?" This movie is a kind of combination disaster movie / insect attack movie with fewer notable stars in it. It is also somewhat boring, as it has the TV atmosphere for it, where you can watch the film fade out for advertisements and the like. The reason has this kind of resort being invaded by ants. I think they were a little disturbed by construction or something going on nearby, but didn't quote me. The most memorable attack for me throughout the girl was the first one to involve the baby falling into the pool after being swamped and of course the Summers attack scene too. What else stands out in this one is the very heavy end where the survivors use cardboard tubes to breathe through. Lastly, but like most television films, this movie is very tame and not very scary at least, unless you panic at the ants' sight.
