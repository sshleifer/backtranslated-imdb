The only good part about this movie is the beautiful nature. This movie was long and boring. The priest should have retired from the pulpit when his son Paul rejected the teachings he proclaimed. How many times can his boys take in vain for the Lord's name, as this movie is from a presbyterian background? That's not true. I wanted Paul to be swept down the river without a boat from the beginning to save us the stupid, smirky, selfish story of Paul (Brad Pitt). Then Norm becomes a teacher, and Paul becomes a compulsory model that Norm wants to save, but does not do so. It is very uninteresting. We see that the prejudices of whites have risen by Paul because of his native American girl. It was the only part that had some interest, and might have been developed into a true 'wild west'. What we only see is a sleepy town where the two ministers' sons have nothing to do, but 1. Norm chase a lame girlfriend and deal with her family and 2.Paul makes stupid stories at the newspaper store while he scratches his head and takes a lot of snakes and tie many flies. I'd rather see a show about fishing that movie again - which will never be.
