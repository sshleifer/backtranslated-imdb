This may be the worst movie I've ever seen. The fact that it has a thin story is bad enough that they have hooked it around the subject of football violence making it 100 times worse. <br /> <br /> I had serious doubts about the prize of this movie even before I began to look, but went into the open, of course, to accept the way the authors thought it appropriate to introduce Elijah Woods character Matt into the hooligan scene. <br /> <br /> But the movie throws inaccuracy after inaccuracy to the point that in the middle of the movie you get to crawl harder than the time before. <br /> <br /> Let's clean up a few things: Hooligans don't tend to smash up in their own pub before a run-of-the-mill game; they do not set out to kill each other; They carry not only Stone Island (and others in the crowd, hooligans or not, do). They have certainly not, when they have taken the exception of a new company member, busy at the territory of their rival companies for pie and mash. And I would love to meet the hool who wanted to go grass on his company's top boy to the rival firm. (Although you can scratch what I said about putting myself out, kill each other if you exist). <br /> <br /> Don't make me mistake, I'm not yet watching a movie on the subject that doesn't. I have some fantasy whims, but it is on par with the company of cluelessness. I found it ironic that Woods American nemesis is morally condemned by his character to be cocaine when this is part and parcel of the British hooligan scene. The movie does not choose to challenge Wood's morality and instead controls any of the company using cola. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think I've made my point. <br /> <br /> With regard to the plot, it is extremely imaginative, and I am sure that if I had not used the whole movie, the points scored, and more, above, I had guessed what was faster than I did. And believe me, I was well ahead. <br /> <br /> I get the distinctive impression that this movie is aimed at men, hoping that women will enjoy the injection of emotional problems that arise. <br /> <br /> If I'm right, the decision makers have failed completely. It is too unrealistic to be enjoyed by anyone who knows about the scene and I cannot believe that the kind of female looking for emotional movies would puzzle any of the characters who have given their violent tendencies . <br /> <br /> Are there good points? Maybe the scene scenes are well choreographed and filmed, but I'm rarely impressed by slow-mo action, certainly not when it's a fight, as it's a blur, it's probably enough. <br /> <br /> There are some fun if unrealistic moments. Woods trip to school raised a smile for me. But a couple of mildly fun moments hardly make it look two hours of pre-fabricated dross. <br /> <br /> If you are British, do not suffer plague if you no longer develop misunderstandings of the scene if you are not in the know. If you are American, you can enjoy it as it is clearly tailored to the market. But no one can deny that the plot is flimsy, predictable and ultimately over the top.
