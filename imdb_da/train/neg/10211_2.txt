Apart from recognizing some fine movies, I can hardly say anything positive about this movie. The only real problem is the protagonist's dilemma of staying with his childhood wives in the world of misery or leaving and taking up his own life. Rich "emotionally powerful" scenes do not go with this plot, and because of bad acting, they also fail to create the intended atmosphere. The director only manages to introduce Anthony's dilemma and finally brings an easy solution. The signs don't seem to evolve, although it's hard to talk about any signs ... maybe except for Sonny. Next to him, the actors do not play much, and when some of them do, they come out as self-indulging amateurs. I wonder what ruined the movie: the superficial manuscript that throws all the potential of the plot or the bad play disturbs any appeal that may be left.
