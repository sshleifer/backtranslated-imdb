Pam Grier stars like Coffy. She is a nurse seeking revenge on drug traffickers who had her sister crocheted in bad heroine. Like all 70s Blaxploitation-flick you can expect to see the racist bad get their just desserts. <br /> <br /> There were scores of these movies made during the 70's and they were really demeaning for both black and white audiences. This is mainly due to the evil racial hostility of these films and the degrading, stereotypical characters. Especially the female characters. <br /> <br /> Other common threads between Coffy and other films of its kind include brutal violence, corrupt police, car guns, a generous abundance of nudity, and sexually beautiful women. Not to mention urban ghettos populated by drug dealers, pimps, mobsters and other criminal foam. <br /> <br /> Pam Grier was the undisputed queen of the 70s Blaxploitation heroines. She was magnificent as he was both hard as nails and deadly beautiful. Like in his other films, Pam expresses the other characters in Coffy. In fact, Pam is so charismatic on the screen that these kinds of movies are inflexible, without her being the protagonist. <br /> <br /> If you like Pam Grier, you're better off seeing her other movies, like Foxy Brown, or maybe Friday Foster. These films have much less empty sleaze than Coffy does. Pam's character in Coffy breaks down too much to get the bad. Pam's characters in his other Blaxploitation films must not be bent so low to get revenge that Coffy did. <br /> <br /> I just want to see Coffy if you can't see any of Pam Grier's other movies. Otherwise, Coffy is a waste of time. Only Pam's talent as an actress makes display of Coffy bearable.
