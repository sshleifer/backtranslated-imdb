Despite the mysterious positive reviews and high rating, this is a horrible movie. Awful enough, I feel obliged to warn you how bad it is. <br /> <br /> The movie is set in the last period of Raj, during India's struggle for independence. What follows in the ridiculous plot just fills me with disbelief. What the characters do and how they behave does not convince me that the characters exist in that era. <br /> <br /> For example, the young, married Hindu housewife from the local village would have an affair with her married English master, knowing that the discovery of the affair would probably mean complete social exclusion and shame if not deadly punishment? Unlikely, but still maybe. But would the same young Hindu housewife in the conservative community in India continue in that era as a half-naked Britney Spears in heat, participate in hot outdoor sex in daylight in open view, where they might be discovered at any time? It's not just bloody unlikely, it's a retarded plot line. Such idiots combined with the poor trades drove me to leave the cinema for an hour in the movie, so I didn't see in the other half of the movie. One could only hope that the end is more intelligent than what I saw in the first half.
