Hands down the worst movie I've ever seen. I thought nothing would ever ruin the last action hero, but it makes it easy. The movie is about 3 single guys who meet on Sunday to discuss their sexual escapades from the weekend. A fourth guy - who is married and - who used to be part of the group, turns out to talk about what he and his wife are doing. Nothing works in this movie. The jokes are not funny, but they are repeated throughout the film. The big kicker at the end of the movie is ridiculous. Avoid at all costs.
