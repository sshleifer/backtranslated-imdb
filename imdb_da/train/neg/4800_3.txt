If you made a genre flip in the late 80's, you had pretty much a 50/50 chance, it would either be put under water or in a prison (unfortunately we never got an underwater prison). Derek Keillor (Dennis Cole), murdered by mafia chief Moretti (Anthony Franciosa), ends in the death row, along with Bob's brother Frankie (Frank Sarcinello Jr.). But it's the least of Derek's problems as a rogue government agent (and mobster) Col. Burgess (John Saxon, who also leads) uses the prison as a test site for a new super virus. This is the only flick-Saxon directed during his great career. For a guy who has worked with tons of directors, it seems that the only ones he has picked up from were the cheap Italian. Sure it's low budget, but it can't apologize for the stylish staging, shooting gaff or clumsy show for the first 15 minutes. To his credit, Saxon did a little gory and he works in a hilarious nude scene (our driver falls asleep during a prison rebellion to just fantasize about a female scientist). Cole, resembling a more robust Jan-Michael Vincent, is decent as stoic lead and Franciosa - with a really bad rug - gives it all as a clich√© mob boss. The end takes place at Marty McKee's favorite place, Bronson Canyon. Retromedia released this on DVD as ZOMBIE DEATH HOUSE.
