This movie comes as the ultimate disappointment in Tsai Ming-Liang for me. It oozes laziness from its every frame. So I also don't want to analyze it thoroughly. But some observations: <br /> <br /> 1. If the premise is drought, why do we see urban landscapes with flowering green trees? I wonder if it should mean anything in the film's metaphorical context (where thirst tells intimacy and watermelon the trivial substitute, sex). Or it's just a matter of miserable film making that doesn't give a silly about being coherent. <br /> <br /> 2. We do not understand what happened to the porn actress, why she is unconscious or presumably dead. It looks like a question that doesn't matter as long as the announcement of the highest alienation (= bombastic) has been delivered, but gradually her inert body shows to be a cheap dramaturgical gimmick, a pretense? as free and exploitative as the activity it is engaged in. <br /> <br /> 3. Nothing is expressed in this film that Antonioni had not expressed better 40 years ago? and without unnecessarily humiliating his actors. <br /> <br /> 4. The musical tracks (reused from 'The Hole') felt like a secondary school idea of ​​artistic counterparty performed at the very secondary school level of skill. If it was intended, the point sucked.
