It just seems bizarre that someone reads this script and thought, "It's fun! I mean, it's so much fun, it just got to be done!" Who was this person? Is he or she really responsible for this? Are they the ones who owe me for my time, more than the director / author? <br /> <br /> This movie stinks in most possible ways. There is no shame of good dialogue and not a sympathetic character. And the story ... I prefer the 2nd worst movie ever, Hulk Hogan's "No Hold's Barred" to this to a considerable extent. It almost seems the Shakespeare in comparison. The end is padded with several minutes of withdrawal and it is still under 80 minutes. The outlets include cast members who laugh at the "hilarious" mistakes they have made and things that went wrong on the phrase of this "comedy." Happy to see someone laugh in someway, with no connection to this 'movie'. Nothing in this movie is fun. Nothing. It just goes on and on. It really is the lame one. I love movies that are so bad they are good. It's so bad, it's something, but I don't know what, and hopefully I'll never find out. <br /> <br /> Amanda Peet doesn't suck completely and is actually the only half good thing about this wannabe movie. But it really does mean a little. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
