My friends and I went into this movie without knowing what to expect but hoping for the best. When we came out, we were just a little more informed about what the movie of the film was actually. Although not the worst movie I've ever seen, I definitely recommend not spending your money watching it in theaters. Maybe a friend has rent it to you (it's not even worth the rental costs either) if you really want to see it. <br /> <br /> When a movie is so distorted that you have no idea what happens until the last five minutes there really isn't much that can be said in its defense. The action was decent, more than you would expect to get from this movie, and some of the pictures were good, but it was all rooted in a paralyzed plot and a bad script. <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie was so bad that as soon as it came out I went and bought a ticket to watch a good movie just to clean my mind. I recommend that all of you just skip the first step and watch a good movie instead.
