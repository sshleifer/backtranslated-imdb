This may well be the worst movie I want to see if I live to be 100. I think a group of first graders could have got better plot lines as a class project than this. I'm stupid to have seen it, and God has mercy on the souls that were paid to produce this movie. <br /> <br /> And after I finally knocked it off, I actually wanted to throw up. /> <br /> No one had a clue about photography when they did this. No one had a clue about acting. Nobody had a clue about pretty much anything. <br /> <br /> I can't believe F / X shows this crap at times. The only time I had seen it was on one of Starz! channels - not even the most important. And it was about 3 a.m.
