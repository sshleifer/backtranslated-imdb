When I was a kid, we always used to be babysitting, and we always used to rent a movie or watch a movie at the cinema. This is one of the movies we watched. This is one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen, I think it can even be a Walt Disney Pictures movie! A martian has fallen to the ground, becomes a human, turns to a human, and tries everything he can to get home. But he is distracted by the wonders of the earth. The only good comment I can give is the choice of actors, Back to the Future's Christopher Lloyd as the martian, Uncle Martin, Dumb and Dumber's Jeff Daniels like Tim O'Hara, Elizabeth Hurley as Brace Channing and Daryl Hannah as Lizzie. But apart from that, it's the complete crap. Poor!
