It was the tagline "in the tradition of American Pie" that tricked me into renting this movie. What I got was a piece of junk in Jackass's style, with the big difference that compared to this Jackass the Movie seems like a Citizen Kane. <br /> <br /> This movie made me regret that I rewarded other movies with 1 in 10 because now I can't go under it. This makes some bad movies look like biographical feats. <br /> <br /> I actually hit it after 45 minutes, and I rarely do that. But it was just too plain boring, stupid, uninteresting and unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Can't believe some people actually reward this with 10 out of 10. What did your parents do? Get rid of your head when you were a kid? Or was it the very first movie you've ever seen, so you have nothing to compare with it? Are you still a virgin and are breasts all you ever think? Something must be wrong, at least. <br /> <br /> My advice: Stay away from this. Even if you are in the mood for a simple movie that does not require thinking, choose something else or you will undoubtedly regret it.
