I don't expect much from this movie, but oh brother, what stinks. <br /> <br /> I found this gem in a huge box of horrible $ 5 DVDs at Walmart (where else)? As cheap as this disk was, I feel ripped off. The special effects had a high school look at them, the camera was confused by the wobbly stand and sketchy lighting and the play was a perfect example of 'Christian School'. One can imagine the long and exhausting "prayer meetings" from the production company after seeing the Russians come back - the people who banked this thing must have had serious anti-biblical feelings to the inappropriate production company that cranked this thing out. Think of their anxiety as they saw their $ 914.86 investment go up in smoke. Someone asked why Christian movies are so bad - maybe the Xian filmmakers have to look at good movies and try to copy some of the things that make them so good. Trustworthy stories and characters, less hysterical weaving and fanaticism, oh and a story that appeals to everyone, not just true believers. Ie Stop the sermon, save it to church. Take e.g. Omen or Prophesy series. Excellent movie with convincing story lines, great filmography and intense music. No hysterical arm waving. No sermon. <br /> <br /> If this movie had a laugh track, it would have been much better.
