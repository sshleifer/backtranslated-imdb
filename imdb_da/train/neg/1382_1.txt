The movie was horrible. The theater was dead with silence because everyone was embarrassed to be in there and looked at such a garbage can. I think someone gave Jet Li a lobotomy and made him do a script with dialogue written by a five year old. The martial art is 'ok', but when you sit next to Jackie Chan movies and 'The Matrix', you are better off seeing one of them.
