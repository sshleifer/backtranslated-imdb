When I first heard of "Solar Crisis", I got a lot of casting, I wondered why I had never heard of a movie with such a large cast before. Then I saw it. <br /> <br /> Now I know. <br /> <br /> For a film that includes outer space, the sun, great deserts and widespread metropolis, this is a horrible cramped and claustrophobic feature; It feels like everyone is hunkered close together so the camera doesn't have to pull too far back. <br /> <br /> And while the effects are good, the effects are quite overwhelming; We are talking about the imminent destruction of the planet earth if a team of scientists and soldiers cannot divert a deadly solar flare. But other than shouting, sweating and a red glow about everything, there is no real emergency. <br /> <br /> Let me not get started with the casting. What Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle, et al. Doing in this movie without bothering to deal with any kind of material is anyone's guess. Do you wonder where else condos are not paid in Hollywood .... And as far as the end goes .... Well, let's just say it's exciting and exciting, but it's too little too late in an attempt like this . If it had stopped that kind of pace through the movie, I might have heard of "Solar Crisis" before. <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mostly for lost opportunities and poor career movements. <br /> <br /> I wonder how Alan Smithee is doing his job by doing so unwanted?
