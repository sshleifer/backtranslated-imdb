Let's be honest. As a film school project, made without budget and "real" actors, this is a charity interesting film. As something to be released on DVD for an innocent viewer, it is a very poorly produced product. If I wanted to start changing channels and accidentally catching this movie, it would probably stop my eye and attention for a while. As a person who bought this DVD under the impression that I would get a proper film product, that is, a movie, I feel very disappointed. It is a video recorded TV game, something along the line in old three series series, but without that kind of charm. Except for the leading man, Mr. Redfield (who is also the director), the other actors seem to be either chaps from the campus (a little too old to actually) or members of the director's household who appear in front of the camera without any help from not only the functioning sofas but also make-up up the artist or hairdresser (a hook over outgrown permanent forehead or a top hat over the mullet is a very long way from creating the 1840s). It's all shot using a motionless mounted camera in a small, bare studio, sometimes using blue screen for outdoor backgrounds. Synthesizer generated uninspired score of lame "period" inspired romantic karaoke insults viewers ears in more than one occasion. The movie is trying to be "dreamless", but it is actually only unnecessary collage of the pictures that made it into editing (and believe me, the standards were not too high to begin with). There are sometimes interesting dialogues, but in general it is rather paralyzed and two-dimensional production in more than one way with no brilliant look from either the director or any of the crew members. It was so that "artsy" films tried to look in the 80s. Sir. Redfield does a much better job as an actor than the director.
