Let's first get it out of the way. . . Yes, this movie steals a lot from 'Darkness Falls' (2003). The reason for 'Darkness Falls' goes like this: The tooth fairy, a murderous woman who hides her face because of insult, kills people who look at her out of revenge. In 'The Tooth Fairy' (2006), the disfigured Tooth Fairy (which, yes, hides her face) releases its furious revenge on virtually everyone. A bit too similar to chance. But what to ask is: If you want to steal the exact plot from a movie, why choose something as mediocre as 'Darkness Falls'? Sure it made a pair of pants at the cashier's office, but it was strictly for the pretty okay theatrical experience the movie delivered. A low budget movie just for video will not have the same effect. And it didn't. <br /> <br /> When I saw the opening 15-20 minutes of the movie, my expectations actually rose. There seemed to be at least SPECIAL production value. The story didn't seem horrible, just blatantly ripped off. Past the first scene, we get an okay throw of characters, including a former doctor with secrets (played by the guy who looks like a Busey) and a warm veterinary student (Jenifer from Argento's Masters of Horror: Jenifer). After the few minutes, however, the film slowly goes down into the drain. It serves all the basically awful clich√©s, including but not limited to: a crazy old person with an unprecedented warning, the stupid stupid jock, the psychic and the stripper with the heart of the gold. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest issues this movie had was its inability to hold onto a target audience. It is like the filmmakers wanted to change the tone, regardless of the character on the screen at that time. When the adults were on the screen, it had a more mature feel. When Star (stripper) and whatshisface (jock) were on the screen, the dialogue went down to a more stupid, erroneously immature level. When the baby was on the screen, it felt like an episode of 'Are you afraid of the dark?'. . . only less scary. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is everywhere. The visions range from quite good to plain boring. The script is subpar, as it mostly acts. On the plus side, there is something exaggerated to do on parts (including a rather cool (but painfully predictable)) woodchipper scene and a beautiful vicious nailgun scene. Also, if you are looking for some of the sexy stuff, there is a short topless scene (but if you want to see this chick topless, there are better movies to do that). Apart from that, there's not much to bother with when it comes to this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of 'Darkness Falls' (can they exist?), maybe you can check it out to see the story done differently. . . But that's the only reason I can find this. <br /> <br /> Final judgment: 3/10 -AP3-
