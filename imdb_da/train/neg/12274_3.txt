I am usually not one to say that a movie is not worth watching, but it is certainly a mitigating circumstance. The only true upside to this movie is Cornelia Sharpe, who looks pretty attractive and the fact that this movie is really short. The plot in the movie is incredibly boring and goes almost nowhere in the whole movie. None of the signs are even externally interesting, and there is no need to worry about anyone. I'm not sure why Sean Connery agreed to make this movie, but he should definitely go ahead with this. <br /> <br /> The only reason to watch this movie is if you are a dead-hard Sean Connery fan and just want to see everything he has done. If you miraculously end up seeing this despite my review (or any of the other reviews on this site), then I hope you enjoy it more than I did. Thanks for reading.
