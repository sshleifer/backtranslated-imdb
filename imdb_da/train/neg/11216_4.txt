Just okay movie about a woman who is a twin who has disturbing visions of her sister in danger back home. She then returns home to find everything is not good and that she will have to find out what has happened to her sister and why. <br /> <br /> These are the kind of things that almost work but don't quite. I can't really put my finger on why it didn't work but it was good enough that I wish it was better or at least had the little things like having the girls playing the twins in flashbacks be closer on size I think maybe something is wrong with it, there are many small things that are just wrong.
