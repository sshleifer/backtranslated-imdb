I wanted to like this movie, but many elements ruined it for me. The use of a fisheye lens throughout and chopped editing did not give me the feeling of being in the world of meth head, but it made me believe I saw MTV in a few short moments. The movie never seemed to go anywhere, and the actor was really an excellent example of over acting. I love movies that give us an insight into the seedy underworld, but this movie couldn't determine if it was a bad scary movie or an even worse serious comment on addiction dependence.
