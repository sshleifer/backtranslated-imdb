I remember when this came out, many children had to. I think I was a little too old to be all excited and I was a fan of real martial arts movies and always found this a bit cheesy. In the early 90s, we were flooded with programs that made the children feel like they could fight and be a power ranger or a corpse of these 3 ninjas children. I believe that both parents and filmmakers got sick of it, because all we had was a lot of kids walking around and bumping into everyone. <br /> <br /> Many kids movies have a big point they are trying to make and it's great for your kids to see and get the message, this one has no message at all ... it utilizes just one million differences in less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> The movie has no great visual qualities, but would you expect it? The action is pretty bad. Victor Wong is a cool actor, but it was embarrassing to see him here. The short, fat, gimped eyed was speeding like a strong ninja, just fun. The kids above acted too much and the youngest ninja Tum Tum was perhaps the worst kid actor I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The movie has a plot that everyone knows before they even read the review. 3 ninjas ... yes you know they will fight with a bunch of evil and win of course ... May I say more. Sorry if I spoiled it to anyone. <br /> <br /> With all that said, KIDS LOVE IT. This movie is aimed at children and only children can enjoy it. If you don't mind your child watching movies about the kids fighting, it's a good movie to let them see. If you don't mind letting your kids see complete garbage that has nothing to do with real martial arts, real acting or reality, then you've found a movie for your kids ... I say children because I believe That even the girls will like it ... I remember all the girls have a crush on Rocky. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 stars because I think you can make a movie for kids and still make fun for adults .. this movie failed a lot of time on it. It's beyond cheesy and nothing original or unique, and I wouldn't allow a kid of mine to see it ... The Kung Fu TV shows are on DVD and there are lots of great Shaw Brothers movies out there. .. Why not show your kids things that will really entertain them and not make them stupid along the way, maybe even teach them some moves and not just how to kick a man between the legs as grandfather did on 3 ninjas ... no no no. .. never kick a man between the legs ... never .. it's so unninja like.
