Well, I just ordered this on my pay-per-view at home because I was bored and in need of a laugh. I have to admit that I laughed a few times, but I don't even remember which parts they were on. I don't understand why this movie was made. It claims to be a comedy, but seriously, I do not find a song penis or a nude 70-year-old woman very funny. This movie tried to fit into the "widespread" comedies of recent years like American Pie and Road Trip, but it just failed miserably. It was too much widespread as it was comedy. Also, why on earth, did Cameron Diaz add his name to this movie?!?! The only thing I liked about this movie was when Dave and Angela were in the pool. I thought it was sexy and comfortable and well done. Besides that, avoid this movie. 3.10
