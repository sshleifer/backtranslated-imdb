This movie has some amazing noirish / neo-realistic images, and it tells a story that is refreshingly free of Hollywood's sugar coating, which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film. But some of the scenes take place too long (the wedding, in particular), and I found the exaggerated play and unrealistic dialogue to be more suitable for the stage than for the silver screen. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was particularly distracting and it seemed to get worse as the film went on. Most characters were either Italian-Americans or Italian immigrants living in New York in the twenties and thirties, but their dialogue sounded like the practiced lines to a Shakespeare game while mixing cement and laying bricks. At the end I laughed and not because the filmmakers wanted me to. I suppose that the poetry asked could be defended by saying that the characters would have spoken Italian, and the dialogue is a literal translation of how they would really speak. But it certainly did not work for me. Another dialog box made me laugh for another reason: The protagonist's son, born and raised in New York in the 1920s, suddenly picks a nice lilting British accent. I just guess that this had something to do with the movie being made in England. <br /> <br /> I give this movie an 'A' for effort and intent but a significantly lower class for execution.
