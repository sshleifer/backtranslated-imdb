I read about this movie in a magazine and I was fascinated. A woman who one day sees herself passing by in her own car. Well, I thought it might be interesting ... <br /> <br /> ... but it's not. First, the title. The Broken? The Broken ... what? What's broken? The ... oh, wait ... I understand, the title itself is "broken"! WOW, wise! Unfortunately, it's pretty much the only thing that goes for it. The principle is not that bad, but I think that Kiefer Suderland did much better in 'Mirrors'. A cross between Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Mirrors, and a rather mediocre in it. A more appropriate title would be 'The Boring' as it draws every scene for bloody ages. Or maybe 'The Confusing', as it doesn't explain anything at all, not in the story or in the story itself, just a vague idea of ​​evil copies and somesuch, dotted with cheap scares and scenes used for death, but nothing tangible . It's just messy. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the play and the special effects are pretty good, but then it is not a difficult role to act. <br /> <br /> Having watched the movie twice, I still feel dissatisfied, a little confused perhaps, and not in the EA Poe or Stephen King kind of way. Do yourself a favor and don't take care of this. In short, there are better thrillers out there.
