I couldn't wait to receive the DVD after hearing so much about the movie. What a disappointment! This became one of the most confusing movies I've ever seen. So many characters were introduced, some resembling others, it was impossible to follow the story. I couldn't understand how George Clooney received a play for the movie when he was hardly involved, at least in the first half of the movie. My wife and I gave up after about an hour of misery and stopped the DVD. I could have considered quick submission to see if the end was better, but after so much confusion, the chances of improvement were slim. A colleague told me that much of the movie "comes together" at the last minute or less. I was glad I didn't waste another hour and waited. I gave the DVD away the following day.
