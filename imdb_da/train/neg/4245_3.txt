This movie was based on actual fact? I do not hope! <br /> <br /> We will see what appears to be many armed cops, emptying as many weapons on 2 guys having only armored torsos. That is a good idea; aim at armor! ... excuse me, but what about the big fat, unmissable heads or their legs to cry aloud. Or were there invisible thoughts that protect them? Were they from Crypton? Have I missed something here? <br /> <br /> This movie started decent enough but after 20 minutes of shoot-out, it really takes a trip to the boring lane. <br /> <br /> And the documentary style didn't work for me either, but it's just something you find equally or not. <br /> <br /> Very amazing things that make it hard to see it through to the end. <br /> 3/10 for finishing.
