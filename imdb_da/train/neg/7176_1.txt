I have no more to say, but it was terrible. I can't imagine why Helen Mirren and others were part of this degrading mess. And if some actors don't want people to question their sexuality, they may refrain from making more of these films. There was at least one set that left me curious. Just my opinion. SHUDDER to think about what was going on cut from the movie. SHUDDER to wonder what went through the actors who made this movie. Push thinking about the thinking and voyeurism that took place in the director's mind. As I said before, it was a degrading mess. It's not even fun. As Ebert said about the movie Caligula with Malcolm McDowell, it's not a good movie, not a good story and not even good porn. YEESHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ............
