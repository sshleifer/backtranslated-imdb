Some unrealistic movie spoilers included. <br /> <br /> From real life experiences this movie continued to disappoint from the beginning. I am currently deployed on my second trip to Iraq as an infantry man. This movie has nothing near what would happen in reality. From the outset to name a few: the bomber, the EOD elements rolled out without any escort, the EOD employee sergeant slipped off the VBC, with sleeves rolled all the time in the ACUs, to where I had to call it, ended my min. copy, sniper scene. The list would continue, but it is unnecessary to specify things that are wrong, with a time of 2 minutes before several things were wrong. and the point was made. <br /> <br /> This movie is for people and critics to see who have no understanding or experience with implementations or the military. People with military background or knowledge of the military will be disappointed with the inaccuracy.
