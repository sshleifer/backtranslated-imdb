Captured part of GEORGE 2 on TV recently, but couldn't make me see it through to the end. Just awful! I can't even remember the plot. All I know is that George and Ursula were not George and Ursula from the first movie, which was bad enough. There is a lot of scrambling around, but the direction and editing were so creepy and choppy, it was like seeing outtakes or deleted scenes. Having Ape's original voice was not close enough to make me warm up to this. GEORGE 2 is probably the only worst sequel I've ever seen, and that says something. Jeez, because of IMDb's 10 line rule, I have to continue writing when I have nothing more to say about this crapulastic made-for-TV sequel. Disney, hang your head in shame.
