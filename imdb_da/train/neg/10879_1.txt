Lame, lame, lame !!! A 90 minute cringe party that is 89 minutes too long. A setting ripe with atmosphere and opportunity (an abandoned monastery) is wasted by a stink of a manuscript filled with lumpy, carefree dialogue stretching so hard to be hip. Mostly, it's just embarrassing, and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat (a sample of the movie's dialogue: After demonstrating his artillery, the fast dolly shot at a close-up of Barbeau's vigilante character, she: "any question?" Hyuck hyuck hyuck ). Bad plays, idiotic, homophobic jokes and judging from the creation effects, it seems that the director has seen 'The Evil Dead' way too many times. <br /> <br /> I owe my friends great time to rent this turkey and expose them to ninety wasted minutes, they never come back. What a turd.
