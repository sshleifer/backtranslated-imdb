I agree with most if not all previous commentators are Tom (bighouseaz@yahoo.com). Zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword struggle and excitement. <br /> <br /> I've seen Zatoichi 1-13,15,16; I think 14 has not been released on Zone 1 (USA). Zatoichi Outlaw was disappointing. The story was complicated and seemed to be a hodgepodge of many former Zatoichi stories. At one point I wondered if I didn't see a remake of a former Zatoichi movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was disappointing because it began to depend on effects (a main scroll, limbs cut off, blood) and less on the nobility of the Zatoichi character. All the previous films succeeded on the basis of the story and the action and won a good result without having to resort to effects. I just hope that the remaining Zatoichi films will NOT follow the same trend. This is the first Zatoichi film from his study. I highly recommend all the previous Zatoichi movies - and recommend them.
