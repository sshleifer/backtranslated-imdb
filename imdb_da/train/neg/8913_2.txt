When I first voted on this morning news, I thought, "Wow, finally, a little entertainment." It was a bit entertaining for a week or so ... But we have to resist it, these news reporters (if you can even call them), WAY TOO has a lot of "play around" time. <br /> <br /> First, I thought Jillian was a fresh air. But seriously, this woman has not least her journalist. She is very unprofessional. She continues to interrupt Steve when he begins to inform viewers of a particular news report. It's just been annoying for the point that I can't see it anymore. <br /> <br /> Jillian is NOT a good journalist. Hell, she's more of a celebrity who loves to be a celebrity. Therefore, she instantly transforms into a celebrity around celebrities whom she should interview. She is not very professional and admittedly perceives her relationship with celebrities more important than being a rather insatiable journalist - and that is all I can say about her. <br /> <br /> Also (disappointing) this show has more entertainment news than necessary news reports about the world, government, US, or anything that will benefit and / or serve the public's best interest. They are too focused on sensationalism, that everything they talk about comes out as a commercial product. On the other hand, their field reporters are interestingly tolerable ... <br /> <br /> I think "Good Day LA" is for young teens and celebrities, and certainly not for people who actually hold get rid of the news. <br /> <br /> PAGE NOTE: (I would very much like to see KTLA, but they are trying so hard to be entertaining sometimes. However, they are still bad. Oh, I stick to NBC's "Today." ABCs ") Good Morning America "is also okay ... as long as Diane Sawyer doesn't get too serious.)
