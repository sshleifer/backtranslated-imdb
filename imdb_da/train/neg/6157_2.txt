Yikes, it was definitely one of those sleepless nights, where I laced the channels and hit this stink of a movie. For some of the names in the cast, I would expect a much better movie. I'm almost embarrassed to see Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham being reduced to such an awful part. I hope the money was worth it. And the students talked about fencing as if they were talking about survival in a war or through a terrible catastrophe. I mean, I've fenced in, it's a fun sport, but I've never been so intense. The only reason I even saw the whole movie was because the remote control fell under the sofa and I was too lazy to get it back.
