I suppose this movie is a fitting tribute to the first Superman movie, as it is as curvaceous and painfully long as the original. Following an opening scene made up of only scary intergalactic images, the credit pays homage to the early futuristic sweeping credits of the original Superman movie, which is still curving. <br /> <br /> Then there are some more creepy things. Ma Kent sees a kind of creepy ruckus on the farm, and spends much of my life slowly going up to some wreck in the corn field. Then Superman sniffs at her and faints. <br /> <br /> Next, we enter Lex Luthor in a scene of many dark close-ups of an old lady as she dies. We don't see Luther's face to the end of the scene, an early example of the movie's drive to leave no hackneyed stone unturned. Lex Luthor is a guy who doesn't like Superman because he's not human. In addition, he does not like people as the film occasionally contains a kind of plot about Lex Luthor, who is planning to kill most of the Earth's population. After a while, Clark Kent shows up on his old job (I forgot to mention he had gone on a five-year trip where nothing happened). Then he finds out Lois Lane has a illegitimate child and dates Cyclops. It disturbs him so much that he loses control of his super strength to such an extent that he accidentally breaks a picture frame. <br /> <br /> At this point, we see that Miss Lane is on a kind of jet attached to some kind of space shuttle. It's a kind of important event because it's on television. Then we learn that there are people in a control room that monitors this event. There are also people watching it on TV, and there are pilots in the cockpit. The film reminds us that these people are involved in cutting them for most of the summer. As the events that led to the inevitable catastrophe began to build, I apologized for getting sodas. I accidentally went back to the wrong theater and saw the movie about Al Gore showing slides in its entirety. I tried to find my way back to Superman Returns, but somehow I walked into Prairie Home Companion, which I saw twice in a row. Then it was time to stop beating. <br /> <br /> I went back to the first theater, found my seat and looked up to see that the upcoming Lois Lane shuttle drama was almost upon us. Still, it seemed to take forever, so I walked around the theater, met a girl, married, traveled a son and sent him to college. As I attended my son's medical education, I remembered probably having to check in on Superman Returns, so I apologized to myself and only drove back to the theater to learn that there was no need to hurry. It still took about half an hour before things went wrong for Space Shuttle Lane. When they did, Superman saved everyone, which was pretty cool. <br /> <br />. And then there's a subplot where Superman gets really scary and begins to pursue Lois Lane and her family with his x-ray vision and super-hearing. Then he tries to get her cheating on Cyclops, which seems like a good guy. Meanwhile, Lex Luthor is involved in some kind of competition to show any possible generic villain behavior before the end of the movie. I forgot to bring my scorecard home with me (they give you one at the door), but I think he scored nearly 100 percent. I hope he wins millions of dollars. <br /> <br /> At this point, things are starting to make up for the great scary finale. Maybe I think the projector was broken because of the movie seemed to be in some kind of loop for a while here. I remember seeing dark things grow out of the water, Superman gets sick, Superman gets better, back to the creepy things he's sick again, no waiting, it's okay again. <br /> <br /> So Lex Luthor released his final bad guy moving: shouting at his girlfriend a little bit. <br /> <br /> So Superman died and came back to life. I thought the movie was over so I went. <br /> <br /> Ninety years later, the nursing home, where I lived, felt a little cold. I realized I left my sweatshirt back in the theater and I went to get it. When I did, I was a little surprised that Superman Returns was not over yet. I tried to ask some of the viewers what I missed, but most were just skeletons with long gray beards now. <br /> <br /> I sat back in my old seat and watched as Lois Lane sat around her house for a while. Then Superman came up and began to quote the beginning of the movie, and since I already saw the part, I thought it was okay to leave. <br /> <br /> So that's my review of Superman Returns. <br /> <Oh, if you like jokes about people eating dogs or jokes about a dog eating another dog, you'll love this movie. Because of that there are two jokes in it.
