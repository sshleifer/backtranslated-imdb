This movie is very very very bad. I've seen better movies. <br /> <br /> There was little excitement, but not much to make you jump out of your chair. It starts slowly with the build up of tension. It is not a success. At least if you ask me. Although I have to say at some points or moments that it was a little fun when people were shot and how they went down. <br /> <br /> They should have made it something like Scary Movie, so it might be a better movie. Because I only look at pieces of the movie by skipping scenes and it became boring through the movie. I have to say that I felt sleepy on this movie so I can definitely not say it worth it. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time thinking about doing something with this movie besides leaving it where it is already. Somewhere very dusty ..
