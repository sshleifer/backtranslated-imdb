This ambitious movie suffers most of the writer / director Paul Thomas Anderson's delusions. Much derived from much better material (Altman's "Nashville", Lumet's "Network"), this carving elephant takes too long to get nowhere. A few wrong detours along the way (an embarrassing musical space, a biblical plague) does not help. Nor is it the uneven level of performances. Particularly bad: William H. Macy whose character and history could easily have been eliminated altogether; Julianne Moore, for her convincing anxiety. And how many times do we see John C. Reilly's Sad Sack shtick ("Chicago" and "The Hours" sufficient)? Tom Cruise comes in handy in comparison? His misogynistic, foul-mouthed Holy Roller was pretty entertaining. The talk of evil mouth was the script so filled with "F" bombs, they lost their influence in no time. Don't even talk about the horrible soundtrack, full of unpleasant and annoying vocals by Aimee Mann. Her extended reproduction of "One", a maudlin number to begin with, drove me to distraction at the beginning of the movie. I should have kept the manuscript on the wall and rescued me three hours, after which I was put to hell. A redemption feature, which I have not seen mentioned in other reviews, is the best performance in the pile, of unknown Melora Walters in the role of Claudia, the damaged coke enemy bowing to self-destruction. Her credibility far exceeded all others. This movie went far too seriously and did not know when to quit.
