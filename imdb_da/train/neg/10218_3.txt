** Spoilers included ** <br /> <br /> I heard from various sources that this movie was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrible. What I didn't expect was the complete change in thanks with about twenty minutes to go. What begins as a typical cowboy / Indian west suddenly down into a very boring romantic "comedy" about Honus (Soldier Blue by the title played by Peter Strauss) and Cresta (Candice Bergen), escaping an attack by the Cheyenne cavalry. The majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people and thus the romantic comedy bit. Donald Pleasance then appears and abducts both of them without any apparent manifestation. Then they escape, and both turn up (separately) on the cavalry base on the threshold of an attack on the Cheyenne base. When Cresta used to be married to one of the Cheyenne chiefs, she escaped the cavalry and joined them. So far so common. Then comes the end. Having spent well over an hour of poor performance involving a clich√© of will / will not get together in the storyline, then the film transforms over the supreme exploitation involving, among other things, a beheading, and a child being shot in the back of the head. Similarities can be drawn with Wild Bunch at this point in the movie, but Wild Bunch kept the same tone all the way through and did not take into account extreme free violence. In some ways, Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perry's last summer, which also completely changed thanks for a shock. I didn't hate soldier blue or found the end very disturbing, but just found it to be quite boring with an unnecessarily violent ending. If you want to watch a movie with a really disturbing slaughter of the innocent, I would recommend Elem Klimov's Come and See.
