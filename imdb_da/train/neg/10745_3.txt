Boring, predictable, by-the-numbers horror outing has at least pretty good special effects and lots of (mindless) mayhem and do to satisfy (mindless) genre fans. For the most part, it's about giant rats fighting for a set of characters, we don't care about an iota about - if it's your thing, tune in. (* 1/2)
