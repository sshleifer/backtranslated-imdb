Greetings again from the dark. What happened to the big Barry Levinson? He instructed two of my all-time favorites in "Avalon" and "Diner". He also had some fine films ("Rainman"), but always gave something of interest ... until now. I think the worst thing you can ever say about a comedy is that it's boring. "Envy" is the definition of boring. Never by the big fan of pure dumb and dumber, I was just stunned by how deceptive this movie is. There might be 2 chuckles in the whole thing - if you can be aware for so long. The best part of the movie is the ongoing gag of the title song of a Redbone sound-like. If the movie was written as well as the song, it would have been tolerable. Rachel Weisz is a wonderful actress, and I realize that they will all make comedy (even Julianne Moore), but the real world puts a weakness. SNL cast member Amy Poehler is her usual over the top in her role as trailer park trash turned princess. The disaster in the movie is Jack Black and Ben Stiller. The first work commuting together flashes some promise, but after that their chemistry disappears because of the poor script. This script is like most of Jack Black's character's ideas - not a bad thought, but no hope of success.
