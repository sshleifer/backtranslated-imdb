Although the production and Jerry Jameson's direction is concrete improvement, "Airport '77" is not much better than "Airport 1975": smooth, commercial waste is being immersed (this time literally) a decent cast. Jack Lemmon is the pilot of a packaged aircraft being hijacked by art thieves and crashing into the ocean (all publicity claimed it was near the Bermuda Triangle, but there is no mention of it in the movie itself). When the rescue ships come out of the water to travel the plane, we see all their cranes falling (rather blindly) into the sea, and it's hard not to laugh (imagining the cranes connecting the plane, the passengers and the water running script). NBC used to fly, which appeared to be the "director's cut," with at least one hour of extra footage - mostly flashbacks - injected into the case with all the underground of a "Gilligan's Island" episode. The most exciting moment is the plane crash, and some of the players have some fun: Lee Grant is an unpleasant drunk, Brenda Vaccaro, a no-nonsense stewardess, Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland flirting old. Nevertheless, the personality conflicts and the monstrous military details eventually tear in patience. ** from ****
