I suppose this movie is relevant today because it was an early Sofia Loren movie. She was 19 years old when the film was made in 1953. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because I wanted to see some of Sofia's early work. I was surprised when she came to the camera when she had her skin bronzed in brown makeup to look like an Ethiopian princess. Surely today it would have been considered a slur and avoided in film making. It was actually annoying to see Mrs. Loren in skin color painting throughout the film. Yes, this movie would have been better made if the real opera singers had made this movie. Then the true and actual facial movements of the real artists would have been evident. I discuss the other parties' comments on whether the right opera singers are older and heavier. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as Mrs Loren was 19 years old and still is today, the movie would have been better received even though it was performed on stage. After all, we don't see beautiful young people on stage with "old opera singers" back stage singing behind the curtain! Don't discount the success of using heavy-duty opera singers. You can only refer to the most artistically produced TV commercial for J. G. Wentworth Company with opera singers on stage who professionally praise the company's product. This is one of the best and entertaining TV commercials produced to date. <br /> <br /> The quality of the film also prints this production of somewhat lesser quality. The color ink has faded a lot and it can't help. <br /> <br /> To improve this movie on DVD, the production company needs to add English-language subtitles so we who don't speak Italian can know what the lyrics are saying. It would help the story and learn more than the narrator to give 30 seconds of introduction to the scenes. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie because of Aida's story or the fact that this is an opera. Apart from Mrs Sofia Loren, none of her contributors is known or remembered by this author. Instead, watch this movie if you are a fan of Mrs Loren and want to see her aged 19 - no matter what the production is. <br /> <br /> Larry from Illinois
