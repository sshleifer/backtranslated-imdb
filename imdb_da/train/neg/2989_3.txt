Although the likelihood that someone is focusing on THIS comment among the other 80+ for this movie is low, I feel I should say something about this. I am not the kind of film guards who emphasize production value, thought-provoking dialogue or brilliant acting and governance. However, I argue that this movie sucks. I don't know why I don't like it ... I think it has almost everything I want out of a horror movie: blood, violence, accidental humor, etc. According to these evidence, it should be my favorite. Still, Zombi 3 is a baaad movie. <br /> <br /> There are just too many things that force you to shout at the screen. Like when the girl leaves the army guy when their car breaks down to find water (this spoils nothing, so don't worry). She goes into what I see as an abandoned hotel or something. Didn't she see that there was a friggin 'lake in the middle of ?? the building ??? Yes she is looking for water and passing a lake. Why? Cuz she wants to know why the people (who are not there cuz the place is left) will not answer her when she calls, "Is there anyone there?" Oh this is just a tiny little piece of the big picture I paint. <br /> <br /> There is a reason why I gave this movie more than 1 star. It's one of those movies where if you forget how bad it really is, as I have a couple of times, you'll want to see it again because it's just so top-notch in every aspect. I called it blood in the first paragraph, but this movie has no blood, it has a sea of ​​gore. It also has pretty strange creatures in it: a zombie baby (with a hand in adult size ???) and a magical flying head to name just two. <br /> <br /> You know when you're trying to think of the worst and cheesiest movies ever made and you come up with '50's sci-fi movie? I think Zombi 3 and movies like it should top them. It has all the elements: scientists argue with the government, warnings of the apocalypse on the radio, armies fighting monsters and so on. This is the plan of 9 in the 80s! While I won't say this is a waste of money if you want to buy it, just expect the worst. And when you find that expecting the worst underestimates Zombi 3, it won't be that bad. You really like it, I'm not saying it's impossible. <br /> <br /> Don't think I hate this movie, I don't ... really. Oh, P.S. Killing Birds (aka Zombie 5) Rules! (Have I just blown my credibility?)
