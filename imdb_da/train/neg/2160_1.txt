God ... where to start. I could only stomach about the first 10 minutes before I knocked it off in disgust. Apart from the actor who played Robin Hood himself, the rest was just awful. And I can only stretch my suspension of disbelief until now. <br /> <br /> From the very opening of the first episode I lost count of how many bugs, plot holes and horrible costumes were. It started with some poor peasants trying to hunt for a deer to feed their family. All good and good. The poor inks, however, must have been most deaf, because a handful of soldiers in full armor of horses could sneak at him within about 10 feet. <br /> <br /> As he ran away, he goes from having them 10 meters behind him to a shot where you can't see them at all, immediately followed by those about 20 feet behind him again. Then he runs into some bushes and is handled immediately by two of the soldiers ... just a few seconds before, galloping in horseback, dozens of feet behind him. <br /> <br /> The "armor" of the soldiers is so painfully clear cloth that they tried to look like maille and failed failed. Not to mention, lead soldier "armor" is about 5 sizes too big for the poor guy. Seriously, he looks like he's a little child wearing his father's oversized armor! Finally, Robin manages to shoot about 5, perfectly targeted shots around a soldier's hand, in about 2 seconds, from what appears to be a recurve bow. No people alive could make those kind of shots in the short time with a scoped rifle, much less a bow. After that, they come out of the soldiers and stop helping an incredibly well-dressed and clean "peasant" dig a ditch ... something that all nobles were willing to do all the time, right? How this excuse excuse for a series that has ever been given another season is beyond me. The production cost (at least for what I saw) must have risen by dozens of dollars (or euros) ... Seriously - I think a high school drama class could have made a better performance. It was so bad that the terrible Kevin Costner version of Robin Hood was better. I highly recommend that you skip this monstrosity and rent or buy the 80's "Robin of Sherwood" series. Much better written, acted, costumed and produced. <br /> <br /> For shame, the BBC ... for shame ...
