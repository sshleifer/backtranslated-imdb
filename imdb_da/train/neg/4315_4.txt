The only good thing about this year's ceremony was the winners. <br /> <br /> Although the ceremony itself was rather short, it was still somewhat boring. I think it's serious time to look for a new director and producers for the show, who can come up with something completely new. It is quite obvious that they tried to make the show more hip and appealing to a younger audience this year by letting Beyonce perform and let P. Diddy and Prince present a category. Also, letting Chris Rock be the presenter was an attempt to resume the ceremony and make it more appealing. None of it really worked. <br /> <br /> Well, Chris Rock is a fun guy, but he wasn't really a good presenter. I really saw him as a guy who just spoke the meantime of the different categories. His presence was not as great as Billy Crystal. <br /> <br /> Also, the awards were pretty stupid at times. Not letting everyone get to the stage but also handing out some of the prices in the middle of the theater was quite weird. <br /> <br /> Still, I can't remember being more satisfied with the prize winners. None of the films really swept away the prices that the last few years had always been. It also means that it had been a good year for movies with lots of competitive participants? I do not think. I think most of the movies are largely forgotten for 20 years from now, with the exception of "Million Dollar Baby" and "The Passion of Christ" perhaps. Of course, I do not agree with every prize awarded this year, for example Caleb Deschanel should have won for best filmography, not that I do not like Robert Richardson's work, he did really great work for most of Oliver Stone's work , but I really feel that Deschanel deserved the price more. I would also have liked to see Jim Miller and Paul Rubell win for best editing and John Debney for best music. But well, it's no way that the Academy Awards can satisfy everyone of course, I understand. There will always be people who complain about the winners. It was also fun to see that most of the prize winners were much more nervous than the nominees and winners. Did Prince say any of the nominated names right away? And where is Sean Penn's sense of humor? Al Pacino and Jeremy "I hope they missed". Irons were the best presenters of the night. Overall a very forgettable show but with good winners. <br /> <br /> 4/10
