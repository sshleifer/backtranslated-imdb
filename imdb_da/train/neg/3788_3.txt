There is a lot to like here. The actors are first-rate and the manuscript provides a good dialogue that best captures the mood of a highly knit, sympathetic family. For that reason, the film doesn't speak right. We see Leo, who apparently just learned about his HIV positive diagnosis, reacts essentially in a way that does not match the supportive atmosphere he finds himself. So well, the film ends somewhat steeply to avoid what Leo, his brother, and the rest of this close family should have dealt with in the light of their love for him. The young actor who plays Leo's brother Marcel is impressive, as it is generally the rest of the cast. Unfortunately, one could not decide whether one wanted an insightful thesis on the HIV effects on a functional, appealing family, or what the destruction HIV is on the victim - so it is only an expression of both. While this movie provides food for thought, the viewer leaves much more than it delivers.
