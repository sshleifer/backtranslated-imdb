Sean, you know, I think you're definitely the greatest actor in the world, but I can't praise you for that. Comedy is just not your strong move. <br /> <br /> But that wasn't your fault. Some of the things were just too hard to understand. Alfred Lynch did a decent job, but you have to wonder where the lines came from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Once again, Sean ... I apologize.
