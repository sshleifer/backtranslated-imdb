My husband and I are the parents of an autistic little boy living in the same township as the movie writer of this movie. We were very concerned that the JCC is bringing this movie to its Jewish film festival because of the way that the mentally handicapped character Frankie is portrayed. We went to watch this movie at the local theater when it came out. We demanded money back. We would urge the writer to donate some of the funds to the JCC Achad program to apologize. <br /> <br /> We didn't like to see Frankie - a mentally handicapped and maybe even autistic teenager - as part of a joke in which he continues to drop something to look at the nanny's breasts. There was no point on Frankie's character other than saying "hi, being mentally handicapped is fun." Challenges like Frankie's are a serious matter. Families like mine are really suffering. The writer author must explain himself. Does she know families with disabled children? Does she see the families with disabled children every week in the JCC pool?
