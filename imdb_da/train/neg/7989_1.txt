I had high expectations for "My beautiful laundry", "Bend it as Beckham" and (less) "East is East". The stories of British Asians that fit into their adopted home have had many great runs on the big screen, as well as a number of excellent television and radio shows (Goodness Gracious Me, etc.). This falls flat. Despite a good start, it quickly went down the hill. In the end, this was a horrible typical BBC effort, complete with strong regional accents, whacky overbearing characters, a "they were the days" soundtrack and lots of "trouble" in an attempt to be worthy. <br /> <br /> I was in many points in this movie. Scripture is predictable. Every possible clich√© was pulled out and aired. In fact, I have trouble thinking of any intercultural / transgenerational entities that could have been used that were not. The characters were thin and clumsy: the eccentric non-conformist minister; the well-meaning but ultimately racist old woman; the indulgent aunt; the pushy Indian parents; working class neighbor; the 'wise' deep granny motorcycle knight thug. The scripture was weak, with every chance of shocking the audience with overtly racist dialogue from the two dimensioned racist white characters taken. And why it had to be put in the 70s (except for having an excuse for a 70s soundtrack) is a mystery. Maybe the incredible character makes a little more credible for people born after 1979. I don't know. Although these things were present, good acting could have led to respectable ambiguity. Instead, the usual "BBC comedy" suspects were rolled out to him. "Bend it as Beckham" had much better comic book (and seriously acting) than this with an almost unknown cast. In summary, a lazy clipped script, over acted in a dull predictable story. Give it a miss. <br /> <br />
