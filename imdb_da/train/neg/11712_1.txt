The only reason I remember this movie is because it was (and still is) the biggest waste of time and money ever spent. I was 17 and my friend was 18. We were age when action movies were our thing to enjoy the most (ok 2nd most). We went out to feel so offended we wanted our money back, but time could never recover. <br /> <br /> Editing is what killed this movie. When the truck is attacked by more and more vehicles with rocket launchers, the movie is completely offended by the public's intelligence by having these rogues in 4x4 VW Bugs shooting rockets in the truck. Please, rockets on a truck known to be transporting plutonium? What's worse is that these VW's are able to get 15-18 shots out of a 4 rocket launcher. You would look at VW with 4 rockets fire 2 of them, cut around the truck with the last connected, came back a second later with two rockets attached, fire another, then go in front of the truck and now it is all set back with 4 rockets . <br /> <br /> We knocked it out and hoped for a great finish that had never happened. It seems they just run out of money and stopped. <br /> <br /> Just ridiculous.
