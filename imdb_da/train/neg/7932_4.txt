Oh dear! What a disappointment. I have been looking at old western on British television for decades and I was not aware of this until it showed yesterday - most other Scott Westerns come around every few years or so and are usually worth seeing again. <br /> <br /> The rich colors and outdoor sets were good, but that's all I can say about this movie. I agree with most other negative comments already made. Several times I felt like quitting it, and finally I halfway through something I almost never do. <br /> <br /> Scott seemed unusually oily in the charming girls, his two sidekicks were annoying and it was also Mexican bandit let. And I have a feeling that the army uniforms were 20 years or so too modern, not that this has bothered decision makers from many other vests. Maybe it got better in the second half, but I couldn't be bothered to wait and see.
