Me and a group of friends rent horrible videos to laugh at them, trust me, it has led to some horribly used money, but also some good laughs. ILL. is one of the better horror-but-funny movies we have rented. The reason is over-done, it all takes your friends into the woods and never comes back is very old. The magnificent part of the movie looks like you are visiting the local butcher's shop, except a little dirty and with blood on the toy looking meat. And if anyone has ever been afraid of this movie, they must stick to Cartoon Network for the rest of their lives, it's pathetic. The good aspect of the movie is that the two girls in it are reasonably warm, one better than the other, and you see them both naked under the film. The other good aspect is that this movie is so bad at times that you will laugh until you cry. I don't like to look terrible at acting or renting these horrible videos. I find it not fun, but seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and still coming out so bad is fun and worth renting. Without being too mature to laugh at someone else's downfalls I would recommend it. <br /> <br /> If you rent / buy it to laugh, I would give it a 8.5.
