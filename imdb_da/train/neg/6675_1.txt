This weekend went right by, I saw "28 weeks later", which was very good. Then I looked at this movie. <br /> <br /> I've told you it's one of the most boring so-called horrors you could ever see. The scenes were unrealistic, there was no script and no plot. The alien creature was unreal. And fight scenes mildly compared to a school yard fight. And to make matters worse, the guy named Cody had an uncontrollable, loose, dirty tongue that distracts attention from the main movie. <br /> <br /> Forget this movie; rather go and see 28 weeks later. <br /> <br /> Bowl, Mesake C.
