Okay, I first saw this movie as at 9:00 on Cinemax a few weeks ago and thought it would be award winning, boy was I 180d on it. This movie brought the big one. I mean, the monsters mother only shows her true form at the end of the movie. I go "That's it? Why doesn't she show it a little earlier in the movie." The foundation is the mother and son's party on the young women's blood. Wouldn't it be better if they just went ahead, you know a killing spree killing like a couple of young women each, then the sheriff or a policeman has to find out and get into the old find a way to kill the monsters, save the young woman / women and have 1 or 2 more people killed in the process? I think it would be a hell of a lot better that way. It also sucks because the son is the protagonist and he is killed first. Why not get rid of the mother first? Plus, how does she have the strength at the end of the movie when she starts killing people? She said she herself was too weak. What was wrong with Stephen this time? I can never ever act on any movie of any actor, after all, they try their best. If it wasn't too good, I'd have given this movie a 1/10. 10.3.
