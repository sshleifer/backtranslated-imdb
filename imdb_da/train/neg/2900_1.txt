I have a 5 minute rule (sometimes I leave leway for 10). If a movie is not good for the first 5 or 10 minutes, it will not improve. I have not yet experienced any films that have been shown to dispute this theory. Dan in Real Life is absolutely no exception. I looked at this turkey and thought; wow, it's not funny, not touching, not sad, and I don't like any of the characters at all. <br /> <br /> The story of a counseling colonist / widow who raises three young daughters who fall in love with his brother's boyfriend. I suppose the tagline would be "consulting columnist who could use advice"? I do not know. Dance character in no way beat me as someone qualified to give advice. I think that's the irony? I do not know. He goes to see his parents, brothers, sisters and their children in a form of marital retreat that seems very sweet and potentially for good comedy, story lines ... no one ever arises. The central story is basically how he loves this woman but can't have her. Anyone with a pulse will realize that he will eventually get her, but you must suffer through painfully unfunny, trite, lifetime film dialogue and "killer of love" to get to the inevitable happy end. <br /> <br /> This is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
