Bingo is the game, bullshit is the name. Rarely has the screen been rendered with such a blow-up of semi-baked conspiracy theories, puritanical beginners and beginner gibberish. Most of the story is set on Viciente, a resort in Cristian in the Peruvian jungle. Think Tolkien's Rivendell meets Star Trek's Planet Baku, inhabited by dimwitted followers of a not so mysterious but surprisingly narrow cult of love and peace. Thanks to horrific acting and sticky production design (the rainbow-colored visualization of the mysterious all-healing "energy" is particularly annoying), "Celestine Prophecies" looks and feels like a discarded 1980's "Twilight Zone" episode. Actual errors regarding church history and nomenclature are abundant. I can't believe Hector Elizondo agreed to be part of this. Perhaps it was made without his consent, Bowfinger style. May the Lord be merciful director, writer, writer of the novel and the poor souls who see the movie or read the book.
