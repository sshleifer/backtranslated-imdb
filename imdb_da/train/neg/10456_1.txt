I would give this a negative review if I could. I went into this movie not expecting much, but I had an open mind. It's all stupid! The snakes are, of course, fake, and the first two things they bite are a breast and a guy johnson. Oh, how original; If I was a 12 year old boy, I could laugh. I have no idea how this movie became so popular. Seriously the worst I have ever seen. I wasn't entertained, it wasn't fun, I didn't even bored! I was nothing. It wasn't that bad, it was good, it's just bad. Ridiculous indeed. Don't waste your money on this movie. Don't even rent this movie. No idea how it gets such a high rating.
