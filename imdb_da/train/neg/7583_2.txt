David Lee's worst movie. Even 'as we serve' was not as bad as this. Usually a movie with a really good reputation like this, at least some redeeming qualities, makes you understand why it can be considered a classic. But after seeing this, I just couldn't get why this piece of shit was very long back in 1945! I did not like the acting, rigid superlative British way, history, script (which can be quite witty at times but totally unfunny) and soundtrack. The Elvira character is supposed to be prolonged and attractive, but was actually ugly and had a strange and annoying voice. Just another movie that has convinced me not to trust a movie's reputation. Another very overrated 'British classic'.
