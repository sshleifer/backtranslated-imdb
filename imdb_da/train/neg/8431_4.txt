Although the actors do a convincing job of playing the losers who mated across the screen, it was not possible to identify those characters by seeing me just 20 minutes in the movie (and more than once after that). Plot development is incoherent and slow, the primary person's verbal diarrhea is almost inadequate, the basal quality of most character acts and the cavalier way they treat is annoying. <br /> <br /> It is typical of Ventura Pons to make crass psychologically handicapped characters. However, this faux sociological analysis is a big step down from CARICIAS or Caresses, where the characters mistreat and despise each other for well-founded reasons playing out during that movie. In the AMOR IDIOTA, we are forced to follow meanderings of a truly subnormal intelligence as he stalks a severely depressed and detached woman. It is allegedly due to his own depression, but the script does not support it. I don't want to give away the rest of the story just if there are any masochists out there? Is he healed through his obsession or is the woman shocked by his own depression through his insignificant attention? Although I saw it all, I was not made to break myself for a moment about any of them. <br /> <br /> If you can sit through all this prejudice, ignorance, fraud, poor dialogue, flimsy philosophy, etc ?? the camera work was pretty good and seems to be something inspired by the DOGMA group. The makeup also seemed to aim to show these players in a raw and greedy light, as it is the worst I have seen Cayetana Guillen Cuervo in any of her films (while she is personally attractive). <br /> <br /> I suppose, if the idea is that we should be forced to see the lower layer of society, so we can be grateful we are not in it, then Pons has reached its goal. The burst of almost identical sex scenes was a real waste of film (if the actors had been filmed, but once in blue-green clothing, the background behind them could have been changed in the special effects studio for a pittance). True, I heard much of the male audience crooked at their seats below this, but an objective view shows that it was not the right goal for those scenes. <br /> <br /> Save yourself and see something else.
