"Washington Square" is a flat, shabby adaptation of the short novel by Henry James. In fact, the novel is very good, but far from the level of James' masterpieces. In addition, the simple, unlimited history seems unfit to make it a movie (although William Wyler with his "The Heiress" gave 1949 a beautiful version of the novel). <br /> <br /> Yet, the film completely rejects the spirit of this work by the great American author. In her novel, Catherine is shy, not very attractive and clumsy, but she is a sound, intelligent young woman, and she is not as naive as it may seem. Her affiliation with her father is worthy and respectful, without bad sides in it. On three quarters of the movie, Catherine (Jennifer Jason Leigh) just seems to be mentally retarded, bad thing. In the last quarter, she suddenly (and incredibly) becomes intelligent, conscious of her dignity as a woman and all that. The director Agnieszka Holland has added two vulgar scenes to the story. The first, when the nervous child Catherine is well, problems with her vesica. The second scene when we look at the background is a kind of outdoor table where prostitutes take their customers behind tents and so on. Nothing could be more contrary to Henry James' spirit and artistic ideals. It is notorious that the author was extremely decent and even devastated the standards of Victorian age. I defy anyone to find any gravity anywhere in the thousands of pages of James's great literary production. I was really very annoyed by these two scenes. Yes, I know that a director needs fair freedom in the screen customization of a novel. But if an instructor completely ignores or misunderstands an author's art (here Henry James), I don't see the point of using his work to make a bad movie. <br /> <br /> The action is appropriate for the movie: poor and flat, despite the talent of Albert Finney and Maggie Smith. "Washington Square" is definitely a non-recommended movie.
