'The Curse of Frankenstein' is faithfully sticking to Mary Shelley's story for a word of the title, which would not be so bad if the changes were good. The tragedy of the creature that destroys Frankenstein's family has been completely carved out and replaced by ... nothing. The heart and moral center of history are gone. It does not help that this Frankenstein is an insidious, rude killer; He deserves everything he gets. The reason is basically a superficial checklist of the Frankenstein clich√©s. Even taken on its own terms, it's nonsense: a gentle, rambling movie with a shiny creature with a pudding bowl of haircut. Since it's the first of Hammer's horror movies, directed by Terence Fisher and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, its place in horror story is safe. But it's bad.
