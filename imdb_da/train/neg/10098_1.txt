Not worth video rental or time or occasional effort. <br /> <br /> * Makeup that a child can do. * Action was over ... poor conducting. * Editing was very choppy ... many things made no sense or just seemed free. * Sound was badly baptized. * Music was very inappropriate. * Casting was extremely off ... must have been on the crack. * Zombies that talk let alone ... run, dance, work ... just reject me. * And the bad guy ... Holy Crap! So terribly thrown as he was ... he was the best looking zombie of all. It doesn't say much. Cover Art was good, but much fraud ... just like the DVD's main menu ... great art and music. <br /> <br /> DON "T BOTHER!
