Alongside slasherfilm from the 1970s and 80s, they were about to die most probably the second most popular horror subgenre. While slasher movies had 'Black Christmas' and 'Halloween' to get it all started, zombie flicks had George Romero's 'Dead' movie. And surprisingly soon after his first two successes in the series, other directors wanted to redeem. Many Italian directors were particularly interested, such as Lucio Fulci, who brought us 'Zombie' a year after Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead', known as 'Zombi' in Italy and some other countries, and that was where Fulci's films became known as 'Zombi 2'. Apart from the wandering dead, it has no relation to Romero's films, but is a good movie in itself. It was a great success in Europe and 9 years later a successor was born. <br /> <br /> Benefits: Lots of beautiful, lush landscapes. Awesome score. The action is not exactly good, but the cast is games and seems to enjoy the experience. After a bit of a slow start, the pace moves like an action girl. Lots of cheese and accidental hilarity for bad movie lovers. Good work on the makeup effects. Lots of blood and a decent gore. Cons: Actual plot less. Nothing you haven't seen before. Blatantly rips off some things from the first few 'Return of the Living Dead' films. Cardboard signs. Don't have the age too good because of the bad 1980s rock music (Not that I say that all rock music in that period is bad), clothing and overall feelings of the movie. Final Thoughts: First of all, this is not a true successor to Fulci's cult classic. In fact, I don't know if it was ever supposed to pick up where that movie was off. For those who do not know, Fulci was ill during production and ended up leaving and was replaced by Bruno Mattei. Mattei's movie is pretty ridiculous, but like this movie, many good campy fun. And that's all this movie is really, just something to watch for fun. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5 (So bad it is good rating) 2/5 (Serious rating)
