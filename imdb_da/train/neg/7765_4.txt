Strangely, almost all reviewers are very positive about this movie. Is it because it is from 1975 and has Chamberlain and Curtis in it and therefore forgive the sometimes very bad plays and childish ways of telling? <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is because some people are becoming obsessive about this movie because they have read the book? (I haven't read the book, but I don't think it's a problem, movie producers never assume viewers have read the book). <br /> <br /> Or is it because I'm unknowingly annoyed that English-speaking actors are trying to behave like their French counterparts?
