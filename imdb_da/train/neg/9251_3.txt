This film, despite its "independent" status, is a stupid Hollywood version of a nauseating mother-daughter relationship. It wasn't that bad at first, but somewhere during the film - about the time when the daughter goes out with that guy, I think - it turns into an eastern mother-daughter bonding movie. I'm sorry, but I don't know about any mothers who have that kind of relationship with their daughter ... it's probably better that way.
