If you liked "Blair with" you would like this one. It has the same miserable camera work and soundtrack, and it has the same non-existent plot and exciting moments. It also has Tom Savini, so if you like Romero's "Dawn of the Dead" or Tarantino and Rodriguez "" From Foam to Dawn "you're in for a treat. He is an icon and a very good actor as well. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. This movie is definitely the nicest movie I've seen for a long time, and I've seen a lot of movies - also bad. I can tell you that I find most horror movies entertaining in some respect, but it was just a waste of time. The only reason I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 was the naked chickens and the hot action with all the sharp plastic teeth ... No, I'm just talking. I must have missed out before I hit "submit" on the poll form. <br /> <br /> Stay away even though it has sexy girls with teeth on the cover!
