Aside from acting by Meryl Streep, which is always for listing, I would avoid this movie because it has a dated "Movie of the Week" quality about it. But it is worth looking at whether you keep the many lessons in mind: How a couple stops media inspection and how the different are treated. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, the problem is the credibility of the various. The Australians are different from "us" (most of the rest of the world), so we (most of us) automatically come to it with an air of "inequality" about them. The couple involved is religious (different from most of the culture) and Adventists (different) on it. So their lifestyle and mindset are suspected at first. Dingos are different animals than other dogs, so again we face odd questions. The real story is how society (and the world) treat the different, those who have different accents, different beliefs than we do, and how we treat what they say as suspects. It's hard to hear the phrase "A dingo took my baby!" Without laughing and there are humorous posts unfortunately all over the web about it. But in the years that followed the story and the movie, it has been discovered (as you find in web searches) that much larger children have been stalked by dingos. Research by experts in dingos has shown that it was not only possible but most likely that the baby was taken by dinghies (perhaps a couple), extracted professionally from the clothes and eaten in moments without trace. <br /> <br /> But what is left is the question of why people defended the dingoes when they were found to risk children, rather than killing dingo to save the children, why because a woman's influence is so cold, she was guilty and over and over. <br /> <br /> Haunting questions, with or without the movie.
