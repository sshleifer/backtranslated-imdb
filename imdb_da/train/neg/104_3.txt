On the way to a small town far away from the beaten track (but suspiciously close to a highway), a female journalist runs into a strange hitchhiker who goes in to help lead her to her destination. The strange man then tells a couple of horrible stories associated with the area: in the first story, a hordes that kill the woman's man, but eventually suffers a far worse fate, even when they are attacked by a zombie; And in the second story, a group of campers have their holiday cut short when an undead outlaw takes a bias by having his grave dressed. <br /> <br /> Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by author Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes by making a zombie themed anthology ?? a good idea, but with only two stories, it falls tremendously short. And that's not the only way this low-budget gore-flick doesn't deliver: the actor is miserable (with Joe Haggerty as the narrative narrator Ebenezer Jackson giving one of the strangest beliefs I've ever seen); the sites are uninspired; the script is boring; there is a sex scene with zero nudity; and the end .... Well, that begs faith. To be fair, some of Syke's creative camera work is effective (although the gimmicky technique used as signs running through the woods is a bit over-exploited) and Joe Castro's cheapo gore is enthusiastic: an ear is bitten, the eyeballs are picked out, a face is removed, the brain is broken, and there is a messy beheading. These positives just make the movie bearable, but be warned, Zombie Chronicles is not a stroll in the park, even for experienced viewers of z-grade trash can. <br /> <br /> I give The Zombie Chronicles 2/10 but generously increase my rating to 3 as I couldn't see the movie in favor of 3D (though I have a stupid suspicion that an extra dimension doesn't would have made so much difference).
