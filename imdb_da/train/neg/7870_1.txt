The original "les visiteurs" were original, fun, interesting, balanced and almost perfect. LV2 must be a candidate for "worst first successor to a really good movie". In LV2 everyone continues to shout when a gag doesn't work first, it repeats another 5 times with some vague hope that it will eventually be fun. LV2 is a horrible parody of LV1, except of course that a parody must be inventive. If you loved LV1 just don't watch this movie then watch LV1 again !!
