One of those thanks-god-I-not-live-there documentaries. This tells of two warring factions in Colombia, guerrillas and paramilitary and the surrounding people in Medellin. <br /> <br /> Guns, drugs and death run rampant. The boys who are older than 22, not in the middle of fighting for a war are in prison. The girls ?? not women, girls ?? Always reacts the same way when one of them is killed, with tears and screams. You scratch your head what do they really expect? I don't know what is more worrying: the nocturnal shots and civil unrest, or that everyone just seems to be passively accepting things as it is. Or see that the boy drinks what is apparently not his first beer, is all 10? If you were to take these some of these young men out of their situation and place them somewhere where they could do more, be more how many would choose not to stay? <br /> <br /> Based on this documentary, I'm all scared.
