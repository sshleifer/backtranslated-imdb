this is the perfect example of something good that goes terribly bad ... why can i advise anyone to see it? well, i was kindly obliged that i was in the tiff competition (i still can't believe it won) .. and i was only until the end because the director was there for a q & a section .. but that was all else than interesting .. What is it about? Well the first half (worth seeing) presents three characters: a hooker, a musician and some kind of official. the first two lies about their profession .. but the third is the actual liar .. the other half (doing something else do not ruin a good evening) contains some old breasts and heavy drinks .. but maybe you will see it completely different ... tiff jury did (if they drink vodka?)
