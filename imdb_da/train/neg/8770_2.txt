This movie was the longest movie and the record breaking movie safe. It had 30 actors. After JAANI DUSHMAN (2002) I think no one had a hard time doing such a thing <br /> <br /> The movie that the title suggests is based on the Kargil war, but the problem is that there are too many characters and the romantic subplots and the songs in many characters are boring. Even there are too many cinematic freedoms like killing people with knives, wondering which soldier does it? <br /> <br /> Direction of JP Dutta pales in front of BORDER Music is okay <br /> <br /> Among the great cast Ajay Devgan stands tall, Saif is very good in his part and also that is his first movie with kareena, Abhishek is equal Manoj Bajpai has his moments Sanju is wasted, Suneil is okay Akshaye Khanna makes his part goodwill is passable Rani is good, Esha is okay rest is acceptable
