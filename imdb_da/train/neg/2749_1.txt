This movie was so badly written. The characters had no depth. They should never have made a movie of this. My 11 year old son could write a better script then Hyung-rae Shim. <br /> <br /> The only actor who didn't suck was zoological guard. He was the only fun and trustworthy one of the party. <br /> <br /> I love movies and try to give them the benefits of the doubt, but this one was up on my lame list at number 2. Number 1 being Demonicus. <br /> <br /> For those of you who actually thought it was a good movie, you have a serious need for brain surgery. <br /> <br /> Most of the creatures in the movie were just dragons ... so why did they call D-war?
