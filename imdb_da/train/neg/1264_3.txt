This movie does not have a horrible mass to do with the predecessor "Robot Jox". This must also be the reason why its most common name is "Robot Wars" and not the alternative name "Robot Jox 2: Robot Wars". "Robot Jox" was basically a fun movie to watch because it had a good premise on giant robots fighting each other in the near future. This concept has been abandoned to this film, and instead it has a completely dull story that is not very original or wise written either. A shame it tried to be so much different from its predecessor, otherwise it might have been a more fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> Like "Robot Jox", this is a B movie, but with a big difference it just isn't very good. Perhaps it also happens that "Robot Jox" was made during the 80s when B-movies still had some charm and class over it, even though the film was released in 1990. It really can't be said about this movie . It's just bad, badly made, poor-looking and not exciting enough. It also has an end that leaves you thinking 'This is it? That's all? '. <br /> <br /> What the movie is, its story is missing is really clear line really. Perhaps a good head villain had been a good idea and some other things as a real point on the story, some actions or similar protagonists. <br /> <br /> What were they thinking when they picked the actors for this movie. Everyone is simply not sympathetic in their roles, and especially Don Michael Paul is annoying as the protagonist, who behaves as if he is the gift of God to woman and Mr. Perfect that can compete with anyone. Were they not even able to get the actors from the first movie? <br /> <br /> For such a futuristic movie, with a concept of having great martial arts in it, this movie is probably missing its action. Had they put more and more into the film, the film would at least have been a more entertaining sight. Instead, we have a movie that does not impress in almost every possible way. <br /> <br /> You can better see an episode for Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, for some more actions and equality. <br /> 3/10
