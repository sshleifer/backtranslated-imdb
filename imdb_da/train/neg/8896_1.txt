I watched Brigadoon on television last night (September 12, 2009). I am 61 years old and have seen movies as long as I can remember. I can honestly say that Brigadoon stands alone as far and by far the worst movie I've ever seen. The centers were shameful. The local kids club would have produced better sets. The signs were so wood that they were probably dry rotten from the cartridges tears that had the accident seeing them. It is hoped that the stars of this film had hidden thick enough to protect them from the embarrassment they may have had to watch this movie. The owners of this tripe must perform a great service for humanity and destroy all copies of this movie.
