Okay, let me collect a new word here: Polyphobia: Fear of polyamorous relationships. This is yet another in a series of films that start by titling the audience on a kind of triangle, just to turn a crown on and go all the way on how it is oh so necessary and the only moral thing to find a monogamous solution. Only one person in a thousand understands the joy of being able to love more than one person, and this instructor is not one of them. Bleh. <br /> <br /> Mark My Words: A few decades from now, polyphobia will become as big a faux-pass as homophobia, but guess who was too close to realize this? Right the first time: the producers of this movie. And so many like it. Why make a ridiculously conservative and old-fashioned movie like this? Pride itself on being unlimitedly open-minded about gayness; Open your eyes, people, thank you! <br /> <br /> This is a disappointing, huge chicken. (But I must say that Heather Graham is the sweetest thing in life.) <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
