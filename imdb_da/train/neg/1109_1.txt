This is almost certainly the worst Western I have ever seen. History follows a formula that is particularly common for Western and martial arts films. Completely teaches that family / friends have been murdered so that the hero sets himself off for exact revenge, peoples the ineffective lawyer, saves the kidnapped girlfriend, and kills the expert arch-nemesis in a brutal duel. This formula has often been successful - otherwise it would not be a formula - but Gunfighter is the most sophomoric performance of what you will ever see. Scripture is terribly simply and insulting; It sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth, maturity and realism. The sound is bad; it is sometimes seen doubled. The kinematics are paralyzed and the sets are sometimes just facades. The action is pitiful; Certainly, some of the performing artists could blame the script but others cannot use that excuse. I hope I never see Chris Lybbert in a talking role ever again; Every time he says a line that should be angry or meaningful, he does no more than lower the timbre of the voice and he just sounds like a child trying to act macho. And about Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, check out his duds (if you dare to watch this movie): He wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like Roy Rogers than a hard-working, down and dirty cowboy. If you enjoy an inactive movie image that only serves to worship Hopalong Cassidy's imaginative grandeur, get it here, but if you have more than two neurons, see something else.
