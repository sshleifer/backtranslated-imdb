The sects utilizing this film are well known for their demand to take the bible message without any change or extra-biblical influence. The existence of this film is solely due to the fact that there is no such thing. <br /> <br /> If you want to know what Christendom's revived branch has had in the seventies, just look up the word 'rapture' in a dictionary of cultures and sects. It is faster than sitting through this celluloid waste. Poor performance, uneven sound quality and a script that could just as easily be written by Jack T Chick (paranoid Christian conspiracy theorist for those who are not familiar with the Gospel scene). You couldn't really put this into 'bad, it's good' category, so its only audience is either those with a pamphlet collection that looks like affiliates or the extremely paranoid.
