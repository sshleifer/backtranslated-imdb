I first heard about White Noise when I watched the TV ad. Before that, I didn't even know it existed. I saw the trailer online and decided that I would go see it. Now I'm a fan of movies like The Sixth Sense, I thought this movie would give me everything I wanted. It has Michael Keaton in it and he rocks. Unfortunately, the film did not deliver. It tried to be another sixth sense or touch of echoes and failed miserably. It has a very promising start, but the center just draws on repeating and ending with a very bad twist that any monkey could have figured out. Unfortunately, most "scary" movies today resemble loud sounds and bangs to get the audience jumping. This movie could have been so much more. It's a shame because it was a good idea.
