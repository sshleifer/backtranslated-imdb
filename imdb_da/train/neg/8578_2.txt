One of the silliest films from the 1940s, an unbearably haunted house comedy with music starring Kay Kyser. Kyer, the orchestra leader and radio star (and eternal college fraternity), was a kind of precursor to Spike Jones who hammered it up for his guests and relied on his joyful group of musicians. He is employed to play a birthday party in a gloomy mansion, the kind where poisonous animals imported from Africa are framed and hung on the wall. Shindig is obsessed with a grim judge, a scary professor, a vicious swami, lots of giggly females, and probably bad jokes to fill three Bob Hope pictures. The songs (by Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer) are nothing to brag about, nor is it convincing that Kyser sucks it up with elbow-in-rib material returning in 1940 back ten years. * from ****
