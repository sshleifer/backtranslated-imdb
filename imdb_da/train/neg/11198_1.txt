I shouldn't even review this movie as it is not actually a horror movie - and therefore not worth Dr. Cheese's attention. At least it's not horror in the usual sense. It is certainly a horrible suggestion to waste your time looking at this crap. That's why I switched it off after the first four hours. Imagine my surprise when the bell showed that only 45 minutes had passed. That's right In general, this film is b-o-r-i-n-g. <br /> <br /> The "order" had many mistakes, not all of them unique. It seems to me especially the biggest problem with the "religious" subgenre of horror films is Hollywood's unwillingness to engage Christianity on its own terms. It is quite possible to make really scary movies that are also orthodox. Just ask William Peter Blatty. In fact, without orthodoxy, movies like this are just something - going smorgasbord of the filmmakers' (usually boring and illogical) performances. <br /> <br /> Think about it. If someone made a movie apparently, says physics, but did not only get the basic laws of physics, but based the whole plot on its wrong images, you will soon get tired of the resulting meaningless plot. The same goes for these kinds of movies. In other words, the "Order" (and many similar films before it) invent all the cloth products about the Catholic Church and about the Christian faith and try to build a plot out of these inventions. It is surprising that the plot ends up being incoherent and stupid. This movie has the added charm of being as interesting to see as your toenails grow. <br /> <br /> Avoid this steaming pile.
