Everything in this movie is bad, the story, the play, the effects, but it's fun, fun, fun !!! Scott Valentine with the army uniform who are ten sizes too big is so bad with the permanent attempt to get a skin on his face as the leader of a special ops group is hilarious! '' The terrorists '' are as scary and realistic as the '' raptors '', it is so false and bad for everything you are trying to laugh. The part where the giant T-REX that somehow snails aboard a ship and then there is some way that has been blown up and you see the metal pole sticking up where the head was, is the perfect end. If you're in bad movies, it's the pot of gold, the mona lisa of the bb-bath !!!
