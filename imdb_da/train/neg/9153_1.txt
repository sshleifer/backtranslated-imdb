I never sent a review before, but I had to do it for this movie! This movie is so bad I tried to justify how bad it is by trying to think of it as kitsch or parody. But it is not. It is really, self-consciously poor. This is a serious experiment that whistles well. Other reviewers have pointed out the movie's many bugs so I'm not trying to repeat these, but I urge you to watch this movie. On the whole I was either speechless, literally gasping with disbelief or rolling on the floor in hysteria. I haven't had so much fun watching movies over the years. In fact, I will try to get all my friends to see it because it is the kind of movie to share. <br /> <br /> My favorite parts: - When Arthur auditions have gone -You boy (his dance is incredible) - The free nudity (the director / the leading actor just got a naked shot) - The priest's office with his cardboard and crayon surrender of Christ - Of course, the famous wedding scene with the palms and the forgotten rings (which narrative feature does this play ?!) - The former wife's wrestling match with Ben for possession of his gun - The detailed order in which Arthur kills the sermon he apparently burns him with this incredibly fragile fight - yes, the gay religious fanatic brother with his bleached hair and WeHo mode - And my favorite, the use of Joplin's "The Entertainer" as the opening sound and Pachebel's Canon in the D Major "like that final soundtrack! - the list goes on and on - one must see !!!
