Words cannot simply describe how terrible this movie is. I watched it on video last night, and I simply couldn't believe what I saw. Basically, "Snake Theater" is about a former military man (Lorenzo Lamas) and his quest for his kidnapped sister who has been imprisoned by Rednecks style. The movie's performance, writing, direction, photography and editing are regrettable along with a song called "Soldier", which must be one of the worst theme songs of any time! <br /> <br /> However, there is a therapist. "Horshack" (Ron Pallio) from "Welcome Back Carter" is in the movie that plays a ridiculously bad guy. Otherwise, avoid this mess in ALL COSTS.
