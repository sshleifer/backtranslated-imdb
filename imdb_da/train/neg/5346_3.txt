I had to watch this movie because the plot was so scandalous and the movie lived up to expectations. In fact, sometimes it makes quite uncomfortable to see. Unlike other Meyer films, the sexual antics are at a minimum. Some of the scenes of violence are unnecessarily free and offensive. The reason is chaotic, and some of the actors and lines are terrible. <br /> <br /> The movie is a strange combination of sado-masochistic fantasy combined with a window of slavery's brutality and immorality and failing on all counts. It is as if Meyer tried to make up for the sexual exploitation / blackploitation by having a higher moral message. Meyer knows that we feel a little guilty of being turned on by the blatant dominatrix connotations of the early stage showing Lady Susan wearing a whip in a provocative outfit. He then tries to return to the righteous way by making it a movie about the triumph of good over evil. But because they interrupt each other, you do not end up with anything. In fact, because it is so bad in many ways, it is worth seeing if you appreciate the art of making a horrible movie in the worst case possible taste. Maybe because it's so bad we almost let Meyer get away with it unacceptably.
