This movie is a pure failure. I'm a Steve Martin fan, but even he can't save the tired idea and Swiss cheese script. Think "Police Academy 7" and use it for a military parade. Yuck. I DO NOT feel the other user comments reflected in the poor rating this movie received (and rightfully deserved!). It is extremely misleading. I have often seen this movie marked down to $ 3.00 in the grocery store and now I know for sure why. <br /> <br /> If I could only get my 90 minutes back ...
