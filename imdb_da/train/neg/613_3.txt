Wow, what can I say about this movie? It's a miserable piece of crap. I'm surprised it was classified as high as it did. What's wrong with this movie? Here's a better question: What's wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> The story itself is just shed and clich√©. Here is pretty much what it is about ... Some kind of geeky kids without friends are picked up, killed and come back as a scarecrow for revenge. "Everything" of it is wrapped in 86 minutes of worthless movie. If you haven't seen this movie, don't waste your time watching it. The other one is not much better either, so don't look it either. I classified this movie a three, because I liked the birdwatching outfit, not because there was something good about the movie. I think you get the picture.
