I'm not sure this is a spoiler; Maybe it's a public service. If you are one of those people who focus on instant gratification that skips end credits, you will miss the final line of the final credit newsletter consultant's voice-over, which states that the US has just been surrendered to Nazi Germany on May 7 1945 to end the Second World War. Here are just a few of the problems with this dense: 1) The older viewer should evoke the equivalent of two or three more UNHOLY films in their eyes to fill the gaping gap between film events and this astonishing conclusion. <br /> <br /> 2) The average person will really kick himself that they do not "see" one of these UNHOLY fill-in-the-blanks flicks created in their own head for free, instead of shelling out time and money to see this UNHOLY from the video store (or on cable). <br /> <br /> 3) This final circle sequence of imagined news bulletins may be the first information some younger viewers are exposed to World War II, leading them to the conclusion that George W. Bush is the latest heir to the Nazi zone .
