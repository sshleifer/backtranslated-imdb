It could have been a wonderful story based on the old breed of cat people, but it wasn't. <br /> <br /> This work could have been just that; wonderful and filled with mythological references that kept my fascination burning. The main characters (Charles Brady played by Brian Krause, and his mother Mary, played by Alice Krige) were made low, had no depth of personality and were hardly sympathetic or drawn. Not even MÃ¤dchen Amick (who played Tanya Robertson )'s character fits into that description. <br /> <br /> But as I have said many times before, when customizing a Stephen King novel for television, you simply have to take into account the fact that his books are not written for television and his manuscript talent is missing unfortunately the fire and depth he exhibits as a novelist. <br /> <br /> This is another smashed attempt to take Stephen King's magic magic, whether it's his novels or an original manuscript. To cut and paste his work on the small screen. His novels are completely bastardized in the process, and everything you end up creating is a good movie; nothing less but certainly no more. His screenshots are hit and miss. Unfortunately, this manuscript was a miss translation. <br /> <br /> Sorry, sorry, sorry movie. <br /> <br /> This movie gets 1.0 / 10 from ... <br /> <br />.
