This movie is very important because I suggested this consideration: sometimes you may want to be sick ... sometimes you may want to get syndrome ... sometimes you can, for example. Wish you Goldfield's syndrome ... that way I can't remember this boring movie ... and above all you wouldn't remember Adam "superfluos" Sandler ... sometimes you just wish ... have hired another movie ... <br /> <br /> My vote? 3 out of 10. My suggestion? If you are neither a fan of boring romantic comedies nor Adam Sandler (... it is a joke, Adam Sandler's fan does not exist ... I hope so), save yourself ... Someone to save? Drew Barrymore. ... maybe.
