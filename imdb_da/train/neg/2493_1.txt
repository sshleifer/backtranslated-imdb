A really horrible movie. I didn't know at first that this was a kiwi effort - but very soon I began to realize that all the characters spoke with hardly disguised kiwi accents under the fake American. Why should it be necessary to set up America? - It could have been tuned in NZ and then the actors could have used their normal voices. Surely someone in the production team could hear the terrible attempts to talk to American accents? A bad bad movie. I'm surprised it's been a long time - how did it get out of the can? It just seemed like a very bad attempt at a Segal / Willis type of action man flick.A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! If there were any taxable money in this piece of waste, I would lead a revolution to get all the money back in the treasury. I'm still reeling (get it? Word game, reeling!) At the absolute garbage I've just seen. Why did I continue to see? Well, I'm a movie fanatic and can't help myself!
