This film of secret state-of-the-art experiments and corrupt use of the citizens by secretive and eerie shady characters had the potential to be a truly interesting movie. But for me it failed. I will not elaborate much on the rather confusing plot line, but if you are looking for a detailed explanation, the comment from the user's "reluctant popstar" gives a good description of it. <br /> <br /> But it didn't work for me. I found it slow, which would be okay, but for the fact that it seemed to go nowhere. The viewer stands in the dark for too many things to really be able to get a handle on this movie - in some films you can claim that the filmmakers intended to provoke thoughts and abandoned things that were ambiguous for that reason. I don't think this is the case here. <br /> <br /> As for the frequent long shots of two buildings often mentioned by other users ... I see that they have a point-they give the viewer time to get another drink without missing any of the "actions". And I suppose many viewers would offer the opportunity to get more drinks on board to get through this.
