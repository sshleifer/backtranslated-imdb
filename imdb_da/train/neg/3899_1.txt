Where do I start? As per the title of this film, I expected some degree of authenticity, eventually I was let down failed. This is not the story of Lale Andersen or the song Lili Marlene, but it's rather a Hollywood (or retrieve your movie hub) story based on some real characters. I should have had a little clue when I heard a heavy English accent giving intro to the movie in German; the blood-red text (title, artists) should have been the second part. The story is constructed (Lale was not fooled by Switzerland's Rolf Liebermann's parents, there is no information that Liebermann helped smuggle Jews from Germany, the original song had been recorded outside the control of the NS regime, but not under control played at the station was picked up in Vienna, while an Lt was there on vacation etc.) the costumes are bad and wrong for the time frames (SS black uniforms are each used from border guards to employee positions, they went away from daily use when the war started, etc. ), the characters are stereotypes (SA bullies in a club when they were primarily out of service). Do not waste your time.
