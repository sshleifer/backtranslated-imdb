The fraudulent cover, title and very little hidden print of the Power of Prayer tricked me into hiring this movie. It started really well and pulled me in. I really liked it. Between 1/3 and 3/4 of that, the movie began to throw in things that were not created and had no meaning. My first thought was, "This is not written by anyone who knows how to tell a story." I ended up revising parts of the movie and thought I had missed something. <br /> <br /> When I reached the last 1/5 of the movie, it was all to live, annoying, RELIGION THUMPING DIALOG that had no meaning, said nothing, and was annoying to listen to; I turned off the sound and made a quick move to the end. Don't waste your time with this flick. Watch out for DVDs labeled Whitlow Film and Level Path Productions. <br /> <br /> And I'm a practicing Catholic.
