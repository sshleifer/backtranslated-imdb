This is just a horrible 'comedy' - it's really a bad movie. There are no fun items. No jokes that are funny. I do not know how some people can claim this gloomy short film could be 'smartest' or 'quality'. Perhaps if it is the only movie that a person has seen you, you can do it to the brothers. but I've seen thousands of better movies: leonard part six (now it's fun)! I don't know how the brothers themselves are considered eligible to be listed on the internet movie database: it's more like a home video than a real movie. Shots aside, just skip this movie. A root canal is more enjoyable for this cliche-ridden unfunny material.
