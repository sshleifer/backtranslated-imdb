A bickering, American family, vacation in the west, discovers a strange ghost town in the middle of the desert. Little do they know that this ghost town was once a test site for nuclear bombs, and a deadly presence stalks them. I generally love mystery-horror movies like this one. "Cube", Spielberg's "Duel" and "The Birds" are all good examples of movies that do not provide answers, but still leave us fascinating and want more. Apparently, "Disappearance" author / director Walter Klenhard tried to do just that kind of movie, and if he succeeded, he succeeded or not. Personally, I think he has come halfway there, so the movie just picks up. <br /> <br /> The actors are all just "ho-hum". Their not very bad, but we as the audience never feel their fears and react to situations in unrealistic ways. Are any other souls of characters just going out to investigate strange sounds?!?!? Give them at least some kind of reason to do it!?!?!? <br /> <br /> For television films, it's an above average fair for sure. Director Klenhard Shall be praised for really milking the desert environment for all that is offered, and some of the setting was striking. There is a really cool scene where two characters find an old nuclear test base, where the sand was completely melted into glass as far as the eye could see. I wonder if it was right ?? <br /> <br /> No one to talk about and "creatures"? Or what ever hell is that after these people? Never appear, not to mention what we never even get a proper clue about what they are (Mutants, aliens, ghosts or old evil Indian spirits? Oh, it really slaps it for us!) Or where they come from. <br /> <br /> There are also many clich√©s here. Why is it that the townspeople in these kinds of movies are always real, really stupid? Why is there always an old guy that everyone seems to be crazy, turns out to be correct? Why? Why? Why? How is a new scenario, people! <br /> <br /> "Disappearance" is trying to be different and intelligent, but ultimately it fails that in many ways it is familiar to us fans of direct-to-video horror foot. Hi, I've seen much worse movies, and the disappearance is not bad, it's just for ?? Average. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
