If you are the kind of person who can get a kick out of a very bad movie, I highly recommend this. If you are not, stay away. This is an amazingly pictorial movie, and sometimes you wonder if it's not just a prank that someone pulls on you. The most positive comment I can make about this is that those responsible seemed to realize that it was super-low budget nonsense, so there is at least a sense of fun here. <br /> <br /> But it's as amateurish as it gets. Their idea of ​​giant killer mushrooms is simply fire covered with beige colored plates with what looks like the rubbish bin can cover upside down. Of course, it's not supposed to be taken seriously (at least), but even with this disclaimer you find yourself shaking your head on the amazing cheesiness of it all. Or laugh out loud as I did.
