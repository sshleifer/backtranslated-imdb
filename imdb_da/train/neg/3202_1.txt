If you ever hear these three words being said to you ... "Joe Don Baker", be afraid ... Final Justice is the low budget action movie based on a sheriff in a Texas city called Geronimo (pronounced Heronimo) . He is a nasty, slimy, rude person in search of a criminal in Malta who killed his partner in Texas. His partner actually beats twice in the movie. Very poor editing. Joe Don Baker (Geronimo) ends up in prison as 4 or 5 times in this movie, so the plot does not go fast. Plus, he shoots everyone as if he's in the wild west. I guess no one told him it was the 20th century. A woman's case is assigned to show him around Malta (which looks like Seinfeld's Elaine), and she is the only one who can do with redneck. She must be crazy! <br /> <br /> The strippers in the bar are the most entertaining characters in this movie. Their dance is shown throughout the movie and I began to tie up with the shabby women. Well, at least it was better than seeing Geronimo try to stumble on something. The finish is flawless and somewhat predictable, and I was glad it was finally over. You will never forget the last line of Joe Don Baker from the movie. <br /> <br /> It's so hard to imagine how he was in three Bond movies ... very strange! Anyway, if you're laughing, look at MST3K sometime. Also, I've heard his other bad movie (among many), "Mitchell" MST3K version being released on DVD by Rhino. I can't wait to see it!
