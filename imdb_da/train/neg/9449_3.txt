Dr. Seuss would surely be sad now if he lived. Cat in the Hat shows that film productions can take a classic story and make it a mindless pile of goop. We have Mike Myers as the infamous cat in the hat, big mistake! Myers proves he can't trade in this movie. He seems like a prissy show girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve. The kids in this movie are okay, somewhere between the lines of boring and annoying. The story is like the original with a few tweaks and like most movies based on other stories, never adapting the original story! Bringing in the evil neighbor Quin was a bad idea. He is a stupid villain who never comes anywhere in life. This movie is like a rejected newspaper from the newspaper if you think about it. The movie is safe, looks tacky! Sure there are fun adult jokes, like the cat cuts in the tail and the censor, before he says a bold word, mildly fun. At least Grinch had spunk, and the movie was actually good! This movie is a cartoon-like piece of snot with bright colors and poor mediocre action. Was Mike Myers himself in this movie actually? And another thing, the fish. What about the stupid fish! The first time you see him, he's an actual fish. The next time you see him, he's all animated and talking. But he looks like an animated piece of rubber dust! This movie is a total off target wreck. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! I'm surprised it even had good jokes like the water park trip joke, it was good. So thank you if you have the choice, see Grinch instead of this mess.
