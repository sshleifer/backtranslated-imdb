Don't try to see this horrible mini-series. It is a six hour drilling, an incredibly beloved triangle of three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other. There is no heat in this story, no true passion, no real romance. It is dry, dull, pulled out and uninspired as they come. And it doesn't even meet the expected level of technical skill. Take the six hours in your life and use them for something more worthwhile.
