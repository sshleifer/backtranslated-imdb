Ummm, please forgive me, but missing more than half of the characters? In the original novel, Valjean is a man imprisoned for 19 years to steal a loaf of bread and then try to escape several times. He breaks the slogan and is persecuted relentlessly by the police visitor Javert. Along the way there are many signs that were not in this version. Some worth mentioning would be Fantine, Cosette, M & Mme. Thenardier, Eponine, Marius, Gavroche and Enjolras. The only character with the same name is Javert. I was confused and frustrated all over the movie and tried to see how it was in any way associated with Victor Hugo's epic novel.
