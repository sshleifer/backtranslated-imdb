What is the purpose of creating successors who have no relevance to the original movie? No point. That's why the Prom Night sequels are so embarrassingly bad. The original film included a group of children who hide a dark secret, which eventually gets them all killed, carried one in a brutal revenge. Can anyone please explain to me what a dead prom queen should rise from the tomb to the steel crown has to do with the first movie then? Prom Night 2 had continuous plot holes that left the audience constantly wondering what happened and why should it happen? But in the end I think you could call it one of the movies that is so bad you end up laughing yourself through it.
