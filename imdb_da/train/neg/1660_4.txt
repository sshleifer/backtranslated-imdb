EXTREMITIES <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> Audio Format: Mono <br /> <br /> A woman turns the tables on a wild rapist when mounting an attack in her home and is forced to decide whether to kill him or inform the police, in which case he could be released and attack her again. Exploitation fans who may expect another rough 'n' clear rape fantasy similar to the WOMEN'S DAY (1978) will almost certainly be disappointed with EXTREMITIES. Farrah Fawcett's character is truly exposed to two unpleasantly long-standing attacks before getting the upper hand on his attacker (an appropriate slimy James Russo), but scriptwriter William Mastrosimone and director Robert M. Young only take these unpleasant scenes so far before revealing the dilemma who informs the moral core of this production. Would their final solution stop in court? Perhaps ... Based on a scene play that reportedly left his actors battered and broken after each performance, the film makes no attempt to open the story and instead rely on a limited attitude to the main action. Acing and technical credits are fine, although Fawcett is too poor a performance will not play effectively for viewers who may trust her to give up their anger.
