I haven't seen any slate this movie yet, and I think I can be the first one. It was awful. In fact, I didn't see the end of it. It was like seeing a dull soap or a really good one (all soaps are crap). The actors were poor and the story was bad. The person who has rated it 10/10 has no idea what he is about. Scripture was horrible. 2 People were in an angry conversation with threats, and you expect the good guy to say something really good and beat crap out of him, but no. He says "If you do that ... I'll hurt you" Hahahahaha. If comedy is your thing, look away. Please do not watch this movie because ... It is CRAP !!! <br /> <br /> Summary: Bad plays, bad games, bad scripts. <br /> <br /> Don't look! Of course it is in my opinion.
