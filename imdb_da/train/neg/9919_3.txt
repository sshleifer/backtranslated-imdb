In the opening scene of "Malta Story", A. Guinness bore such an amazing resemblance to Noel Coward that I fully expected his first words to be "Some women need to beat regularly - like gongs" or such a world - bon mot. Unfortunately, his dialogue is hardly deadly prose, and even the master would have had trouble bringing it to life. Foreign Guinness walks through the picture as if looking for a contact point and failing to find one. And there is the fatal weakness throughout the film. Sir. J.Hawkins also gets up early and ends up giving a Jack Hawkins performance without an odd individuality. It could have been spliced ​​from any of a dozen British war movies. Many of the early fifties are accustomed to arise and make their skitick for very small purposes. Luftwaffe failed to bomb Malta for submission in the same way as failed to bring London to its knees. The courage of Maltese courage against incessant danger was recognized by the king and the island was awarded to George Cross.A. worthy subject you might believe in a movie, but "Malta Story" does not even qualify for the term "worthy" in its most patronizing sense. It gives the appearance of being quickly paved together to meet a deadline, perhaps before the actors lost will live
