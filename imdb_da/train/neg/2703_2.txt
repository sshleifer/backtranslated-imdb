MINOR SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> I sat just late watching this movie, first and foremost because I enjoyed and rated some of the Singlet's earlier work as "Boyz n hood". However, I must say that this was a big disappointment, and that is all I hate about confidential, clich√©, so-called "message" movies. <br /> <br /> The action is mostly poor (pop stars and models do not necessarily make good actors ... notes), situations that are hard to swallow (rape victim is overnight lesbian? ... thank you), but worst of all, it reinforces every screwed stereotype you can think of. In the second half of the movie it has become a comic book as in its characterization, which makes you lose any kind of empathy you might have had for its one-dimensional players. <br /> <br /> Not once is there a valid point about the inherent causes of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. As a result, it merely ceases to be the sensationalization of the results of these problems. That is, the message is contradictory, giving a sense of confusion and a general lack of plot. As for the conclusion of the film, I found it predictable, embarrassing, exploitative and mildly offensive. For a movie called "Higher Learning", I have to say everything I learned is to avoid seeing this ever again. <br /> <br /> If you want a true comment on some of the themes that this movie totally fails to elaborate then you should hire "American History X" .... unless you just watched Tyra Banks, So go rent a life.
