People who actually liked Problem Child (1990) need to have their head examined. Who would take the idea of ​​seeing a malicious little boy ruin others and consider it fun? The movie is not fun, ever in any way, beginning to end. It will be a cartoon, but the authors do not realize that slapstick is not fun when people are attacked by bears or hit by baseball bats. It can be fun in cartoons, but not in a movie picture. The film's young hero is Junior (Michael Oliver), who, since he was a baby, has been placed on the foster parents' front door for adoption. The families reject him because Junior tends to give them a hard time. <br /> <br /> He is then thrown into an orphanage where he terrorizes the nuns and writes penpals to the convicted Bow-Tie Killer Michael Richards). He is soon adopted by Ben and Flo Healy (the late John Ritter and his wife Amy Yasbeck) who die to get a child to be like any other parent in their neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Junior becomes a member of Healy's household, and "Little" Ben is interested in him, despite the fact that he destroys a camping trip by luring a bear on the spot or throwing a cat on his father "Big "Ben Jack Warden", a bigoted politician. <br /> <br /> I think we should take care of Junior so we can mess with him when he claims to be human. His new mother, Flo, is a bitch, his grandfather is quite selfish, and a little girl - who despises adoptive children - is such a spoiled brat. But what Junior does to get the last laugh is not fun - it's bad, cruel and sometimes life-threatening. <br /> <br /> And what is the movie's message? That children should solve problems of violence and vandalism? That they should seek friendship by writing to convicted murderers? They certainly don't make it a bad child. Junior is not one - he's just a sadistic, little check. There was a time when it was bad for children to look up to others. Now everyone laughs when Junior beats children with a baseball bat. It's a shame that this film has been marketed as a "family comedy". What's worse is that Problem Child is rated PG. What was the MPAA mindset when they saw this? There are many ghosts and ghosts here that can speculate on the division between PG and PG-13. <br /> <br /> The kids will enjoy this, but parents will be shocked at what is pictured on the screen. And for most, Problem Child will be considered a "guilty pleasure" classic; a movie that someone will shamefully admit to wanting, even though the ruling opinion, as evidenced by more serious viewers, is that the film is a piece of shit.
