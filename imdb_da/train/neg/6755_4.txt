Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a mentally unstable young woman with a troubled past who gets more than she negotiated when she goes to a pool party with a nice colleague. When her date and friends say they belong to a `Murder Club ', Maddy takes it seriously and moves right up to' Level 3 'by basing in a woman's brains in a parking lot (for denting his car! ). But is Maddy also the one who gives a plastic mask and kills other members of the group or has another lost it? <br /> <br /> The reason for this movie (originally titled MAKE 'EM BLEED) is very poorly conceived, full of holes and spirals completely out of control before a ridiculous, exterior left-handed end. Some of the dialogue is quite scary. I had no problem with Rochon's performance, but the supportive throw was horrible. But I managed to sit through this Full Moon release thoroughly entertained. There is plenty of skin and blood and it is the perfect type of flick to sit with a group of your friends and pick apart. Horror fans can also enjoy cameos from Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman (as Debbie's parents) and Julie Strain (an early victim). <br /> <br /> Score: 4 out of 10
