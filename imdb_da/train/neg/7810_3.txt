Against All Hope is a very badly made, sometimes painful, movie. This is Michael Madsen's first film, and it shows that he is not so good at it. Some people may find the story ridiculous; An alcoholic realizes that his life and family fall apart so he calls a preacher as a last resort for help. Having told the sermon of his story, he accepts Jesus Christ in his heart. <br /> <br /> In fact, I found many of the religious scenes that, when Cecil Moe (Madsen) goes to a church but walks away from it, is quite realistic. I also liked how Cecil knows his life is breaking down and trying to get help, but only understands that God can help him. In the end, he realizes with God's help that he can go through life without drinking again. <br /> <br /> This movie is not well made at all. The action is bad, the script could use some work and look worse than my home videos, but it has a good message. Just because you become a Christian does not mean that you can automatically stop an addiction or cure your broken family, and Cecil realizes this and works hard to keep track. Overall, if your Christian wants to appreciate how this film portrays Christianity, and if you are not, you may find yourself called to find out more about the faith.
