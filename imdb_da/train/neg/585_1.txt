The original film, Man From Snowy River, is one of the best I've seen, almost perfect. A lady and pedaling story in two senses - rich girl / poor boy and abilities vs bloodline. The sequel, however, is not only a shameless attempt to exploit the original but also a ridiculous, overblown Disneyfied root summarized best as "Rambo Meets the Black Stallion." Without the charm of The Black Stallion. The young man comes back from a 3 year absence, and suddenly he is Superman on horseback; In the original, good movie, he was genuine and credible, but unfortunately reduced to a caricature in the sequel. I have hardly been so disappointed in a movie, and at times it made me somewhat angry - they lacked almost no clich√©. Brazen audience manipulation - do studio heads think that all you have to do with a horse-loving audience is set beautiful horses in front of them to make them happy? A mess in a movie.
