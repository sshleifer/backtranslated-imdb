I thought these movies were a letdown I expected to be so much better than it was. I'm so glad I didn't pay to watch this movie and I didn't sit in a movie theater for this movie. Where to start on this movie, the play in this movie was average, humor was horrible, and just the overall story of this movie was not special. I thought this movie was supposed to be great, but it was no more than a cheesy waste of time. I think the actor in this movie was horrible, none of the actors in this movie had chemistry, it just wasn't there. I think if we had another actor, playing Kirk than Jay Baruchel, it could have been better, but all the time I watched this movie he looked high and I didn't get the feeling that he didn't appear in this movie. Now Alice Eve did a good job as an actress, but there was no chemistry between her and Jay. All the actors in this movie were no names and had very little influence in this movie. The mood of this movie was not fun at all, there were a few lines in this movie that were OK but nothing worth saying to your friends that they would understand. I think Jim Field Smith was having a hard time doing this because he couldn't decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy. I honestly think he should stick to the Burger King commercials. I think this movie could have been better if the authors had been to another director. The story of this movie is like any other hot girl, just OK, dear love story? Boring I think it would have been better if it had more originality, but what a letdown nothing. I honestly would not recommend anyone go see this movie. I think you would have more entertainment at the dentist than in this movie. Then save yourself the pain and just don't see it.
