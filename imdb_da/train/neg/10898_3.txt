If you like to comment on movies, where the manuscript comes halfway through the movie, then it is here. An attitude and acting like a porn movie, but nothing happens that only pits and touches the third kind. That actually gets very boring after 45 minutes of touchy feely but no action. A few of the actors I have seen in true x-rated movies and their performance were much better. All the special effects are made by the great "Rondo", who performs all the magic in his opinion. A cult movie is written on the box. Does this mean that this movie shouldn't be seen at all ??? <br /> <br /> Get drunk with some friends and watch this movie on New Year's Eve thanks.
