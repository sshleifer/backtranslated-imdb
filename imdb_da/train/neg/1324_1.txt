"The Second Coming of Suzanne" is yet another of the surrealistic films trying to cross as highly sophisticated, but all it does is put the viewer to sleep. Like other films of this type, there is limited dialogue. Everyone is much more interested in the visual aesthetics of the image. However, cinematography sucks so there is nothing to watch for. <br /> <br /> The video box says this movie is "one of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen on film." Yes sure. It is right up there to see such stimulating events as a bucket of ice melting or a turtle walking a mile. 1.10
