When my wife and I decided to watch this movie, we thought it couldn't fail. I love Billy Crystal, my wife loves Julia Roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it. <br /> <br /> We were misled in spades. I felt Billy on my side, Billy Krystal's character was extremely one-dimensional and did very little for the movie. Sure, he broke a couple of good jokes, but as a sign he did nothing but take a seat. <br/> <br /> And bad Julia Roberts. In previous shows she plays well as a strong will, self-determined lady. In this flick she seems completely oppressed and had very little fire. This is not Julia Roberts who my wife enjoys seeing. OK, if I were to find a good thing, it should be Christopher Walken. Now it's entertainment. But like Billy Crystal, there's almost nothing about his character. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a night of thoughtless laughs with very little redeeming value, take it. But if you're looking for a smart, romantic comedy, it's not your movie. It is none of the above.
