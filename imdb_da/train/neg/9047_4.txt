This movie forever left an impression on me. I saw it as a freshman in high school and was alone at home that night. I think I lost all respect for Robert Reed as an actor, there had been a big fan of "Brady Bunch". I also thought Chuck Connor's role was terrible and evil. However, this film made such an impact on me that I am now volunteering in the woman's state prison by doing Bible studies and church services and trying to change women's lives one at a time. What fascinates me is that so few people actually saw this movie. None of my friends watched it, and my family is clueless to this day when I discuss this movie because they didn't see it.
