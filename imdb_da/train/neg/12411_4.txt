There were many really good horror movies produced in the 70s - but this film is certainly not one of them! It's a shame. The kids are no better as it works from a decent idea that takes a couple of sometimes successful horror themes. We have the idea of ​​a devoted child who worked so well in classic movies like The Bad Seed, and then we have the central zombie theme, which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie. The reason is basically this: The young girl blames a lot of people for her mother's death, so she goes to the cemetery and raises the dead to avenge herself (as you do). It's all good and good, except for the fact that it's boring! There's nothing happening for most of the movie, and even though it does come up with something nice at the end; It is not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it. The film was apparently shot on a budget, as the sites look cheap and all the actors are bad. There really is not much I can say about the movie as there is not much to it. The child is a gloomy seventies horror flick, and I certainly do not recommend it.
