"Horrible People" should be the subtitle of this horrible movie. If you want to see ordinary people doing common things, look out of your real life window. But if you want to see unpleasant people doing boring things, see this horrible movie by Mike Leigh. The characters speak slowly, but are in fact never able to communicate with each other. Why not? Probably because Leigh stuff that we are all as ineffective and pathetic as his actors and he wants to film real life. But we are not, and he failed.
