Somewhere inside this movie is a half hour episode from The Twilight Zone trying to get out. While cube was tight, well-made, claustrophobic and mind-set, I am afraid that Cypher is a soft, dull rebuilding of several well-developed themes that just don't give up much, especially if you have almost seen any other half-way decent sci-fi -film before. <br /> <br /> Cypher manages to pull all the way through its relatively short 95 minutes straight to the incompetent finish. None of the characters sparkle, and for a movie made in 2002, the technology is really cheesy. It is difficult to connect this tired and uninspired movie with the director of the Cube. It's not a bad movie, but it's certainly not a good movie. Once you've seen the grass grow and paint dry and get bored with your stick insects, you see all these movies, but the other activities are likely to be more stimulating.
