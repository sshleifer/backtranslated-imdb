You don't have to write a script for this broken scandal! You sit right back and see a couple of moonlight women, and guests pay homage to each other before an uneasy audience's exposure to "The Jerry Show"! Violent and unpleasant, this deposit on the real Jerry Springer program reveals everything the over-rated hyped talk show doesn't show you in the air - unless you have a collection of uncensored videos made by the "police" producers. Even the foreign world of Springerland reveals the most amateur play of the decade! This shows you that THE GONG SHOW MOVIE had a central character in a movie turkey. Change channel!
