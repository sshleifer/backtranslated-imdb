Just think, it cost a total of $ 250,000 to make "Clerks". How the hell did they cost $ 45 million to make this glorious music video? An almost unknown cast, two or three sets, no special effects that I could see ... I know it must have been used on the professionally crafted, economical, thrilling manuscript. Shoot, the bar set must have cost a bundle. In any case, I think Jerry Bruckheimer would not be caught dead, producing something for less. I'm just surprised he didn't blow anything. Anyway, it wasn't a horrible movie I guess. The female managers seemed to have good chemistry and the soundtrack was ok. IMO It just seems a pity that this pretty mediocre project could have been made for $ 5 million without loss for production, and there could also be made 6 more $ 5 million dollar indy films of profit.
