This is the worst show I've seen this year. I think it should be taken by T.V. because of its retardedness. It's so stupid that I can feel weak when I see it. (although I never see it because it's SOOOOO poor) <br /> <br /> Goofs: When mac says he can; Don't eat sugar, in another episode he eats sugar. Almost everything in the world has sugar in it !!! In episode "Eddie Monster" when eddy screams on Terrance falls into the box twice PLUS the seconed time he falls in, he does not fall in, he falls to the side. What stupidity. I can't even say the word Fosters Home. I even made a song with my band about how retarded this show is. Byyyyyyyyeeeee
