OK me and a friend rented this a few days ago because we like to keep track of b-movies as we do them ourselves. Still, the cover contained blood and strange looking naked girls with fangs and stuff ... and Tom Savini! There is just no way this movie can fail! Right? wrong!! It just seems like such a waste! There was really no story, the dialogue was awful (is there there? X 1000 !!!), the characters were .. yes, they really lacked any kind of personality ... The effects were terrible .. and what about those long artificial shots of scared people running around doing nothing .. with extreme close-ups of eyes and things? We sat the whole movie waiting for something ... something to happen ... but no "oh here comes the nymphs! Good! Oh ... they kiss ... again ... and now for the violence ... OK ... there nothing happens ... again ... oh, now they run around ... and the eyes in the vicinity ... again ... oh, heres tom savini! oh ... he died ... right ... okay , maybe something is cold or even interesting that will happen .. no! Oh! Cold! A cut off head! The end ... Oh shit .. "And finally, since I'm so full of myself .. I want to tell you here! Give me a van, six actors, a strange looking house, Tom Savini, a couple of naked girls with fangs and buckets of blood, and I could make the coolest movie you've ever seen ... I've made movies with zero budget in two days who has better effects, better acting and a better script than this ... what does this Johannes guy do? It's cool to make cool movies! It could have been so good ... I'm really sorry !!
