Ugh, what can I say other than, ugh. I rented this movie because it was labeled as a successor to the original vampires. This movie could not have been a lame. Not only lacking in plot, but the play is terrible. Combined with some obvious plot holes, this movie makes for a very difficult to see. Many times I asked my own beauty by continuing to watch the movie long after the plot had skipped the shark. Here's a slice of the camera range ... <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Professional "Slayer" insists on sleeping outdoors by itself at night. He wakes up to a woman crying and sitting no more than 3 feet from him in the middle of heaven. He immediately goes to comfort her without questioning her sudden appearance. She goes from crying to seducing him, and he lets it do with clear results ... One of the main characters is Zoe, was bitten by a vampire, but as long as she takes these "experimental pills" she got in Mexico City, she It's fine, even though her body temperature is below room temperature ... Worth outside the monastery, where hero is getting up at night, being killed by vampires, the hero leaves the next day. Then he returns one day later to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after leaving ... <br /> <br /> ... avoid this movie.
