I think war movies should try to convey the terror of war, avoid idealism and respect some rudimentary military principles. Zvezda hardly makes the first one. Zvezda was a Russian war film, I was expecting patriotism, sentimentality, beautiful poetic images, a lush score, Slavic cheekbones and cruel Germans. What I didn't need was the naive love without affair, the unrealistic stupid war images and the abuse of the syrup soundtrack in a movie that carefully avoided all historical or political references (Stalinism, Nazism, Holocaust) yet insulting to our feelings of history endnote about "liberating Poland". A missed opportunity as a movie, but not as propaganda apparently.
