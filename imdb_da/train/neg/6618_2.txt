OVERALL PERFORMANCE: - Finally, the long waiting AAG hits screens. Unfortunately, it could not put progressive fire in the audience. The first best thing to talk about the movie is the idea of ​​remake the mighty SHOLAY. And Varma made a good choice of changing the overall background of the film. If he repeated the same Ramghad background, people will say again that there is nothing new in this. Different backgrounds are appreciated, but the way he presented them is not worthy. Right from the start of his career with SIVA in Telugu he had used the same lighting and kind of background. I seriously think that this guy, Varma, is thinking about lighting or not, or maybe he has no lighting technique other than gordon willis GODFATHER. It's all NETHERLANDS ENGLISH ENGLISH. Why would some body use so many Dutch angles and extreme closeup images !!!!!!! Shots division is lame. Characters can't bear a feeling, notions are not to their character, narration is worse, the background is really really awful. <br /> <br /> Babban: - Amitabhz has been over priority for her job. VARMA produced great villains such as Bikumatre, Bhavtakur Das, Mallik Bhai, but this time failed to cut out the very highest signs in Hindi Cinema. There is no comparison between Gabbar and Babban. Babban is a more psycho than a villain, but he still has a soft corner for his brother (it's a gift in this movie). Amitabhz's performance is not for his brand. His appearance itself is pathetic. The scar on the nose symbolizes forgotten villains of black and white cinema. What they have ever been working on Babban has not succeeded. Babban is no comparison with Gabbar. <br /> <br /> Narsimha: - The first best thing about this character is not to excite the audience about their hands. If hot did, it would be like teaching ABCD to a bachelor's degree. That's good, he opened the secret early. But the feedback is pathetic. Varma couldn't use a big actor as mohanlal for his brand. <br /> <br /> Durga: - The only sign of improvement. This character has been improved with satisfactory changes and was used according to history. <br /> <br /> Heroo, Raj, Ghunguroo: - No body is annoying or at least considering this character. The movie's full failure starts when the director could not work on the close friendship between our hero. These characters carry nothing to this movie. <br /> <br /> RAMGOPALVARMA: - His quality is degrading, diminishing. AAG can be completely treated as a C grade film. Sholay is a vengeance, a city problem, which means for true friendship and highly valued irritation and fun at Dharmendra. AAG has never had feelings with its signs. The storytelling is too weak that it could not make the audience feel sympathetic to the characters. Don't compare AAG with sholay, but you won't like it. <br /> <br /> If you dare see this movie. You will be burned alive in RAMGOPAL VARMA KI AAG
