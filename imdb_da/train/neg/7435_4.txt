This movie (along with Rinne) are smaller gems among the retread homage images that have gone for horror movies so far on the 8FTDF "HorrorFest." And yes, it is weak praise indeed. Because there is not much worse in movie judgment than would be autographs who believe the atmosphere is a substitute for a coherent plot. <br /> <br /> And that's all you get with The Abandoned. This is a film that was made almost exclusively in the director's head. Sure, it would have been good if he had transferred it to movies, but it happened instead. It is a very nice movie with a couple of real scarecrows, but the last wheel is strictly for the latent lapping cynical crowd.
