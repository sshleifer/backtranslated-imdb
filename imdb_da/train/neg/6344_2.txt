Well, I'm blown, a Woody Allen movie that I went out after half an hour (I'm aware of the moral fragility of commenting on a movie I've seen less than half, but I hope you understand why). Basically, it became clear very early that we should be condescending from the screen with: a script that devises its image as with bullet points; a casting that all tried to be the sign of Hannah and her sisters (with the exception of Chloe Sevigny), and was ill-prepared to do so; and a camera that was talkative, just because there was nothing to film, but chat and the actor delivered it. Drama? None; It is partly told, but the action does nothing to develop a dramatic situation. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I went too early in this case, but then I had decided half and a half hours -liner-Allen clones. Scripture has its fun moments ?? I almost went to the back of Will Ferrell's excerpt in the trailer (trailer-hooked again, doh!) ?? But there is little pace to let them fly nonchalantly as it is best. Worse than this, there is no fluidity. Saying this movie's tree makes a forest look like a jelly: the open caf√©-bound discussion is the most modest case-in point. The only thing to do with numbers is the pot's review? 10.2.
