I scared all the way through this movie. First of all, the idiotic plot has a bit to do with Parson's own story. Hollywood has been trying to create a kind of comedy car chase movie. Imagine "Englebert Sings Hendrix". <br /> <br /> Don't worry about this movie to be precise. The name Parsons in the title and steal of his body is just used as a stepping stone to a low budget chase movie, an obvious attempt to grab some bucks from Parson's legacy and his fan base. Gram's father long ago died in 1973, the other global signs are fictional, none of which has anything to do with Gram's life or death. <br /> <br /> If you are a Gram fan, I advise you not to watch this movie. I wish I didn't. It is sad to see something specially treated as such a disgusting feed. I would swear I could hear Gram turning in his grave while the movie was playing. If you are not familiar with Gram's life and heritage, do not take anything in this movie as representative of Gram. <br /> <br /> I can't say enough bad things about this movie. If Gram was alive and saw this movie, he would kill himself. Then again, maybe he would be afraid that if he knew that this movie would result.
