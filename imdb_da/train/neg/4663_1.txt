This movie was really bad. I love war movies and can usually get away from most movies and find something I liked, but it wasn't one of them. This film lacked substance and intensity. I get it, the veneers put a hell of a fight and that's good, but the story is badly told. You have no real connection with any of the characters and there are no real stories to follow. You just go from one random scene to another that is not flowing to form the story that is trying to be conveyed. If you want a war movie that keeps you riveted and surprisingly without fighting scenes, then I suggest "Downfall" (Second World War German Film). Or if you prefer a great story and a lot of action then I would suggest "Brotherhood of War" (Korean war / Korean film). These two movies will not let you down as a winter war will.
