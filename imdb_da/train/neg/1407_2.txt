After life is a miracle, I didn't expect much. It's hard to believe that these movies were made by the same man as Do You Remember Dolly Bell, for example. Zavet is two hours of stupid antics without history. Underground's wild and outrageous humor seems to be degenerate into pathetic buffoonery here. It seems that Kusturica has been steadily downhill since he started making life-conscious comedies, starting with the Black Cat, White Cat, which I thought was great, but already had some disturbing signs of dementia. I liked his early films so much, and so it is especially disappointing to see something like this. Let us hope that his next will be great.
