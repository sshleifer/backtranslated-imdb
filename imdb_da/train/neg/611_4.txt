Okay, "enjoy" is a pretty proportionate expression, but flexibility is okay when you are dealing with a filmmaker of the James Glickenhaus caliber. <br /> <br /> McBain is really one of the most ridiculous, over-the-top action movies I've ever seen, without the unpleasant edge of The Exterminator. Other reviews have commented on a suspension of disbelief regarding the film's heroic interim commands, but what about making a movie in the Philippines set in Colombia? All extras are Filipino. In fact, the only sign that looks distant is Hispanic, well by Victor Argo as the very damaged 'El Presidente'! Oh yes, we also have Maria Conchita Alonso overemoting as crazy as rebel leader. There are tons of explosions and organs flying all over this entertaining paean to the glory of the American imperialism.
