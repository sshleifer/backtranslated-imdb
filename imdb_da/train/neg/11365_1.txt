This is a very sad movie. Really. Nothing happens in this movie. The script is bad !!! I suppose they just copied-paste the first 15 pages to 90 pages. The producers must have thought let's make a Hollywood movie here in Belgium. They did not succeed. Now in the third week it only runs in Antwerp and Brussels at. 22h45 or something. Previously, we have had really good movies in Belgium, like Daens. Shades are a waste of your time. Maybe you can sneak into the theater after you've seen a real movie. If you've seen 10 minute shades, you've seen it all. It was advertised to death on local radio and television. I hope it will soon disappear in the news.
