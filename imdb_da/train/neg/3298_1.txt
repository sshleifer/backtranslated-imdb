When I heard that Hicks Dukes should be remade with current actors and a solid script, I was like, "Okay, I'll give it a try, it won't get any better than first, but we'll see what's happening." So what happened. I saw a big late 70's / 80's show, which was a classic that was basically humiliated by Hollywood. It is so sad to see that Hollywood screenwriters cannot make any original these days. They seem to take a good show that had a large audience and try to "REMAKE" the classic show. HEADS UP Hollywood ... IT'S NOT WORKIN !!!! Anyway, more about the show. I think they could have thrown a better actor than Sean William Scott (American Pie Stiffler) to play Bo. I'm sure John Schneider is totally disappointed with how his character was portrayed and exploited. Also, get for real, Johnny Knoxville, like Luke Duke. How low can you go ?? A crappy jackass actor to play loving Luke. This hurts me. I also want to give Jessica Simpson a beautiful woman, but her acting sucks. Catherine Bach, who played the original Daisy, was smart, sexy, strong, opinionated and a good IL's southern girl. She was all the little girls role model grow up! (I owned the doll and the jeep - thank you!) In any case, Jessica Simpson played a beautiful ass, 2-bit veil like Daisy Duke. Daisy was never blonde. Why should they throw her. Jessica Alba would have played a big Daisy Duke. She can speak with a big southern accent, and she is beautiful and would have done a wonderful job. Anyway, I'd like to say that this movie blew something violently. I want to be ripped off by paying $ 8.50 for tickets and they have to refund my money. If you like Dukes of Hazzard (the original series), you can't watch this movie. It will just disturb you. The CMT (country music tv) then plays all the time later in the night. Then put your TIVOs and go with the right thing, not the imitation on the big screen in Hollywood.
