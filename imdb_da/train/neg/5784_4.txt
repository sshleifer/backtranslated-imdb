I was almost not so beaten with this as many other reviewers. Well, it has a couple of lovely girls playing erotic, lesbian vampires. Marianne Morris and Anulka D. play these two lovely sirens with razor teeth that run up to cars on a way out of the way, hitch to their homes (at dusk) and invite their prey ... sex-starved men to their boudoir. What happens ... well, when they knock them off and kiss each other most, they kill their visitors. Director Jose Ramon Larraz has some glimpses of his camera. Some scenes are pretty scary and effectively shot, but sex alone does not record a movie (no saying is calculated ... at least deliberately). There really isn't much history here. We have the two girls. We are shown an inexplicable and inexplicable beginning where we see them shot with gun. Why? What does it mean "Why do we have the guy who stays for several days, greet a guy in the hotel who insists he knows him from years ago? Does it have any purpose? Of course, I have even more general questions like one couple of nice girls who make as vampires on the English landscape and have a wine cellar filled with wine from the carpathians? literally) and then go to bed in the crypt.The end starts with some juicier scenes, but it is anti-climatic.As mentioned, there are some effective scenes by the director ... I liked how the girls dressed and filmed in The forest is also an impressive set, and both girls are as I said very nice. Marianne Morris especially distinguished - in more ways than an older movie fan, silent television veteran Bessie Love has a short cameo the movie s end.
