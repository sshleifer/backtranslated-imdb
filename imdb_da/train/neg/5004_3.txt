Wow it is ironic, as this movie has been out for a while, I think someone else has just reviewed it a few days ago. <br /> <br /> At least I watched this movie, simply because it has Nick Stahl, for the record. br /> <br /> The movie was ridiculous. The characters drove me INSANE, they were so Clich√© and STEREOTYPED. This movie had some of the worst dialogues I've ever heard. It had too many plot twists. <br /> <br /> There is a scene in the movie worth seeing, however, the scene: "Hot Heart, Cold Gun", where Nick Stahl kills the unpleasant girl in the shower. (Well, they were actually all unpleasant.) But his action in that scene was excellent. The look of his face reminded me of American Psycho (a good movie). The scene is worth seeing, but not worth seeing the rest of the movie, do yourself a favor and don't see it.
