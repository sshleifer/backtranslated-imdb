Oh dear, Jerry can be the undisputed king in talk show, but the movies are a completely different ball game and he is out of his league. The writing of this movie is so bad, it must be seen as belief, and it is boring to see such vaguely familiar actors as Michael Dudikoff (80's action, B'vovie King), Michael Jai White (last seen in the Sci Fi flop 锟 斤Wn Spawn ') and Surviving Games' William MacNamara (who is involved in the only half-fun situation throughout the movie!) Stoop this low for employment. If you're a fan of Jerry then stick to his TV show as this is a total waste of one and a half hours. After I finished sitting through this I managed to catch the last half hour of Rocky 5 on TV, which looked like a movie masterpiece in comparison, I think it says more than enough !!! <br /> <br />
