Yep .. This is definitely up there with some of the worst of the MSTIFI movies, but I've definitely seen worse. Think Gremlins rated R. Well, I met Rick Sloane on a sci-fi convention, it was great he lectured on! It was one of the really low budget conventions where everything goes, everyone brought something in (if you want to see shed, you should have seen what some friends and I took). <br /> <br /> He seemed like a very nice guy, he was very cool about my questions and comments to Hobgoblins, and he even didn't say to take it seriously and said he loved the MST3K version! All in all, Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. And I think it was supposed to be bad as Mars Attacks. So I suppose I stand up for this movie and give it a 5 and betray all my fellow human beings. Excuse the guys.
