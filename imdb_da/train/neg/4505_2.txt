Memoirs of a Geisha are a beautifully filmed movie, there is no doubt about it. And the play is generally excellent, at least as to how it portrays the characters as they are written. <br /> <br /> But so many details small and large are just _wrong_ that it just disturbs me too much to be able to fully enjoy it. A little detail that characterizes this kind of lack of sensitivity is a scene (no it doesn't destroy anything), where Mameha calls a bell hanging at the door of the house where Sayuri lives on a snowy winter day. The bell she is calling is a furein or wind bell - there is only left hanging outside houses in Japan in the summer! People in traditional Japanese homes did not have door bells - they just opened the door and announced themselves. (You may think this is such a trivial detail, but I would equate this to a movie made about America, where a Christmas wreath hangs on the door in July and no one thinks anything about it.) And doesn't even make me start totally wrong hairstyles given to maiko and geisha, who are vaguely pan-asian / chinese / kung-fu-ish, and nothing like real thing. I think this pretty cavalier attitude to the culture they are trying to portray really comes out in the attitudes and depictions of people and situations too. So I suppose the less you know about Japanese culture and the world of geisha and maiko in Kyoto (which is what "Miyako" is), then I assume the more you will enjoy this. I honestly think this movie could have been so much better ... as it is, it's just another Hollywood version of "exotic Japan".
