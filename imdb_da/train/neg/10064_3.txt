The pokemon movie was a horrible movie. Unlike the first one, it's not a good movie at all. the graphics were decent, but the story was flat and no real drama was built in it. in the first, the interaction between the characters was decent. The subtraction of the brock and the addition of tracey was poor. Tracey really doesn't have much to say or do, and unlike Brock, there is no comic relief. The only good thing is that you get to see the fog actually get jelous over the ashes, and her early brooding over being called his girlfriend was entertaining. Generally, this movie is not worth renting, and the short movie before didn't do anything for me or my wife. and we consider ourselves pokemon fans. hey, maybe the next will be better. Can't be much worse
