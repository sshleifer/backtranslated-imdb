I've seen enough of both Little Richard in interviews and in performances and plenty of poor Leon pigeonholed in these 50s / 60s musical bio pictures to know that Leon was not the right actor for this role. Leon was as real as David Ruffin in The Temptations, but completely failed to capture the essence of Little Richard in this movie. <br /> <br /> Actor Miguel Núñez, who played Little Richard in "Why Fall in Love?" was a much more suitable choice as he had pulled out the musician's powerful but lonely persona. <br /> <br /> If the performances are not convincing, the movie will be just as good. And this is what has happened here. Glossed over or completely missed are LR's forays for homosexuality and voyeurism. What "The Temptations" did well to catch the group's rise, warts and everything, this movie misses with a wide brand. What happens to CEO Robert Townsend, who started so well with "The Hollywood Shuffle"? He is a talented, funny guy, but has not delivered anything near the first effort.
