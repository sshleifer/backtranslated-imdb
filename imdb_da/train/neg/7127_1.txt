This movie was bad to say the least !!! The plethora of amazing cars is outraged to have been featured in this LAME movie. It starts with a race from L.A. to Las Vegas to be completed in 1HR 45min ... in a Ferrari F430. I did this in 1HR 50min in a small 4 cylinder 140HP 1993 Honda Accord. Seriously ... this movie doesn't do justice to these cars. Of course, these authors are just that and drive safely below the speed limit with their hands @ 10 & 2. I remember watching the news how Eddie Griffin crashed a $ 1.5 million Ferrari Enzo that went 30-40MPH >>> youtube.com / watch? v = cNVrMZX2kms <br /> <br /> And ... the director ANDY CHENG IS THE LARGEST SALES !!! He brings shame to his own race. I wonder how many people he orally would like to just break into Hollywood. He participated in a film depicting Asian Americans in such a negative and false way. Asian women >> cheap money grubbing whores. Asian men >> lose compulsive players and bullies who are beaten all the time. What dunk is all fear of Asians? Why the need to always portray them in such a negative connotation? I'm so sorry for the way Hollywood ALWAYS exposes Asians to such a negative and false Easter.
