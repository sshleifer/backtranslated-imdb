In the comic, Modesty is strong. Alexandra Staden, who plays Modesty Blaise, looks more like an anorectic fashion model. Neither does she have the morality or personality Modesty has in the comics. Modesty would never give a woman the advice to show more skin to make more money. I can't see any similarities with my comics with Modesty and this movie. Its like a mission impossible movie would be if Ethan Hunt locked in the Freedom Bureau in high school talking to the caretaker about when he went to high school and Hunt would have been played by DJ Qualls (in Road Trip). So if you're a Modesty fan, you can't see the movie, you just get angry. If you don't know much about the Modesty cartoons, just another movie, don't play your time with this. I can't understand how Quentin Tarantino can name it. I will request a refund on my DVD rental shop tomorrow.
