No wonder the historian Ian Kershaw, author of the groundbreaking Hitler biography, who was originally the scientific consultant for this television movie, differs from that. The film is historically just wrong. The errors start right away when Hitler's father Alois dies at home while he actually died in a pub. In the film, Hitler moves from Vienna to Munich in 1914, while in fact he moved to Munich in 1913. I could go on endlessly. Hitler's childhood and youth are depicted too briefly, making it quite difficult for historically uninformed people to understand the nature of this frustrated neurotic man. Important people from the party's time, as Hitler's dangerous friend Dietrich Eckart or the party "philosopher" Alfred Rosenberg lacks completely. The characterization of Ernst Hanfstaengl is very problematic. In the film he is portrayed as a noble character, almost despising Hitler. The manuscript apparently follows Hanfstaengl's own brilliance over views of himself, which he gave in his biography after the war. Hanfstaengl was actually an anti-semitic and was crazy about his "Fuehrer". But the movie's biggest problem is the actual portrayal of Hitler. He is characterized as one who is constantly unfriendly, has neither charisma nor charm and always orders everyone around. After watching the movie, one wonders how such a disgusting person could ever get any followers. Of course, since we all know what an evil criminal Hitler was, any scriptwriter is tempted to portray Hitler as completely disgusting and uncarismatic. But the fact is that in private he could be quite charming and entertaining. His companions did not follow him because he constantly shouted at them, but because they liked this strange man. In addition to all the historical mistakes, the film is well made, the actors are first class, the location pictures and production design give a credible impression of the era.
