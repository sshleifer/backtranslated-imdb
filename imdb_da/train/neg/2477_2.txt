If you want to know the real story of Wendigo, I suggest you download a copy of Algernon Blackwell's original story. This movie was not only bad, but had nothing to do with the book. <br /> <br /> I loved the book as I read it as a child (in "Campfire Chillers" by EM Freeman) and was so excited to see a movie based on it coming out. I was so disappointed when I finally saw it. Another thing is that there were too many PC (politically correct) undertones in the whole movie that had no place in the movie. When the book was written, no PC even existed. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is not wasting your time or money !! If you see it on the video store shelf, LEAVE IT THERE.
