Without wishing to be a killjoy, Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the most boring and cliché movies I've ever seen - this is one of them, and Camp Blood is another. <br /> <br /> The action is horrible, the pressure is scary, and everything about this movie screams "seriously, you can improve yourself". Maybe it's a challenge for everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie-related crap? <br /> <br /> I bought this for £ 1 but remember you can't appreciate 71 minutes of your life. You would do well to avoid this turkey, even for a bargain basement price.
