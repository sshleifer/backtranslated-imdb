I have 2 words for you. Sean Bean. He is the only valuable presence in this movie. But still, don't watch this movie. Though he is good as the biggest villain, you will not waste your time. <br /> <br /> I didn't care about the characters (except the little boy), and in fact, I didn't really care that the star crossed lovers ended up or died. The movie didn't make me indifferent or think that these people cared about each other at all. I have read many "classic" novels after watching the movies, and this movie didn't even make me read the book. The story seems so boring. But I can go ahead and read it to try to redeem the story in my head. <br /> <br /> Stay away from Lorna Doone. The actor who played Lorna was also in Sense and Sensibility, and she was much better at it. Watch Sharpe, Horatio Hornblower, A & E have amazing movies of novels like Pride and Prejudice. Or miniseries like Forsyte Saga. Check them out, don't bother with Lorna Doone.
