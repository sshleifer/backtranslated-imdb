Basically, "Caprica" ​​is the Cylon origin story. The presentation of the show is interesting. However, the authors follow so many story lines and clog it with too many POV characters as it paints down the narrative. The plot creeps at glacial speeds that spread in whatever tension it might have had. In a given episode little or nothing happens. <br /> <br /> Daniel Graystone (Eric Stolz) is a military contractor working on a robot soldier using a stolen chip. Unfortunately, his only working prototype is driven by the AI ​​version of his dead daughter Zoe, who died in a suicide bombing caused by Soldiers of the One (STO), an underground monotheistic extremist group. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Joseph Adama (father of "Battlestar Galactica" Commander Adama) is struggling to keep his family together while searching for the AI ​​version of his daughter (who also died in the bombing ) in a Machiavellian virtual version of Caprica (much like the 1930s Chicago). <br /> <br /> In addition to the vapid writing, Caprica suffers from a similar problem as many origins stories. We already know how it ends (ie, cyylons develop their own civilization and rebellion against humanity).
