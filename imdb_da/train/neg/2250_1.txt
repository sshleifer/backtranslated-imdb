Rock star John Norman Howard (Kris Kristofferson) turns lounge singer Esther Hoffman (Barbra Streisand) into an overnight star. Esther's star rises while John goes down, thanks to drugs and alcohol. After approx. two hours, John makes the self-destructive-red convergent 160-MPH crack-up-on-a-desert highway thing. The best thing about this movie is the music, especially the song "Evergreen." Barbra Streisand sings well, but you cannot take her seriously as a forward-looking star when she is already * a star. The very first time she looks, sings in a back street bar, she looks like an established song star who slumbering at night, not like a giant unknown trying to start her singing career. She is too confident, too professional. Her apartment looks like a side out of the "Apartment Living", not a hole in the wall where a really struggling singer would live. <br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson handles the self-centered, out-of-control rock star role as ... well as a singer trying to be an actor, but does not have much actor talent. The direction is weak, the story is slow and boring. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this movie is not the play or the lame direction or the slow story. It's the hair! After staring at Kristofferson's and Streisand's terrible 70s hairstyles for 2+ hours, your eyes hurt.
