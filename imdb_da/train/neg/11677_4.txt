This was talked about to the death of the critics when it is honestly not so great. Sure, "CHAOS" and "INSIDE MAN" are literally the same movie, with only variations in voltage. But I found "CHAOS" more comfortable because it was quickly paced like the silly movie "Swordfish". The reason this movie is more popular is that it was released in the United States, and "Chaos" was broadcast worldwide at film festivals and foreign theaters, but has not yet found a distributor in the UK and the United States. <br /> <br /> It is true that this film makes a lot of tribute to classic movies such as DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee movies, but that doesn't mean it's a pleasant movie to watch. <br /> <br /> See if nothing else is on T.V., but you'll be bored after a while.
