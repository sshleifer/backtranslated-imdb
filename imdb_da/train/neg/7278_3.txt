This barely watchable movie was a bit of an ordeal to sit through. None of the segments are good, but at least the first was mildly fun, and the middle was somewhat imaginative. The final was simply brutal, and after sitting through two weak comic shorts, the third was really painful to see. Even after the low standards of a National Lampoon movie, this one seemed particularly boring and pleasing.
