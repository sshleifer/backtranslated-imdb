Let me first say that this must be at the top of my list of boring movies. Nothing, and I mean nothing in this movie is even extremely exciting. Most of it is very confusing, and as it progresses, you just want it to end !! Some people want a movie that makes them "think" through all that I say ... "More power for you" !! I just want to be entertained. Which brings me back to this stink, entertainment is not. This movie is stupid and a complete waste of time. Seems that most people here also agree. Most of this made no sense, and when you think you have a scene, it seems that another lambing scene comes around and .... well, I guess you see where it goes. Avoid this sucker .... bad !!
