I first saw the live musical at the Denver Center For The Performing Arts, and it was totally insane, stunning and had such great continuity in plot and dialogue that I liked it much more than most musicals I've seen on stage. The interesting thing is that you never have to see Zach's face. He was always in the dark, but his presence was powerful and directed the direction of the whole production. When I heard that they made a movie from it, I waited with breath, but when I saw the movie version I was so bummed out disappointed that I felt like I was being cheated. The film lacks the captivating mood of live production, and it never allows you to be in close contact with every character. Personally, I would like to see the live version again, and if it ever should be revived, I would wholeheartedly recommend that you leave your way to see it. It will be one of the most memorable experiences you will enjoy.
