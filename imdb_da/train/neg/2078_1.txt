I went to watch this movie yesterday, and even though I didn't have great hopes for this movie, I was still bitterly disappointed! I really can't believe I spent 96 minutes in my life watching this movie ... it was so bad !!! The story was shameful and the play was terrible (though it had big names like Uma Thurman in it). This movie was heavily dependent on its special effects ... but they had no influence on me. I honestly wanted the id to never see it and I strongly warn anyone against seeing this movie. It is a total waste of money and you will only end up being disappointed afterwards. My advice is to save money, go shopping, pamper yourself, just don't go and watch this movie ... You will live to regret it lol!
