Very strange, but occasionally stylish exercise film with no real story, but benefits from its astonishingly stunning leading actress and a handful of fine, gruesome makeup effects. Daniella is a beautiful twenty-something girl who brings with her the trauma of being raped at the age of 13. Nightmares and hallucinations lead her to believe that she is the reincarnation of a female ancestor who is said to be a werewolf. She kills her brother-in-law during a nocturnal meeting and is sent to a hospital. However, she escapes again and randomly eats more men while she is on the run for police detectives, doctors and relatives. It is also beautiful to watch and listen to (really good soundtrack), but the absence of plot and continuity becomes annoying quite quickly. Fortunately, leading lady Annik Borel rarely has any clothes and she fills the boring moments by dancing naked around a fire. The film is too long, too strange and unforgettable. The biggest surprise comes at the end when suddenly and out of the blue, director Rino Di Silvestro tries to make us believe his film was based on true facts. Yeah right...
