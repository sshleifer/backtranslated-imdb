I saw it, I agree with him 100%, but I didn't care about his delivery. He just came out as an asshole in a poorly edited, constructed juvenile smear campaign. Edit cuts galore etc. The camera would be focused on him and you will see 2 or 3 editing cuts just in a minute or two of dialogue. Add in the constant boom mixes in the camera shot, which is a movie no-no. <br /> <br /> This documentary hits a topic with so many angles, so many interesting stories that the movie is just as easy. Picking on religious fanatics is like picking on the retarded child. It's so easy, it's just wrong. I mean how hard is it to get these people to look like emergency bags? To make them contradict, just let them recite more than one verse or two. I like when he ran back between people of the same religion and showed them quite contradictory. <br /> <br /> I just think he could have done something a little more creative. The part with the neurologist who talked about brain activity never got rid of. It might have been interesting to show brain scans of people under religious conditions in relation to drugs or sex or ???? He could have played more on the women, who are all looking forward to the Passion game, which looked more like a snus scene in a new Rob Zombie movie. More could have gone into John Smith's story, the founder of Mormon, who was right in the colorful past. Delve in science vs. religion. One is a very methodical, very strict process to increase confidence in theories. It builds on itself from a solid bottom, a new layer on top of a more proven layer. A huge burden of proof is required every step of the way. The other starts at the top and comes down with challenges. It is so because good ?? I said it. <br /> <br /> Finished right ?? I would say make it an HBO original series ?? beat another religion every week. <br /> <br /> It was an eye opener for one thing. I must have been blind. Good ole G.W.Bush ... no wonder he was chosen. He had the religious majority. And well ... now it's the blind that leads the blind. Bill Moyer .. Well ... what can I expect from a guy coming out at Sutra in Newport Beach?
