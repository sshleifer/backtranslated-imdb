Not to be confused with the above average supernatural thriller "The Sentinel". Sentinel was a big barring of a movie for me, and didn't deliver the consistent action a few critics promised on the back. For me it seemed like everyone was Halfassing it, and only there to get some quick money, because it felt very much like one made for television movies. Sentinel is a rehash of several better movies, like "In The Fire Of Fire", this has no originality in it, and seeing Michael Douglas running around, I felt a little stupid. The main problem besides that is unoriginal, had to be the slow pace. I was often distracted while trying to watch this movie while I watched how much time was left, more than once. Not just miscasting with Eva Longoria, who couldn't convince such a lick. <br /> <br /> Performances. Michael Douglas is usually a reliable actor, of course, through the movements. He does not convince as a man on the run or a secret agent. His chemistry with Bassinger was also off. I'm a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but here he is just OK, nothing more than that. He tries to cross like a gruff, but managed to be more bland than anything else, and to be honest, he didn't seem to be interested. Eva Longoria Parker is pretty mediocre. She does not convince in her role and was purely eyewitness. Kim Basinger is pretty horrible as the first lady. She looks bored to tears, and her role is a throw away, more than anything else. Martin Donovan has a great deal at the end, but not enough to do anything for me. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Sentinel is yet another political thriller that bored me to cry. It's too old, too tired, and most importantly, the effort is lacking. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 4/10
