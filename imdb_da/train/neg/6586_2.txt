If you appreciate the Renaissance in Asian horror, don't bother with Gawi. The film hardly deserves mention together with A-list work like Ringu, A Tale of Two Sisters, Cure and Ju-On (or even as good material as The Eye or Inner Senses). These movies feature subtleties, unexpected images, rich characters, and a certain non-western take on what's scary. Gawi is tense with the remaining limbs and organs of everything that has made American horror miserable over the past 25 years. <br /> <br /> The movie is trying to mix Asian ghost story and Hollywood slasher flick, but it's a bad fit. One aesthetic is bound to smother the other; guess which one? Has no own story to tell the filmmakers to rat for an evil subplot, but the situation is hopeless. Clich√©s, crap characters, spotless plot, a boring ghost, ho hum.
