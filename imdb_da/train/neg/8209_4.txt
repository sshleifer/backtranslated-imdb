The action, other reviews, despite it was remarkably well done. Brad Pitt handles an annoying, unpleasant Austrian climber's role quite well. Other plays are fine. The story could have been riveting, but somehow it lacks - one never understands or cares for the signs shown, and the story that could have been quite dramatic fails to draw in that audience. <br /> <br /> Beautiful scenery and filmography, a remarkably dramatic true story, important events that created the world we live in - but I couldn't, try as I might, involve myself in this story. As an effortless Brad Pitt fan (I consider him one of the top five players in his generation), I expected * loved * this flick - but it left me cold. <br /> <br /> It could be a lack in myself, but I tend to point to the creative end of this movie - direction, scriptwriting, production, editing - somehow they lost me. It's a shame because it could have been wonderful. <br /> <br /> Good acting, dramatic story, beautiful shot - it should have been magnificent. It wasn't. Probably worth seeing just to make your own mind up on it - but don't expect too much and maybe you won't be as disappointed as I was. For the most part, it bored me.
