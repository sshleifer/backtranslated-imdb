What?!?? Why do people say this is "mind blowing?" Just watch it out The end is at the worst endings in movie history! 4 back and the whole world is finished! Not to mention the grade 9 was an idiot all the time when he got everyone killed. 1 was true all the time if he sacrificed 9, nothing would have happened. People who give it live for a stupid cause and for what? ... to make it rain? I admit the movie if it's part and the whole concept was fascinating. But much of it was clich√©s in succession. And did anyone else get this feeling that this is much like "Lord of the Rings?" Characters died for stupid reasons, there was almost no sign development, and honestly ask yourself, it's good to have only four guys back in the world; its meaningless and stupid. It was one of the shortest movies I've ever seen and thank God! How are robots in any way creative in humans! It's been done like a hundred times! This movie is really stupid, watch a movie worth watching like Star Trek, The Hangover or Inglorious Basterds, it was great movies!
