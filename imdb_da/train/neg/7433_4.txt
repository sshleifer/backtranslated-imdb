I have to be quite honest with saying first that I fell asleep somewhere in the middle so I can't give a whole mind about the movie until I fully see it. Basically, a group of thieves, including Sid Carter (Sid James) and Ernie Bragg (Bernard Bresslaw) are planning to make a fortune stealing a shipment of birth control pills from Finisham's maternity hospital. This is where the title character Matron (Hattie Jacques) works with the employees Sir Bernard Cutting (Kenneth Williams), Dr. Francis Goode (Charles Hawtrey), Dr. Prodd (Terry Scott) and Nurse Susan Ball (Barbara Windsor). Patients and their visitors are also nearby, including pregnant wife Tidey (Joan Sims) and her nervous father-to-husband husband. Tidey (Kenneth Connor). Also starring Bill Maynard like Freddy and EastEnders' Wendy Richard as Miss Willing. By the way, this plan does not, by the way, penetrate because the entire staff gets in the way. It's pretty much everything that can be said about the movie until I see it all over again. Okay!
