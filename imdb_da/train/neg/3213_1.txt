Well, I can honestly say this is the first time I saw a movie that literally didn't have meat or potatoes in it. The whole movie felt like it was just lettuce without a main course. The story was erroneous and ridiculous, the characters were one-dimensional, the realism was out of the window, and the animation was made by four-year-olds. Does it cover it? I have never been more embarrassed by a concept throughout my life. I have never read the comics or seen the other programs with this character, but from the look of the other reviews I am not out of line with my observation. <br /> <br /> Initially, history moved too fast. For someone who was new to this character and situation, I needed more built to create the reasons instead of finding the solution. I've seen other Anime (if you could call this an anime) doing great things with their characters because they take the time to develop them. There was nothing devoted to Lady Death. In a couple of short scenes, we see his train with Cremator and instantly become this aggressive game of hell. It was hard for me to swallow considering moments before being introduced as this weak and weak woman controlled by her father. Suddenly she is immersed in hatred and can struggle with an existence that has existed for millions of years. This was absurd. The presentation of Lady Death was bad, to say the least. I felt that she was no more than an animated character instead of a desperate woman with revenge on the mind. For me it just didn't work. She was nothing but eye-candy for prepubescent boys who wanted to trigger the masses of skin that she suddenly grew on her chest as they trained with Cremator. Oh, I felt sick just looking at her. The same goes for Cremator's character. Who was this random person? The explanation they gave was not enough, and instead I was left with more incoherent babbling than the actual development. It is a very sad day in hell when we refrain from signs to show more violence and action, especially in an animated function. <br /> <br /> Next there was Lucifer himself. Let me just say I think I could fight with the King of Hell and survive. He was weak, his voice was ridiculous, and he just didn't represent the image I had in my mind. It was as if Disney was in control and wanted to make him a semi-PC. He lacked the dark and corrupt nature that Lucifer includes. He was not Hell's Ruler, but instead just a delicious one who had a bigger place to live. Talking about living or dying, how can you die again in hell? It was a concept that definitely needed more explanation. Most signs were worrying about dying as they did not even consider the possibility that they had already died. That's how they came to hell. I think it was this thinking that ruined the movie for me. I couldn't quite understand that your soul was still in a solid body in hell, but it could just be me? or maybe it was because there was no development in this story. Nothing was built, just prepared. <br /> <br /> The fighting sequences were hysterically bad. The animation in this cartoon felt like it was made in the early 90s. There was nothing impressive about the way this movie was drawn. Why are we, America, behind the animation? It's huge in Asia, and it's crawling in hardcore here because we continue to make movies like Lady Death, which doesn't challenge or use any part of imagination. We are cheap and this film shows it. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was bad. The animation combined with horrible voice work was cheap. I had a head somewhere that this movie as in production for a long time, which is hard to understand because I think I could have made this movie on my credit card. The production was horrible as well as the story. Nothing was developed and left great gaping plot holes that almost all fell in. The character of the characters was missing, and nothing was explained. I wasted my time with this one and would like to warn others so when death comes you will not find yourself in my state and regret that you wasted 80 minutes on this bin. <br /> <br /> BLAH! <br /> <br /> Degree: * out of *****
