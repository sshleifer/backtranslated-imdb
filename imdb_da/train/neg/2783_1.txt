I visited one of my relatives a while back and we popped at a theater so we thought we would go in and give this movie a ride. What a mistake! This movie is horrible in all departments. I had never heard of the movie before, and literally everyone still didn't. No wonder it is as high as it gets. It's a comedy, so it all goes well, the only thing that is fun is that the instructor is able to make such a movie. When you get so close to Christmas, one should mention how to subdue a turkey in almost an hour and a half - or how long it was when I went out. At the end of the movie you will come out as if you have been poisoned on a sick turkey and regret wasting your time on such dribbling. Who knows why such things are done. Some people had left the theater before the movie was well over, and I blame myself for not going out much earlier. It really annoys me that you pay good money to see something decent, and all you come out to see is a bad TV movie to be shown at 2 in the morning, actually it is so bad, daytime TV should not show it. What more can one say ... probably not enough bad words could do it justice.
