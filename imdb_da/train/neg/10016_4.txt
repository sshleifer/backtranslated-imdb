"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" was one of the many 50's films about hot-rodding teens encountering supernatural. In this case, teens cannot pay the rent for their hangout and be postponed. With nowhere to go, they decide on an apparently haunted house. As you may have guessed when they arrive, some strange things begin. And there is a twist at the end. <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this movie that you haven't seen in other movies, but it's a good entertainment. My favorite character was the foul-mouthed parrot. Well, let me rephrase it: He didn't speak like a sign in a Quentin Tarantino movie, but he said things we didn't expect from a bird. The film's pure hokum, but harmless.
