"This story is dedicated to women," according to the introduction, "who has fought for their rights ever since Adam and Eve started the loose leaf." When "Politics" was admitted, the nineteenth amendment guaranteed women's voting rights was only ten years old. And the film deals with the women's pursuit of political power as a voting group. Attempts at banning and abolishing speakeasies were a major concern for women at that time. Good-natured Marie Dressler (like Hattie Burns) becomes politically active after a young woman is shot and killed coming out of a speakeasy. She wants the liquid-leaking joints to be closed; and was drafted in a Mayoral race, after delivering a strong speech at a women's rally. Ms Dressler is supported by her tenants, best friend Polly Moran (such as Ivy Higgins) and her supreme husband Roscoe Ates (like Peter Higgins). Dresslers race for the Mayor of Lake City draws resistance from men in the city; Dressler therefore orders the women to go on strike, deny them, "everything" in "living room, bedroom and bath". <br /> <br /> The movie sounds much better than it turned out. The mood is honest, not too good; and it has some involuntary and moderately offensive situations ("You look like Madame Queen" refers to an Amos and Andy character). And the blend of shootings and slapstick does not mix well, this time. The producers could have considered making the movie more dramatic and focused solely on Dressler and the characters played by William Bakewell (like Benny Emerson) and Karen Morley (like Myrtle Burns). <br /> <br /> **** Politics (7 / 25/31) Charles Reisner ~ Marie Dressler, Polly Moran, Roscoe Ates
