Sorry my neighbor Nevada City neighbors, but this one is bad. Brian must have had too much botox because he had very small facial expressions throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Alice looked as if she had a table attached to her back. She was stiff throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> I looked up both Alice and Brian and was surprised to see the extensive biography of the work. I would have guessed that they were first-year students. <br /> <br /> Ed Asner and Peter Jason honestly carried the film with their shame and ease with each line. Ed has certainly not lost his charisma. I wish I had taken the time to meet him while he was here. <br /> <br /> I love snow scenes and scenes of shops and church because I've been there. I make Nevada City my home and waited eagerly for the premiere. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> Sorry.
