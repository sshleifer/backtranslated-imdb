After reading many years about how great this film was, how it established the Ruiz among the French critics (especially the Snobian Cahiers crowd), when I finally looked at it a year ago, I found it rather disappointing (but then I guess my expectations were soaring). The shot in saturated black and white is told this deliberately cerebral film (made for television and merely one hour) in the form of a conversation between an art artist and an offscreen narrator, which they consider through a series of paintings (shown in the style of tableaux vivants) and trying to find out if they have any traces of a hidden political crime. (The horrible Kate Beckinsale movie uncovered has a similar argument). Borgesian is a word I read a lot in reviews about this movie, but I would say that almost every Borges story is more interesting than this movie.
