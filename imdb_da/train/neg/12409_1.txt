And it comes from a person who will withstand almost any view. The play and the sound are horrible. This may qualify for a "so bad it's good" point of merit ,,, for some. But I take my horror movies seriously and it's just shit-it's just as good, I think it's my big complaint. The dialogue is often hilarious attention to how many times "you scared me" are used. The "child" actress is seriously god horrible - I ask her acting career ended here. Here line "DONUTS! IN HATE DONUTS" is worth repeating viewing though.
