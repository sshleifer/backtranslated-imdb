If this is the first of the "Nemesis" movies that you have seen, I strongly urge you to continue no longer. The sequel to "Nebula" proves to be no better ... hard to believe in considering this entry is bottom-of-barrel. This movie is trying, but it's just not worth your time, guys. Take a nap instead.
