Please be warned: this movie, although a pretty bad story, was one of the most gruesome movies I've seen ... EVER. Just remember it before you sit on your sofa to enjoy the movie. Then it officially begins with a party. Just your average party, but there is some guy there. He's beautiful in Kate ... if you know what I'm saying. Remember his face; It helps later. <br /> <br /> Still, Kate goes to find George Clooney (I didn't say the plot was bad?) and then the tube. It's London underground in the middle of the night, but she's just stupid like that. So the timetable says the next, and at last the train will arrive in 7 minutes. Now Kate, stupid party girl, as she is, decides she can get a nap in the extra 7 minutes. She typically misses the train and finds herself locked in the London Underground. Alone. Well, almost ... <br /> <br /> So the movie just continues from there. Blood, bowel, limbs, even certain parts of the body that I should not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body. In short, it's a typical horror; beautiful but thick girl in women type women and sick, strange psycho. Or, as is the case, Creep. <br /> <br /> I would say give it a ride if you are in the Saw, Hostel or Texas Chain saw massacre, but for the rest of us, screaming with gratitude needs grateful.
