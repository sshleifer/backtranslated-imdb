I enjoy watching Western movies, but this movie takes biscuits. Scripture and dialogue are ridiculous. The action was horrible, where did they pick them up? Music was OK, I have to say. Fortunately, I didn't buy or rent the movie, but it was now disposed of. <br /> <br /> I was corrected at the beginning when the stranger (martin sheen) began to tell her story. I must admit that I enjoy the confrontation between Hopalong and Tex, where Hopalong shot Tex's finger and told him to train for 40 years to reach his league. But it was all that was pear-shaped then. I had to watch the whole movie in the hope that it would be better, never did.
