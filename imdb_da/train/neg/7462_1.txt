Direction should be the problem here. I recently heard John Cleese talk about working a shit for Fawlty Towers. He was going to attack his car with a branch. The first branch was too flimsy and not fun. The other branch was too stiff to be fun. The third was just flimsy enough to be fun. This kind of attention to detail is missing from "Corky Romano". No matter how scary unfunny a cartoon was, it was not fixed and was not left on the floor. The one value I can find in this movie is as a study of a very flawed movie that somehow escaped in distribution without being repaired. I've scanned dozens of other reviews here. The number of reviews that price this absolute waste of time strengthens my suspicion that some people are being paid to promote titles. I can't understand how anyone over the age of 9 could rate this title more than a 4, MAX. I mean, come on, 5 is average. I can't imagine anyone, even those making money out of it, judging it as much as the average. <br /> <br /> This makes my list of the 10 worst movies all the time. And hi, I actually like the three stooges and can even tolerate ed wood!
