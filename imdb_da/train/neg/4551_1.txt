I have to admit that I don't like much of New Age mumbo jumbo. When people "exchange energy," I always wonder how much kJ is actually exchanged and how it can help solve the global warming problem. When energy is "enforced", I always wonder how they managed to violate the laws of entropy and still have no Nobel Prizes. When people feel how well instinct they can faultlessly navigate through the complexities of life, I wonder how they fail to do a simple thing like finding the station. But then it's not the first movie again with plot holes and most of them I find quite acceptable and entertaining. If this were the case with "Celestine Prophecy", I would not burn this movie down, but unfortunately it is not. Every actor seems to be boring out of his head and unable to understand what he actually needs to do on the spot. This results in many "Ah's" and "Oh's", which I usually do when talking about quantum physics with someone who actually knows what he is talking about and pretends to understand. <br /> <br /> direction is also uninspired. You might expect something more from the guy who did "What Dreams Can Come", but hey, I assumed he was well paid for the job and adopted a New York taxi driver's attitude: "It's your money, buddy .." only one who seems to have fun is the all-time bad guy JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. Not only does he have a job, he is one of the few actors in this movie who may have some clever cracks in this eternal and terribly boring New Age chatter. <br /> <br /> This movie is much like one of these dinners dating when you find out that your date is actually a terrible birth that seems to be incapable of stopping. In a moment, it seems that the words turn into small ping-pong balls that are thrown to the head incessantly until it hurts. <br /> <br /> If you want to feel good and choose between this movie and stinging safety pins in your eyelids, take my advice: choose the latter.
