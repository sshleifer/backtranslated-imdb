Couldn't go to bed the second night. So I got up, turned around the tube and this movie was on. Film makers relaxed more than they could chew. Just as ambitious in scope as "Forrest Gump" was. But Gump reads as an adventure where an extraordinarily lucky man leads us through the era. TGMB only relies on tired clich√©s to tell the story. Almost like a Broadway musical, where the actors have to pounce. The purpose of each character was to fill out a stupid 60-sheet type. <br /> <br /> Take a look at how we are introduced to Finnegan: Hug his black girl and receive a framed picture of MLK. Criminey, talk about the heavy hand. Why not just give him a t-shirt that says "I Heart Black People"? <br /> <br /> Sunshine: "Isn't free love groovay, man? Oh no, I didn't have my time." <br /> <br /> Mary Beth: "I want to go to Berkeley, not square UCLA." Uh, excuse me? There was nothing square about LA in the 60s. Instead of taking the time to demonstrate what made Berkeley unique, we just hear this brat about not going there. <br /> <br /> Can't even remember the black child's name. He was just a prop used to show how racially tolerant the other children are. <br /> <br /> Things are that pieces don't have to be this cheesy. Take "Dazed & Confused." See how we are introduced to football hero, Randall Floyd. We first see him on the football field. In fact, we never see him playing football. We are introduced to him in class and invite his nerdish poker friends to a party. <br /> <br /> In "Dazed" feminism is not an informal by-product of some chicks being opened up. It's much more organic, more serious than that. It is refined in the women's room over a flip discussion on Gilligan's Island. Serious ideas can grow in the most secular settings. But real life is like that. <br /> <br /> Some of the hot comments here note that the themes in this movie are still relevant. I agree! Therefore, I feel so disappointed with this piece of Baby-Boomer pornostalgia.
