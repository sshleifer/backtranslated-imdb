I have already seen amazing stories, but the premises in this are so incredible that it comes very close to being ridiculous. A rich and young guy undergoes a heart transplant the day after his marriage, and somehow witnessed his own operation and his surgeon's plot to kill him. Even if there is a medical explanation for such a phenomenon, what happens next is a mixture of dialogue among ... say ... souls? ... maybe and the real life where the dedicated mother will do everything to save her son's life. There is no shadow of excitement or excitement, just a combination of a bad and simplistic plot with a series of coincidences that can never happen in life. This is not to say that the film lacks quality - in fact, first time director Joby Harold does a decent job in managing a good team of actors that include Hayden Christensen in his first major role after taking the fabulous Anakin Skywalker costume. Jessica Alba and super cool Lena Olin. Everyone would have deserved a better story.
