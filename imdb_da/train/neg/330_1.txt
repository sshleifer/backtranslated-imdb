I would turn the TV on. Seeing it was torture. I hated it. Never watch this movie. The terrorists are annoying. Adam Sandler is annoying. I usually like him but not this one. I would break the DVD. This is the most annoying movie in the world. The comedian he is jealous of is unpleasant. The only distant fun part is rocker with the black teeth that get all the girls. It was so annoying I wanted to beat the TV. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE, NOT BEING CONSIDERED WHEN YOU WANT TO RESPONSIBLE. If you even like Adam Sandler a little bit, don't buy it. It'll just make you hate him. Do yourself a favor if you see it in the store, save it to put everyone out of danger of buying it. It's a waste of $ 1.99 I paid for it.
