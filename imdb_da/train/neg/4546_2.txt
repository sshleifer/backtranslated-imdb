I just watched this movie and haven't read the book. The good thing about the movie is that in some parts it makes you think a little about the spiritual subject, evolution, syncronicity and your part in the world. <br /> <br /> However, the film's immersion is easily broken and there is very little report between the viewer and the characters. It is very clear that the book loses a lot in this movie version. The events that were supposed to show syndrome take place are almost unrecognizable. A great reason must be made for the viewer to see that the scene indicates a case, and even more to imagine that it has something to do with a larger purpose. <br /> <br /> Information scenes are visually bad and do not create the better feeling that it should. Do you remember the enlightenment with Keanu Reeves (in Little Buddha)? Well, it's not like that. <br /> <br /> Most scenes are poorly executed. There are many scenes that do not really develop the story, nor do they help create an atmosphere. The better actors in this movie, namely Hector Elizondo, Joaquim de Almeida and Jürgen Prochnow, cannot save it. The first 2 seem to have had more scenes than their characters should try to save the movie and because they were paid more, but it doesn't work. Most scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all. <br /> <br /> Jürgen does well in his scenes and sells like an evil guy (as always), but the script doesn't help him at all. The scene where he first tries to convince John (Matthew Settle) to stay with him is just a bad script. The performance of the scene when he dies in an explosion is absurdly poorly executed. Flashbacks throughout the movie can't even be commented on. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is a big waist of time, read the book! I haven't read it, but it's probably a billion times better than this, it must be. It's so bad I had to write my first comment in IMDb.
