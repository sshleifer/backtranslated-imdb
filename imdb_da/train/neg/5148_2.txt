There is an awful lot wrong with this image, which begins with a script that is both obvious and superfluous. Courtney Cox plays a cartoonist flying to a small desert town after being raped twice in the big city. She is immediately disturbed by a room that seems quite unhinged (Craig Sheffer) and who seems to try a third movement Mickey Rourke imitation. D. B. Sweeny is a local policeman who is allegedly there to protect and serve. Meanwhile, the manuscript manipulates the audience on who really is the good guy? Logic flies out the window after the first ten minutes and never returns, and there are more unanswered questions than there should be. If you think "Blue Desert" can be saved by the wonderful Philip Baker Hall, you will be disappointed. His part is insignificant, just like the whole movie. - NOTE
