There seem to be a surprisingly high number of 8-10 star reviews here from people who have never written an IMDb review sooner or later. Considering the very low average rating given by other people, I think you can draw your own conclusions. <br /> <br /> This is a very bad movie. I admit, I thought the concept was sweet, and I was happy to see the actresses who played Eve and Harmony on Angel got work, but it didn't take long for the glorious horror of this movie to make himself known. <br /> <br /> Acting: The wires seemed enough, but everyone else? Terrible. <br /> <br /> Plot: Shock full of holes big enough to drive a truck through. <br /> <br /> Direction: Non-existent. <br /> <br /> Humor: Did they really think people were laughing? Oh boy. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: OK. There were some really beautiful women in this movie. Not just the three main female characters, but just across the board. It was as if the producers hoped the landscape would keep male viewers so distracted, they would not notice how terrible everything else was. If so, they failed miserably. <br /> <br /> In the right hands, it could have been sweet but dark fun classic. It wasn't even close.
