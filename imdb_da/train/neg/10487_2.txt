OMG! The only reason I give this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because Tom Hanks is fun as an Elvis-in-the-Box. Aside from that, how did this halfway decent cast signed to make such a lame movie ?? Perhaps it seemed like a good idea at that time ... There is no laugh, the stereotypes are pathetic, the throw is wasted, the direction is amateurish. Now that I think about it, most of the blame is probably with director Joel Zwick. He does not bring out anything except flat ideas from everyone involved. Don't waste your time as I did; But then I enjoy a good train wreck. Geez, now the system tells me I need more lines - here you go: This movie should be called Return to Sender. Okay, now it was more fun than anything in the movie ...
