My thoughts about the movie, 9 <br /> <br /> It wasn't good, not at all good. Visually it was fantastic. I was happy with pacing, camera angles, etc. But the signs? eh, a little gentle. Reason? It sucked. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed more new to age than anything else. Organized religion is presented as cowardly and horrible. Science is not better portrayed. It creates a monster weapon that kills everything ... but "souls" have the power to destroy monsters and bring life? Really? <br /> <br /> It's something that bites my ass too. Here we have a CGI movie ... created with science ... and they use it to let us know that science will destroy the world while promoting the idea that spirituality will save us? At least they had a decency to have one of the characters ask, <br /> <br /> "Okay, so now what?" (or something like that). I couldn't hear it too well because of the crowd promptly coming up and making a break for the departure. It was an "okay ... it was just hardly entertaining enough to sit here for the whole movie, but now we get out of here as soon as possible!" type of exit. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies where you can't think if you want to enjoy it. Just look at the pictures and enjoy your head beautifully. Any thought of "what is the meaning of it?" will suck you out of disbelief and make you see the exit sign with longing. <br /> <br /> Okay ... SPOILERS follow. <br/> <br /> So basically, a scientist creates the "Machine" capable of creating other, intelligent, robotic life. Evil people use it as a weapon. However, the researcher realizes that he is also guilty. He gave the machine his intellect, but did not give it his heart. <br /> <br /> The machine walks Skynet on the collective ass of humanity and dries out of all life on earth, and finally slows down. However, the scientist manages to survive and create migratory socks. Every one that contains a piece of the scientist's soul. <br /> <br /> The last, # 9 wakes up without knowing anything about the world. He sees a strange entity nearby and picks it up. He meets another like himself, # 2. <br /> <br /> Now, # 2 is caught by a last surviving robot in the machine. # 9 finds more like himself and sets out to save # 2. <br /> <br /> They succeed. <br /> <br /> # 9 notes that there is a matching hole that fits perfectly with the device. He inserts it and the machine comes back to life ... pulls out the soul of # 2 in the process. <br /> <br /> The movie then continues with action scenes with # 9 trying to save its soul-yanked compatriots. <br /> <br /> Eventually they succeed and destroy the machine. They solve their fallen friends who go up into the clouds. It is raining and we see life returning to the planet. <br /> <br /> Honey?!? <br /> <br /> It makes no sense. Not anybody. Why the hell would the scientist share his soul in 9 homunculi? What has it done? Were they set up to stop the machine? Everything is dead! The machine was dead! Why disturb? Why did he expect nine small critters to succeed, as nothing else had? Why not create another intellectual machine, but with a "soul" to fight the first one. At least it would have been as if it would have had a reasonable chance of success. Why should they have their souls sucked into the unit of the machine and then destroy the machine and then release the souls to bring life back to earth? Why not just wait for the machine to flow down and bring life back without all the other crazy steps?
