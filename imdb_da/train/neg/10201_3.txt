This is a typical "perfect crime" thriller. A perfect crime is being carried out, and the investigating police officer ignores all the clues immediately knowing who is guilty. The audience must wait the whole movie for the guilty to be caught. The result is like every episode of "Columbo" or "Murder she wrote". The director himself refers to the hackney story by showing the police officer an episode of Matlock! This story takes almost 90 minutes, but the director insists on using every 120 minutes of filling with each clich√© in the book. Skip this one, you are not missing anything.
