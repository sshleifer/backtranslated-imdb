Hines and Goforth, the perpetrators of this crime, begin on the wrong foot the first step by assuming that Wells wrote Gothic fright and that all his lines are meant to be taken seriously. It is simply not true. Wells was very much a piece of information for the information, and his biggest concern was that Victorian complacency could leave the British unprepared for the world the new technology could produce - both good and bad. <br /> <br /> Two horrible consequences follow - the protagonist is portrayed as a wimpy screamer (I was reminded of Fay Wray in the original King Kong), rather than a man struggling to live out the irony of an incredible disaster; and the dialogue series of "victorianisms" pronounced seriously that Welles clearly meant to be taken tongue in the cheek. All this looks suspiciously like Ed Wood with a huge budget wasting CGI effects - which by the way is so poorly executed, Warner Bro's comic book factory in the 1940s could have done a better job. (Sprayed blood balls resembled red bubbles, I expected them to flow away for a moment.) Think of the yellow submarine as done by the old EC comics. <br /> <br /> Worse yet, the loss of theme that robs the movie is for some reason to exist. Though the film's makers are returning the story to their Victorian era, they totally miss the scary way. The story of Wells predicted many of the horrors of the First World War - an incomplete, unnoticed independence of Wells himself, which after the war processed the theme in the form of things to come. <br /> <br /> Without any theme, all we have here is a lot of people running around blowing in cartoon balloons when they aren't trying to make a high school production of a drunk student's rewrite of Macbeth. Really, this is the worst, most pointless piece I have suffered since a friend talked to me about seeing the Eastern European cartoon "Fantastic Planet" 30 years ago. That movie was so pretentiously boring, my friend and I and two assembled strangers gave it ridiculously about halfway through and sat close to the screen playing cards, using the movie as light to see the cards - it's only useful as far as any We could tell. <br /> <br /> But I already have electrical lighting in my apartment, so I didn't need this Wells closure for anything. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie - steal every copy you can (don't pay a cent) and burn each one of them. God in His wisdom just created us for this purpose.
