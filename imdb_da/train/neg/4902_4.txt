Almost in the same league as the Yonfan's rather cruel color blooms, Spider Lillies runs the home that you can make cutting edge cinema without the edge, or much in the way of cutting. It is a Taiwanese movie that at this time and age becomes a novelty at an alarming rate, but more than the bit of time we can find very little in the way of the remarkable here. <br /> <br /> You should know that apparently Spider Lillies is also a lesbian-themed story, but in every aspect there is only one plastic cushion to entice in the easily seduced and credible. In several ways, here is a repetition of other recently released Taiwan release Eternal Summer. Then there were gay men who received treatment with shortchange, now we have the same with women. Zero Chou presents, for your non-existent structure, a story that will probably be titled a maximum of fifteen years old. They manage some of the art house's attitude, but in the end it results in a most horrible, simply uninteresting foray. The Hong Kong angle comes in the form of Isabella Leung (Bug Me Not, Isabella, Diary), here sporting her most butch look yet. Although there is something similar in her previous job, Isabella in Spider Lillies is effortless and lacking in most departments. Either her heart was not in it, or the whole lesbian drama pitch did not appeal to her sensibilities. She makes a Taipei tattoo artist who is shy and retiring and responsible for a mentally challenged younger brother, played by John Shen, who fortunately gives the film its only thespian-related redemption feature. Isabella's character, strangely named Takeko, but apparently howling from Hong Kong, is soon associated with the confused youth Jade (Rainie Yang from fondly-recalled Meteor Garden). The latter lives with his grandmother and has a whole list of complaints due to being left behind by her parents and life in general. The grandmother's component works well and touches, but otherwise Jade as the main character is just as unmoving as his counterpart Takeko. <br /> <br /> The two women share a past and lots of inadequately covered anxiety, with Jade working as a webcam girl while takeko keeps her father's legacy alive with a unique tattoo of a spider lilly emblazoned on her arm. Jade also wants to acquire this very design, leading to Takeko exploring internal feelings of the problem through flashbacks and little minimal discourse with the spunky Jade. <br /> <br /> Well, if there is a little discourse to write the homebase, at least intercourse is memorable? In a word, no. Those kissing and celebrating make it unpleasant close to the end, but just as the eternal summer did not remind us long ago, there is a gap measured in light years between showing sexual content and that ticket buyers believe they are seeing sexual content . <Br /> <br /> This cynical expectation building seals the fate of Spider Lillies. With a weak history, ho-hum acting and a general lack of relics taking away from the theater with you, this one kind of makes Color Blossoms look good, came to think of it. At least we got a little Teresa Cheung's mothers. No, Spider Lillies is not an AV masterpiece and should be deleted from the playlist for even the most mundane and sad CAP film festival. <br /> <br /> Amazing for a pseudo-indie release, not even soundtracks and filmography produce moments of inspiration. It's as good as it makes it much easier to transfer Spider Lillies. Believe in us, avoid it and you will not miss any good. <br /> <br /> Rating: * *
