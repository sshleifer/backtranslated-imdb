The Canadians are too polite to boo, but the audience at the Toronto Film Festival left the theater murmuring that they would rate this movie 0 or 1 on their ballot. The premise is that a modern filmmaker interprets an 18th-century template of the love of shepherds and shepherds, which lie in the distant past, as grapes were the spiritual leaders. Working in three epochs offers many opportunities to introduce anachronism, including stupid and impractical clothing and peculiar spiritual rites that involve really bad poetry. Lovers are divided by jealousy and their rigid adherence to idiotic codes of conduct, from which there are cross-links and various dangerous situations. The movie could have been fun as a Monty Python piece, as it looks too close, but Rohmer's efforts are very flat. The audience laughed at the sight jokes, but otherwise told the slow pace. The ending is all in a hurry and is really terrible. This is a trivial movie and a waste of your movie time.
