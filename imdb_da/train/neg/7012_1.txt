Me and my boyfriend went to see this movie as a "Premiere Surprise", which we bought on a ticket to previve for a movie before it was opened here in Denmark. We sat through 1 hour or so and then we left! The point in the movie seemed to be simply portraying the era (and the club 54), but it did so at the expense of character development, of which there was none, and of which it was small. /> Rarely have I been so indifferent to the characters in a movie! <br /> <br /> The music was good. So if you like to hear some good music and get a solution to the 70's mood, I think it's OK. But don't expect to get a plot of credible signs. <br /> <br />
