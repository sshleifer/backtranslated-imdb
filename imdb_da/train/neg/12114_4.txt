The weird people who live in a city go about their lives. There is a guy licking everything, a dumpster diver who finds a body that he takes home to live with him, a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her, a guy who wants to clean girls on their evil ways. .. offbeat in the extreme, this shot in black and white film is better without color. The monochrome takes the edge of the two steps up from the home movie feel. As a Troma movie, this movie is fun in fits and starts, but for the most part it is odd for nice, and soon it becomes a crash, when you see set ups, you can guess where it is much of the time - not always - but enough for it not to be fun. (Although I didn't see the cleaning coming). Worth having a shot if you have nothing else to see and you are waiting for the next set of Golden Girls to come from Netflix.
