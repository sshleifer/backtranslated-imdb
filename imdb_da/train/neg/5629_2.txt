I just rented (yes! I paid money to see!) This movie. OMG. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. As another reviewer put it, Mrs Colagrande, came out of the movies, PLEASE! Never make or perform in another movie! The lady has a charisma of a cantaloupe. No, it's not fair for cantaloupe, which probably has more for it. She doesn't know how to act; she affects an abominable appearance all the time (reminded me a lot about my always disgusting sister-in-law from Europe). She is not charming; she is not beautiful There is no real story. And editing! There was nothing I could see! It's pretty bad when you watch a movie, and to get through it, press "forward" on your remote control and nothing still happens! I think! ..... I kept involuntarily screaming, "Cut! Cut!" What did they think? Well, of course they thought they would make a movie together and be paid to love the screen! Pretty good deal for them; pretty raw deal for the viewer! I think I should throw up now ...
