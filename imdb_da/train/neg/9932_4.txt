Dan Duryea, a very decent B-movie actor who made lots of lookalike noirs in the 1940s, can't do much with this: young man is accused of murdering an unhappy married singer; When he is doomed to die, his wife decides to resolve the case even with the help of the dead woman's husband. After a dazzling opening image, flick quickly puts into B-film formula. It certainly looks good, but the twist finish is colorless and cast (including Peter Lorre and Broderick Crawford) is just a bit stiff. Based on a Cornell Woolrich novel and adaptable to a single view. <br /> <br /> ** from ****
