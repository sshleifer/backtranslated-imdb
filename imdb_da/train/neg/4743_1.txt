It's so bad, the Disney Channel flushes away its money once again with the exciting yet decisive 10-second promotions that keep viewers wondering, "when should it be?" And then suddenly, when it comes to, for one, it not only got a higher TV rating than usual, but it was only seen once !!!!! Oh no!!!!! Once all !!!!! Plus, this movie is about high school and things, and believe me, I won't go on with what's in there ..... <br /> <br /> Say ch ... smile !!!! ! (SNAP!) <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs. 0/10
