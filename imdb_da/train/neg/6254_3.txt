One of my friends was in the cast as a FEDS agent (a non-speaking part I remember). He brought it over to DVD so I could see it. It was "interesting" but felt very much like an amateur movie. A well made amateur movie, however. Really boring and badly written. It was probably fun to do and be involved in, but it certainly did not deserve any kind of broad release. Maybe in Omaha they would enjoy it, but this California girl was bored and honestly so embarrassed by my friend's commitment. <br /> <br /> If this film producer has made or produced more films, he really should try to have a really interesting storyline and good actors. I'm sure this was a good learning tool for them. I wish them happiness in the future and hope they can improve their film production.
