End of Violence and surely Million Dollar Hotel hinted at the idea that Wenders has lost his vision, his ability to tell compelling stories through a map of the moving image. The Plenty Land sells the coffin I am afraid of being a very imaginative, overtly sentimental and clich√©'d film. The characters are completely flat and stereotypes, writing, plot and direction are at best amateur. For the first time in a while, I was impatient for the movie to end so that I could get on with my life. The uncle's war-torn delirium, the patriotic abstract that stares into the sky in the conclusion ... it all struck me just to be so simple and pathetic, hardly a work of a filmmaker who once made some compelling magic on the screen. What happened? The day of experimentation, perceptive writing, and interesting movie footage are long behind him, I'm afraid. Let's hope he finds his inspiration again ... At the Toronto Film Festival, where I watched the movie, Wenders was there to introduce it. He lacked complete humility and offered us the following: "I hope ... no, wait ... I know you will enjoy the next two hours." I'm afraid he couldn't be more wrong ...
