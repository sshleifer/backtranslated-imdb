I went to the movie as a Sneak Preview in Austria. So I didn't have an idea of ​​what I want to see. The story is very normal. The movie is very long, I think it could have cut to 1/2 without causing any problems with the story. It's the type of movie you can see in a boring evening that you will be bored more of! Ashton Kutcher was very good. Kevin Costner is okay. The film talks about the US Coast Guards, how they are trained, their lifestyle and the problems they face. Since there are not many effects in the movie. So if you want to see it, then it is not necessary to waste your money and time on going to the cinema. Would be more efficient to see it at home when it comes to DVDs.
