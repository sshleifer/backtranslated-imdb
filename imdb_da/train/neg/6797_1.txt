What can you say about a grainy, poorly filmed 16mm stag film, where the best and most attractive performer is a German shepherd? Nothing that would be positive. Avoid this travesty at all costs. In any case, it would be difficult to find, as bestiality remains a taboo and illegal issue in the United States. I strongly suggest IMDb to visit their weighting formula to establish ratings as an 8.8 rating for this piece of fecal material is absurd! I am by no means a brag and have spent many hours enjoying the classic porn movies of the 70s and 80s; But this is inferior product, even by the more loyal standards of the (then illegal) deer loop.
