The only reason why "The Norliss Tapes" deserves ALL stars is the presence of Angie Dickinson in the casting. Other than seeing Angie Baby in a pre- "Police Woman" performance, there is nothing else worth seeing here. <br /> <br /> SYNOPSIS: <br /> <br /> *** MINOR SPOILERS ** * <br /> <br /> David Norliss is brave to write a book about supernatural. One day he mysteriously disappears after calling his publisher and suggests that he has stumbled upon something that has put him in deadly danger. The entire series, for which this miserable pilot was written, was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks via "Norliss tapes" - a set of audio tapes recorded by the author during the investigation of supernatural cases. <br /> <br /> In the pilot episode, a wealthy sculptor dies - but not before he buys an ancient Egyptian scarab from a local occultist who assures him that bauble will give him immortality after death. We soon discover that the ring itself does not provide immortality. Instead, it only resuscitates the sculptor's body so that he can escape his crypt so that he can run around the city draining beautiful girls of all their blood. Blue-Face, Yellow-Eyes, and Trenching ARRRHHHHHHHs You Have Heard Didn't hear, since you last saw "Scooby Doo" comics, the sculptor attacks his wife (Dickinson) a dark evening. She escapes, and through a common acquaintance, he contacts Norliss for help in solving the mystery behind his deceased husband's creepy again on his property. So is this guy a vampire? No. There is no vampire in this story despite what you may have read or heard. The sculptor does not drink the blood of his victims - he gathers it. How? Do not know. We only see him attack and never gather. Why? To fulfill the second part of his bid for immortality. It turns out that the reanimated sculptor is only allowed to live forever if he builds a lifestyle statue of a demon called Sargoth out of a mixture of clay and human blood. When it's finished, Sargoth plans to inhabit the statue by using it as its entry into our world. The final analysis: <br /> <br /> "The Norliss Tapes" was not picked up as a series of very good reasons ... it was garbage. As you can see from my synopsis, history is a scary, unimaginable mess. The action and dialogue do not offer better. This is not even a struggle for a "So bad is the good" price. Sometimes bad is just bad. After years of hearing underground rumblings about the great benefits of "The Norliss Tapes", I was very excited to find it on Fox Movie Channel on 10/15/03. I wish I hadn't set myself up for the fall. <br /> <br /> Having screened this groaner for the first time two days ago, I can only assume any applause you've heard so far, from other IMDB reviewers, coming from those who review the show based on bad memories and youth's nostalgia. Or maybe they are simply loyal fans of Dan Curtis. In some way, they have offered you misleading reviews of "The Norliss Tapes." <br /> <br /> Pauly Orchid - October 17, 2003
