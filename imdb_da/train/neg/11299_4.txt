The mother's tomb begins with a review of the events of The Mummy's Hand, and then moves the story forward for several years and over the ocean to the United States, where the current high priest and mummy Kharis have pronounced to destroy and avenge those who previously violated the tomb. <br /> <br /> While I absolutely loved "The Mummy" with Boris Karloff as Imhotep's mummy and liked "The Mummy's Hand" with Tom Tyler as Kharis (who is the direct prequel to this movie), I became not taken with "The Mummy's Tomb". It is made in a similar style to the previous movie and has a somewhat similar plot albeit in a new setting. Lon Chaney Jr. is okay as Kharis, but doesn't really stand out. And I think it's my biggest criticism of this movie - that nothing really stands out. There is nothing really terrible here, but nothing really excellent either, so the viewer is back with a rather bland mother's tale.
