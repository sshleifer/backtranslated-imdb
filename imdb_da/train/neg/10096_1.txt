This movie should be the worst I have ever seen. The title of the film deceives the audience into thinking there might be hope. The film's history line is at best ridiculous, with the play so poor you just have to ring. The title 'Zombie Nation' involves a shadow of zombies when there are actually six in total. This cannot be categorized as a horror movie because of the introduction of cheesy 80's music when the zombies attack. The zombies actually speak and act like people in the movie, the only difference being the make-up that looks like something out of a La Roux video. If you ever get the chance to buy this movie, do it and then burn the copy.
