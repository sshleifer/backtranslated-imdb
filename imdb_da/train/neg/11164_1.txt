What a disappointment! <br /> <br /> This movie seemed to be trying to copy the cutting edge comedy, but the direction and the manuscript were sloppy, sick and sentimental in the worst movie tradition. Jack Black's acting / role was self-reliant and self-conscious ... and the other characters were just as unnoticed and uninteresting. The soundtrack was boring. We are (WERE) fans of Black, but none of us made more than many a forced look for the duration. Why did he feel he needed to make this mistake? <br /> <br /> We won't see another of his movies without reading reviews more carefully first !! <br /> <br /> Was he full when he read the script before joining this drive?
