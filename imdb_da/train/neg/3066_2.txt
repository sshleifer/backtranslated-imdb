This is a horrible remake of a marginal but successful movie from the early 70s. I've seen the original at least 6 times. The 1997 edition is a 20 minute movie 'crammed' for 2 hours or whatever rest time is. Cheesy storyline, which by the way is completely different from the original. The great government's involvement was far out. There is no power from one scene to the next. In the original you could take a beer or beat the bathroom and still stop. <br /> <br /> Changing the oil pan on the car only took a few hours of movie time. It takes many times longer than in real life. Car guys notice these things. Also, the fool or fool who chose to separate a 1968 charger and abuse a challenger from 1970, must be shot in the heel with a dull ball. The fact that they are not 'car people' is painfully obvious and their transitory will not be taken care of. <br /> <br /> Actors lacked emotion, everything was cut and dried. A step above a monotone. A barmitzvah is more exciting and energetic. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, radio DJ made the impression that Challenger hit the 180 or 185 (??) bulldozer. It's total waste. Can you say aerodynamics or lack thereof? Hahahaha !! This movie is a joke. Don't waste your time watching this one.
