When I was a kid, I remember seeing this while visiting a friend of our "Uncle" Phil. We are back! A Dinosaur's Story is a silly cartoon of a dinosaur called Rex (pronounced by the wonderful John Goodman). He tells a little boy dinosaur the story of how the dinosaurs came back to Earth to live. He explains that he was part of what brought them back with some friends. The doctor / professor's villain of this movie, I believe, could have been responsible for being back, but I don't care about him. The kids like this, but it is personal just for cheesy. John Goodman was probably the only decent thing. Poor!
