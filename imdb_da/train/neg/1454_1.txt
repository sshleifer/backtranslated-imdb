I recently watched this movie twice and I don't seem to understand why the decision makers made this pile of crap. I mean yes, it gives a good impression of Hitler's environment, and I mean how they reproduced Austria in the late 1890s, WWI and the war. What I cannot understand is why they depicted Hitler as a 100% pure evil, crazy, unreliable, mentally unstable freak. He was, after all, a very thoughtful, loving and intelligent man who of course had his dark sides without a doubt about it. But why does he portray him this way in the name of heaven? All his positive aspects have been cut out of the scenario and leave nothing but a very propaganda-like portrait of a man who ever had the greatest influence on modern civilization. Yes, he threw Germany into the devastating World War II. Yes, he was racist, and yes, he was sometimes menically unstable, especially at the end of the war. All true. But again; why in hell did they beat LIE to the public? To warn us? <br /> <br /> I absolutely don't think this movie was a warning. The true danger for Hitler and the Nazis was that they were able to rise to power in moments of severe global weakness. The fact that this evil was so recognizable, yet embraced by almost all German alive (not to mention Austrians and a lot of others) makes it a warning to modern civilization, NOT the fact that Hitler was such a " weird ". If it had been as the creators made us believe - I would have been convinced that the German people were being retarded. A man like that in this movie would never have got anywhere near the party leader - not to mention the ReichsKanzler. <br /> <br /> 4/10
