This whole movie should have lasted 45 minutes - maximum. Although an interesting concept / theme, it did not develop as a story. Once the idea of ​​a brave (stupid?) Bombing expert (cowboy?) Is introduced and happens very early in the movie, the rest is repetitive. Characters were not explored and aspects of location and politics were ignored. There was some good insight into the terrible difficulties troops had in such an alien environment, and the difficulty of distinguishing between friend and enemy. But the way in which the device ran out of faith! Individual performances were good and special effects were adequate, but not enough to overcome the basic lack of content.
