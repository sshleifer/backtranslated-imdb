After seeing the previews, I felt that this movie would be a great improvement over the fast and furious series. So I have already expected to have a missing story, but at least this time it won't be loaded with a bunch of powerless civics with speed cans. Unfortunately, I was wrong. If you could only imagine a Fast & Furious movie with a worse storyline than at least, the movie is for you. <br /> <br /> This is the worst movie I had ever seen (I'm good - no, I wouldn't take baseball bat for my nuts as others have said). Not only was the story non-existent, but the action was also wrong. I think the director thought they could just throw bunch of females and exotic cars and then call it a movie. For example, there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the nos button, and his Lamborghini takes off and flies over a McLaren SLR to win. And after the bit where Eddy Griffin came in a fight with one of her "girls" (an Imus comment would work in this case) the girl asks to retire and get out of the PLANE and of course they are in the middle of desert. After this wonderful scene I couldn't take it anymore. So I only got to see half of this monstrosity. This is the first movie I had ever gone on. Afterwards I had to stop for some drinks to kill all my broken brain cells. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 1 because 0 is not an option. You better go to the local car show and stop at a strip on the way home. I will keep all viewers in my prayers.
