"What happens when you give a homeless man $ 100,000?" As if asking the question, they are somehow morally released by what will ultimately happen. The creators of "Reversal of Fortune" are trying to get their voyeuristic giggles while hiding their antics as a kind of responsible social experiment. They take Ted, a homeless man in Pasadena, and give him $ 100,000 to see if he wants to turn his life around. Then, with the most manageable guidance and advice, they only let go of their joyful way. What are they trying to say? "Money can't buy you happiness?" "The homeless are homeless because they deserve to be?" Or how about, "Lift a man up - it's fun to see him fall from a higher altitude." They took a man with nothing to lose, gave him something to lose, and saw that he dumped it all into the drain. It should be entertainment? They dress this up with some bleak music and dramatic camera images, but in the end, it has all the moral heights in car crash videos - only this time they constructed the car, crashed and asked, "What happens when you stop a sign?"
