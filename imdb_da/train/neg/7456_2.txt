This may not be the worst comedy from all the time, but it is close. The producers of this movie stole an hour and a half in my life and I want it back! Chris Kattan is fun for approx. 10 minutes. His high-altitude voice and crazy flailing begin to grow old, and then you realize that the rest of the movie is much worse. He falls into a large number of former SNLs who have tried filming. Some have been brilliant, some have failed miserably. There is not much intermediate in this category. Although Chris Farley was brilliant and so okay, and then not so funny and so dead ... so I suppose he hits the whole spectrum in a career. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie like the plague. <br /> <br /> c
