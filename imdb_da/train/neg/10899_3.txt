Cheap and fun blistering boring story and acting. Not a single good line, not even a line that is bad enough to be good and no memorable delivery. Even the blooper roll that came with the DVD showed how indecent the actors were and how much fun any of them had. The esoteric and occult foundations were apathetic unauthorized, and the antagonists were not scary or credible. The "homoerotic" overtones were meaningless tame and dissatisfied and were limited to young boys caressing their coffins while they were sleeping in their boxes. I'm not gay enough to appreciate it, but a little action could at least keep me and my girlfriend awake.
