I don't really know what this movie is about. It is like a student's art school project. They never say why the world is dark, but it is always dark except seconds a day. There are long interruptions of insects of any kind without reason. Which little dialogue is in the movie is just as indecent and indecent as the pictures. A black woman goes into the main character's apartment. In one way or another she becomes pregnant overnight, so it gets shot in the head. The protagonist takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon, after which a white naked woman appears. I've never been so blown away by how bad and pointless a movie can be. Honestly, I want someone to see it so they can tell me what they think it is about. But I would not want this level of hell on anyone else.
