Slaughter High is inherently your emblematic 80s slasher flick. A prank goes out of hand and leaves a geeky guy terribly burnt. A few years later, the nerdy guy turns back and starts killing the people who hit him. Now the story may sound exciting and very entertaining, but what makes this horrible movie so different from the rest of the 80's slasher flicks is that it has some humorous mistakes and continuation errors. The play is terrible, but in fact not as bad as you would suspect. Although it does not help that any character in the film is so grody and unlikely. The management, Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) is the biggest annoyance of the individual and she is the one we seem to share compassion and peace for. Not to mention, the geeky guy is almost too geeky, and I think even stereotypical geeks would be awful and just offended by how miserable he was, so when he was painted, someone really cares about? <br /> <br /> There is very unintentional laughter potential. Munro's lack of acting talent is quite evident, putting her at the same level as the rest of the horrible cast. However, it is most enjoyable when the movie is badly trying to make up Munro, which in the mid-30s is like a teenager among teenagers. And then when it comes to later life, and Munro plays around in his real age, the rest of the cast doesn't go as adults. It all goes well with a theme song, there is a hilarious bag of heavy metal thrash accompanied by maniacal laughter and a voice shrieking "I get you." With that said, Slaughter High is really not a very good slasher flick, but it has a bad cheesy entertainment value to it. Perhaps an important one for hardcore slasher fans, but don't expect dilemma, excitement or any credibility from it. Terrible!!!
