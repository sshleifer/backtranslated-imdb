Well, AWFUL is just the first name. This movie is a cliché-ridden piece of junk. A high school comedy set up in a military training camp. I'm sorry I had to give this one star as it didn't deserve. <br /> <br /> THIS MAG CONTAINS SPOILERS: <br /> Just about everything is completely forced, convincing and unrealistic. The HEPO (Military Police) will not come to you if you do not make your appearance, especially on your wedding day. The actors were rather embarrassed by this scene because the scene didn't work as it was so much unlikely. You can sense it in their voices. Even if they were not so bad actors, they would not have been able to save the scene. <br /> <br /> The next guy should train in his wedding dress. No, there was no time to get him a uniform first. Man, this is great movie! I will remember this scene for the rest of my life. <br /> <br /> There is also GIRLS in the camp - exciting - one of them is a model, although I don't see the big one - and the worst actress I've ever seen. I doubt in Hollywood that they would let her say a single line in a B movie. <br /> <br /> Okay girls in the military! Now it's fun. The girls are even located on the same floor so we can sneak into their room at night! In fact, they will be located in another building a quarter mile away, separated by two fences with barbed wire. <br /> <br /> There are thoughts available that we can use for a fun trip in our spare time, of which we have plenty. No, tanks are not locked and the ignition keys are inserted. No one will notice the sounds of the engine, especially not at night. <br /> <br /> There is a bunch of sex scenes and references and everyone is under the waste line. We need them, so the sexually occupied Germans also like the movie. Switzerland is too small a market for any feature film. Well done! <br /> <br /> A sex scene takes place in the kitchen. Surely none of these facilities are ever locked. The military routines are as sloppy as they can get. <br /> <br /> At the end of the brainless flip, the mafia hit men of revenge on the poor guy trying to shoot him! Because he left his fiancee! Sure I buy it, the Italians are that way - a jealous pile (not). <br /> <br /> The evil guys are trying to do this in open daylight with two dozen eyewitnesses. Not at night in a dark hill. Again, military training spaces (where there is live ammunition shooting) are open to the public, all of them can freely drive or enter there. There are no such things as guards or fences. <br /> <br /> Death, however, is prevented by the good captain who is currently launching a rocket into the Italian car. The explosion paves the hit men and the furious fiancé out of their feet. No one at 40 meters distance is injured when the car is blowing for forges. It's a comedy, remember. <br /> <br /> Okay. It's a comedy I have, and I can live with it. No realism needed. Filmmakers can easily get along with this if it is fun, parting fun or entertaining, interesting, challenging. Unfortunately, none of them. It's just embarrassing. A rip-off from brainless American comedies. The latter is at least done professionally without amateur players. It's pretty boring and predictable, a waste of time and energy, especially for those who pass through the entire movie, which I unfortunately did. Yawn.
