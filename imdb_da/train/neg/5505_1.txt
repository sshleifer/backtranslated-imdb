Shazbot, this is embarrassing. In fact, here is a list of 100 that embarrasses: 1.) a failed comeback for Christopher Lloyd. 2.) Jeff Daniels basically plays the same role he played in the live 101 Dalmatian remake, which was not too juicy at first. He probably has a fun way to promote his Purple Rose Theater. 3.) Disney fly. 4.) Another disappointing reminder that Wallace Shawn is to Disney, what Jet Li was to Bob Hoskins in the solution. 5.) Ray Walston, the original martian of the TV series, played a bit (read "cameo") in this flick and died two years later by lupus. Coincidence? 6.) horrible special effects. Seriously - terrible. 7.-100.) The horrible speaker, adorable suit spoken to an annoying degree by Wayne Knight ("Newman!"). My favorite scene? HA! Ha ha, ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ... Whew! ... Good one. You - You're a joker. Okay, let's enclose this review with a moment of silence for this franchise's disturbing death, and if you wish, you can say a quick prayer that Disney doesn't forget this travesty and does something silly as a movie adaptation of "Mork and Mindy" with Tim Allen ............................................. .. ..........
