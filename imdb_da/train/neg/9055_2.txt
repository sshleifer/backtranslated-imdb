Being a fan of Billy Bob Thornton and the diversity of his abilities, I noticed this movie and I was surprised that I hadn't heard of it. <br /> <br /> I had traveled more than usual during both periods it was filmed in 2000 and when it hit theaters more than 2-1 / 2 years later (the time is the first clue was not good at the production ). <br /> <br /> Now, Patrick Swayze can't shop for sour apples, but Thornton has more than enough ability to make up for the difference between them. And Charlize Theron is a person whom it would be a pleasure to see, even though it showed her to see paint dry. <br /> <br /> I was curious I checked this product's production information. It made a huge <$ 600 a. Screen its opening weekend, and just over $ 400 each after its month's theater run in the latter 2002. Overall gross was $ 261K, which I doubt could cover the cast and crew hotel and food for a week at the location. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty benign, and even the use of Reno's usually interesting location is as boring as the rest of the time. <br /> <br /> It is something that several SNL bits were all stuck together, none individually too big at all, and the overall presentation even worse. Either way, the cost of this production should be substantial - though everyone worked for less than their usual fees - so the only thing that made it a barely tolerable opus was the quality of the movie and Billy Bob's presence (though understandably something laconic here Compared to his usual work.) Think of the three amazing, completely different characters he portrayed in "Sling Blade", "Bandits" and "Bad Santa" and you know he understood this work wa under standard, long before viewers got the opportunity to confirm this. One star for himself here and one because the production was better than the typical "Lifetime" flip.
