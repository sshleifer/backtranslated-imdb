This was a movie I always wanted to watch as it was released Promos were eye-catching and Govinda in a negative role was a surprise <br /> <br /> But the movie isn't that good <br /> <br /> have many mistakes. The start is good, and to the murder everything goes well, but the film falls flat when the romance track starts between Govinda and Karisma and the songs that follow. <br /> <br /> So, twist about Govinda and Tabu revolves around falling in love with more doubts and shortcomings, and when does Govinda come to a rich criminal from a poor villager? The last feedback is also long lasting and also the entire clash between Govinda-Karisma and Tabu <br /> <br /> N Chandra drawers Music is okay, Bahot Khoobsurat stands out <br /> <br /> Govinda tries a negative role and do it very well in it, though he exaggerates it too much at times charisma is good but annoy at times with her crying taboo is okay Nirmal pandey still does not know the difference between loud screaming and functioning rest is okay y
