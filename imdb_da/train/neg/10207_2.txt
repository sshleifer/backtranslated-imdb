Alfred Hitchcock invented any kind of thriller you could think of: he set the standards so high that any director making a thriller movie will be poorly compared to him. <br /> <br /> The main topic of this Bullock vehicle, all the Ideas, was almost everything in Hitchcock's classic "Rope": the two students committing a gratuitous crime, Nietsche's philosophy, and the traces scattered by the boys were the master the first to transfer them to the screen. And with a eighty-minute movie, which was a technically nodding tour de force. <br /> <br /> "Murder by numbers" does not take place in a single room that "ropes", imagine. And what a supreme originality it puts two police against the evil youth and you will never guess it. These two policemen are very different: in fact, Bullock plays the part of the woman who lives as a man, and her partner (Chaplin) is as shy as a clueless girlie. The two boys performances are not really strange, not as good as it says Edward Norton in "primal fear". <br /> <br /> Now, you know, "Rope" was so good ....
