I will count on Alice's plot, after surviving the previous part of the nightmare series, Freddy Krueger finds deadly dreams to start again. This time, the scary killer is striking through Alice's unborn child's sleeping mind. His intention is to be "born again" in the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice release her spirit in time to save her own son? This movie started really well when we see Alice dream of being Amanda Kruger, who is stuck in the living room and being raped by 100 Manics, so she is shaken to the hospital, but then she is no longer the pregnant lady but she Amanda feeds Freddy again. <br /> <br /> Alice and Dan are the only two people returning from the 4th movie and then having some new friends. It is not long before Freddy starts to kill again. I liked the first dead it okay, not as good as the other deaths or dreams. Freddy himself didn't seem to be scary in this movie, the nightmare was just boring, they weren't scary or scary at all. <br /> <br /> Acting in movies was okay for a fifth movie in the series, but generally I think this movie was really Dull. (Not the worst movie in the series, Freddy Dead is the worst) <br /> <br /> 4/10
