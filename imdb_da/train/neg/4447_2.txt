Yes there are worse movies out there. Most of them made for fun, on a shoe strict budget, or as a tsv. movie this week, but even though it was 'movie of the week', it would not judge more than two stars. It's a bad movie about a serious topic with a battered woman flying the slime king into the protective arms of the daring people's king. (If this is an attempt to show that she does not need a man to protect her, but that you are superfluouse for the movie and should not be at all). It has no tension, no sign development and a heroine that could be lubricated by a rat onion. (I think she flushes her wedding ring on a boat with a separate tank, instead of just dropping it overboard in the ocean (where her body must be anyway) and after the man finds her and shows that she is a moron, she still makes childish assumptions that cause her to be almost killed.) I am always amazed when I see that kind of high rating a movie that this one gets, and it makes me realize that Dr. Seuss still has a large untapped market for people who would be challenged by his work. After I finish living on humanity I cry.
