On the way back from IMC6 (San Jose, California), all five (remind you, three of us stubborn Kamal fans) had unanimously made a decision; VV was solid crap and thanks to the film we had a beautiful screw up Monday. Not to mention, we vowed to stay out of the theaters for the next year. I don't want to blame Kamal here because he kind of fell into a recent interview with the Madan comic (on Vijay TV). He said something about "Tamizh Cinema'la Photography, Editing'la namba munnera'a maadri Manus, Direction, Acting'la innum namba munnera'la" (Tamil Cinema has grown in terms of photography and editing, but we are hardly improved, When it comes to manuscripts, direction and action ". While looking at VV, these words are very true. <br /> <br /> Now here are the 10 reasons to hate this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> 2. Harris Jeyaraj <br /> <br /> 3. Harris Jeyaraj I barely keep using expletives here, but Fakta is that HJ has mastered good ability to turn up every recent movie of his (remember 'Anniyan', 'Ghajini') with the crushing cacophony he counts as background music. Next time I have thrombocytosis, he pays it. <br /> <br /> 4. Songs Sometimes the songs do not help to move the film's story spatially or temporarily, nor do they get you started and notice.The film feels like it is made of four very long songs e with a few scenes throw in between them. <br /> <br /> 5. A card gone too far. VV at best is suitable for being a short story, not a 2 hour plus "thriller". To use a clich√© here like the Energizer rabbit, it goes on and on; Only in this case will you not have it. The later part of a movie feels like a big move. <br /> <br /> 6. Kamal-Jothika mating Two ice cubes rubbed together could have produced more sparks than this wire pairing. There is no reason why you would root for them to do it together. In fact, every time they come together in the second half of the movie, they make a good annoyance to the story. Hate to say this, but Kamalini Mukerjhe's 10 minute romancing does more than what Kamal and Jothika achieve in this movie plus 'Thenali'. <br /> <br /> 7. Kamal Haasan accent Kamal has this pretentious accent that no one speaks either in India or in the United States; And it's not new either. He has done so since 'Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae'. It simply comes on the nerve. Imagine what chaos it can cause when his flair of using this weird accent meets on-site shooting in the United States. He also does not leave it at immigration. He offers advice to his men (confused TN Cops from Keeranor, Sathoor and beyond) in throwing Kamanglish ("We have a clean bad political wok here"), of course, with nausea. <br /> <br /> 8. Logic There are a few directors that you expect to stand up to a certain scale. Gautam fails us badly with some brittle performance in the common sense department. Which D.C.P in his senses would meet his love interests on the streets to discuss such relationships as committing oneself and life! The scene inside the theater was so bad, against the climax; we could hear people behind us loudly challenging the heroes IQ. "Is he stupid, can't he just use his Siren or Lights?" (On a busy Madras road, Kamal-the-cop-on-a-police-Jeep fights a guy on a bike like any ordinary guy!). "Can't he just use his gun?" ("The guy on a bike" starts on foot and we have a fully geared Kamal in the hunt for a long time). I'm not voting for it later, but I'm just trying to explain the mood inside. <br /> <br /> 9. Gore & Violence If I wanted to see women being raped, their throats were cut, more women were raped and thrown into the bushes with eerie authenticity, I would sit at home and rather see a "Police Report" or "Kuttram". The use of excessive violence should go in a way to extend history, not overwhelming it! Somewhere down the line, Gautum seems confused about what the extensions (rape, murder) are and what the pin is (the story)! <br /> <br /> 10. Even a double shot Espresso couldn't get the pain out of his head.
