I saw the DVD (called BLACK WIDOW in the US) and later felt it was a really horrible movie. But they have to cut out a little bit of the original movie, or I missed a lot. The sex scenes had very little vulgarity and no nudity (not even a breast), but I have read several other comments on IMDb.com to mention the vulgarity and something about a tampon. I didn't see such a thing, just a bad, boring movie with unlikely signs and a pace, sophomoric plot. Giada Colagrande is either paralyzed or botoxed to the golden, and nary an expression hits her face. And her name makes me think of super-dimensioning a drink at Taco Bell: "I have the Cola Grande!" It was actually fun, it was so bad I had to play as I was in my own Mystery Science Theater 3000 and noticed things like the fact that Dafoe's skin is too big for the face. It's really like silly pussy!
