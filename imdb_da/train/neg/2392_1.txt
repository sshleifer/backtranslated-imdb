We actually saw this twice in the theater because we couldn't believe how bad it was for the first time. Maybe we had missed something ... no, it was missing from the beginning of the pre-production. I actually went back to Robbin's novel to see if I could find the problem, and I discovered that what I thought was fun and exciting back in the day is just as much disconnected and unclear. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the original problem with the film decided to do it at all, and the rest of the train wreck went away. Absolutely nothing seems - not a blessed thing. Some beautiful exterior photography gets steamed by random camera placement in interior pictures. All the actors at least look uncomfortable - Angie Dickenson looks positive - except Rain Phoenix, who gives the impression she's too ignorant to realize how terrible her performance really is. The dialogue is a long, inevitable cringe. Scenes do not make sense from second to second, and the connections between them are non-existent. And yet the film stumbles blindly, convinced it says something deep. <br /> <br /> It's too bad to even be fun; It is simply uncomfortable. Gus Van Zant has made other great movies that I encourage you to watch, and I'm glad he survived (and seems to have learned) this mess.
