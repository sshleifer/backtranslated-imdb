While I watch the movie, I'm not sure what direstion it was to take. There is a reason why an author should not correct his work and even act in it too, you cannot do everything. I felt the story really suffered from this movie because the instructor had so many hats. Ms McTeer is the movie. To add to her amazing talents, her portrayal of this woman was why I was engaged. Here is a British actress who can do anything. In my opinion, conflict is what makes drama and a great story. I felt this movie didn't. Everything was somewhat easy for the characters, there were no real obstacles that prevented chahracters from getting what they wanted. Watch the movie for sweetness, but most of all for Ms. McTeer's amazing performance.
