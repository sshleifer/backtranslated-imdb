The five or so really good westerns that Mann made are unsurpassed as a Hollywood ensemble. Even John Ford has never done so many with so much quality. The curious thing about them all is how uneven they are. Ford's Darling Clementine is worth about two and a half of any of them. Or at least two. <br /> <br /> The real hero of them besides Mann and Stewart is Chase. Chase is responsible for the brilliant Red River. Chase wrote far country, bending the river and probably some others. But none of them are as finished as My Darling Clementine, but so few films, western or otherwise. <br /> <br /> Each of the five movies in Mann has big holes, or is it six, let's see. Bend, Far, Westman, Furies, Winchester 73, and yep, six, Naked Spur. Each has magnificent scene after magnificent scene, with rather sharp deviations. Yet, it also makes the red river, which is still the single largest western ever. So perfection is not everything. <br /> <br /> But the distant land has large, large holes. It's mawkish, and really comes alive only when Stewart and Mc Entire are locking horns. The rest is beautiful pedestrian, with the usual exception of Mann's camera. Mann's camera is a one-man filmography course. It's just as good an eye as anyone who has ever got behind a strip of moving film. It's almost never in the wrong place, never. <br /> <br /> The highland has a fantastic moment. And as it comes from Stewart. No one in the history of the cinema has ever received physical punishment with this man's authority. He is absolutely amazing: look at him in Bend, Dad, Winchester and Man from Laramie: in Bend has been beaten and hangs in a thread so credible, and with such boiling hatred he looks as if someone has been driven from Dachau. is shot out of a fleet with such violence, it looks so convincing that you are overthrowing, and of course when pulled through the fire in Man, you find yourself looking for the brand names. What an actor. Not to mention the moment in Winchester, when he gets up early in the hotel room, it is as good as anyone ever did. <br /> <br /> But it was Man's territory: look at Gary Cooper fighting with Jack Lord in the West of Man. As painful as any fight scene ever recorded. Cooper, while not as convincing as Stewart, is still similar to being exhausted at the end of the fight. In short, none, but none, but no one ever showed man in extremities as well as man. <br /> <br /> What a great, wonderful instructor. <br /> <br /> See all Western he has ever made. They are his real monuments, though everyone is scetchy. But then what. When he roars with his amazing scenes, they are as good as anyone, including Ford. And his six westerns as an ensemble are the best ever made by anyone, period. <br /> <br /> Thanks Anthony.
