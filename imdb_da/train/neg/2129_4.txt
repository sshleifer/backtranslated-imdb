In my humble opinion, this version of the great BDWY musical has only two things going for it - Tyne Daly and the fact that there is now a filmed version with the original script. (OK Vanessa Williams is good to see.) But for me, there is everything there is. Most of the casts seem to go through the show - Chynna Phillips doesn't know who Kim really is and no wonder people go over Harry McAfee when played by George Wendt, who looks like he'd rather be back on a bar stool in Boston . Jason Alexander is acceptable, but the gem must go and I saw better dance in Bugsy Malone. As I mentioned, it is good to have a version of the scene script now, but I hope the young people out there who have never seen a musical, DO NOT judge them all about this.
