In the United States there have been very few films about Rome that were not set at the time of Julius Caesar or shortly thereafter. Hollywood's sword and sandalepics mostly have a Christian theme, making it difficult to enter previous Roman history (Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule and encountered some opposition in Hollywood because it did not have Jesus in it) . /> <br /> It is interesting to see at least one picture that not only takes place before Caesar and Christ but is set when Rome was only a city among many on the Italian peninsula and had just poured out the hated king Tarquin and formed the republic. <br /> <br /> But this is not a historical movie; it is peplum, and although the production values ​​are not bound, plays and characterizations are cardboard. I can only imagine what the dialogue was like in Italian, but with English training in wood it is very campy. I got a couple of good laughs out of it first. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen many movies of this genre since they missed most Hercules movies from the 60s. It's fun up to a point, but when the movie continues, it gets a little boring. One thing is for sure: if I had seen this movie when I was ten, I would have loved it. At that age I went for something with the Romans and swordsmen in it. So at least this flick brought back some childhood memories.
