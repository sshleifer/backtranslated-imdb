Just what we need! Another remake of vintage Hollywood movie theater, with Eddie Murphy re-ignored in his second time after THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996)! This shows why we run out of special ideas to make a quality movie, ladies and gentlemen! It has some signs of hope for its sympathetic and lovely imaging of animals that can act and talk to humans. Things can only get worse, unfortunately. Bathroom jokes and sexual references kill this kind of "family" jumble immediately. Even parents and children saw the trailer ad on The Family Channel, which was followed by complete anxiety and disgust at the cinema. Sad to say this is the more progressive pre-millennium era, but enjoy it while it lasts because things can only get worse over time. Several went wrong with the brand new DR. Dolittle. It is completely unpleasant, feels too flat. I also hate the annoying voice of Chris Rock !!! We need more talented voice-overs than a bunch of overpaid celebs who don't want to declare bankruptcy. I have to agree on my local newspaper, which gives this among the top five worst movies from 1998. Then again, the original version was not good either. Murphy's next project may be PATTON if he is not careful!
