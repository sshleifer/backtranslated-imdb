I just looked at it. A few laughs, but nothing to write home about. Jason Lee looked like he was having fun. The (long) DVD gag reel is almost entirely made up of him who is fit for uncontrollable laughter. Selma Blair seemed to clock a clock, but again she had to be a stick in the mud, so "well done" do I think? Jim Brolin was surprisingly fun. (Being married to Babs can't be a picnic.) The soundtrack was hip and eclectic. Larry Miller, who played Julia Stile's father (hilarious), in 10 things I hate about you, is also fun here. He's great, but the best aspect of this movie was the casting of Julia Stiles. I could spend two hours watching her fold laundry and I have what I just did.
