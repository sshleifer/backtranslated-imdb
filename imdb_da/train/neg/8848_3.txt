Somewhere buried very deep inside this movie is a half-way decent movie trying to get out. The only tracks are a few early stages in Los Angeles (in a bar and a cemetery) and then a few production designs. As I say, buried very deeply. One of the greatest challenges for movies involving the supernatural is how to get signs of responding reliably in incredible situations. Annie Mcenroe's response to being told that her sister (presumably Dee Wallace from the first movie) is (was?) A werewolf is, if I remember, consistent with; "Really?". Not one of the better answers to that challenge. The non-sequiters continue as the story moves to Trannsylvania to seek the Stirba (apparently self-proclaimed) "Werewolves Queen". Like Stirba, Sybil Danning is the two best things in the film. Yes, even better than the werewolf group-sex scene, Reb Brown's acting, and the odd simian-looking werewolves. The final credits have assumed less playful status and are available in all their honor (at least until the sensor finds them) on Youtube. Check them out to see why and remember, the whole movie makes the same sense. If you happen to catch this on American television, the credits have been edited to replace the endless repeated shot of Danning, ripping off her top with another infinitely repeated shot of her ripping, opening a cloak only this time, she has some kind of top at the bottom. It's a kind of absurd, cherry-on-top moment that challenges satire.
