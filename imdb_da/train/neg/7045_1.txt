This must be the worst and I think worst biker movies ever made! And it says a lot because the stinking string is long and smelly! Now, at least we know what happened to Ginger after she was saved from Gilligan's Island! A frightened look Tina Louise (she was probably afraid someone would see this mess!) Is a stranded motorist who is plagued by the most repulsive motorcycle band in film history. But quiet, not fans! Batman, I mean Adam West as a hick-town doctor comes to the rescue! Pow! Crush! Boom! Holy Toledo Batman! <br /> <br /> The only good points in this "bomb" are some cute women, some ridiculous fighting scenes and the still "sexy" Tina Louise!
