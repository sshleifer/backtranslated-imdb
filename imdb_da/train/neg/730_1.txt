I haven't seen the first movie, and if anything like this doesn't have any great desire to. <br /> <br /> Just a few hours ago, I struggle to remember something about it. <br /> <br /> From what I remember, it seems to be a group of very annoying people living with a house with the risky old woman from Friday the 13th and stalked by the wooden board. <br /> <br /> Some people die, the movie ends, I start a law package against the person who sold me this movie, because I want compensation for the missing time of my life. <br /> <br /> I'll pay you Â£ 1 to take this movie out of my hands ...... oh wait I already gave it away to a "friend".
