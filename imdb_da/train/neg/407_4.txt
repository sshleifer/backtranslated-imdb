I love special effects and testify to new technologies that make science fiction a reality. Special effects of this film are very good. I have seen most of this movie since it has been on HBO for the past few months. I must admit I may have missed a few scenes, but I am usually drawn into movies and have seen some scenes more than once. But every time I see something of "Hollow Man" I feel depressed, almost like a "movie noir". I'm not sure why; Perhaps it is that I do not want Kevin Bacon to be evil and there is disappointment in it. But I think it's witnessing how loud he is. Whether I can recommend this movie for excitement (although some parts are moving slowly), but I do NOT recommend to under 14s (maybe 12 if they are mature).
