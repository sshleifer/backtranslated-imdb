Gayniggers from outer space are a short foreign movie about black, gay aliens exploring the galaxy until they stumble across the earth. Being gay, their goal is to have a male universe where all people are gay. When they discover that women or "female beings" live on Earth, they are initially frightened; Eventually, they decide to remove all women on the planet and liberate the male population. <br /> <br /> An offensive title with a racist, homophobic and sexist history, albeit probably a satire, gives this movie some shocking value. However, there is little substance underneath. As another reviewer pointed out, there are few jokes beyond the character's names (eg, ArmInAss); I think I once laughed at a little gay joke. I think I quickly got the point on the movie, a satire of bad science fiction, but after that I had had enough; I continued to have the movie already ended (and it's a short film!). Not brilliant or especially well-written.
