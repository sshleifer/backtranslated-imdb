What can I say about cruel intentions 2? Well, I can honestly say that I will only see this movie again if I'm attached to a chair and have my eyes opened clockwork-orange-style. <br /> <br /> The movie 'stars' Robin Dunne (No, I've never heard of him either) whose awful impression of Ryan Phillipe made me hug all the way. In the case of terrible casting, Dunne (and fails) tries to continue playing a beautiful charismatic charm. Since the actor is not beautiful, nor charismatic or charming, the character has remained absolutely incredible. Amy Adams (she was in an episode of buffy once), trying to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar slammed and killing Katherine's life ... But Adams is not so good an actress, and her performance was flat and lacking in any real feeling, she often looked like she read a cue card just outside the camera. There were two good actors in the movie, but Barry Flatman (Saw 2 & Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs Kensington in Austion Powers) did very good and entertaining performances like Sebastian's and Catherine's parents and the only reason I judged the movie as a 2, not a 1. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is a bad version of the original, with as low as carbon copy is of dialogue and imitating scenes that lacked the originality of the previous movie. <br /> <br /> I think what a TV show could have worked, but if it had been reworked with people who could actually trade in the main parts.
