Not a bad start to the program - but what a pat on the face of true law enforcement. The worst part of the series is that it tries to count as a real fare - and is anything but. Men and women who dedicate their lives to the enforcement of laws deserve better than this. What is the next medical school in a moment? Charo does lipo? Charles Grodin helps in a hip replacement? C'mon ... show some respect. Even citizens of Muncie are outreaching the program as staged. Police Academy = Gymnasium Gymnasium? Bad editing (how many times can they use the Taco Bell car in the background?), Cheesy siren effects (same loop added ad nauseum to each call "about rolling code or not) and last but not least - more officers security issues than you could shake a stick. <br /> <br /> If I want to see produced police and clever false police, I would see RENO 911.
