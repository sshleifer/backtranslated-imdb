Remake by H.B. Halicki's classic 70's chase film is simply horrible. Along with the vanishing point, Gone in 60 Seconds is represented by the characteristic billiard films. Remake takes the original and stands upside down. While Halicki gave us 75% car ticket and 25% support drama, in GISS 2000 we get 25% car ticket and 75% support drama. Cage as super man, saves his brother, kisses the girl. MTV edits, breasts and ass. Save your money, rent the original. In any case, Halicki did not live to see his baby (he wrote, produced, directed and starred in '74' movies) in this way.
