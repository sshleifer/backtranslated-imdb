A battleship sinks ... Its survivors, hanging on a nearby liferaft, are sitting there doing nothing while entering each of their minds for a series of long feedbacks. Although Noel Coward's name is just one that you notice under the credits, all that is cinematic in it is because of Lean. And on technical terms it is very good. David Lean only knew movies from get-go. There are many moments when Coward's investigated dialogue takes a different seat, and Lee's visual sense takes the central stage. Try the soldiers to get out of the ship near the end and the whole scene; The trace shot in the direction of the hymn song, the scene where we are inside a house being bombed. <br /> <br /> Noel Coward is one of the worst actors I've ever seen. He is completely tree that does not show emotion, character or humanity. You can see in his eyes that he is not really listening to what the other performer is saying, he is just waiting for them to finish so he can get out of his own line. <br/> <br /> 7/10. /> <br /> Its episodic, slightly repetitive, and flashbacks overwhelm the story: There is no central story, the progress just giving general insight into the characters. Still, it's an interesting movie to watch - and a good debut for Lean. It's not a very deep or penetrating movie, and it's definitely a propaganda movie, but it is also a showcase of Lean's editing skills - it's about how the pieces are put together.
