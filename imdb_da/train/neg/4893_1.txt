The movie is actually too slow. There are some nice pictures, but it cannot make up for the movie to be boring. You see a sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and a relationship while eating a melon and maybe a little more. It may even sound interesting to anyone, but believe me to see it for 2 hours is not fun at all. Although you laugh several times, but it's really not enough, and it can be more out of despair and disbelieve than fun. In order to disturb the boredom, the director tries to put a few movie videos in the movie. They are really colorful clips of absurd songs perhaps from the 50s, but it's hard to say exactly, and they are trying to be fun so hard that it's really upset. Several times you have the feeling that the plot can evolve into something that creates a strong scene, but eventually it just evaporates in one way or another and that is it. Next to the cliffs there are almost no dialogues, let alone music. The director tries to be original and artistic at all costs. Personally, I can't recommend the movie. I think art is something that should not be boring. During the projection, there was yawning around the cinema, which just confirms my brief review.
