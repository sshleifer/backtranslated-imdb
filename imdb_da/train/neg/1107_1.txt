I read the back of the box and talked about Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley and Lord Byron. I thought "wonderful! This is going to be great!" I was so wrong. The story was completely turned up. In fact, I still don't get it. It just seems to me that all the signs were, was drinking, smoking (opium?) And having sex. Not that it's not good movie properties, but thank you! Where was the story? I got to finish the movie, and yes, it took to the end, but then the movie was almost over. Rent it if you really want to. Just do not sit on the back of the box.
