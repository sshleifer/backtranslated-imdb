I loved Dewaere in the Noir series. His talent is trivialized in "The Waltzers" aka "Going Places". Okay, it's a few guys who flaunt the convention in the most absurd and irreversible ways; Many people find such behavior entertaining. This was a boring, pointless exercise designed to shock. I find the smirk on Blier's face, the face behind the camera, annoying. Series Noir was a valid expression of personal freedom and legal conduct. From the very first moment when we see Patric Dewaere prancing in the abandoned party, we get an idea of ​​the confusingly beautiful anti-hero we will spend time with the next few hours. When we see him chase the miserable middle-aged woman with his friend Depardieu in "Going Places", we have fair warning that two hours spent with these chaps will be rare. I have trouble real even a "3" for this annoying distraction.
