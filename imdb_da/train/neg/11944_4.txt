I rented this movie and thought it was the sobbingly sad 1959 version I saw as a child. It was not. I was therefore very disappointed with what I felt was marginal, poor character development and most of all lacking in highlighting the relationship between the boy and his dog. In this version, "Dog of Flanders" is just a cute "page" for the movie. Get the 1959 version!
