My Tage: A Tired Formula Christmas Comedy. Laughter is tired and the talents behind it also seem to be. <br /> <br /> I love holidays as much as the next guy (though I often have a bad case of vacation blues), but it looks like it's just a dump for a bunch of Holiday Comedies that would be bad Movie on any day of the year, but it doesn't make them any less painful during the season. As if we already had enough SANTA CLAUSE movies (three and * gulp * still count), who will see a movie about his brother? In a plot that would be home to Disney's SANTA CLAUSE franchise (scared of the occasional raw humor and Santa's "little" helper with a short skirt), FRED CLAUS is a one-joke premise that continues for 116 minutes. Surely, Jolly Ol 'Saint Nick has a brother, but where does it go from there? <br /> <br /> It's a shame really. PEACE CLAUS is blessed with a casting that could have made it an enjoyable Christian comedy that probably melts away with the snow, but it would have been so much better than this. Vince Vaughn is your typical snob, but we are led to believe that he really is the long-standing brother of the ancient Santa (Paul Giamatti) who invites his good brother to visit. Mrs Claus (Miranda Richardson) is reluctant, and worse, an efficiency expert (Kevin Spacey) has come to keep a close eye on Father Christmas, and his THIS close to being shut down. Hah! And guess who's playing Santa! Kathy Bates of course. Elizabeth Banks is Santa's Helper Charlene, John Michael Higgins is one of the elves, and Rachel Wiesz plays Peace's girlfriend! SI don't know if I want to praise casting or to bash it. Here we have some familiar faces to add a touch of quality, but they become too small to work with. <br /> <br /> With regard to humor, the best thing FRED CLAUS might encounter is Santa's brother being his exact opposite and some joke about a DJ elf. I have to admit that I had a couple of giggles involved in Fred who attended a group of counseling to celebrity brothers (where he is with Stephen Baldwin, Roger Clinton and Frank Stallone), but giggles begin and end there. Even worse is the film even let down in sentimentality, which must make us feel good and teach us a lesson about "what Christmas really means". Which Christmas means that Christmas gets as much of our remaining Christmas shopping money as possible. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** out of 5.
