Ok so I'm bored and I saw it all the way through. <br /> <br /> This movie is gentle, unofficial and lackluster. The story is so sugary that it reveals the teeth of the opening titles. A tail of two 'traumatized' children learn about 'God' fairy story way which honestly left me a little traumatized. It uses the Irish "blarney" in such a stereotypical way. One does not hope that any real Irish can ever see it. The purpose of children who would honestly turn off after the first attempt at an 'OIRISH' accent. All in all, why are they pumping them out.
