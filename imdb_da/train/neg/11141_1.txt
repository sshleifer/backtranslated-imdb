Man, this movie sucked great time! I didn't even see the hole thing (my boyfriend did). Really bad plays, computer animations so bad you just laugh (woman to werewolf), strange clips, the list goes on and on. Don't know if it's just me or does this movie remind you of a porn movie? And I don't mean all the naked ladies ... It's something about the light or something ... It might be a classic just because of the bad play and all the naked women, but not because it's an original movie, white one nice plot twist. My last words are: Don't see it! It's not worth the time. If you want to see it because naked there are many better to see!
