Uwe Boll has made the impossible: create a game fit that at least remains true to the game; He has turned a game of antisocial and insulting content into a film full of antisocial and insulting content. So, as an adaptation, it's a success. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's still Uwe Boll we have to deal with here, so don't expect the movie to be really good. While it does, the moment "Post" is spreading its welcome is very fast and becomes a pain to pass through. <br /> <br /> The core of Postal is a satire in the United States, made by a twelve year old child. Ball seems to believe that offense is linearly proportional to comic value: the more offensive, more fun and the more exaggerated the fun. This results in a film that sets new levels of tastelessness while being extremely hit and miss. Yes, some gags work, but it seems to be pure luck. High points are that the director is satirizing himself and people are being hit very heavily by trucks and other vehicles. Low points include ... well just about anything else. After the first surprise slips, mail simply becomes a bore to watch. Yes, there is a good joke every good ten minutes, but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters who shoot and chase each other everywhere, for what seems to be eternity. has worked as a short movie, but it's just not enough content for something that lasts over 90 minutes (even if it feels twice as long). There are good ideas and nice attempts, but they are hopelessly lost in endless and meaningless action scenes and content that is offensive, just because it is due 4/10
