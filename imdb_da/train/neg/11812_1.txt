... but I'm not one of them. Caro Diario was at least observable for two-thirds of the time, but the boring and self-centered third section of that movie gave us a taste of what was to come in this extraordinary self-indulgence. Moretti says he feels he has to make this movie, but he won't, while the viewer thinks he should stick to it, but he won't. A film about Italian politics and elections could be fascinating, but it's not that movie. At one point, Moretti and his friends are outside the Communist Party headquarters and discuss the interviews they are preparing to lead with party leaders, but it is characteristic of this movie that we will never see any of them. Interested in Moretti's political ravens are the events that lead to his son's birth, and subsequent home screenings of him with the child and later infant Pietro (the film draws us over several years and more than one term). We still expect to see some final sequence or convincing argument, but they never come. I doubt I could have the patience to sit through a Nanni Moretti movie again. He succeeds in making an hour and twenty minutes seem like an eternity.
