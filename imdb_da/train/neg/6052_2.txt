Despite his mistakes, I saw "Cigarette Burns", John Carpenter's Season One episode in the Masters of Horror series. Yes, the story seemed like a cheap cross between IN MUG OF MADNESS and 8MM, but it was still pretty good for the budget and time constraints. With "Pro-Life", however, the low budget and time constraints show absolutely more than anything else. There is solid guidance as always from Carpenter, but there is quality for the writing and the entire production itself, which gives the feeling it was made in a total and complete rush. Scripture is not always clear, the message is unclear, and the story is full of plot holes when looking back at them. Perhaps Carpenter had rewritten the script, it could have been a worthy episode. Instead, it's a mess that only hardcore Carpenter fans will find the slightest pleasure in. Absolutely the worst Carpenter ever made. 2.10
