Yes, it could actually have been a good movie. A love bangle, (sorry for the poetic license, but is not a triangle!) An interesting story that unfortunately wrongly said. The picture is sometimes weird, sometimes ok, the picture looks crowded and narrow. The sound needs more attention (it usually does in Romanian movies), light and color filters are sometimes poorly chosen. The soundtrack is short and does not help the action. About the play ... sorry, but the best actress is the hostess. The others seem outdated and cannot convince the viewer. The action is poetic when it is to be realistic and realistic when it is to be poetic. It is a picture for adults told by the children. Only disturb if it is very curious.
