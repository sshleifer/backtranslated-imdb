With the title like this you know that you get pretty much junk. Acting badly. Script bad. Director poor. Grammar bad. <br /> <br /> Movies make a lot of noise, really no music and many people shout. Film makes bad racist stereotype. Why does every movie with black heroes come with a drug addict? Why does the hero always dance to be successful? Why does famous rapper always come to dance movies? Why does letter "s" not be in title? Hollywood needs to stop stupid audiences and make movies that have people with brains who know how to speak proper English. <br /> <br /> Confidence and not see.
