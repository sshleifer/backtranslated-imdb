A memorable line from a short-lived show. After seeing the episode where the line was introduced, my fraternity-intramural flag football team began using the line to break our huddles on offense. Instead of Ready / Break, our quarter back said FOOTBALL and the rest of the squad replied I BET! A fun way to break the huddle that had our opponents scratching their heads when very few of them had seen the show. Using this line added a unique element to our season that I will never forget. We had our best season in my college time that year and in a small way it was fun having used this line. The show was basically a stink, but it lives on in the memories of the 1977 football game in Pi Kappa Phi at West Virginia Tech.
