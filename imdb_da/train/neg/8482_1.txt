Some of my old friends suggested me to watch this movie, but I only got one chance recently. I had great hopes of seeing something interesting from Kamal Hans, what I saw was a lot of waste camera angles mixed with high speed. I couldn't understand what was the message except breaking down Hinduism. I am more like many religious types, but I felt Kamal Hasan is a man of low character for orchestrating this kind of thought. He could have made a horror movie than this crap. He tried to add Hollywood genre to viruses and God forbid that he did not convert that guy into a mutant and ultimately go to world domination. This is a very appropriate movie for a film school vs. general public. Shame on him for not keeping up with the talent he has. The beginning of the story, Chaos tried to borrow ideas from the Butterfly effect, so between little religious harmony at the expense of abusive Hinduism. (Once again, I insult Hinduism, but this film is not equal, and my insult is the same for religion in general, which may have made this film intellectual.)
