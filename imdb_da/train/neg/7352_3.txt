It wasn't fun in 1972. It's not fun now. <br /> <br /> Unlike many other people, I don't rely on the movie because it's incredibly sexist - I quote it or rather I enjoyed the reaction it generates in annoying PC people - I base it because it is poorly written and acted. <br /> <br /> The only truly memorable sign is Blakey, which British people 25 years old will recognize immediately since he was a favorite with Impressionists for a long time. <br /> <br /> Avoid. <br /> <br />
