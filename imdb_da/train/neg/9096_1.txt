I think it's probably one of the worst movies I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Trying to get the same characters with different people is * like * a bad idea. If they could not get Sara Michelle G. and Ryan P. in this, they should just have cut their losses and said that heck with it. Instead, they get new actors who are horrible at what they did. I felt seriously as though I was at a high school or (poor) college playing with the tip to act these people forward. <br /> <br /> Where do they get some of these people? Was this their first movie? It certainly seemed like that. <br /> <br /> This movie also parallels the original with a couple of rows of speech. I had just finished seeing the first one and appeared # 2 in. I was all excited to see the other and it ended up being the worst show I've seen for a while. I can't always turn off a movie, but this certainly went away after approx. 30 - 40 min.
