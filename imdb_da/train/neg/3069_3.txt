Yuck! And again I say ... YUCK! The original version of this movie was a well-informed story of a man who was already dead and drove through the purgatory. The original movie had a lot to say and didn't go out of its way to say it. And it had a naked chicken on a motorcycle. <br /> <br /> This version seems to me something that a manufacturer bought the rights to and then abandoned by the uninterested. It seems as if a group of individuals deliberately decided to care for the nineties and changed ethnic groups and gender just to be sweet. The film is not about a burnout about committing suicide in a last threat. It's about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife. <br /> <br /> There was no reason this movie was done other than making me angry ...
