First of all, I'm not really a fan of all the things that eat meat in disgusting new ways "genre of movie, but I'm a bad movie afficionado, so my neighbor's neighbor said he had the worst movie ever. This. First of all - it is recorded on a camcorder sense stand! Secondly, the skinny white leather's voice is called by a big black man, thirdly, no dialogue makes any sense. although convincing and chockful with bad taste and tomato paste, believe me that the director (and my neighbor's neighbor) need psychological help, it is fun for about 5 minutes, but it gets old fast. is like watching a badly duplicated high school video yearbook .... with zombies. A note for anyone involved in this movie - I want the 20 minutes in my life I used to see this before I fell asleep, back.
