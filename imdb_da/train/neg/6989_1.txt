<br /> <br /> worst. Movie. Ever. <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of filming this remake (apart from making it a 90-minute informal for the movie's soundtrack)? Zombies * running * ??? I suppose the director has never seen the original "Dead" films showing rigid glued (from rigor mortis) creatures that blend / shambling to their living prey. <br /> <br /> And how did the survivors see which boat in the marina belonged to the recently derived Steve? <br /> <br /> 1/10
