I love sharks. And mutants. And explosions. Theoretically, with these parameters in mind, HAMMERHEAD: Shark Frenzy should have been the best movie ever. <br /> <br /> It's not. <br /> <br /> The monster looks like a villain from the Power Rangers and has about the same range of rubber movement. This can be okay if the decision makers were not as proud of their design as they seem to be. That is, for a guy in a big rubber boot in an action / scifi / horror flick who can take advantage of some mystery, the shark gets a lot of screen time. Granted, it's usually shaky and irregular. I suppose you have to assume it's so scary that even the camera's guy blinks. <br /> <br /> The camera goes to a person to be eaten, the camera goes to the shark. The camera goes back to the person to be eaten, only now they are screaming and armless. Etc. The costume is poor, the play is poor, and special effects are underperforming, but writing is by far the worst. Things happen quite randomly, so more people can be eaten, or something can explode. Because LET ME TELL YOU, the people who made this movie certainly went in with a more explosion = more better mindset. Characters shoot cars and there's a massive explosion. They shoot helicopters, which is a massive explosion. Barrels, stones, trees, WHY do they all explode, so much so that the freaking shark even explodes at the end. <br /> <br /> Talking about which, I don't care about how crazy a person is, I find it hard to believe anyone would seem to try to make a huge half-haired shark, having sex with a woman for Making freaky shark people babies is a good idea. That is, unless that person is the worst scientist in this movie. The bad thing is that the film is so random (and sometimes boring) that even its badness is not enough to keep a person's long-standing interest. It can be a good thing for MST3K with your friends, but beyond that, if you happen to catch this bad boy, do yourself a favor and change channel.
