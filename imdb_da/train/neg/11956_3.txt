This movie stinks. I don't think I've ever seen a movie so excited about the shock value. The reason was relatively interesting, but the dialogue was super flat and the play was bland. This could have been a good movie. I think it's just based on it's grotesque visuals. I can usually handle graphic scenes and human taboos, but it meant that Miike shot it to shoot it. Just a badly executed movie. There is just nothing to entertain by watching this movie unless you are fascinated by challenging you with explicit scenes of incest, pedophilia, necrophilia, rape, milking, parents, and siblings abuse and faecal dispersion. I think I've just sold the movie to many of you, but I meant it when I said it stinks. He has succeeded in other films, but I think you would be better off seeing someone who is popping up.
