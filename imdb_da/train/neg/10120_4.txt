This Hitchcock movie has little resemblance to its later excitement films and seems much more like a very old-fashioned moral story. A young couple receives a legacy that they believe will make them happy. They spend the money around the world and live a very hedonistic existence. But after a while the excitement begins to diminish and the couple are disappearing and meaningless in their existence. But beyond where, when on a luxury cruise, the ship drops and they lose everything - and end up happier at last because they now appreciate life! What a strange, silly and preaching movie! Personally, I want to inherit all the money and find out if it makes me miserable! <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are relatively poor compared to later productions - a hard film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish acting.
