I was looking forward to seeing this movie and then realized that any hope of a coherent dialogue between the actors was flooded with unnecessary swearing. Now I'm not a prude in any way, but to shout obscenities on each other doesn't make a good movie. Ewan Bremner is undoubtedly one of the worst actors in the world at this time (witnessing his accomplishments in the god horrible Life of Stuff) and his "Cockney" accent is almost as bad as his Edinburgh accent. Avoid. How many more of these movies "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang", "Beautiful Creatures" we must suffer before the filmmakers realize that the f-word, c-word, etc. do not replace proper dialogue.
