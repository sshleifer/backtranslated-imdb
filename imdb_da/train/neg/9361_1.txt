When I watched this on TV on TV, I thought, "Ok it will be a good werewolf movie", but it wasn't. it was not scary at all! the action was good, the plot was terrible, the military bid was simply stupid. I think the SCI-FI channel could do better than this piece of shit. The film made it sound like Arron was going to be a werewolf, instead he turned psycho and knocked out a little doctor. If you've read some of my other reviews on other movies, it's all positive, but one isn't just because the story was horrible. One out of 10 max. I'm sure you all expected some werewolf flick, but I bet you didn't expect this. In addition to Loch Nes, much better than this movie, heck, any movie on the sci-fi channel is better than this movie.
