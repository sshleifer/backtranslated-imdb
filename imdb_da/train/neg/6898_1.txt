Avoid this crap at all costs. Poor script, poor conducting, poor performance, poor editing, poor sound and bad music. Get the idea? This movie is trying to be Western flavoring, it's not. It's trying to be hard core violently, it's not. It tries to present a new look at an old genre, it doesn't. The actors try it best and my heart goes out to them. But with such material to work with it is difficult to get something to shine. For me, the whole look of a "fresh outta film school will set the world on fire" first attempt. Freshmen filmmakers often bite more, as they, or their budget, can chew. The best thing they can do is to take a few steps back, rethink what is possible, and work within their limited budget next time.
