Yes, this movie is bad. What's worse is that it doesn't take any advantage at all of its own title !! Throughout the movie, zombies and vampires fight each other or twice. On top of that, we are never quite sure if the protagonist of the film is finally a vampire. One can argue that they were trying to "tone it down" or "make it" realistic, but it just ends up boring. More than half of this movie takes place in a car. The scenes that take place elsewhere are not much to brag about either. There is also no clear antagonist, and in the end you have no idea what really happened in the last 30 minutes of the movie. <br /> <br /> But I would say that for a movie this low production value, the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented (with either an original score or sampled music from elsewhere). <br /> <br /> I'm all for independent movies, but it doesn't seem like this was ever meant for a lot of audiences (if any). <br /> <br /> "worse than scarecrow slayer."
