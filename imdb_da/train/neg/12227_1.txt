This may be the worst movie ever made and may be worth seeing for that reason alone. Streisand is ridiculously incredible as a young woman who makes up a man to study Judaism. The soundtrack is tortured, and Barbara offers some of the weakest blather ever set for film. And don't even get me started on the plot. You will actually get more chuckles out of this movie than many comedies because it is soooooo horrible. Streisand's scary ego and thought she could somehow raise this stink to Oscar heights, led to this disaster. I'm pretty sure that the novel, Isaac Bashevis Singer, hated this movie and never forgave Streisand. I can't blame him. This movie is like watching a car wreck in slow motion for two hours, with the soundtrack of 'The Sound of Music' being played back on an old record player. It's really that bad. I'm amazed that someone from Streisand enjoyed this movie at the level it was supposed to.
