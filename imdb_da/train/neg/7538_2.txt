I saw this movie because I like Nicolas Cage and well, I found it strange and completely pointless ... so I decided to stick around and get my hands on the 70's copy of it. Wow. what a difference. The original was far better. I would like you all to know that it was actually actually making a statement, its existence having a purpose. It was truly the Christian public who expressed their fear of paganism. If you dig deeper into it, it will also comment on life, but I will not go into details, just say if you were disappointed and you would like to know what it should look like, then welcome to see the 70's version, a little dated, but much better.
