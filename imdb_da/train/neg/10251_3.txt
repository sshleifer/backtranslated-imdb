A good deal runs around. A badly pronounced opponent with very little complexity. A scientist working in communication, sending signals to the room and receiving them, is hit by foreigners. Along with his beautiful wife, he invades their territory and secures them. He becomes rather treacherous in the process. Permitted, he still gets a little choice. There is a scene where he gives them everything they want. This is a boring movie with many long stretches where little happens. The reason is not technically bad. It's just that we usually follow a car, a walk through a forest, examine a building. It's about editing. I suppose the story would not technically support more technically. Not much here.
