(aka: DEMONS III) <br /> <br /> Made for Italian TV, even though it was shot in English and never intended to be a successor to the former DEMONS movies. It should simply be termed, THE OGRE, which is how Director Lamberto Bava had released it. <br /> <br /> An American family rents an Italian villa for the summer. The woman (Virginia Bryant) has recurring dreams of herself as a little girl going down to the old wine cellar of this villa and meeting this cocoon-like structure hanging from the ceiling. It glows and is covered with cobwebs and has what looks like spiders or insect bones hanging from it. It drips what looks like green paint. <br /> <br /> Of course, the owner thinks of this. The villa is just old and creaking and making strange noises in the middle of the night, and she should just ignore it. <br /> <br /> But then OGRE even appears in what looks like a kind of 16-year-old costume with what looks like a wolf's head attached to it and it attracts the scent of orchids. <br /> <br /> The files are not really bad, and at least the dialogue is halfway intelligent without the ridiculous scary phrases that copying would bring. There is no real thing other than some skeletons rotting in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern swimming pool. OGRE itself simply disappears away after it has been exceeded by the family's Jeep Cherokee. <br /> <br /> The copy of the Shriek DVD I watched was defective, with the image black for a few seconds in half an hour in the movie, a mistake I hope the Shriek page has corrected. Extra includes a brief interview with Lamberto Bava where he explains how this was not a successor, etc. With some trailers for other Shriek DVD releases. These are pretty standard things. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 <br /> <br />
