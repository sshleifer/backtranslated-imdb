I went into this with my hopes of twenty minutes in the movie, I couldn't have been more disappointed. Despite thinking that this would be another terrible bad remake, I kept my hopes high, maybe ... just maybe someone would get it right this time. Unfortunately, Prom Night is on the same level as the recent April Fools Day remake, bad script, poor direction, cheesy excessive play and generally bad fright. From the beginning to the end, it is boring, repetitive and worthy of about a dozen eye rolls. We've seen everything before, and we've seen it done a million times better than this. If you go to see the Prom Night in the theater (I would say wait for DVD or PPV), get ready for the audience to laugh because they laugh. The race is not on points in the movie that should be fun, they are in response to important "exciting" moments in the movie that is so badly done, you feel like you are watching the latest episode of Scary Movie. Seriously should this be a remake or a spoof? The filmmakers missed the sticker so badly that a large number of audiences in the theater I attended went halfway through the film. Which in the backward wish I had done. Not myself, I had to torture myself and hold on to it, hoping it would get better. Needless to say it didn't. The "horror" scenes are a joke, not even so much because of the play, but because of the direction, the script, "special effects" and the camera works. The film manages to look like they used a fortune to produce it, but still got it out with a micro budget film. I was expecting half-way to see dollar store codes on some of the props and thought I'd spot a porn star in a thrown place. <br /> <br /> These movies scary okay, if this is the future of great budgetary scare, then the horror genre is doomed.
