Why am I constantly doing this to myself? I really mean it's right there in the title - "The Incredible Melting Man". What else would I expect? I have to admit, I'm a sucker for just about anything I come across on the Monster HD channel, but the only redeeming feature in this picture would be the truly grotesque makeup job of the legendary Rick Baker. As if scary, I'll give the nod to the cool old geezer couple who suck on lemons just before the lights out. Now they were really scary. <br /> <br /> Something I could never figure out in horror flicks was why a monster's victim would not just run away when faced with virtual extermination. Like the chicken in the cabin. You know there was a door completely visible right there in the kitchen, that she could have run straight out anytime. Incredible Steve-O couldn't do much more than a brisk trip, so why not just blow him? I don't know, maybe I'm missing something. <br /> <br /> This flick was part of the feel of a 'Tales From The Crypt' episode, but 'Tales' usually had a cool or grotesque twist, which you often didn't look forward to. This was a picture that you couldn't get a handle on coming or going. For example, in an early stage, you can make it clear that the eyes of the man melted out of his head, so how did he get around for the rest of the story? I suppose we should not ask. <br /> <br /> In forty-four minutes, the image was about an hour and a half too long. When it was over, I was ready to take General Perry on his previous proposal - "I really could use a drink now".
