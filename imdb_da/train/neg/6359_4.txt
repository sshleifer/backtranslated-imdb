Woody Allen, at its best, has one of the sharpest bullets around. He can make an emergency observation and pack it around a stroke line like no other. But when he is in the worst case, his movie stinks of pretentiousness. Unfortunately, "Melinda and Melinda" have this stench from opening to closing. The setup is one of his most exciting ideas for a while. Four friends sit in a restaurant that discusses whether the essence of life is comedy or drama. To help clarify the argument, a man refers to the beginning of a story and asks the other two men to argue (a comic author, the other a dramatic dramatist) whether history is a comedy or a tragedy. The two men then continue the story, and the film plays out the stories they weave. Now, when I first heard about this movie, my understanding that they are telling exactly the same story, the genre (comedy or drama) is changing only by how it looks. Now it would have been interesting. However, the stories share only one main element and a few side elements. They are completely different stories with large plot differences. The drama is so rigid script and pretentious that it can only act as self-parody. If this were meant, it failed because these elements prevent the audience from feeling an emotional investment in any of the characters. The comedy is the story that has moments of success, but they are still short and fleeting. Of course, Farrell will be considered standby for Woody, but he could have played this character much more credibly without adding Woody's shorter and hand-ticks. Woody is the best to be Woody. When others try, they do not play a character, they model a recognizable actor. This kind of thing only pulls the audience out of the story. <br /> <br /> My favorite Woody Allen movies make me leave the theater a little easier in the spirit than I did. This one made me wish I could get my money back.
