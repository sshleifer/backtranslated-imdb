This was the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen many bad movies. First, I'm from Kansas, this movie has no truth in it. Its like they took the BTK name and made the rest. On top of that, it looks like someone was as if I only have $ 20 here, take it and make a movie and oh yes, don't worry about examining btk at all just doing something. Seriously pure dookie no one should ever watch this movie. Slaughter cows scenes and making his victims eat things and describe animal species BTK did not do any of these things, but the film makes it for God's love never see this god's horrible movie. They made for TV's far better and more accurate
