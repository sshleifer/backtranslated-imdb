This movie features two of my favorite actors in Kilmer and Downey. It also boasts the always fun Larry Miller in a small part. Despite this, I found it almost unattainable. Michelle Monaghan can be beautiful, but she is almost charisma free, and the reasons Downey's character is obsessed with her character are not at all understandable in terms of the information presented by the film or the way it is portrayed. The ending seems pretentious, and although the intention seems to be that the audience must be part of the nod and blink the movie because they have not got us to the side of its protagonists, we do not leave or unable to do so . Fans of the film say those who do not agree "don't get it". I don't think that's the way. The reason was not complicated or without understanding. It was simply uninvolving and clumsy and of course made. I just got it. I just didn't like it. Paddy Breathnach's "In Went Down" and Guy Ritchie's "Snatch" and "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" are much better-realized examples of the kind of film production that Director Shane Black does not manage. <br /> <br /> I share a birthday with Shane Black, but a look at his credits (mostly as a writer) makes me separate from any other connection.
