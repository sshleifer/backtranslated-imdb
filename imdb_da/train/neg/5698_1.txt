I almost drowned in CHEESE and watched this movie. In fact, I couldn't even finish it. I want my money back. One of Hollywood's weak attempts to come up with a new idea. Good thing, I keep a bowl of lemons in the fridge. In the case of. They had to give Nic Cage a hat and a bull-whip. Swashbucklin '. Cage's performance in Raising Arizona or Leaving Las Vegas beats this "lemon". People who are completely marketed (and most of them are) should love this movie. If this movie had been animated, I would have taken it more seriously. I'd rather pay to see a completely stupid movie that didn't try to hide it. In my opinion, this was an incredibly stupid movie and it made an even more unfortunate effort to try to hide that fact. <br /> <br /> All SHEEP seem to love it themselves.
