I don't know where to start, so I start with an excerpt from the back of this film cover. "Alive combines the excitement of Vincenzo Natali's Cube with Kitamura's own Versus." I haven't seen Versus, so I can't comment on it, but I think Cube was an excellent movie that I recommend to everyone. But in this case, some have clearly confused "tension" with "boredom". <br /> <br /> I just want to pamper the whole plot, as well as being a sacred Swiss cheese of a plot, it's also moldy cheese, and the movie is not worth spending any time even if you don't know the plot in advance so it doesn't matter. If I have misunderstood the plot, don't beat me - that's probably because I had to fight to keep my eyelids open. <br /> <br /> So the US military in Nevada once lost a UFO in the Nambi desert. This is apparently sensible because they are both deserts, so they are almost the same place. Different continents or not. A monkey broke into the UFO and acquired a stranger who was transferred to a Japanese scientist who was to eat the monkey to survive in the desert. No matter what. The alien thing is now passed on to anyone who is "bloodthirsty" enough to kill the present host. The Japanese military wants to use it for military purposes, so they decide to get it from the current host (scientist's daughter) to another guy. But instead of just picking someone out of the military, who is full of people who are bloodthirsty and already on the military side, they decide that it's probably a good idea to pick some criminals out of the death row instead. Oh, and the reason they choose this criminal from the death row is because he was the first person in history not to die from the non-lethal electric shock, which is the standard execution method, because everyone dies from the placebo effect when they becomes electrocute. I don't know if they do it so they can giggle in the living room on how everyone dies, even if it's not mortal, or if they just want to cut the electricity bill. <br /> <br /> So the movie turns into what The Matrix would have been if it had been very paralyzed, and superfluous battles bore us tears for what feels like an hour. And oh wait, now they remember that they already had a guy who was infected with the alien thing, so the whole movie to this point was actually a waste of time and also human life. So everyone dies. The end. <br /> <br /> The only moment in the movie where I didn't want to go to sleep or eat a sandwich instead was when a guy was attached to a wall by a tube through his chest and he was hanging up there and another guy passes by. The guy hanging on the wall says "I have pain, shoot me". And the living guy looks at him, and it's not like he's a mediocre guy or something, so he looks really sad and doesn't want the guy on the wall to suffer. So he shoots him. <br /> <br /> (Rhetorical pause.) <br /> <br /> In the stomach. "Give THANK YOU AND FREAKIN 'HEAP."
