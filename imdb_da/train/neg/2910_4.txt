The highlight of this movie for me was undoubtedly Tom Hanks. As Mike Sullivan, he was certainly thrown against the type and showed that he can cope with an untraditional role (for him). Hanks is usually the good guy in a movie - the one you like, admire and root for. Sullivan was definitely not a good guy. It is true that during this film he came across as a noble one - his purpose is to avenge the murder of his wife and the youngest son. Still, he was already a gangster and killer before they killed. So Hanks took a role, I wouldn't have expected him in, and he looked good. Hank's good performance aside, though I certainly couldn't call this an enjoyable movie. After an opening that I would best describe as enigmatic (it wasn't quite clear to me for a while when it went), it becomes a very bleak movie about the complicated relationships that Sullivan has developed as a gangster - largely raised by Rooney (Paul Newman), who is a kind of mob, and tries to raise his own two sons and keep them "clean" so to speak; isolated from his business. After the older son witnesses a murder, the gang tries to kill him to keep him silent, gets the wrong son (and mother) and leaves Sullivan and his older son (Mike, Jr.) on the run. It becomes a strange kind of father / son bonding movie. Although it ends in a somewhat hopeful note (at least in the overall context of history) it is really very dark throughout, that the mood is enhanced with many of the scenes being shot in dark and violent rainfall. I have to admit that while I appreciated Hank's performance, the film as a whole didn't take me. 4.10
