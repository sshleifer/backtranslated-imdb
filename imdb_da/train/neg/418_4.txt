One might wish that an idea as good as the "invisible man" would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of amazing special effects, but that is not the case. The story, the characters and finally the whole of the last 20 minutes of the film about as fresh as a mad scientist from the early 50s. There are some good moments, mainly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of ​​an invisible man who stalks the streets. But alas, we are soon back in the narrow confinement of the underground lab, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable but schematic. There have been many old remakes of old movies or TV shows over the last 10 years, and some of them have their charms. However, it becomes clear and clear to each movie that the idea of ​​putting oliglassics under the nose of eager goblins like Verhoeven (who has his moments) is a very bad one. It is obvious that the money is the key problem here: the time and energy of the script is almost insufficient, and as a result, "Hollow Man" is seriously undermined by clichés, juicy characters, predictability and lack of any depth. <br /> <br /> But the only thing that actually impressed me, besides the special effects, was the sword. When making this kind of film, the modern producers are very eager to let the children see them. Therefore, the language (and sometimes violence and sex) is much toned down. When the whole world blows up, the good people go "Oh darn!" and "Oh my God". "Hollow Man" gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy, and the characters have the freedom to say what is most natural to them. I'm not saying that the most natural answer to something gone wrong is to swear - but it makes it more credible if someone actually swears. I think we can thank Verhoeven for that.
