... for this movie defines a new layer in Bollywood and has set the standard against which all c ** p should now be compared. <br /> <br /> First, the beginning was beginning to have elements of style ... and if handled well, it could have become a cult classic, a-la pulp fiction or a desi desperado ... but the plot (was there One?) begins to meander and at some point completely loses it. <br /> <Brill in a horrified donor with an occupation for English, a call center smart Alec, a femme fa tale that can don a bikini and a saree with the same aplomb, a levitating, gravity defying hit man and a cop with One hundred (or a thousand) black cat commands on their tracks .... good ingredients in competent hands. But here I would like to ask the director: Sir, what are you smoking? <br /> <br /> I'm sure this movie will be remembered in the annals of the Bollywood movie production - for what must never be done - insult the intelligence of most brain-dead filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Possibly the only redeeming feature of this Desi matrix plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is the music ... watch the videos ... hear airplay and you won't be disappointed. Vishal-Shekhar comes up with some extremely hummable tunes. <br /> <br /> Where I wish the director had spent the money making something more eye-opener .... <br /> <br /> As I log off, I really know very badly how does Akshay bullet wound disappear in a microsecond ... what did you do editors on? Tashan, maybe ...
