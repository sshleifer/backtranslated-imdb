Blonde and Lace were unfunny.Basically, it was a rip-off girl version of Dumb and Dumber, but less fun, and they used too much background sound and music. ENJOYED POSSIBLE BACKGROUND AND MUSIC IF YOU EXPOSE ME !!!! It starts tremendously boring and completely out. It doesn't take up the pace anywhere soon, and I felt more frustrated as this nonsense continued. Maybe the only thing that saved me from giving this movie a 1 the last 30 minutes. I found it a bit entertaining and interesting as it approached the end, but that was the only part. Also I could not help but as Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards sign a little. Although this movie didn't get any laughs from me, it was my attention. I wouldn't say avoiding this movie altogether, but there are thousands of better movies so you can spend your time and money on Blonde and Lace.
