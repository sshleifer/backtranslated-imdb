I really wanted to like this movie, but so much of it is stolen / borrowed from other work - some of the loan amount is painfully obvious. The New York Times review pointed out that their sangfrog is reminiscent of it in the famous Warner Brothers cartoon ('Hello my baby, hello my treasure', hi my ragtime gal ... '). But I challenge anyone to see the Fox / Blue Sky animated feature Robots (2005) and not find ridiculous similarities in: storyline - A young inventor is growing up and a single innovative company distributes all the amazing inventions. <br /> <br /> cityscape - Extremely similar camera angles capture extremely similar futuristic urban environments. <br /> <br /> ... robots ... - Robinson's household server robot has a very similar design to the robots, and both films use a kind of retro-futuristic look. All of this seems to be in sharp contradiction to the unpleasant quote from Disney at the end, which means that the company has been a stable innovator who never looks back (which also contradicts their entire catalog of movies in the 90s, which was largely clones of each other, with some minor tweaks to storyline and ethnicity). The filmmakers do not seem to let the story speak alone, and instead constantly send objects and sounds flying in our direction, as though we did not have any attention for anything less. The villain is really well-designed and brilliant animated and he is a pleasure to see. Much of the rest of the movie works together. Some of the landscapes resemble CGI from the mid-90s. <br /> <br /> The movie actually opens with a classic Mickey Mouse card. At the end of this cartoon we are reminded that Disney has never had much interest in innovation or good storytelling - they seem to believe that just getting something up on the big screen is proof enough of their virtue.
