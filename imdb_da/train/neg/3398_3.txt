It seems that the film's intention was to show the Russians' aggressive (mafia-like) character, or at least the Russians who could travel outside their big country; stealing a bank in England is too easy; and that the British police are so ineffective that it cannot find the person who robbed the bank even when those issues leave the country by plane. In addition, Nicole Kidman and the supposed Russian colleagues spoke a language that had not yet been identified, probably spoken by foreigners in the Urals, but far to be Russian. So Nicole, if you really want to speak Russian, kindly go to Moscow or St. St. Petersburg and keep yourself learning Russian grammar and its pronunciation.
