This was my first, and probably the last Angelopoulos movie. I was eager to get into it as it highlighted Mastroianni, one of my favorite actors, and was a movie by Theo, which I heard a lot. The opening was promising, a long shot over a jeep soldier over the Albanian-Greek border. OKAY! But that was all. Nothing left. The movie had big holes, and I don't know what to mention first. History's main drawing is revealed to the journalist by the old woman. during a long walk. It's like a 15-minute monologue that kills action and viewers patience, nothing happens on the screen for 15 or even 20 minutes, apart from this old lady telling a story. All that is supposed to be shown through action was simply told by the old lady the camera. For a moment, the TV set was on its way to the bar. They turn around the corner and immediately begin the winter! Probably shot in different days, continuity leaked. A lot of trouble with the story, it went from absurd to irrational, never sticking to a style, so the viewer asked questions that never got answers. Bad Mastroianni, given a role that lacked integrity or charm. On the other hand, as many Greeks or Albanians or Balcan people would agree, the films showed many historical, ethnic or political inaccuracies just to make a film about "humanity" as red in another review. Much more to say, but no time to lose on a bad movie that was not at all movie, but the beauty of a person impressed on film and paid with state money.
