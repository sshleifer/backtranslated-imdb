There are some things I can never understand. Like this movie. What if I had to make a really cheap and crappy look Dino and crocodile polygon model in Maya and then continue to cut and paste it into an amateur video clip if people are screaming and being eaten by the same? How can anyone believe that a completely fake CGI dinocroc that looks completely out of place would affect the events of this movie? I know its B-class, low budget and all but the manufacturers could do better than making a piece of shit that no one will ever see or see through. It just doesn't make sense. Are people really so stupid that they would sit through this? Apparently so. For laughing? No, this thing is not even worth laughing.
