When childhood memory tells you this was a scary movie; It touches and goes if you have to visit it again. Still, I remembered a scary scene with a homeless person and a cool villain played by Jeff Kober. <br /> <br /> "The First Power" is not a great movie, sad to say. It is shocking with these cop cliches and a very poor script with holes that a truck could run through (along with countless practical "twists" that help the story run together). Lou Diamond Phillips is the over-confident bad ass-policeman who sends the baddie serial killer only to the gas chamber to find out he was a minion of Satan himself and now has the power of the uprising along with the power to possess any weak minded person that he comes across Through the mixture is a very poorly realized psychic that helps with the matter. <br /> <br /> Ahhh, that's the garbage bin. But fun as such, especially if you have good memories of it. It scared me like a child, and the scene of the homeless is still pretty good. As for any kind of logic here; Forget it, pretty much all scenarios are thrown in good mind, and you end up with a cross between a Steven Segal action-flick and a 70-demonic flick. And who on earth thought it was a good idea to throw Lou Diamond Phillips in the lead here? Needless to say, he doesn't convince at all, but he tries his best, and I've never had the problem with the guy, so many reviewers here seem to have. As for Tracy Griffith as the psychic, the less the better said. But Kober is pretty good as the killer; always wanted the actor. <br /> <br /> "The first power" can be what the doctor ordered after a hard day's work and a "brain interruption" is required. Beer will most likely improve the experience and I will definitely have plenty of it next time I give this movie a spin. Overall; not a good flick but a somewhat guilty pleasure for nostalgic fans who were easily scared as kids. "Look around, buddy boy"!
