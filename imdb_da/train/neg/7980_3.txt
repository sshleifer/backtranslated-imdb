This service comedy, which Peter Marshall (Joanne Dr's brother and later perennial hosted The Hollywood Squares) and Tommy Noonan were hyped as 'the new Lewis and Martin' is just shy of horrible: a few random sight gags inserted, everyone speaks quickly and nothing seems quite right - there is a scene where Noonan throws grenades at the officers and politicians in anger; They are about five feet apart, throwing Noonan between them, and the overall response is that all flinches. <br /> <br /> In the midst of a horrible lightness only by retrieving Julie Newmar, there are a few Brightness instantly: Marshall and Noonan engage in occasional bouts of double talk and argufying, and their timing is almost perfect - clear that they were a well-run comedy couple. Saving this turkey is not enough, unfortunately.
