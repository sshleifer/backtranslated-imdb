My goodness is this movie bad. I was completely misled by my local film review because this is certifiable waste. Yes, yes, good guys carry white, evil guys wearing black .... and the good guys always win. Now go home and hug your kids and watch how good Hollywood has made you feel. Blech! I can't believe this brainwashed movie was made by Wes Craven. I guess he needed some money to pay the mortgage, so he made this piece of fertilizer. It is the kind of production that makes anyone who sees movies regularly think they can do as well or better than such an experienced director. Look, a bad guy wants a cute girl who loves her father to do a beautiful IL 'bad thing, or he'll hurt her father. But to be Mrs. All-American girl next door, we know she will save the day and beat the evil guys ... the end. Girl Power ROCKS. <br /> <br /> C'mon now, just an idiot would find this entertaining ... "a roller coaster ride" let alone something new or new. All the "super-duper" reviews you see on this site are from industry hackers who either make money on this flick, pay back a favor, or have sold their souls to the devil. <br /> <br /> Rachael McAdams is beautiful .... yup, that's it. Not a good performance, not a terrible ... she's just cute. She would have had to show a lot of skin to save this movie. She is not hard enough to be a good female manager. <br /> <br /> Cillian Murphy was at least passable for 28 days. But here he plays a stupid villain pretending to be a smart one. He gets his ass kicked back and forth by 5'5''MadAdams, because she was a cheerleader ... and a field hockey player ... and I'm sure she owns all the Tae Bo tapes ... so she should be able to kick the crap out of an international terrorist for hire. I wouldn't trust him to steal a heavy package from 7-11. <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie was done before, except before they did well. Go to rent some of the Die Hard movies. You have loved ones in danger, international terrorists, except that the characters are more sympathetic and credible, and the wicked are way more competent and interesting. I simply don't understand how Hollywood can continue to do such things as if they were ignorant of the right models they can easily copy. No wonder the movie revenue is down. Throw your $ 6 down the toilet and save yourself 2 hours in your life, you never come back. <br /> <br /> Ciao, FreddyShoop
