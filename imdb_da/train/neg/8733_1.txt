*** Possible Plot Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I love Dennis Hopper. I question why he accepted the role of police detective in the 2000 Spreading Ground. This movie flat out sucks, and I'm about to tell you why. <br /> <br /> It's about a small city that is getting a contract for a sports arena. One hitch: there's a killer on the loose and it's bad for business. The mayor makes an appointment with the Irish Mob to find the killer and make sure he never makes it to court. The. Ed Delongpre has other plans. He wants this guy caught too, but he is level and believes in the system. He wants to see the system doing that job. <br /> <br /> It could have been pretty good. It could have been riveting. It was awful. First, they notice this guy a serial killer. Err no. There are specific criteria and none of them fit here. The bad guy killed 5 children the first day and I think it was 2 the other day. This whole movie spans a 48 hour period ... Hardly serial killer action. I don't care what distorted motives they give him in the end, the serial killers do their job over a long period of time. Not only do they kill 7 children in two days. It's a Spree. Okay, the annoying aside, the play was terrible. The only name here was Hopper, and he is the only one who came close to pulling his share. Unfortunately, he is a bit of a kind for me, and I think he makes psycho parts much, much better. This was just not a good vehicle for Hopper. It did not allow him to do what he does best, which is to act everything scary. It's not that he did it badly, it's that I've seen him do so much better. <br /> <br /> The Irish mob guy, Johnny Gault (Tom McCamus - Long Day's Journey Into Night), who is in charge of their investigation is just above the top stiff. Contradiction? Not really. He tries to play the cold, hard friendly guy, and he makes it the point that the sign is just wood. Drilling for max. He didn't scare me. He did not inspire any feeling whatsoever, except boredom. I can't tell you how many times I checked to see how much longer it was until the end of this movie. The other thing about this is that it had the feeling of a movie for television. You know what I mean. The poor production values, low budget, reuse of scenes to save costs. Just eh. Yanno? But I want to compare this with those who are an insult to them. <br /> <br /> Derek Vanlint was both director and filmographer on this project. He beat off more than he could chew. I can't help feeling that Hopper must have taken this role as a personal service for a friend. It's the only rational I can come up with. This was Vanlint's first job as director, third as a film photographer. Hopefully it was an educational experience for him. <br /> <br /> I don't want to ruin the end if you decide to torture yourself with this, but I want to say they all lost the ball here. ..hopper. In a scene that should have been emotionally intestinal for the detective, it was just .. well .. blah. I didn't see any of the fears whatsoever that would accompany the overall gear change this guy made. Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> This 100 grueling minutes long and rated R for violence and language. No child under 13 will have any interest whatsoever in seeing this, so no worries there. It is not suitable for anyone anyway. heh. <br /> <br /> Skip this one. You will thank me later.
