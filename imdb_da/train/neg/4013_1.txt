After seeing some of HBO's good stuff - Band of Brothers, Rome, etc. - I have to say I had pretty high expectations before I saw the first episode of "True Blood". Jeez. Often the script seemed to be written by an 8-year-old, some parts are just terribly filmed (the scene where she "saves" Bill, I mean to come. She throws a chain on the guy and it! Around the neck and it shocks him) Magic! It was pretty embarrassing if you wanted my opinion, or just a moment before the scene when she found out that the couple is gone with Bill, ridiculous, she hears them plan their stuff and looks like 5 seconds later, magic! The 3 are gone and no fight or noise or anything! <br /> <br /> I think the idea of ​​the show seemed interesting, mysterious, exciting, vampires that exist with man in our modern society ... but frankly, I don't think they would really do more of this than a little soap show that the average teenage girl sees all the time but no one else cares ... Unfortunately, the script is made low, mediocre at best. is low and very predictable, often I thought it was a kind of joke or something . <br /> <br /> Actors deliver truly convincing performances if you want my opinion. They seem to be taking the show very easily, as if it were some kind of ordinary, low-budget family television show (well maybe what it is if you take away the family part). The only actor who seemed to be good to me was Stephen Moyer in Bill's role, considering the poorly written, extremely short answers he had to say, "What are you ..." "Can I call you once ... "I think he did well to bring out the somewhat mysterious scary part of a vampire that anyone with a vampire role should actually have. Anna Paquin was okay too, but no more. But the guy plays his brother himself, jeez, he's horrible. The scene where he is arrested is simply a shame for the modern television. The play is bad, the construction site looks fake to the leg, and the other two guys "Why is he arrested? Uh .. I dunno ..." It was pretty embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Another thing I thought was totally missed was the way they presented Sookie's psychic powers. They make us hear what people think and talk both at the same time, and it's just wrong. Often it just seems unnecessarily chaotic, as if people's thought was a kind of annoying radio channel, and that when she gets close to them, she hits the right frequency level and has to hear everything they think. <br /> <br /> And finally, the sex scenes are clearly unnecessary, and the vampire sextape stuff was just plain disgusting. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong - I wrote all these comments, not because I thought the show was bad, but because I was very disappointed. I expected quality stuff. I didn't think it was that way. It is certainly not a good show though. Mediocre at best.
