Ah WINTER KILLS, based on the novel by Richard Condon, dealing with a conspiracy that killed the US President 20 years ago. I knew Condon also wrote THE MANSCURIC CANDIDATE who treated a similar theme and was looking forward to seeing an intelligent thriller <br /> <br /> WINTER KILLS left me cold. It's not a thriller - It's a piece of worthless shit, possibly the worst movie I've seen this month and boy, I've seen many bad movies in June. The problem lies in both the direction and the manuscript, and when William Richert was responsible for both, he was to be blamed for this unfunny farce <br /> <br /> There are two things wrong with this movie. Firstly, the way everything is presented is in a completely over the top way. It's not like the OTT as saying something about the James Bond movie with David Niven and Peter Sellers, but everything has a far-flung edge to it with actors who completely topple their performances. This could have been justified if there was entertainment value for the movie, but there are none. As a satire it is very silly, so stupid that it becomes almost unattainable. Second, the scenes seem to have been cut so much that they are rendered meaningless. Take, for example, a scene where the hero faces a loopy military leader called Dawson. Dawson tells the hero he has 30 seconds, then starts cutting it to the hero on board an aircraft. Scenes begin and end without rhyme or reason <br /> <br /> A grim movie that is a trial to sit through
