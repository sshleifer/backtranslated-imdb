I had to shut this off after about 15 executable moments. <br /> <br /> I hoped it could get better, <br /> <br /> What I saw was badly acted, directed, and written. <Br /> <br /> This movie should never even be released directly on DVD. <br /> <br /> The main character, which is a bridal top, is from HELL, has a large ice sculpture falling on her to kill her. She was such an outrageous person, I wasn't even sorry for her. She wins up there in a kind of sky and was still repulsive, I left shortly after. Eve Longoria portrays her and I hope I never see her again, she can't even act. She is just plain annoying. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd an actor who usually can't do anything wrong was also in this dud. <br /> <br /> Jason Biggs (no longer a teen) is also present <br /> <br /> I like comedies but not stupid about stupid people. <br /> <br /> Rating: * (out of 4) 30 points (out of 100) IMDb 2 (out of 10)
