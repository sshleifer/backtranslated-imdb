This is actually a god adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. Compared to the American version with Guinneth Paltrow, the manuscript was written to look like the book as much as possible. But the play was terrible. Besides Kate Beckinsale, who I think was a genuine resemblance to Emma in the book, all other actors tried too hard. Mark Strong was not the "gentleman" he was supposed to be. He was often rude and offensive, had no sense at all, and throughout the movie you couldn't see his love "grow" for Emma at all. This had a terrible impact on Kate Beckinsale, who seemed to try to "resque" her leading role as well as her partner. Moreover, there was no chemistry between the entire cast. Hariett Smith, played by Samantha Morton, did not seem to have any real affiliation with Mr. Elton, played by Dominic Rowan. Therefore, she did not seem to hear the heart rate as she was portrayed in the book. The settings of the movie are too poor. The costumes are even more so. I would have imagined that Emma Woodhouse would dress in a more fashionable and elegant way she does here. The end is also too long. It's good that it looks like the end of the book, but it's a killer ending for a movie. And again I can't see any sense of happiness towards Mr. Knightley. Eventually, I thought this adaptation to be loyal to the book, but with bad actors. It seemed that the film was made without any budget at all. I prefer to see the "lighter" version with Paltrow and Northam, although it is clear that it was made to be a "blockbuster" than to see these actors (except the good Olivia Williams and the better Kate Beckinsale) destroying the entire script .
