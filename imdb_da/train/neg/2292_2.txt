First of all, I must admit Batman: The animated series is by far the best batman series. We saw it when it used to be on TV. I didn't realize there was a season four. In fact, there wasn't. BTAS ends with season 3, and it should have stopped there. <br /> <br /> Why should they blush with a good thing. Catwoman and Poison ivy now have horrible gray faces. The joker looks scary, it seems that every time they change their appearance, he looks more and more scary. He does not seem to have students anymore, and now he does not even see human (even though he is). Bruce Wayne is pronounced by Kevin Conroy, who makes the best batman. Although he now resembles superman. There is nothing that sets him apart because they both look the same, Bruce Wayne now has blue eyes. Night Wing really needs a haircut, thank you! Alfred only has students from the eyes, looks more like a character from the 80s. <br /> <br /> I've seen three episodes from Disc 1 in the series and I already find this version more violent and graphic (there is blood in each episode). <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of Batman: The animated series, there's no batman season 4. They just included this series as season 4 for merchantability. If they just deleted it as The New Batman Adventures, I don't think many people would have bought it. Save yourself the disappointment and stick to the seasons 1-3.
