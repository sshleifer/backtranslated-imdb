An obvious b-class effort to put on Hostel / Saw buzz, my expectations for this movie were low (really low!) And yet it still managed to disappoint at all levels. The action is so bad, it's not even fun, the plot line is non-existent, and the only scare was to realize I had wasted 1 hour 21 minutes watching it! I'm surprised to notice that 34 people gave it a 10 star rating. I can only suspect that 33 of these are Cast and Crew. The 34th may be the director's mother? - Although I'm sure she would find it difficult to go beyond a 2! DVD extras include an hour long "making of" function. Which raises the question "Why?" (though it may turn out what you should not do!). Avoid at all costs.
