Within 15 minutes my entire family was angry at Goldie Hawn's character to die, or at least for Steve Martin's characters to leave her. In 40 minutes we switched it off. There are only a few films a year, we try to be so annoying that we don't even have enough time for the story to be established. Usually I like both Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn and I remember enjoying Neil Simon the original. So I owe Marc Lawrence and Sam Weisman. Combine the director of "What's the worst thing to happen" and the author of "Miss Congeniality 2" and I think that's what we end up with.
