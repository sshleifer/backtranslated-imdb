Just saw this movie and what a waste of time. The movie was predictable and slow. It's basically the Mormon bad news that carries the sanctioned basketball of the church. Instead of watching this movie, I should have had a root canal. The cameo performances were obviously driven by sponsorship / funding. This film had potential because of the monstrous behavior exhibited by Mormons when playing the sanctified basketball of the church, but because it is classified PG, the true nature of the play could not be transferred to movies. The action is horrible except for Clint Howard and Fred Willard. Thurl Bailey's appearance in the film was completely unnecessary.
