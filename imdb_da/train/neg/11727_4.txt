I wouldn't call it horrible, but there's nothing in this movie at all, and it's bound by some incredibly incredible plot plot development. It starts well, but when the primary hit is finished, it goes into a long plot about a young girl who is not compelling and some action scenes that are absurdly unrealistic theater. For example, there is a long-lasting shootout at the airport, where the lighting is completely stroboscopic. No explanation for that. How trustworthy is that an airport's storage area will have lights that are blinking and confusing, and just enough to let Snipes make its incredible escape? This is one of too few action scenes characterized by infinitely drawn-out settings that simply fail to draw one for suspending faith. In addition, the whole prize seems to be that the US CIA team can shoot the spot, but get away with it by saying "national security" to the British. This gimmick is dependent on a stereotype that is far from reality to be satisfactory. There are many better action movies out there. Better formulated, better done. This one is entertaining at times, but there is just not enough meat on the bone, and after a while it becomes boring - something that should never happen in a good action movie.
