I usually try to construct reasonably well-grounded criticism of movies, but I can't believe this came past the manuscript. The dialogue is horrible, the act is very risky, the accents are just awful, and the direction and pacing are at best scrappy. <br /> <br /> I can't remember the last time I saw a movie, so bad. Joseph Fiennes, as he is, can only have killed his career as soon as it started. The desert doctor Moreau was no worse than this garbage.
