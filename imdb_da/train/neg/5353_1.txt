I had the "privilege" of participating in a special screening of the "Lack of Light" at a horror convention in Ohio. First, you know you're in trouble when the director introduces a movie, says, "Remember now, we don't have much money ..." Not that non-budget movies are bad, but when a filmmaker uses this as an excuse , the results are always poor. And there is no better example than this unattainable sleeping party. <br /> <br /> In fact, the "Lack of Light" is a first in the world of underground cinema: It's the only time I've seen a dream cast of talented genre veterinarians actually living me. Charismatic actors such as David Hess, Tony Todd and Reggie Banister coincide and end the film and prove to be as uninteresting as the amateur no names. Who are their characters? What are they talking about? So what? It's so boring, you stop worrying about something or someone. After 30 minutes of this endurance test, I gave up and left the theater. It was not surprising, so most of the cast members also participated. <br /> <br /> Any curious gene refinement would do well to stay away from this. With a little luck, this movie will never see the light of day.
