Not sure why this movie seems to have gotten such rave reviews. <br /> <br /> As I watched "Bang" one night on television, I was sorry for the obscene, random plot that appeared on the screen. The whole movie seems to be nothing more than an exercise in pointless, artistic fun indulgence on the part of the filmmaker. The fact that the director / author goes by a one-name moniker only reinforces this sense of pretentiousness. <br /> <br /> Those who are interested in indie flicks would rather be looking for something better written and dare I say more entertaining than this complete waste of time.
