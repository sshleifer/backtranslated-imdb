This movie made me go. The title was perhaps the biggest idea I heard. I thought it was an independent movie about a zombie outbreak and their attempt to take over the United States and a group of single survivors, banding together and planning to take off the zombies. Badly wrong! It's about a psychopar with weakness to kill his female arrests, get what comes to him when a pack of zombie women rises from their graves to get proper revenge. As you can see, there is nothing about the nation or a county involved. Where to start with the seriousness of this movie disaster caused our nation. <br /> <br /> First of all, the zombie women look like Victoria Secret models with dark eyeliner and a pale face. What are zombies, but mindless, debatable, intelligent cannibalistic killers eating because of their primitive most basic needs? These zombie women run like streetwalkers and runway models, they talk like they are in a bad movie noir movie and don't act like real zombies. Sure to eat and kill there, but where is mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement? Although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zomrenrenren, it makes fun of that genre and asks the question, "Why can't zombies be beautiful vixen kill machines?" I would say that this movie would be considered a really bad indie movie that was produced and made by garage junkies. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who loves zombie genres too much, it is an insult and too scary? Not even.
