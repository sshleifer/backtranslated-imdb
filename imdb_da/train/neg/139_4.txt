This movie was rented by a friend. Her choice is usually good. I read the cover first and expected a good movie. Though it was <br /> <br /> a horror movie. Which I do not prefer. But there was no fate while watching the movie. It was a boring <br /> <br /> not particularly entertaining movie. The appearance of Denise Richards <br /> was again a pleasure to the eye. But it is. We (the four of us) <br /> <br /> we are a little disappointed. But you are welcome to watch this movie and <br /> <br /> judge it yourself.
