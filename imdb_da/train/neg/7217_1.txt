I'm about to see this DVD at home. We love Western so my husband rented it. He started apologizing me halfway through. The saddles, costumes, accents - everything was off. The part that made me so angry is where the guy didn't shoot the "collector" with his bow and arrow when he took the fat guy's soul. His only excuse was "he only had 2 arrows left." We saw it all the way through, and as someone else said ... too many bad things to exclude for some reason it sucked. I think the fact that the boy has been hit by the evil stone from the collector on the same month and day, it was found, what is the meaning of it? And why was there a burial ground where everyone died on April 25, but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still walking around? If you want a movie to make fun of after a few beers, it may be your movie. But if you want a true western, you will hate this movie.
