The mark of 'Edison' was decent, but an actor especially destroyed the whole movie. Justin Timberlake destroyed the movie with every line he made during the movie. He is by far the one of the worst actors I have ever seen and should have the same fate as the whole of F.R.A.T. squad. <br /> <br /> Whether it was an emotional scene, an action scene or even a quiet scene, Justin Timberlake managed to destroy it. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time watching this movie. Not even bothering to download it, midget porn will be a much better choice. <br /> <br /> And if you read Justin, you stick to music. Even if you are not comfortable, you have done a wonderful job that entices people into believing that you can actually sing.
