Let me be clear. I've been using IMDb for years. But only today I went through the hassle of registering on the site, just so I could give this movie the lowest possible rating. I've seen hundreds of movies, some of them bad, some awful. However, I have never seen such a contrast of pretension and incompetence, with high intentions and failures. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino is terribly thrown like the princess, but amazingly like Phocion, a young boy. Fiona Shaw is always an entertaining sign, but the dialogue in the movie is much worse even in the cheeky French game that is the source (Marivaux never reached Hollywood until now, and we should do that). <Br /> To illustrate, for example, that Leontine is a brilliant, passionate philosopher and scientist, she shows her struggling chemicals from goblet to goblet and shouts the names of famous scientists. And the romance between Agis and the princess is even more playful. For this, the couple were to receive a joint 'Clair Danes' award, which in a fair world would be awarded for free anachronistic and uninspired reinterpretation of interesting teens from literature as brats from the 1990s (see Miss Danes in Les Miserables). <br /> <br /> Apart from the gruesome plot and dialogue, there are some attempts to introduce artistic troops into the movie. For example, there are moments when a handful of spectators fade in and out of the action, sitting in chairs and seeing the protagonists. The director wants us to realize that she has adapted a game. I understand it. But it doesn't happen far into the movie at all. At that time, seeing a lot of people sitting in chairs for a moment and disappearing is frightening and distracting. They are like a kind of un-scary zombie crowd that pops up through the mist and fills us with fear. When you see the horrible frolic and song ending this movie, you want to wake your own number of zombies and kill them all for the serious injustice by poisoning your mind for 112 minutes. <br /> <br /> Matthew McGuire
