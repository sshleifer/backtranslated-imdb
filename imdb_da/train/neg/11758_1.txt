I saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed. It's so bad that it's actually fun in a very dignified way. <br /> <br /> Gael is horrible, I think he just can't trade, period. He should give up now, as appearance is clearly not his thing. His co-stars are about the same caliber, I'm sure my 5-year-old cousin could do a better job than all of them! The director must be ashamed of having put his name on something so ridiculous. Somehow, I don't think an Oscar is on the cards for this guy. I never wrote a comment on IMDb, but this movie was so bad I felt compelled to do it. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to watch this movie, don't be 0/10 if there was a 0
