The potential film extravaganza that was set in the 19th century failed to produce. With big names actors like Maggie Smith, Albert Finney and many others, there was no reason for the movie to fail. However, the film lacked an end, had apologized for a plot line, and broke with continuity. A typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy, gathered together by love and destroyed by the beauty (or lack thereof) and disapproval, has a touching side of a mother's early death and an absent father. The father played by Finney is a disturbed man who plagues his daughter in life as well as death. He believes his daughter's lack of good looks would ruin his fortune by marrying under their social status. The actors in vain tried to save what was left of the story. Washington Square is a black hole of destruction and destruction and wasting precious time for those who sadly see. I give this movie a 1 instead of a 0, solely for the players' attempts. Save yourself, stay free from Washington Square.
