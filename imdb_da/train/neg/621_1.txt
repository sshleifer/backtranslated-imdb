Holy @ #% & this movie was still warm and juicy from the pile it was made with. I tried to see this pile of festering garbage but found it easier to cut my wrists and slug back a shooter of Lysol floor scrubbers than endure more than half of the shit that was on my screen. I rank this well under something I've ever seen on movies or TV, and that says something. I once saw a cow crap in a field. I saw the steaming pile for an hour and a half, who knows ... it could have moved or something. Well it was time better spent than seeing this tripe. The action was non-existent, the plot was somewhere other than this movie. I think I saw a bit early when the plot managed to escape and ride out in the background at the back of an old pickup truck to Portland hoping to become a Steven King shi77er. Tell me that the director gets medication that he so desperately needs. It's pretty clear that he needs heavy medication and I want to provide the money needed for his lobotomy reverse. Bah ... I can't give this review the full blow it needs because nothing this painful can ever be done justice in written words alone. Let me just say that if you are looking for a girl to pass some time and you see this Chilton on the rack, go to your car, start the engine, and push both your fists right into the fan until you can't feel it your bones vibrate more. Make sure you have your purse in hand, also because you have to blow up cash anyway. You might as well have the privilege of wasting it yourself. <br /> <br /> By the way, I saw this after a "friend" of mine sent his girlfriend over so I could see it. He came over, she also had. What's worse is that she had to see this $% & @ thing twice! I heard their poison now and he will visit his balls once a month. I hope it was because of this movie.
