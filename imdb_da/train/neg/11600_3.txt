After the success of Part 4, another successor was a natural feature. But they should have stopped it before it started. Alice, after surviving part 4, finds herself pregnant, and Freddy seems to be using his unborn child to come to his victims, which of course is Alice's friends. Strange nightmare movie, very heavy on religious images and bad acting. The special effects are good, but the film itself is not.
