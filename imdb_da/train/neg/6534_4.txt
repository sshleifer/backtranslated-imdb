This sci-fi adventure is not the best and by no means the worst. I agree with the statement that bad sci-fi is comical. Bizarre pink tones and unusual special effects make this a favorite for late, late and late show viewers. Space scientists on the planet Mars are fighting for strange giant amoeba-like monsters and other strange creatures. Pretty cool. The game includes Les Tremayne, Naura Hayden, Gerald Mohr and Jack Kruschen. Get comfy and enjoy. Don't be bad if you nod for a moment. I agree to add this to the list of cult classics so as not to miss.
