Haunting. A remake, of course. The original was an eerie psychological thriller, and one that has improved over time. Compared to this 1999 remake, it's a classic. There is no sign development here, only caricatures (blurred, the authoritative brain, "I'm going to get out of here", the so sensitive bookworm). But as we looked at how the banks on the special effects were "the star", I think that characters with which you can empathize are a secondary concern. Unfortunately, the effects are ridiculous. Dark cherubs, stretched doors, annoying dead children who can't speak clearly ... and an idiotic juicy end that does it are the darnest to give you a new age-old butterflies and rainbow. I take my skittles verbally, thank you. Bruce Dern, I've seen you since "The Cowboys". Stop it.
