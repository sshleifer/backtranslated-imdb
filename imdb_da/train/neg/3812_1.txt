Full House is one of the worst TV shows ever! Why? Because all the characters are so annoying that it's impossible to carry. The best character is Joey one just he is pretty annoying occasionally. A girl DJ who wrote her character? I will kill myself every time she speaks. to mention when Danny starts with his philosophy. Example: DJ won about ten thousand dollars or more in the casino. But she is not eighteen, so she should not gamble according to the law. ready to pay her the money, but when Danny, her father fleshes her and let's not get the money because she's not eighteen. Come on, give me a break, will you? Since I saw the stupid and childish scene I immediately switched off the television. As for the things they say in this series not even a child would buy. Who in the world could think that Full House is entertaining and fun? Every word they say in this series seems like Shakespeare wrote It was that Shakespere knew how to write and except that he would not be childish and stupid to write something as stupid as they wrote in the script for the full house! <br /> <br /> For anyone who has a bad heart or any kind of poor medical condition or any will for life or a sense of the real world, I highly recommend 'Don't look at the full house'! Not even an episode as a test. Extract this series. Even yourself from stupidity and nonsense. This is the worst TV show ever! I'd rather see Teletubbies then this. "And don't see this."
