Wait, don't tell me ... they threw the movie out and held out. You know, this movie could have been shot in a backdrop in New York. The "Gangster Bangster" I think. Gangster Rap, Designer gangster tights clothes, including carpet, which was somehow moved from the neck to protect from dust storms to the head. I suppose it was protecting the head from the heat filtration through the K-Mart hat. "Budget hire-a-horsie", it seems, delivered horsies. The one bedroom scene where the girl spoke and the guy mouthed her words .... I was even though he was talking. You know watching this movie just confirms what it's about to shop more ... it's about appearance and it's about the money. Couldn't have been too much of what this movie is concerned about. All in all, I think this movie will go down as the very best movie ever made. Just one more thing, where was Ice T? Did he finally go to Oprah?
