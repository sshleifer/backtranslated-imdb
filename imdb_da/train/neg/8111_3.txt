Another fantastic movie of Costa-Gavras. It is a good presentation of the situation is Latin America and the US commitment to Latin American politics. Facts may or may not be accurate, but it is a fact that the United States was deeply involved in coups and support from Latin American dictatorships. <br /> <br /> Despite this, the film's spirit follows the typical left-wing / communist propaganda of the Cold War era. Costa-Gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer and his film is always biased. For example, he presents the American actions as brutal and inhuman, while representing Tupamaros extremist activities as something positive. As it turned out, it was a blessing for Uruguay and the rest of Latin America that the United States became involved. Europe is filled with poor Eastern European prostitutes. I have never heard of poor Uruguayan or Chilean girls who prostitute themselves much as it happens in most Eastern European countries. The US fought for a modest war, and God blessed us all the monster of Soviet communism was defeated. It is unfortunate that the United States had to do what it did in Latin America (and elsewhere), but sometimes you need to play dirty. This is not an idealistic world like Costa-Gavras and Matamoros as believing. If Matamoros came to power in Uruguay, we would have had another Ukraine in Latin America. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie follows corrupt and bankrupted left-wing ideologies of times past and tries to convey it as idealistic and morally correct.
