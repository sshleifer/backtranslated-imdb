Facts about National Lampoon go to the movies, among others. National Lampoon's Movie Madness: <br /> <br /> 1. The movie is poor, even after Lampon's typical standards. 2. It's not fun. 3. No one goes to watch a movie. So, when I finished seeing it, I began to wonder why on earth it says 'National Lampoon Goes to the Movies' and why it was ever perceived much less actually made. It would be like calling Austin Powers 'American Guy Goes to the movies.' How inhibiting. He is not American and he does not go to movies. None of the signs in Lampon's so-called "satire" are funny, and no one sees movies, causing a bit of a problem. I was hoping it would be something in the Mystery Science Theater 3000, but it is not. <br /> <br /> This was National Lampoon's first movie after Animal House, though you couldn't tell about the quality of movies. Poorly developed, rough and amateurish of any standard, it induces headaches ?? Not a good sign of an 89-minute movie that appears to be double the length. <br /> <br /> I noticed a pattern. Really bad movies are typically renamed ?? and this little disaster falls into this category. It has two separate titles - probably to try to promote it to people who are too stupid to remember how badly a panning it received from home video critics in 1982/83. 'Hmm, Movie Madness ?? I have never heard of this movie before! Let's rent it! 'And then the realization: "Hey, wait a minute, this is just National Lampoon Goes to the Movies!" <br /> <br /> It was enveloped by MGM / UA, never to be released to theaters or DVDs; it sometimes comes up on TV a couple of times per. decade, which is only the only place you can find it. <br /> <br /> It is divided into three stories ?? a parody of videos with self-enlargement, butter and homelessness and police brutality / cop-buddy movies (I think). The first segment of stars Peter Riegert (Animal House) as a frustrated guy separating his wife and doing some other things. I'm not sure what because it was so boring, my mind began to slip. Until the sex scene appeared. <br /> <br /> Part II is about an exotic dancer raped by a butterfly (don't ask) who decides to become Queen of Margarine so she can eliminate the supply of dairy products. Ouch! This contains the only fun line in the movie: 'Only I can love with my son!' If you think that doesn't sound very funny, are you right? it is not. And just imagine ?? It's the highlight of this movie! Part III is about a policeman chasing a serial killer (Christopher Lloyd) to lose his nerve and shoot the guy. It contains a fun scene but it is extremely over-acted ?? Only Lloyd shows real humor, plays his character dry and compassionate, yet strangely surreal. The part where he stifles his victim and the shabby policeman stands by to see it all unfold at least a chuckle or two. It is a shame to see such a cast of semifinamic names resort to low standards. The authors of each segment clearly believe that they are very ironic and wise by spoofing so-called stereotypes ?? The error is that the movie becomes a major contradiction, favoring standard T & A instead of plot; raw humor instead of witty dialogue; Desperate performances instead of inspired. It's easy to see that none of the actors were thrilled with the material, mumbling their lines, often so embarrassed they can rarely get eye contact with the camera. <br /> <br /> The movie is not fun as I said before. I once laughed at only one line, and even then it was a half-hearted one. Two chuckles, a smile and a very weak laugh. Compared to Movie Madness, a number of other decent comedies seem like regular laughs. <br /> <br /> I like the National Lampoons Vacation series (or at least three out of four) and their classic Animal House, but their recent drop of direct-to-video bombs like Golf Punks (with the great comic genius Tom Arnold) gives a good example of why their magazine went out of print for more than a decade ago. It gets really old, really fast. <br /> <br /> Sad to see a new movie called Gold Diggers being released with their 'approval stamp'. It's like condemning a movie before it even hits theaters ?? Perhaps they should start promoting their names everywhere. <br /> <br /> Distributor: 'This movie is bad. It is approved by the National Lampoon stamp. It will teach you not to do something so terrible next time. '<br /> <br /> Forget about the death penalty. Just keep a bunch of criminals in a room and have them watch it again and again every day for a month. It's so bad that I can't even begin to explain my horrible savagery. I give up.
