Fiction movie (it lists as based on a story, though it has a "documented" credit) of a group of scientists entering the wilderness of Canada to try to find a Bigfoot. (They will catch one and then attach a tracking device). Its lots of scientific mumbo jumbo mixed in what really is a dull movie of a bunch of people wandering around the desert. There are some attempts to create tensions and scares, but to be honest, there is nothing worth seeing outside of some beautiful images of the game. This is a perfect definition of an exercise movie, it promises you so much, a look at Bigfoot, but in reality it does deliver very little. Recommended only for insomniacs
