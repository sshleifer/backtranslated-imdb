I should issue a warning all the time and say that the movie should not be seen. It fails to be an appropriate tribute in such a grandiose way that it is almost an insult to the memories of the brave men. The special effect was horrible, I didn't expect the overall lack of the director to appreciate military technology. How can a machine gun that normally burns at a speed of 600 rounds per Minute fire at 1 / 10th speed? How can soldiers come when a grenade explodes in front of them? How can people survive when there are artillery shells falling as close as 20 meters away? How come the artillery shells only fall on both sides of the road and not the road itself? <br /> <br /> not only did this respect for the weapon shake me, it was the clever situations and the inconsistency of the dialogues that had me screaming murder. There were the standard dialogues such as Ye Bhi Kisi Ka Bhai Hai, Ise Laath Mat Maro and Pakistan's jeaada musal maan to Hindustand me hai and LOC Cross math caro ye more hakum hai. Stupid to say the least. <br /> <br /> What Shobha They Have Written Is True. The director worked without a script and it shows. There is no power for the movie. There is no gradual progression from one blow to another. It is only a shot after the next without connection to the war overwrite. The explanatory scenes are awful. The chief of army personnel does not look convincing. To make matters worse, the theater people had discriminated against cut footage to fit the four-hour movie for 3 hours.
