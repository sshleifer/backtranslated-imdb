I went to watch this movie with my 17 y.o. daughter. I insisted we went to matin√©e, not because I'm a tightwad, but just the feeling I had. In the NASCAR spirit, this is a sponsor's dream. So much obvious advertising, it almost qualifies as an info mercial if it wasn't for the so-called play. Continuing with the tradition, the Herbie franchise continues with its cheese-historical lines, the car being just a "vehicle" (no pun intended) for this cornball of a movie image. Earlier Herbie installments (though cheesy) were produced during more severe times, making them slightly easier to digest. Ms. Lohan, Disney's ruling drama queen, has little-acting ability. I was surprised that Mr. Keaton and Mr. Dillon would be involved in such a project. Only the snack bar was a bigger ripoff!
