Really everyone in this movie looks like they will be somewhere else! No wonder the casting is not done with the left hand, but not at all at all. I haven't seen anything worse than Natascha McElhone, who mimics a kind of agent carrying a gun. You don't use a spoiled city-like look in such a role. The only worse thing I can imagine is casting Doris Day as a prostitute. The rest of the casting is also horrible, possibly with Hurt as the only exception, sometimes you can see him try but suffer. Oh, do I mention it's an insane story? Did many people kill lives because you are divorced and want to see your family? Well, it must be because the guy (Weller) is German? <br /> <br /> 2/10 because shooting could be worse.
