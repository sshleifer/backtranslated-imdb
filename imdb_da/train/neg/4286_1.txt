This is basically the first Jason Scott Lee movie I've seen. I say a lot because I've also seen a soldier where he plays the villain ... but from what I've heard, it's not considered a Jason Scott Lee movie. However, this is. And if this is an indication of the quality of such films, I will not see any of the others. Lee is basically passable as a martial artist ... as the management he is horrible. He comes in a battle with random no-name characters every few minutes of the movie, probably because the screenwriter could not figure out how to otherwise stretch the movie to the minimum necessary playing time for a feature film. The villain is the only character with even a hint of personality, and apart from the fact that he is certified insane, he hardly seems like a villain at all. Most of the movie is basically Lee chasing the villain over time ... or maybe it's the other way around. I can't say for sure ... and I certainly wouldn't see it again to be sure. The effects aren't quite terrible ... but it's close. The title comes from the popular idea of ​​using a time machine to go and kill Hitler. Somehow, the film screws up the interesting idea as well. The reason is too complicated for its own good. Pacing is bad. I can't think of a positive thing to say about this movie ... I really can't. It is simply too formal and meaningless. If I only had a time machine, then I could go back and prevent this movie from ever being made ... no, not against. I just hope to get fragile minds exposed to this as possible. Listen to the negative reviewers. Avoid this turkey. I recommend this to Lee's fans and no one else. If you are looking for a quality movie ... yes it is not. That is for sure. 1.10
