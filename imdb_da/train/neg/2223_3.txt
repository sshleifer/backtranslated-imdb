Trite, clich√© dialogue and plotting (the same kind of thing we experienced all through the 1980s fantasy films), hokey music and a sign for numbers knock this out of the race for everyone but the most hardcore fans. <Br /> <br /> What saves this movie from the junk hill is the beautiful crutch of Bakshi's work, rotoscoping and the fact that Frank Frazetta taught the animators how to draw like him. This is Frazetta ... in motion. The violence is spectacular, and the art direction and the animation are unlike any other sword & turkish movie in the period. <br /> <br /> I like to watch this with the sound off and play the soundtrack to the first Conan movie instead.
