the only worst movie I've ever seen in a theater. I watched this movie at the austin film festival in 2004, and it was a blow to me that this film was accepted for a festival. It was an interesting prerequisite, and thought it could go somewhere, but fell apart each time it tried to do something. First of all, if you are going to make a musical, find someone with musical talent. The music consisted of cheesy piano games that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they filmed. The lyrics were terribly written, and as they were not obvious rhymes, they were moaning rhythms that showed how far they stretched to try to do this film. And you think you would find people who could sing when making a musical, didn't you? not in this case. Luckily, they were half-talking / half-song in rhyme most of the time, but when they sang it made me cringe. especially when they tried to sing in harmony. and it is just aimed at the music. some of the actors were pretty good, but much of the dialogue was horrible as well as most of the scenes. Of course, they didn't have enough coverage on the scenes, or they just had a bad editor because they consistently jumped the line and used horrible choices while they were splitting the movie. at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script before adding the hook to make it a musical. I hope the investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again.
