(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was very curious to see this movie after hearing it was clever and witty. I had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom I felt. The idea behind the film would have been acceptable: portrays the way the relationship between a man and a woman develops through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience. What didn't make me the whole movie was two things. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the movie was so down-to-earth that it seemed like describing the problems a couple had to solve during the day to day became commonplace and boring. <br /> <br /> Second, the overall dullness of production, with dialogues that were barely understandable. <br /> <br /> Too bad.
