Can I give this a minus rating? None? Well, let me say this is the most horrible movie I've ever tried to see. It was painful. Boringus Maximus. The reason (?) Is well hidden in several sub-levels of nebulosity. I rented this movie with a friend and after approx. 30 minutes hoped it would get better, we decided to "fast forward" a little to see if things would get better. It never gets better. This movie that some guys are kidnapped by these two girls sounds interesting, but in reality it's just a bore. Nothing even externally interesting ever happens. If you ever get the chance to see this, do yourself a favor, try "PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE" instead.
