Reviews for this movie were lukewarm at best, while expectations were sky-high: a huge budget, lots of popular faces, a pretty fun idea and a lead that everyone loves. The end result is a disaster. Alice Tremblay's supposed humorous journey in the fantasy world in no way fails to entertain that audience (I didn't hear a single laugh throughout the presentation) that goes through the side-dense storyline and one-dimensional characters without a single spark, not a sign of the magic of the desired it had. The 90 minute movies here are sterile with clumsy direction, and some good actors do their best to come as professionals in a feature that certainly could not seem so great an idea on the set, let alone on paper. 'L'Odyss√©e d'Alice Tremblay' is a collage of comics linked to a (very) thin layer of good ideas. Avoid or boredom will haunt you.
