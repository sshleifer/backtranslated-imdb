I was hoping that this movie would be mildly entertaining, like any other genre. However, it was lame and I didn't find myself laughing. Watch it on HBO, maybe, or if you have a free rent for waste and you need a movie to pass the time. But I do not recommend paying to see it. <br /> <br /> The reason is simple and straightforward, and it could have been fun, maybe if the script was better. Jason Lee can be fun and he gets a few laughs here and there, but the movie falls flat. Just don't go see this one. The management is lacking, but for what it is, governance is not so important. I think the biggest drawback is that it's just not much fun. See something else, don't play your time here.
