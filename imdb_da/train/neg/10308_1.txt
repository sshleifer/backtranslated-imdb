This really is really bad. Lamas just shows how another rate actor does his job. But what makes it worth watching is the scene where OJ really takes a fellow police at the neck as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the text "I have proof of you!". (Allows me to hear the rest of the texts - attributed to David Gregoli and Leslie Oren, but I couldn't find it on iTunes). Talk about looking into the future ... For fun of words. The rest of the movie is forgettable. The score and songs are more interesting than the script. It's the successor. Which question why they would make a sequel at all. My understanding was that foreign sales ran many of these B movies. Doesn't say much about the world's visual habits.
