Rented a lot of blockbuster movies last night, and that was the first thing I watched (it was late on a Saturday night, wanted a "horror movie fix") ... <br /> <br /> Wow, this was horrible, almost embarrassing so ... Stupid slasher-type story I really thought movies like Scream had stopped; amateur actors who provide clich√©d 'and insipid dialogue that are hard to believe were actually written and read a page; and do scenes that are nothing to be excited about (especially when it happens in a movie that is poorly written). <br /> <br /> But I always thought that no movie is 100% percent totally worthless. Here are the few good things I can say about this mess: <br /> # 1 Bobbie Phillips: Love this actress. She is the only member of the cast who shows any acting talent at all. The only reason I took the chance to rent this is because her name was on the cover. She deprives her presence in this boy with professionalism, though she seems to be confused at times that she is acting in such a moronic history. <br /> <br /> 2 Unintentional Hilarity: This is the kind of movie I remember watching back as there were still gatehouse theaters around the country, and they used to include crap like this as the third movie on a triple -bill with a prestige thriller movie that finally made it to the hinterland. Unfortunately, in this direct-to-video age, most viewers have to endure these turkeys alone now without the municipal experience being part of an audience that scares and throws things on the screen because the movie is so terrible. Which leads to-- <br /> <br /> # 3 Pornstars who are trying to act!: Mostly at hand, because the manufacturers don't have to pamper or reject them to indulge in extended sex scenes, but this trade usually means that they will actually speak some lines that will tell a story (except "ooh yeah baby" or "harder!"). And with pride they all live academically and look stupid when they try to act. I would almost exclude Ginger Lynn Allen from this group if her character was not to be an Irish mother, and she actually tries to make an accent that just keeps the smiles coming. <br /> <br /> It is nice to look for the positive in all experiences, and that's what I took from this cesspool aka "Evil Breed"
