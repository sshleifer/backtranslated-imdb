Dear me ... Peter Sellers was one of the most strangely talented actors. But his choice of film, after 1964, was very unfortunate. He did not realize how to use his talents. He would have been better off working with more of the movie church's cubricks than the people he did. Of his later films, only "The Optimists of Nine Elms" and "Being There" have impressed me by those I have seen. <br /> <br /> Having said that, Boultings and Sellers had made a couple of movies ahead of that, it doesn't sound too bad - I haven't yet seen "Carlton Browne" and "Heavens Above!" - at least in the sense of using Sellers well to some extent. But, "There is a girl in my soup" is really a bad movie and a bleak choice on Sellers' part in terms of character. In his 1955-64 films, you can usually expect at least some very inventive twist and always a puzzling conviction in his roles. Here you have Peter Sellers trying to play a typical romantic leadership. It's almost Sellers who play a Niven Cad without the joviality. He certainly does not convince, try as he may, or create an interesting character. He should have left such parts to sovereigns as Cary Grant, concentrating on the exciting dramatic and comical roles he was famous for. <br /> <br /> Hawn and Sellers really don't create any real chemistry; this is not easy, brilliant romance of the kind perfected by William Powell and Myrna Loy. It is very artificially apparent, all the way through - I know that it is part of Danver's character that he is a dry dealer of ladies, but he does not really change it in a way that convinces. Sellers have a very gritty way to play "charm" too ... this character really has no depth, and really doesn't get the viewer sympathy or interest. Sellers go through the movements in a way that one would not imagine when remembering the grandeur of his sharp, iconoclastic performance in "Lolita". There is really nothing to say about the plot, the direction or the characters, which honestly they leave little or no impression. This is really one of the most anemic, complacent, disgruntled and easily boring movies I've ever seen. A nonentity of a "vehicle" to Sellers' undisputed talents. <br /> <br /> Rating: - * 1/2 / *****
