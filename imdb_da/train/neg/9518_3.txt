Bad performances by Sinatra, Martin and Hyer. Gross underdeveloped supporting characters. Annoying talky without proper plot. The ending leaves you flatter than a pancake with more loose ends than you could tie in four successors (that is, if you even cared about these wooden characters). MacLaine is the only real asset. The penultimate order in which "Chicago hood" seeks Sinatra character is ridiculous. The music in that sequence is also bad. And in the last scene where Martin's character removes his hat from the woman, he called a "pig," almost made me out and found a stone to throw through my TV screen.
