Anemic comedy drama, an unhappy, seemingly hasty affair with Cher as a woebegone housewife who slowly makes friends with the hitman who has been hired to kill her by her husband. Chazz Palminteri, as the flashy hired gun, adapted the manuscript from its own game with stagy set-ups and back and forth dialogs that quickly hit the eye and ear. An air of gloom hangs over the whole project, and director Paul Mazursky can't get Cher out of his eternal funk (she's listless). After all, the best talent (including Robert De Niro as one of the producers) is "faithful" fraudulent, without content for the story and the characters that rarely come to life. * 1/2 from ****
