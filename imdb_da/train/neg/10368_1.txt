This "movie" is such a bad job! Nothing seems to try and be realistic. Plot is weak, actresses - actors wonder as in a 1st year's production, trying very hard to act without any chance from the start. What a flop! What a waste of time, money and effort for everyone involved, including the audience. Now, as in any thriller, here are also murders, corpses and blood. Imagine a person who committed a murder with a knife 5 minutes ago and came out quietly and smiling, not to mention pure as a whistle, as if frightening the throat is made by a virtual agent. Also, this murder was to be carried out by a small, fragile woman on a tall, strong man, and she cut her throat !!! Did she politely ask him to bow to her? Much more stupidity of the same kind happens and continues to leave the audience if it was a joke that just turned out to be a bad one. Continuity is another major problem, for example: The eager-hungry groom is lying in bed waiting for his virgin bride to come out of the bathroom and after a long sleep (!?!). The next scene opens with the young couple into the reception and asks for guidance for scenarios! Not a word of last night ??? How to waste time trying to write about this low low supposed "movie".
