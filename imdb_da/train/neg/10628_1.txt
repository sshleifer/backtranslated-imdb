This so-called "documentary film" tries to tell that the United States falsified the moon landing. Years to the right. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has actually studied the case knows otherwise. <br /> <br /> First of all, there is absolute evidence. When the astronauts were on the moon, they brought many mouth wallet rock from the moon - for geological studies. These were scattered around the world to hundreds of labs that tested them. And they all concluded that they came from the same planet, not the earth: because the inner elements of the basic elements are different from those found on the ground, but resemble those intended for the moon. DVS. The conspiracy theorists never study anything: they only take the thing that fits into their theory and ignore the rest. Another wrongful assertion from them is that theirs was wind in the hangar, where they shot the moon landing, the IE flag moving. There is a logical explanation: the astronaut moved it by hand so it moved. And what proves this: Well, if the conspiracy theorists themselves studied the footage, they would see that the flag NEVER moves after the astronaut has left it, I.E. The conspiracy theorists are bad scientists, they cannot study a subject correctly, or only study it until they have what they came for so they can lie from there and make money (IE this so-called "documentary"). A claim says it cannot have been filmed on the moon because all the shadows come from different places because there are different light sources, the artificial lighting from the studio. Once again, conspiracy theorists are wrong (as usual), the same would happen in a desert at night at night, without light sources. But I doubt that any conspiracy theorists have ever been outside their grandmother's basement for more than how many days a Star Treck Convention has been over. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy theorists are in denial, BIG TIME. They only see what they want to see. So they make all these lies seem important - it's a fact.
