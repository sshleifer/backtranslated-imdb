This is a movie that is bad in every way possible. Sure we like to know what happened 12 years from the last movie and it works at some level. But the new characters are just not interesting. Baby Melody is horribly horrible! Alas, while the logic that humans cannot underwater forever, is maintained, other fundamental physical logic is ignored. It's cool if you don't have cold weather clothing if you're in the Arctic. I do not know why most of the comments here return of Jafar bet worse, I thought this is more horrible.
