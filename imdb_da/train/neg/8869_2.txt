With the release of "Dangerous Past", the Swedish film industry has really hit the rock bottom. Stefan (Jens Hultén) ​​has in recent years lived a quiet life with his wife Marie (Regina Lund). One day, an old friend of Stefans comes with a service to ask him. Stefan is going to do a little courier job. He was to bring a suitcase filled with heroine through Swedish-German customs. Unfortunately, things in Germany are not as planned, and Stefan is now in big trouble. It is always nice to see a Swedish film that breaks the traditional family drama pattern. Unfortunately, if the people involved in the production have no idea how a movie is supposed to be written, filmed or cut, the result can only be disastrous. The content can be concluded with: bad action, an incoherent plot and idiotic dialogues. The only highlight in the film is the unconscious sex scene with the incredibly beautiful Regina Lund. This lasts only a few seconds, which gives about 90 minutes clean, let's say what it really is, crap.
