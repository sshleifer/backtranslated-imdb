While the majority of the movie is very amateurish, Kosher slaughtering scene is up, but not untrue. Kosher law says that an animal must be conscious when the leaf touches its skin. The Kosher slaughter scene is accurate as everyone knows who has seen one, or has seen the Peta movie showing a Kosher slaughter where the animal's neck is cut and the esophagus cut out while it is still alive, conscious and of course suffering. We must remember that the story is written by the victors. Is it even allowed to even believe that perhaps the Nazis were right? <br /> <br /> Doesn't it say that the Nazis had banned this vicious religious slaughter, and the Jews are still practicing it today?
