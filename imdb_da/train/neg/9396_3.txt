Radar Men from the Moon is a fairly typical fare of 1950 series. The special effects are pretty cheap, the lunar riders are obviously surplus patrons from World War II with painted plywood over them and the like. The action is only so-so. It inspires the child's imagination, which I believe in, was aimed at. With today's standards, it's boring, cheap and bad. There is also a large amount of stock footage in the first 9 episodes of natural disasters.
