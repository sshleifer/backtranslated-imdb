I want to say that the play is bad, but I think it was the guide that did that. I never thought much of Highlander (same director), but it could be due in the 80s. <br /> <br /> However, this has no excuses. People are being shot while leaving ditches with a man in front of him! These kinds of errors, along with an unclear timeline, weird combat tactics, under-pairing and poor visual effects, make this a sub-movie of all. <br /> <br /> So, as so many others have commented, all this American bullshit. The German general is practically afraid of his captured American private. Be prepared to swallow a lot of it, even if it is in small doses. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, it's not a horrible yet subordinate war movie in every aspect.
