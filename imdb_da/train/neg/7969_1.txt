OK another movie bought by me and Joe Swatman. OK this is not the worst movie I've reviewed this week, but it still sucked royaly. We had a lot of fun watching this piece of crap. Monster Jigsaw is a mish mash of all these dysfunctional student ideas, you just know yourself in trouble when someone equips him with a buzzsaw and a miss of shotgun, the movie was not as ugly as we hoped I mean death is a heart attack. Again, I think the play sucks, the sum of the actors must be pornstars, and you get into her underwear for any reason. <br /> <br /> The absolute worst part is the end, leaving it openly for a bit of a Jigsaw 2, but it never happens that Gunna stands out above it. <br /> <br /> My ratings: <br /> <br /> fun 4/100 mock (how much fun we had mocking it) 73/100 acting 8/100 overall 12/100
