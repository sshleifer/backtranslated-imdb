For door-hard Judy Garland fans only. There are two (2) numbers that are really good - one where she does a number with an older cleaning lady (you have all seen the pictures), and a pretty good number at the end. There are a few scenes where the lines are fun. But basically the script is so bad, and the movie is so dated that it's hard not to cut the horror all over. But it's worth 2.50 to rent the movie - just be prepared to speed it up.
