***** probably less spoilers ****** <br /> I can't say I liked it, but I can't say I didn't ... it was very strange. It has bad things in it, such as a shark that came out of nowhere with the worst CGI you can imagine, if I were a director, I would probably cut that part so I wanted to stop seeing the rest of film. .. For some people it will be boring because it lacks action, feels at home made sometimes ... Take, for example, a scene that one of your friends died, and the next thing they do is what? nop, don't cry ... their telling horror stories to each other .. * sugar * (just after crying for hes lost) <br /> <br /> Another silly thing was when they talked inside the boat they had like " one hundred "candles in the table in front of them ... the boat is surrounded by a kind of ragdardine (old cloths covering the windows) and sofas / coupons ... I thought it was stupid, using candles, but not thought of the surroundings besides being in the high seas alone ... The good ones, some scary scenes, they are nicely finished, I liked some. Sometimes horror seems better when it is hidden, when behind something instead of showing off, so this movie does well, maybe because it's a low budget, I don't know, but it works fine for me! You will feel tension if you forget some holes like the ones I mentioned above. Don't expect much from it! but if you like something from movies, watch this, be patient, try to enjoy .. lol <br /> <br /> (sorry my raw english) =) <br /> <br /> Cheers
