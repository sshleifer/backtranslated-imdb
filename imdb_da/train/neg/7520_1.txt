This movie proves that you can't judge a movie of the amazing artwork on the DVD cover. It also shows that you should learn more about a movie before you buy it (or get it for a person at Christmas). The beginning of this movie actually looks a little promising. Well, until you meet the characters. Pumpkin Jack (the old guy from the street) brings the college with a book full of witch magic, which he leaves in their annual haunted house (where the film takes place). Then there's something to drink, huge and soft core porn. Then the film's action finally takes place after over an hour. <br /> <br /> All in all, Hallow's End was predictable, inexhaustible, and reminiscent of a soft core porn. This movie is probably best seen together with a group of friends who have nothing better to do, as it is a good movie to have fun with. And for first-time viewers it is really fun to make predictions about the order of people who die.
