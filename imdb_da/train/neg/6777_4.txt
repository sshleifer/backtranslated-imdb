While I recently gave OPERATION PETTICOAT a positive review, I really didn't like this movie even though it had so many similarities. Both were made just a few years apart, both star Cary Grant and both were World War II comedies. But the general tone and style of the films was completely different. KISS HERE FOR ME, as a whole seemed just like a cheaper movie - with poor writing, little energy and some very broad notions - even compared to OPERATION PETTICOAT. I think at least that much of the blame lies in casting Jayne Mansfield. The combination of her great talents and limited acting abilities really made this A-budget movie look like it came from a 3rd-rate studio. Plus, there wasn't much chemistry or energy in mating her with Cary Grant - an actor was generally loved for her grace and class. It's like mating Sir Lawrence Olivier with Marjorie Main.
