I just watched The Convent for the second time. I had enjoyed it earlier and figured it would make for a good drunk Friday night movie, some gore, some style, some humor and the like. I was sorry to find out that I could no longer appreciate it very much. It looked like someone had set out to revise cheeseball pics like Night of the Demons to a modern audience, but lost the things that made the original worth. For the record I'm not even a big fan of the night of the demons, but there were some things I really did dig about it. The convention does the cheese, but not the goodness so much. Apart from the maiden (sympathetic performance of Joanna Canton), the goth girl and a sweet came from Adrienne Barbeau, it was almost all the characters that were terribly unlikely and adhering to the absolute lowest level of moronic offensive jockhood. The movie is so severely hampered by the complete lack of free nudity, which means that considering the terrible dialogue, it is difficult to see the characters and harder to appreciate the good points of the movie. The evil nuns are original in design and get lots of good scenes, but not scary, they are certainly sweet, and the movie also marks a lot of nice things. Towards the end, when Adrienne Barbeau is on stage, the movie becomes quite entertaining because all the unpleasant people are dead and it is a vicious non-bashing frenzy. The stylized direction also gives occasional good results, although the camera sometimes moves too fast. All in all, this was a movie where for me the shining good points just can't make up for the things I hated. Those who are more eager for this kind of movie like it much more, but for me it wasn't a good time.
