In fact, I didn't mind the Geico advertisements the first 50 times so I saw them and even found them a little angry and funny, but seriously! This is the best thing these people could come up with?!? This show sucks! It's boring and feels like watching an episode of "The Office" with the characters disguised as the cavemen (I know many of them will hate me to say it, but "The Office" just doesn't do it for me). Okay, I understand: We have the poor slob just trying to keep his nose clean and he has a villain who hates him; the pseudo-intellectual who really only has a barely functioning intellect; and the dopey who will just be accepted but so what !!! I've worked with these people and found them just as annoying in real life as I do on TV ... why would I like to waste another 1/336 of my week and see more of these types nominate?!? Please call your parents and ask them if they lost you on the head, if after thinking about it you will still make yourself believe this is entertainment.
