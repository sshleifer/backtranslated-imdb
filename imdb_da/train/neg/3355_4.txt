There were only two things that kept me interested in this movie: I was waiting for Owen Wilson to die, and Catherine Zeta Jones. <br /> <br /> This was pretty much a woman's show. Catherine Zeta Jones was right there to give the eye-candy. Liam Neeson was completely wasted in this movie. Like Jones, he had no role whatsoever. The movie was all Lily Taylor (Ransom, Ready to Wear). She was the only one who had any real role in this crappy script by David Self. OK, it was his first and he redeemed himself with Road to Perdition. <br /> <br /> I don't know which director Jan de Bont's problem was. He did a good job with Speed ​​and Twister. He really fell down on the job here. Perhaps he was still coming back from the disaster Speed ​​2: Cruise Control. He should thank his lucky stars for The Wild Wild West, otherwise this would be the worst picture of 1999. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
