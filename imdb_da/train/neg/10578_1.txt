Horror fans (I'm talking to those over the age of 12, but if you are under 12, I apologize for what you might consider insulting): In short, if you appreciate having your imagination disturbed by the well-written, original story, drawn by unpredictable Well-planted scares and delivered through convincing performances, I can highly recommend - AVOID THEIR STEAMERS - made by directors who apparently long ago passed their sales by date. It is no coincidence that almost every episode feels like it was made in the 1980s. In order not to blame the shoulders of some of these old boys (or even the 80s), because where would we be without certain films from eg. Argento, Carpenter, Landis, Dante and Barker (Actually Clive, WTF do you in there? Happy to see Romero had the good sense to give it a miss, since I'm sure he was asked to attend ... ). More perhaps, we must point to creator Mick Garris, whose credentials include the logical defying and depressing ill-advised television remake of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 'The Shining'. It may be an indication of the state of television today. Are we so hungry with good TV horror that we welcome any old, dull chuckle that the networks secrete on our set? Unfortunately, maybe so. <br /> <br /> Normally, I wouldn't see the point of adding a comment that doesn't conflict with the flaws and benefits of a production, I just wanted to judge it accordingly. But since this series is lacking in any kind of profit (with perhaps the only exception to the theme), I write this as more a warning than a review: DO NOT PLAY YOUR TIME AND MONEY. If you disagree with me then it is more than likely that you have not seen enough decent horror. Perhaps the earlier films from some of these directors were a much better place to start, but if these "Masters of Horror" were judged alone on these works, they would never have been allowed to finish with their bachelor's degree. Unless they themselves studied for a degree from the University of S ** t.
