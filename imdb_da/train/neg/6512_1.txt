With no affinity to any kind of filmmaking and a sound understanding of documentaries, I can honestly say I was angry with myself for bothering to sit through the entire length of "20 Dates". I will not waste your time with the plot, you can read other reviews. I would say that Berkowitz's hyper, Woody Allen-style tale was extremely annoying. You also didn't want him to put off the coffee or take some sedatives. And it may be for Berkowitz himself that this film was a bad idea, as parts of it describe his attempts to fund the documentary. Forgive me for hiding insults as compliments, but I give credit to Berkowitz for having the skills to convince some idiot to fund this horrible piece of ****. I appreciate the film's boundaries and intentions here, but even when it comes to the standards that Berkowitz sets for himself, he fires out and misses at all levels. Finally, I am sure that many of these female companions were not able to go on a date with an exciting, wanna-bee movie maker, and so I question the film's sense of authenticity. Hey Myles, I loved your movie the first time I saw it ... when it appeared as an episode of Seinfeld or was a movie directed by Woody Allen or Kevin Smith.
