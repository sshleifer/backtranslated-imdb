Camera Work - Why does the camera work in this movie then jump? This is annoying and distracting. Editing - The flashes of the still images were too short. Many of the other scenes were too short. Flashing only. Sound - the background music was too loud and covered by the voices. You don't have to rewind and play again to catch what was said. Does anyone not control these things and make them do it again. Reduce the background music volume in the future. Is the adjustment of the relative sound levels worked by the editor, Julia Wong? The reason had too many loose ends. The basic story line had potential. I think the movie needed more work. Was it hasty? Maybe they ran out of money. Like many movies, it started well, but just petered towards the end. I really don't understand this, you know you have the storyboard before it goes into production, so why not all the loose ends are taken care of in the storyboard. Sorry to be so critical.
