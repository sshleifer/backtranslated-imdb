I didn't know what the movie was about until I saw it because Tashan only had teaser trailers while it was being promoted. So I asked my friends if they knew anything about it and they said "It is the direct debut of Vijay Krishna Acharya who wrote the screenshots for Dhoom 1 & 2 and Saif Ali Khan's son Ibrahim makes his debut in the movie by play him as a child in his repurchase ". <br /> <br /> After seeing it, I understood why their was not a proper trailer because there was nothing in the movie to show. The story was extremely stupid and even a 10 year old child could come up with a better storyline. There was hardly any action and the camera shook at every possible angle, and it's hard to figure out who is killing who. The action was also daft & unrealistic, for example. One man with a gun managed to kill about 100 men with machine guns. As I looked at Tashan it reminded me of 3 movies: <br /> <br /> Sin City: During the opening credits. <br /> <br /> Koyla: Anil Kapoor's terrible English like Amrish Puri in Koyla. <br /> <br /> Jhoom Barabar Jhoom: The outrageous ridiculous jokes that aren't even fun. <br /> <br /> I've also heard the budget is 40 crores, which is the same amount as Dhoom 2, and I don't know where all the money went. Whether you did not like Dhoom 2 then there is absolutely no chance that you will like Tashan. Race was hot on heels and it's a million times better. <br /> <br /> The only 2 good songs are Dil Haara & Challiya, and both songs are shot in Greece in good places, but what is the use of it in a garbage game? Even Anil Kapoor's terrible English couldn't save this discomfort.
