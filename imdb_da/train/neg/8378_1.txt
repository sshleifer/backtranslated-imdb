This movie may be the worst movie I've ever seen in my life! The reason is ridiculous, and the whole "Little Man" crap is just so stupid. The whole movie is unrealistic and stupid. Let's see, it's just a "black comedy". This is just a pointless horrible piece that should never have made it into theaters. The wit is not funny and the play is terrible. I ask you to save your money than to see this worthless piece of shit. I had to endure quotes through little man for an hour and a half if my eyes would bleed. I am impeded that something like this would even be thought of! Who writes this crap? The actors have no talent what ever, how do these people get into Hollywood? They make money on this junk!
