An absolute miserable film !! Nothing ever happens. No ghosts, hardly any trains, no mystery, no interest. The constant and brutal attempts at comedy are painful. Everything else is pathetic. The premise is idiotic: a bunch of people stranded in the middle of no-place because their train was stopped for less than 3 minutes. What? And the railway leaves them no place to live in a heavy storm? I do not think. Oh, they can walk 4 miles over the dead-black fields. umm, yes. Of course. Or they can force themselves on the railway's hospitality and stay at the "haunted" train station. A station that turned out to be nothing but mortal, completely without ghosts, interest or plot. <br /> <br /> So very terribly boring that this seems impossible. <br /> <br /> This should be added to the LOST FILMS list! aargh !!
