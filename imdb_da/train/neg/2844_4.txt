This is one of the worst movies Clark Gable made. Of course, only PARNELL was worse. It's just so painfully clichéd, and the dialogue is so miserable that neither is Gable nor Jean Harlow should have been proud to do. Gable is a heel whose illegal activities result in his girl going to the slam (like gangster talk?). She hopes he will do the right thing, but he just leaves her there - unknown to any of them, gosh, that she is "in the family's way". Eventually the villain returns to the right thing and somehow they tie it all together for a good ending! They seemed to have forgotten Gable's need to take rap and spend years in hoosegow. Leonard Maltin says "the stars are the best here". By what standard? Best to produce accidental chuckles? Gimme a break! <br /> <br /> PS - after saying this, my wife thinks Leonard Maltin should find me and kick my ass. Hmmm. In spite of my comment, however, I believe that Mr. Maltin is the finest proofreader and human on the planet (I hope it reassures him). UPDATE - 2/2/08. Because I didn't like this movie the very first time (especially the ridiculous end), I decided to watch it again. After all, when I see a movie again, I like it a lot more and realize that I was a little too hard. Although it has been the case with several movies in recent months, I did not like this movie - even the second time. Most of it was not because of the film's first half. In the first half, Harlow's characters were incredibly stupid, but at least it was credible. But when she was sent to prison, it was all clichés until the final ridiculous scene of the marriage took place. The bottom line is that this order is embarrassingly stupid - it just makes no sense, and is akin to making the movie a bit of a crazy adventure rather than a love story of two disadvantages. I stand by my original review (despite all "NOT HELPFUL") and believe that apart from PARNELL and possibly POLLY AT CIRCUS, it may just be the worst Gable movie.
