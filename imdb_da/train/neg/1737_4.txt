The last film for Ernst Lubitsch, completed by Otto Preminger after Lubitsch's early death during production, is a juggling episode of sophisticated and silliness, romance and music, fantasy and costume drama. In a 19th-century castle in south-eastern Europe, a Countess falls for his sworn enemy, the leader of the Hungarian rebellion; She is helped by her ancestor whose painted image comes to life. Betty Grable, in a long blonde wig adorned with flowers, has never been more beautiful and her songs are very comfortable. Unfortunately, this script (by Samson Raphaelson taken from an operetta by Rudolf Schanzer and E. Welisch) is flooded with different ideas that do not get under way - or entertain. The results are great, but not absorbent. * 1/2 from ****
