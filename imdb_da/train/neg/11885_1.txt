I will dispense with the usual comparisons with a particular legendary filmmaker known to his neurotic New Yorker persona, to honestly draw comparisons with bumbling loser Josh Kornbluth is just an insult to any such director. I would also like to mention the spot-on satire "Office Space" in the same breath as this celluloid disaster. However, I can compare it to waking up during your own operation ?? It is painful to see and you wonder if the surgeons really know what they are doing. Haiku Tunnel is the kind of movie you want them to pull on in their early stages of production. It was cruel to let it live, and as a result, the audience around the world is hit. <br /> <br /> The film's premise ?? if it actually has a ?? is not even worth discussing, but for the sake of caution I will. Josh Kornbluth, a hobbyist with heavy engagement phobia, offered a permanent job. His main duty is to send out 17 high priority letters to his boss. But, ridiculously, he cannot do this simple task. My reaction? Big deal! It's not a story ?? It is at best a transient way of thinking - one that should have passed any self-respecting movie maker. <br /> <br /> The leading actor ?? if you can call him that ?? is a lumpy buffoon in a man, with lumpy features, a backward, untamed hairline, and a series of facial expressions ranging from cringe making to generally disturbing. How o where did the instructor find this schmuck? What do you say ???? he is an instructor? Oh, my fault. Playing yourself in your own embarrassment on a manuscript is one thing, but I suppose Mr Kornbluth is not as convincing as a human being, let alone an actor. Be sure this is by no means a speechless murder, but never before have I been so riled up by an actor on the screen! My frustration was further confused by his incessant monologues in the camera between scenes. I believe that the viewer needs an odd intelligence to understand this drive, Kornbluth further fights us by explaining the action (first movie recording: "dramatize exhibition"? Show, not tell). Who does this guy think he is? He has no charisma, no charm and judging by his Hawaiian shirts, no sense of style. His casting agent must be shot blank! <br /> <br /> Supporting actors do nothing to alleviate the intense boredom I felt, with only one exception. Patricia Scanlon puts in a very funny look like Helen's former secretary, who has been insanely run by her old boss, and has harassing phone calls from her basement while holding a flashlight under her face. This made me grill me, but the moment went by and I was back to check my watch for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie's title is also a misleading one. Haiku Tunnel has nothing to do with the old form of Japanese poetry. Don't be fooled into thinking that this is an art house movie because of its pretentious sounding title or the fact that it only played in a handful of cinemas and didn't make money at the box office ?????? There is a very good reason for that! <br /> <br />
