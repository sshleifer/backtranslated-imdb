This film is painfully slow and has no plot. It conveys the life of a group of scared boat workers. One of the elderly is sincere in his attempt to get a job. There may be some social comments here, but it is confused since nobody is painted in a very sympathetic light. I don't understand why it had a 7.8 when I decided to see it. I saw the whole boring thing and built expectations for a huge redeeming payout. No luck. The IMDb class has always been a good match for my taste. Something over 6.5 was worth seeing. <br /> <br /> And my wife says Javier Barem doesn't even look good in this movie. He's not my type, so my deal doesn't mean much. <br /> <br /> Sigh. I give it a 1.
