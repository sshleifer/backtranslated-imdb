This movie wastes almost all the actors' talents in what could best be called a "pot boiler". <br /> <br /> Despite the action-packed Top Gun opening, it's all downhill from there with lots of stereotypes and unlikely situations one after the other until you try to stifle yourself on your popcorn. There are so many final stories in this movie, I guess at some point, it was made by joining a discarded television series. <br /> <br /> Quinn's Mexican drug-lord role is ridiculous and his "associates" picked just out of a 1970s Quinn-Martin cop show. Costner's character is wood and gives us no reason to believe he actually fell in love with Mendez's wife. We also have not convincingly led to believe that wife is painful and will jump the first warm body together. <br /> <br /> Absolutely a B movie at best and a great waste of time for everyone involved.
