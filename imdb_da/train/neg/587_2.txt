This film differs from the giant "miracle of the human body" documentary with bold, if it is bizarre, and chooses to induce disgust in the viewer. In a scene, the camera shuts in on a gigantic 50-foot zit as a teen squeezes pus and fluid out of it. In another, the camera is semisubmerged in a swamp of half-digested food and stomach acid as parts of a pasta salad drop from the esophagus and plop into the goo. In a final tour de force, the viewer takes a shaking trip through a forest of ... teenage armhole. Unfortunately, I do nothing about this. Watch this movie, if you should, but: take your throwing bag and do not have pasta salad in advance.
