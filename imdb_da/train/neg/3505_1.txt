Comedy Central has a habit of spending great programs at times-Chappelle's Show, The Daily Show, the Colbert Report, and then there are some people who love or hate-Stella, Dr. Katz. Then there are some shows that have their defenders, but are just awful - Mencia, and now, Sarah Silverman. <br /> <br /> This show based on Silverman is self-centered, which can be fun (Colbert Report), but can be terrible (Mind of Mencia). It should not shock anyone as I think the latter is the case. This show is a parody of a sitcom and a community, a program so absurd it loses in its absurdity, and it's simply not fun. A woman's jump has been done in comedy many times because it is not something that is common. We don't need 25 minutes of it. When a criminal is disarmed by a queue, it just loses its appeal - we saw it back in Jay and Silent Bob Strike, except that the women were warmer and the whole scene was more absurd and better. But the best comparison of this show is that Stella, except that Stella was more subtle, made the absurd comedy fun. It was better to act and I suppose a bit more of a fantastic realistic view. Perhaps some reviews are sometimes so negative (I'm very skeptical of the critical recognition, but do not doubt fan reaction) to this show is the amount of advertising on it, very unpleasant ads through many programs far outdo advertising on for other programs . Many wonder why Sarah Silverman has a career and others are still bitter when better shows have been canceled. This show should never have passed the unaired pilot phase. Back to Norm showed much more promise, but this show does it further. And as far as critics are correct, many things have been universally panned, have seen their status rise incredibly. Last time I checked in, Britney Spears also got good reviews. Take the comparison you want because someone will undoubtedly accuse me of being psychotic on IMDb because you don't like this show.
