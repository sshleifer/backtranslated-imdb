Bloodsucker Leads the Dance - what a ridiculous title it is so completely misleading. It is not surprising that the filmmakers are trying to mislead us, even though it is a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> The story basically involves a killing mystery in a castle on a remote island. <br /> <br /> Very little happens in this movie. And when something awakens the viewer from his stupidity, the inevitably unintentional comedy in the form of horrible dialogue is provided by a hopeless group of vocalists. These guys are so bad that they make the actors deliver votes to act as a group of remedial-level morons. It's really hard to decide how bad the play is when you've doubled this unpleasant. But the voice artists cannot be due to the script. It's a travesty. Accidental fun at best pathetic at worst. The story generally is at least uneven. The women's figures are extremely idiotic; the men are either scary or boring. <br /> <br /> The entire company tastes of pure public use. It does not deliver the remote control what it promises, and even when the murders (finally) begin to happen, they all appear out of the screen. All we get is a pair of half-hearted cut heads. <br /> <br /> A few people have said that this movie is a giallo. I cannot accept less with this opinion. Anyone who enjoys Italian thrillers should give this movie a wide berth, as there is nothing distant about it. It's basically a soft-core porn movie with a horror angle. But it's not very erotic either. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this to anyone.
