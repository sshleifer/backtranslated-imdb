Primal Species comes from B Movie legend Roger Corman, and as such everyone who sees this must realize that this is a Low Budget B Movie and it knows it. <br /> <br /> A bunch of terrorists high-jack a Lorry and kill an entire army do it, they think it holds uranium, but no ..... It contains two Dino's with a taste for Human Flesh. .. Then a Crack team as well called Delta Force can be called in. Ok, this is not Jurassic Park, and yes. The Dino's are never seen clearly because of course it is a guy in a costume that is not too different from Barney the Dinosaur - just a little less scary, but got on guys this had about 1% of the Jurassic Park budget and as such does what it can do. <br /> <br /> does it deserve to be at bottom 100? .... HELLO NOT !!! I think that almost half of the voters who give this a 1 - way way way too hard, it's much closer to a 4 ... it's actually much better than a lot of other movies that don't is at the bottom 100 and has a similar production value to a Sci-Fi channel production. (Again, Movies that get too hard time from critics here on IMDb). It appears is as expected in a B-movie, although none of the actors take it so seriously, nor the script <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a fun B Movie - Not for movie Snobs <br /> <br /> ** out of *****
