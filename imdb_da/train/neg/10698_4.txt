The Darkling was a very interesting and entertaining movie while F. Murray Abraham was in it. Spoilers: Approx. Halfway becomes F.Murray zapped because The Darkling is a kind of demon-like being who enjoys living vicariously. He takes pimples and losers and further distorts them while giving them everything they want in terms of success. He gives birth from their enjoyment of the seven mortal sins. But part of it is that he needs to get people who can be flawed, but not quite evil. Otherwise, he cannot "distort" their natural goodness. That said the little guy in his Barry White voice, which I found both charming and entertaining. Most fun. Can you imagine Barry White if he was a little dwarf, and he told Aiden the gill "Dee Plane, Dee Plane, Bos, Come here, Dee Plane!" Through the film, Dee Dwarf (actually a robotic cherub) speaks to Aiden Gillen in the Barry White voice and says things like "It's okay to be bad, you know you want it." "Now you've committed murder, you're really moving in the world" and other remarks that look like advertisements for "being evil" stores or something. It's really fun in a bad way. Anyway, Aiden Gillen is no F. Murray Abraham, and the movie tanks as soon as Murray gets the ax (or knifed?). F. Murray brings some happy evil to his role in this movie. He's a good actor. Aiden Gillen, on the other hand, has a permanently happy smile on his face, and he may resemble his remedial English comp. The class had never hit the mythological signs, and he couldn't imagine what the movie was about. ENDING is really scary and yet almost comical. If this movie was a parody, the end was perfect. If it wasn't a parody then it was scary; but a cheap use of a little girl to deliver a coarse run that the film itself could not deliver. The people who made this movie lost what it was that they wanted to do with it somewhere before the end. It ends up just as they just realized they had run out of money and had to film a quick ending.
