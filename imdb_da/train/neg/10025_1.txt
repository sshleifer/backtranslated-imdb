If this is a 2008 product from one of the largest production houses in the Indian Film Industry (Yash Raj), I fear it will be a very long time for us to reach the right standards. <br /> <br /> If you can go wrong at this length with such a large casting of Anil, Akshay, Saif and Kareena, then filmmaking still needs to be studied much harder by anyone associated with this movie. The film is missing in almost every department except movies and Akshay Kumar. He has some good dialogues to do, but that alone cannot make you enjoy a girl with great expectations. <br /> <br /> The first scene in a car crashing into a river from the mountain has very cheap graphics like that of a cartoon movie. It itself was a clear indicator of the director's vision. Every actor who is otherwise an asset to a movie is simply wasted. Anil Kapoor's gimmick for trying good English falls flat on time. And Saif will surely beat himself and think about why he signed this movie. In short, it's the biggest waste of resources after "JHOOM BARABAR JHOOM". I would say that even "Aaja Nachle" was a better enjoyable movie than this. <br /> <br /> You can't understand how and why this type of script was written and approved. The most unwanted was the flashback sequence of Akshay's love story. After the defective script, the weakest point in the movie is its music. Vishal Shekhar has provided some filler songs for each song. The songs start very well, and suddenly the songs fall dramatically. Only one song "Falak Tak Chal" is somehow good for everything in the party. An opportunity for the waste of Vishal Shekhar. <br /> <br /> As for the intelligence intelligence of the decision makers, you can simply try this: Akshay and Saif are heading in the hilly area of ​​a foreign location (probably Ladakh). In the next scene, they search for Kareena in Haridwar and then back in the hills with Kareena in their dicky. I'm still thinking about who wrote this. <br /> <br /> If you manage to last, the climax is too long with stupid and unnecessary stunts. You can see all the heroes go through the storm of bullets that do not hurt as though they are GOD. Do we still see a movie from 2008 with all these technical heights achieved? Look no further word on this pathetic and downgrade movie, but a sincere request to senior actors from their fan. Dear Anil Kapoor & Akshay Kumar, if possible, ask for an example of your movies after their first copy is out. As artists of such size, you have certain obligations to your fans and viewers. People are still clapping for you while you enter the screen in your first scenes respectively. I think this kind of movie should not see daylight as it inhibits the reputation of everyone associated with the film, the actors and the production house both.
