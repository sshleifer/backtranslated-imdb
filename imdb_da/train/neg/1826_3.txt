I watched this movie last night and even after a few beers was the only giggle, this movie came out of me when I realized I was actually looking at it. in a word it is unfunny. Unfunny. I totally believe at trivia tidbit about Jack Black, apologizing for making this waste. I can't believe Barry Levinson didn't just throw this script when he read the first page. Besides, I can't believe I saw more than ten minutes of it. <br /> <br /> I gave it 3 out of 10 * because I love watching Christopher Walken make horrible movies for paycheck. Also, the horse "corky", by simply being a sign in this movie, is actually quite ridiculous.
