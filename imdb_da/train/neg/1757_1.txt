Don't make me wrong, Dan Jansen was a great speed skater. If there was a guy who deserved his gold medal at the Olympics, it was Dan. <br /> <br /> But how can Bill Corcoran have made such a bad movie about the incredible Dan Jansen story because the real Dan Jansen story is really incredible! Especially when you look at this movie through the eyes of a sportsman, all wrong, Matt Mattes and the other actor's skate skater, their technique, the speed of the oval dimensions of the skate is completely wrong! <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Bill Corcoran, Dan Jansen deserves better, much better! <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10
