How have I never seen or even heard about this junk movie before? It's right up in my alley with bloody teenkill, ridiculous plot and an irresistible 80's cheese atmosphere hanging around it. For some reason, no one really is interested in, staff and students of an elite Catholic university are slaughtered by an unknown psychopath. Recently recruited teacher Julie Parker gets involved when all the people she is in contact with either die or behave strangely. This movie is hilariously bad! There is absolutely no logic or coherence, and any sign is just as meaningless to the others. For example, a girl was killed and her body dumped in a container. Then, and for no reason, the story suddenly goes forward for three weeks, but the murdered girl is never mentioned or even missed. Not even by his girlfriend! The action is pitiful and there is not even a little nudity to enjoy. The revelation of the killer is quite fun because the decision makers really felt convinced that it was an original twist ... It's not boys! "Splatter University" is easily one of the worst horror turkeys ever.
