Julia Stiles is a talented young actress who, with the guidance of a reputable agent, has many opportunities. Obviously, the person who led her into this travesty is not someone who cares about her career. I sat in the theater surrounded by teenagers who left in droves to find another movie to sneak in to wonder who thought this movie would appeal to anyone. It was poorly written, the casting director could only have put 1 or 2 minutes effort into the characters and the director obviously didn't care.
