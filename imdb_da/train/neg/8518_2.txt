I'm surprised at how many comments on this show are about how "right" it is. Maybe I'm not part of the same universe because if Veronica Mars is something, it's over the top in a big way. The play chews nature with enthusiasm and the plots have holes you can drive a truck through. That's not what I call right. It is so serious in its desire to be "relevant" that it only shows how cut off from reality Rob Thomas and his staff. <br /> <br /> In general, I found it at best a snooze party and at worst, more than a little annoying. Kristen Bell looks as though she could be a good actress, but it's hard to tell the overall style of the show.
