I love B movies .. but get on .... this was not even worth a class ... The end was stupid ... b / c There was no real end !!! .. not to mention that it comes to life on its own ... I mean no light storm or crazy demonic forces ?? Slow as hell, and then they just start killing the characters one by one as a 15 min time period ... and I don't even start the part of the case that kills one guy without his head .... and then you not even seeing what Jigsaw does with his so-called "new puzzle" .... Unless you have nothing better to do ... Id watch paint dry before I recommend this godly movie to anyone else ... oh and for To make it even better the other movie totem you can see the guy throwing one creature into the basement scene from the window. It was fun as hell and probably the only good part of watching the waste of movies
