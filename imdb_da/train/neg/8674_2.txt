The first few minutes of "The Bodyguard" have a campy charm: It opens with crawling of text from the Bible (the part that Samuel Jackson recites for his soon to be victims of "Pulp Fiction") continues with two karate school Teachers in New York who argues for the eternal question of mankind (who is better? Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee?) and then Chiba looks and plays himself; he immediately stops a plane hijacking and breaks a bottle in half with his bare hand. Unfortunately, any entertainment value, intentional or unintentional, is soon shattered by the inconsistent history, the lack of action for long periods and the poor quality of any current action. To keep it simple, that's why "The Bodyguard" is an unbearable movie to watch: <br /> <br /> 1) You don't know what's going on. <br /> <br /> 2) There are hardly any games. <br /> <br /> 3) The battles that are there are short and terribly busy. <br /> <br /> Sonny Chiba is cool. Judy Lee is beautiful, her face is brilliant. It's only for them I give "The Bodyguard" a 2nd star out of 10. This movie makes 87 minutes feel like 5 hours.
