OK .. this movie could have been sooo good! All generations have been exposed to Thunderbirds and have come to love it, and this movie had some of the features you would look for in a good thunderbird movie. The vessel itself and Tracey Island were realistically transferred to the big screen while still conforming to the designs we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was simply amazing as Lady P and Bill Paxton, while not exactly what I imagined Jeff Tracey was, was solid enough ... but then adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe 8 year olds could fly 200 tons of machines. <br /> <br /> It's not so much that the movie was centered on the kids, which made me feel that Jonathon Frakes hit me with a wet fish and laughed for my hard earned money spent on the movie was the fact that Alan Tracey was so pitiful in the movie and that he seemed to be able to fly the machines as well as his brothers ... who was at least 19/20. Seriously, there are some beautiful, simple machines to use, if so. The movie did not seem to know if it would be serious or dangerous. It tried to pay tribute while satirizing and it usually fell flat on the face. 3/10 (2 for the machines, 1 for Lady P)
