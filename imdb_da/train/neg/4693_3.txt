That's the kind of movie that frustrates me the most. Great cast, great instructor, great story potential, so they ruin everything with a script that doesn't go down ... and say nothing while you go there! There are no depths at all at all. No depth of character, no depth of plot, no depth of surprise, excitement or common sense. We know what happens, we are told how they intend to solve the problem, they solve the problem, throw a surprise with us near the end that does not generate any tension, then they stop the film abruptly. Forgotten opportunity. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, Glenn Ford leads a cast of British (and French) actors, all of whom are amazing, doing an incredibly impressive job with the one-dimensional writing they were given. One of the absolute favorites is Herbert Walton as "Old Charlie", which gives some amazing pieces of humor and warmth to a dark and serious movie. I also thought the movie had a good look at it ... all the shadows and fog ... much movie noir in feeling. Although the actors do the best they can and the management is fun, it's still just not enough for me to recommend spending time watching the movie. There are much better Glenn Ford movies out there: The Big Heat, Gilda, Affair in Trinidad etc.
