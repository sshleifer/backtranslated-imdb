Why did I waste my money on Sundance's last day? I want a refund ... Can I get my $ 16 back? While I watched this movie, I waited for something to happen, nothing happened. The only way I knew about what it was all about was to read the plot, which wasn't really like the movie. why zoom the instructor in with their handy cam and then zoom out? It wasn't very artistic. Why did the director show Lulu, who sent her nails for fifteen minutes? Why did they succeed when the actors tried to talk, they sounded like they were reading? Or was that the point? I felt that Phantom Love had no history at all, and to be honest I felt like my friends holiday videos had a much higher entertainment value than this movie.
