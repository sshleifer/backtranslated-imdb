... And I never thought a movie deserved to be awarded a 1! But this is honestly the worst movie I've ever seen. My wife picked it up because of the cast, but the story ever since the DVD box seemed pretty predictable. It's not a mystery or a captivating movie. It does not include any sensuality if that is what the distance title might suggest to any of you. This is just an overall no-no. Don't waste your time or money unless you want to see a bunch of young people in such an adult kind of Gothic setting where a killer goes after them. Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing worth seeing. Max Makowski does the worst of Nick Stahl.
