This film shows a series of sketches that partially overlap. I realized it was passing late in the movie, only it annoyed me only. <br /> <br /> Many of the episodes in this movie come together without any recognizable punchlines and simply try to change that fact through absurdity and obscenity. The attempt to become comedy without fun pieces fails. <br /> <br /> My staff and perhaps subjective result after seeing this movie (my god, it hurts my head every time I call it "movie"): A bold attempt to make nothing big . But it failed. At least, the instructor did something out of nowhere. But that's not good. <br /> <br /> Many movies did not seem as fun as they were planned, but one tops them all. It is the real life manifestation of the worst case of film making. No. To correct myself, it's even worse than that. A movie with gags so bad that they are not fun at all. Seeing the lead, writer, and director (all three same guy by the way) is by no means fun by drowning in the sea of ​​bad movies. The movie is too bad for it.
