I would like to think of myself as a pretty open minded guy and it takes a lot (!) For me not to like a movie, but this one is without a doubt one of the cutest, most crappiest movies I've ever seen! <Br /> <br /> I have no idea what is wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here (imdb is usually pretty reliable in terms of ratings) ... all I can imagine is that people must have voted in one or more conditions: <br /> <br /> 1. Although they are imprisoned / stoned out of their minds 2. They have received hard money for the votes 3. Under gunpoint <br /> < I can't believe I wasted a good 1 hour 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie.
