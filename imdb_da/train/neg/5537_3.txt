What? You didn't realize that Scooby-Doo fought with zombies? Well, you can't even pay attention to this little movie that was directed by Victor Halperin, who also directed White Zombie four years earlier. It would probably make it the second zombie film made. <br /> <br /> No, look for Dorothy Stone to reveal her breasts as you would expect in most zombie movies and not even look for any brain. It's 1936, you know. <br /> <br /> So what you want to see is typical of the period - lots of talking. You get to see Dean Jagger (Twelve O 'Clock High) and Bela Lugo's eyes, but it's about it. Zombies in Cambodia, yes!
