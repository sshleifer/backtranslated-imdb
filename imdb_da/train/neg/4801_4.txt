I really wanted to like this movie. It has a nice prison setting, conspiracy theories, bloodthirsty zombies, an awesome 80's touch, and it's a direct bet by actor John Saxon who also plays a bad (you guessed it) a bad guy. It reminds me of some (beloved) Italian horror flicks. But the direction is very wood and there is no nightmare / scary moment in there. It just goes over and over again, and then it must (logically) end. More excitement and more bold visuals and its fate as a cult classic would have been sealed.
