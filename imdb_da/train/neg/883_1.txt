The problems with this movie are many, but I will try to mention the most brilliant and annoying. First and foremost, while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about Manhattan life, the reality was that, as usual in movies and television, it was about something bizarre, usually of a sexual nature. The story lines were thin or non-existent, and almost all scenes, camera shots, dialogue line and expressed feelings were absolutely and completely false. It finally reached a point after an hour with so many emotions that I went out (something not unusual for me in recent years.) I would have guessed that fiIlm was led by some of the authentic drop outs of some 3rd movement film studies, but I think the director Mira Nair (at some point pre-Amelia, talented) participated in this disgusting travesty, so perhaps the direct-oriented talent in America has dropped a lot into the cesspool.
