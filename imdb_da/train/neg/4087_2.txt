I usually talk a little about the plot in the first part of my review, but in this movie there really isn't much to talk about. Just a mish-mash of other FAR better swords & Turkish epics. Lack of cohesion runs immensely, like banality. Even the biggest villaness who refuses to wear clothes in any other way, is a drench rather boring, as she basically has a chest of a young boy. It's fun in the infinite at best and seriously retarded at worst. Lucio Fulci scraps the bottom of the barrel and it shows. <br /> <br /> My character: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Poster & Still galleries; Lucio Fulci Bio; and American and international theater curtains <br /> Eye Candy: Sabrina Siani is topless all the time (some may consider it appealing, I didn't); various extras are also topless
