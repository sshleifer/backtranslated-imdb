The film crew did not have good access to the occupied territories, so movie shooting of the Israeli side dominated. I was hit by the almost completely opposite views of the mothers. The Israeli mother lost a child who had the opportunity for a life of great happiness. The Palestinian mother lost a child who only had the opportunity of a life of regret and despair. With such completely different views, every meeting had no real chance for any meeting of the mind. The word "peace" did not have the same meaning for each of them. Peace to the Palestinians was freedom. Peace to the Israelis was security. With such an abyss, is this kind of movie really worth it? I was finished with the feeling that I had seen a meaningless propaganda - both sides were convincing.
