A light shadow of a great musical, this film suffers from the fact that director, Richard Attenborough, completely misses the musical point, unnecessarily "opens" it and muddy the piece in the play. The show is about a group of dancers auditioning for a job in a B'way musical and exploring their drive and desire to work in this demanding and not always rewarding work style. Attenborough gives us an innovative cast of hopefuls, assuming they are trying to get their "big break" in show business, rather than presenting the gritty mix of characters created on stage as a group of live "gypsies" live shows for to show, along with a couple of beginners. The movie has an advantage over the game and it is the opening scene that shows the size of the original audition and the true scale of shrinkage down to 16/17 on the line (depending on how you count Cassie, who is stupidly held out of the line in the movie). Anyone who can capture a local opera production of the drama will have a much richer experience than watching this ill-conceived movie.
