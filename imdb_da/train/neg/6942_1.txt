This thing is really awfull. There are no weights with weight, they are all floating around in the BGs. Motion Capture is a fine toy, but this movie demostrates that you really need people who know animation to make an animated movie. The machine cannot do anything good by itself. If you see it as a bizarre movie, you have fun finding errors in continuity ... IN A 3D MOVIE !!! It's fun to see the princess dress move like a thing with different phisics. You need animators and 3D animators, not data inputs that know 3D programs. Note the crosses as the elbows how they lost volume and become deformed. The person who made the charachter design (a very good one) surely sued when he / she saw them moving, 'you can't say they come alive.
