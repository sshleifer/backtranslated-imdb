I am very surprised at the positive comments because there were four of us who saw this at a screening and we all went together. We personally felt that it was painfully slow to see and couldn't sit through the whole movie. And we really tried to stick to it. In particular, those in the group who really wanted to suffer it because of their personal experience of sexual orientation were alienation in the depicted school years not like or identified with it at all. :( <br /> Having said that, it is good to see that this movie really resonates with many people here on the blackboards and with proofreaders.
