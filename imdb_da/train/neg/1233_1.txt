Oh God. The idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me. Beyond the point, it seems to be written by a 5 year old. The plot, the actor and even the props and the movie of this movie were all beyond disgrace. I'm not usually critical of any movie because every person has his / her style. But this movie was probably the worst movie I've seen in 2008. I can honestly believe this movie is unknown and I think it should stay that way for movies like these make the thriller genre a joke. /> <br /> I advise anyone who is a fan of thriller movies or even simply movies to stay far away from this one.
