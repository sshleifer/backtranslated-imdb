This movie seems to be a rip off of many movies that have dealt with the same subject in the past. Let the future viewer be aware that "Art Heist" does not add anything to the genre. Director Bryan Goeres has no idea what to do with the movie. <br /> <br /> William Baldwin resumes filming and, frankly, you are wondering if he has a good agent, or is it that directors and producers love his unusual goofy look, complimented by the strange hairdresser he sports in most of his films. The only good movie he has performed in is "The Squid and the Whale", where he speaks only two or three lines. Ellen Pompeo, his leading lady, does not go much better; there is no chemistry between Ms. Pompeo and Mr. Baldwin. <br /> <br /> A movie seen at the viewer's own risk.
