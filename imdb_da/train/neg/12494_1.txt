There was nothing about this movie that I liked. It was, of course, low budget with poor lighting and camera work (almost like Blair Witch Project, it was just that which should not be so). There wasn't much to the plot and the movie was just drugs again and again. I was actually quickly forwarded through the last 1/3 of the movies, but it didn't help much. It looked like it might be good from the box, but I have to say again: Nothing about this movie looked good. No good actors, the special effects were so fake, the camera work was terrible, and the dialogue was painfully horrible. On my own scale, I give this movie a 0 out of 10. Yikes!
