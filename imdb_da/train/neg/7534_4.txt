A mummy tells vignettes about men, women and the flesh between them. Huh? In the beginning, the mummy randomly asks the viewer, "Imagine having sex with this girl. Imagine having sex with this boy" about. 37 times while blinking pictures of half naked against young. Later pills mods boys against girls with ... vegetables? If you ignore (or fast forward) through the mummies hike, the shorts are not bad in their own right. I found a couple of them pretty funny. My personal favorite is one in which the sexually confused man tries to convince a girl to have sex with him while his pet lizard sits on the bed. This is a good, bizarre movie.
