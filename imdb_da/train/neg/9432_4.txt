"Unhinged" is a strange little movie, a forgotten slasher from the golden age of the genres. It's hard to really write a satisfactory review of this movie simply because the movie is so unique. It's plot is pretty exaggerated - three young women on their way to a rock concert come in a car accident and end up stranding at the manor house of an eccentric old woman and her spinster daughter. Very quickly, the ladies realize that something is not quite right when they hear strange breathing and sounds from the ceiling. On top of that, the mother and daughter seem to have a very, very strange relationship, as they are intensely contending for their housekeeping for dinner. The old mother even goes as far as calling her daughter a whore and nap and accusing her of sneaking guys at night to sleep with them. Halfway through the movie, when a girl finally decides that she better walks to find help, the killing begins. <br /> <br /> As far as the play goes, this movie is at the bottom of the barrel. None of the three stranded girls can shop, especially the "lead" girl. It's almost incredible to hear them delivering their lines in the same wood tone throughout the movie. The mother and daughter are better, but not much. The movie is also pretty boring in parts and really, really draws. The murders are cruel, but nothing we haven't seen before. However, as mentioned here, the film really gets pointer with the brilliantly disturbing and gory ending. It comes entirely from the left field and has the same shock value as the end of the classic "Sleepaway Camp camp." Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is a drill and suffers from horrible acting and boring, boring pacing. The isolated, eerie-looking manor and the dark, preventive illumination give the film a grainy realism, but it quickly gets crushed when one of the characters tries to act. It can be worth it if you can keep it to the end, but I say you are better, just fast 10 minutes. 4 out of 10
