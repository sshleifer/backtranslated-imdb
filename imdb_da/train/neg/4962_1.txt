99.999% pure crap. And the other .001% was a brief moment when I thought the blonde chick was going to disturb. Nope. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was historically poor. The action sucked, and there was no sex (the front blonde chick mentioned is modestly dressed, unfortunately the whole movie). The CGI had the dubious honor of being the worst movie I've ever seen, and the anachronisms were numerous and clear. Action was mediocre even from Ben Cross and Marina Sirtis, the only 'names' in this movie. And Marina Sirtis really looked really bad. <br /> <br /> I've seen high schools play more capable produced. This is the kind of movie that MST3K thrived on. Heads should roll at Sci-Fi to allow this steaming pile in the air.
