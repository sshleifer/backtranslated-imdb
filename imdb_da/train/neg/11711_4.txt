An okay movie, with a fine leading lady, but a horrible leading man. Stephan Jenkins, who plays the man, is a really bad actor. Joyce Hyser, on the other hand, is the film's saving grace. She's the best actress. <br /> <br /> NOTE * The first comment of the guy who raised praise over the movie (and according to his IMDB.com account has written only a review - and guess which movie?) is naturally a plant. While the film is nicely shot, it is by no means subtle or large or whatever other hypo-descriptions used by the reviewer. "Art of Revenge" is a fair movie, but it is a great tease. It gives up all kinds of sexual situations, but never goes through with it. Like watching a Skin Flick on Cinemax, but with all the "cheeky bits" edited. <br /> <br /> The movie as a whole is a bit unfocused and the end and much of the third action is really a big mess. There is, of course, a twist, since all movies today find it necessary to have a twist end. <br /> <br /> A 4 out of 10. <br /> <br />
