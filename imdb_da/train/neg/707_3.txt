"The Feast of All Saints"? Where...? When ...? <br /> <br /> Was the fortress of Allhelgers history and theme edited? <br /> <br /> What a waste of a wonderful title! There is never anything in history that has the farthest connection to "All Saints' Feast". There is also nothing in the story of "All Souls Day" that the term refers to. Why bother using this title if you are never going to include any story or theme on "All Souls Day" or "All Saints Feast"? <br /> <br /> Scandalous Bad Script & Amateur Writing <br /> <br /> How did they attract such great talent to this clunker? The scripture is so amateur - characters who have known each other throughout their lives, go into big long talks about their life story for the sake of the audience. Not at all how people talk to each other. <br /> <br /> What was the director thinking? <br /> <br /> The management is just as bad! The forced and overly convincing style feels amateurish. In a scene, a sign shouts "Take your hands off me" and NO ONE touches him! However, the worst-case scene is the incredibly over-the-top battle scene at the start of the movie. <br /> <br /> Excessive Gore in a very fake silly battle scene <br /> <br /> There are so many dead people in the most fake battle scene. It looks like a Saturday Night Live crap !! You can see extras waiting for their signals to cross the camera. Everyone plays their death scene as 4th grade boys - exaggerating every little rubbing and dragging. The blood on camp victims is so exaggerated and carelessly used. It looks like someone used a ketchup dispenser and just sprayed straight red lines on the costumes. This whole battle scene comes out as a spoof of a really cheesy war movie. You almost expect someone like Will Ferrell and Mike Myers to ride a horse and deliver the battle line. <br /> <br /> Who really would ever have that way? <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous part of writing, steering, and casting is actually the focus of the scene: <br /> <br /> A little girl stands under her hanging father's death - who is terribly mutilated and literally drops blood forms its yawning wounds. Even an idiot would know he is dead! Still, she - very monotonously - repeats again and again "Daddy, Daddy ..." while looking at someone on the screen. She delivered it with almost as much credibility and passion as one might expect from a non-actress who had repeated the line to the cameras all day. Although the poor kid had some acting skills, the scene is incredible. The little girl wouldn't even be in the middle of the battlefield after hours of carnage - surrounded by hundreds of dead bodies while standing still! Natural instincts would make the child scream and frighten, run away from the bloody carnage! <br /> <br /> Are we supposed to be scared or laughed ...? A particularly greasy detail that gives the scene a SNL satire tone is the danger hanging with a large hook through the mouth and cheek. He looks like a fish on a hook! The unintentional fun details make the whole scene come across as fake and stupid. <br /> <br /> In Fantasy La-La-Land, Mothers and Daughters are the same age! <br /> <br /> Another fun detail is that you see a central character - the little girl's mother - at the end of the stage and in the next scene that occurs 20+ years later, she looks exactly the same ! She is still young and beautiful, and now at the same age as her daughter! <br /> <br /> I almost hit the movie right there because the direction and writing were obviously horrible - but I tried to keep it out because I wanted to see the Louisiana settings and I like all the actors. I don't know what these fine actors were thinking when they accepted these roles! <br /> <br /> Who was the targeted audience? The exaggerated amount of blood and badly traded violence in the opening scene is oddly out of place with the soap opera telling tone that follows. It is also a strange way to start a movie that for the rest of the time seems to be targeted to Romanesque novel reading women. Weird inconsistency in tone!
