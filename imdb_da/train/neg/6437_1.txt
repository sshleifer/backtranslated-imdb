Spoilers. <br /> <br /> First, nothing happened in this movie, except that a woman blew inexplicably. Second, it was not scary. Third, it had the worst soundtrack of any movie ever. Let me elaborate. The sound was edited by either Beavis or Butthead ?? I'm not sure, let's just go with Beavis. The movie gradually becomes quieter and the people mumble and mumble and force you to turn up the volume (I saw this at home). Then Beavis explodes some very loud sounds with presumably scary / shocking images, forcing you to quickly lower the volume again. This happens many times until, mercifully, the film ends. I can see the picture Beavis laughing vulgarly behind the two-way mirror while watching the test group, which runs every day removed for the remote control. If you have children and prefer to watch scary movies after falling asleep, this is a big mistake. But then it is still a big mistake. Here's a thought ?? If you're going to make a horror movie, at least add a gratuitous punch, a 19-year-old blonde girl screaming at the top of her lungs just before she can take off her sweater, the shade of a person's wall being eaten alive just outside the reach of the camera, a cat is thrown into the camera to frighten the audience, some nozzles with a scary laugh or a monster resembling a scene hand covered with aluminum foil (a la tv is lost in the room). These people didn't even try to scare me. They just wanted to hurt my ears.
