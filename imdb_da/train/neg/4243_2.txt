The funniest scene in this movie is probably when our savior gets their medals and plaques and whatnot. So, the basic idea is that the police surpass those gangsters by one million to one, but they are powerless because the bad guys are a little bigger. I suppose police ammunition is just a little bounces off. They decided to shoot this film in documentary style with fake interviews and everything and seriously, what's wrong with these guys? They speak as if they were armed with rolled papers. Okay, I admit it's probably still dangerous to be in the fire, even though the situation is so much to your advantage, but not in need. And why the hell did it take 44 minutes to solve everything anyway? I will say it is a very long time when you have them surrounded and you are allowed to shoot. They are like ten feet away, they hit absolutely nothing. Then they go and buy larger weapons themselves to increase their heroism. And so yes, you have it, one of the police actually hits someone. Bullet was probably redirected by a lamp insert or something. I had a good laugh I guess.
