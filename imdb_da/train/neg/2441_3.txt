I thought "Intensive Care" was pretty bad and very unintentional fun. But at least not as bad as I thought it might be. Sometimes it's a little exciting, but never a good shocker. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD <br /> <br /> The fun lies in ridiculous moments. But the full-time classic is this: Peter (Koen Wauters) is stabbed and beaten by the killer. He lies groaned in the corner of the hallway. Amy (Nada van Nie) kneels next to him and asks "Poor Peter, should I get you a tape aid?". <br /> <br /> This film was shot in Dutch and English. To save costs, all license plates are USA, and the background of the news study is a Manhattan skyline. Very fun if you are Dutch and see the original version in Dutch.
