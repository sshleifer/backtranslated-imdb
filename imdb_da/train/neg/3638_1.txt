The film portrays France's unresolved problems with its colonial heritage in Western (Francophonic) Africa through the terrible and complex psychoanalytic prism of a young woman, France (symbolically symbolizing its nation). It is an often engaging and challenging portrait of a young woman's desire to express a traumatic moment in her past, especially, and a country's desire to reach out to the "other" who is once "owned" and cast. . This is reflected in the way it centers around the concept of traveling (or transiting) from the present to the past; remembered realities for undeniable contemporary political and economic events. The people all play a symbolic, albeit limited and non-convincing role. France meant to be a visual as well as a totemic representation of the modern French society, leaving one indifferent to her situation, as she still seems to be imbued with the same naivety she has had as a child - in fact, as a child she sees more possessing her reality. The rest of the rag tag's ensemble is just forgettable. The black Africans are at least offencive impressionist portraits of formerly colonized people now colonized by the director's poor handling of her material. They are no more than a dark and moribund background with which the shy-like France is wondering about finding a world she never knew and hoping for someone who can never be found in Cameroon.
