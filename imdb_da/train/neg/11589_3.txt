Bottom-of-the-Freddy barrel. This is the worst movie in the series and beats "Freddy's Revenge" for that title. A cheap look (with mediocre special effects), incoherent mess, with Freddy transformed into a punch. He has one or two cool lines, but it does not save this illogical and sloppy successor.
