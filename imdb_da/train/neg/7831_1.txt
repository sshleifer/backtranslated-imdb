With his companion, MASTERS OF HORROR, NIGHTMARES AND DREAMSCAPES can only be seen as the absolute nadir of the genre that began so pleasantly with THE TWILIGHT ZONE and THE OUTER LIMITS. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of the problem is that it doesn't matter to be of interest to a relatively adult audience, but instead aims at TEN-OLDS, which can only count body bags and barely probably that. And so gravity is king, and King is gross. <br /> <br /> Stephen King is simply illiterate? In general, he has the ability to tell about Bart Simpson. Since he cannot read his only inspiration, the films are. True, the cinema is not that bad to start, as it generally has escaped the "Realism" attack. But these movies are only rumored, not that, and if you want to write, you need to dig deeper. <br /> <br /> Of course, only PICKMAN had monsters as close acquaintances. But even that should be clear to any bachelor that vampires are not Dracula and Lugosi. <br /> <br /> At least AUTOPSY ROOM FOUR is a clear indication of what's wrong. One can almost imagine this pathetic hidden sitting as his desk tries to come up with some SCARY. <br /> <br /> Remember, try to describe exactly the horror of the system as he is an integral part of, making it stupidly stupid, but trying to come up with a scary story for his little nephew. Suppose you were paralyzed, and people thought you were dead and began to cut open as they do about these autopsy things! Wouldn't it be rough? And that, boys and girls, is the story. <br /> <br /> What about characterization? Oh yes, he is one of those suits that never really appreciated the life you know, and now it's too late, right? And he shouts ?? Well, they can't actually hear him, you know? He says he must sue the hospital, but he is not as big a shot as you see, lying there (or lying there, I can never remember) and everyone. And he thinks: Oh no, please don't cut me, and it's terrible to lie (or lie down) like that? Now wouldn't it be a good story? You know I read somewhere that a snake bite can do what I think it was the great medical authority Agatha Christie. What was the name of the snake again, oh yes, a BOOMSLANG ?? Have a call for it, don't. <br /> <br /> Let's make it a PERUVIAN TREE! Well, Steve, it's good ?? except that BOOMSLANG is African, you moron! But how can you really tell that the target group is children and not just mental deficiencies? It's easy: There is no sex. <br /> <br /> Now there, but it's the kind that glitters through a crack in the door of our parent's bedroom. Modern filmmakers are really big on the erotic aspects of the genre, the monster, the female victim, the chase. <br /> <br /> But unlike UNIVERSAL and LEWTON, they have no idea what is going on. All that's really left is giggling outside the SM club and the fascist credo that people with sexual preferences are inherently evil. <br /> <br /> Despite some discrepancy in size, King Kong knew exactly what to do with Fay Wray. Freddy Krueger can only kill her. <br /> <br /> And since there is no real titillation in it, must he torture her first? Not in any way that can thrill her, you understand, as it would disturb our Puritan feelings. And then horror and romance simply become unpleasant and grooming by psychopaths. <br /> <br /> Our hero you see is a rubber fetishist and can only get one boner if someone touches him you know down there with you well ?? rubber gloves (giggle). And that's what they use in autopsies, and that's how they discover he actually knows. <br /> <br /> It is, of course, the author at the height of his inspirational powers. Too bad they cut it out as it could have disturbed the five-year-old show!
