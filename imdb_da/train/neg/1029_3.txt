My father is a fan of Columbo and I hadn't always liked the show. I always declare my contempt for the show and tell him how bad it is. But he continues to see it anyway. It's his right as an American I guess. But my senses were set for the series when I found out that Spielberg had directed the leading episode. It was so grateful that my dad had bought this show that I really can't stand. I went through his DVD collection and appeared in this when I came home for a college visit. My opinion about the series as a whole was not swayed, but I got respect for Spielberg and knew he started as most low-level directors. And it makes little dribble until the big fish get together (get the pun, HA, HA. As Spielberg did. It's like Jesus before he became a man. Or at least that's what I think it would feels like a fan of Columbo than you probably like this, even though it contains a bit of Peter Falk, I attribute this to the fact that this is the start of the series and no one knew where to go with it yet. on the sins of the crime instead of Columbo's investigation, which many later episodes would do.
