Any movie where Brooke Shield's out-acts a Fonda is going to be both an anomaly and a horror. Shield is actually only bad because she is youthful, inexperienced and obviously not really controlled by her co-star. Peter Fonda is bad because, good because he is bad. I liked him in Ole's gold, years later, but master of it, he's horrible here. Not that anyone else is good. There is not a single performance (outside Henry Fonda's lovely cameo), which is even acceptable. I have never seen a movie with these many bad performances. In the case of Luke Askew, the top villain, it is clear that this is due to poor dialogue and direction as he has done good work in the past. But his partner, played by Ted Markland, is an embarrassing ham. The scripture is just bloody awful, and the actors cannot be pampered by the terrible things they have to say. But they say so badly! The editing and direction is worse than the pedestrian. Shots are kept for too long without dramatic reason, or cut off before the effect of the stage can be realized. This picture was far worse than I had imagined and would have been completely forgotten (and probably never even made) without the participation of a few famous names. A bright spot: The cinema in the Grand Canyon is exquisite and captures the beauty of this area in a way, even great Imax productions haven't quite done so well. And finally: whether it's a bad version of Paper Moon, with a gracious couple-daughter-types, or it's a bad version of Pretty Baby, with a significantly more icky romantic relationship between a fortnight and a 13-year-old. It suggests more of the latter than the former, and it is therefore rather disturbing.
