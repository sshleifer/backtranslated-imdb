<br /> <br /> I'm not sure who decides which category a movie fits in, but this movie is NOT a horror movie. As far as history is concerned, it was quite interesting, but rather slow. I was especially disappointed at the end though. <br /> <br /> ** spoiler ** <br /> <br /> Tell me why on Earth she runs over to her uncle's (?) home without at least calling Detective or Police first? She knows exactly what happens at that time, plus she has a videotape as evidence. Instead, she runs over there and starts walking on nuts and saying "I know everything, I have proof! You didn't have any proof, did you?" Then she's surprised when her uncle gets up and starts to go over to her as if he wants to hurt her. Now DUH! Of course he will hurt you idiot, you just told him you know everything and have evidence to reveal everything. What a stupid end.
