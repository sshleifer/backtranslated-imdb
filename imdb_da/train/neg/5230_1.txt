Although Robert "Knox" Benfer has his fans, I'm not one of them. His movie is asinine and amateurish, and and just not as fun unless you are a 14 year old with an underdeveloped sense of humor. <br /> <br /> He's certainly not famous as his immature fans want you to believe by harassing people at Wikipedia or filling in the ratings that vote here on IMDb. He has certainly not been profiled by any major media stores that tell volumes about his and his creator's fame. <br /> <br /> Benfer has some small skills with limited animation, but he has to get away from his young sycophants and learn to write some really fun material before being taken seriously as a real entertainer. But right now he's just a kid with a camera and it shows.
