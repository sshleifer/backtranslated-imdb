"Transylvania 6-5000" is an insignificant but occasionally fun and charming mid-80's screaming parade with some very well-known names in the cast and a handful of real opportunities to cluster in the script. Two bozo journalists of a gossip tabloid newspaper are very much sent to their will for Transylvania to make a story about the alleged return of mad scientist Frankenstein. There are some cute little gimmicks and details to discover left and right in the movie, like a small guillotine for hard-boiled eggs and laboratory tubes used to put in cream and sugar at the breakfast table. However, the sound of the movie is not as successful as it could and should have been with jokes and parody situations that are too slow. Roger Corman's production "Transylvania Twist", which came out four years after this, is much more fun and much more recommended. The film is especially parodying the classic universal milestones of the early 30's so you'd better make sure you've seen them if you want to understand all the little gags and references. There is a beautiful original twist that suggests that the Frankenstein character only behaves like a crazy evil scientist when he enters his lab. It is also revealed that he is actually more of a father Damien kind of messiah who is only concerned about conditional exile monsters. Michael Richards, the freaky guy who plays Kramer in Seinfeld, stars as a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inappropriate moments. I'm sure John Turturro's character in "Mr. Deeds" was inspired by Richard's role here.
