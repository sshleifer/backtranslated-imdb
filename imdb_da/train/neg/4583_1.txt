To see intelligent, philosophical discussion on human potential and potential, see "Waking Life" which is brilliant. "What # $ *! We Know" is all over the focus, badly directed, poorly written, badly acted, completely devoid of any artistic direction and quite annoying. It was not thought-provoking or entertaining at least. The inclusion of this striking freak "Ramtha" in this movie is reason enough to avoid it. Isn't it strange how filmmakers choose to overlook that this woman worships something like 2000 years old Atlantic God or something? What a flake the old chick is and what a total waste of my time and money this movie was. The people responsible for this movie should not be allowed to make another movie ever again.
