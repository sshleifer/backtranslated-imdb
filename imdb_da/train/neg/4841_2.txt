REALLY??? <br /> <br /> I'm really amazed to see the glowing reviews here! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a great pathetic, grainy, clich√©. I would have laughed a lot and much, but was on a date with a former military guy. I couldn't hide my second answer, BOREDOM. Yes, I think my date, a flat line "good old boy", liked it. It's not a compliment. I know an actor will work .... Fine for the others. But Ralph, get on. <br /> <br /> It was a painful tease from Ralph. I only vote for a 2 because Ralph looked so STUNNING. But I must say, Ralph, how could you? And why?? <br /> <br /> I'm going to see End of the Affair to heal and restore now .... C1
