If someone wants to make a really bad movie, "Wizards of the lost kingdom" really sets a scale by which to measure the depth of evil. Start with the pseudo-chewbacca that follows around the protagonist ... Some poor schmuck in a purplish white "furry" costume that looks like it was sewn together from discarded carpets. Work slowly, painfully through more non-special effects, which carefully reject the viewer from suspension of disbelief. Add a garden gnome (just for the heel of it). <br /> <br /> On second thought, skip this movie completely and find something else to do for an hour and a half.
