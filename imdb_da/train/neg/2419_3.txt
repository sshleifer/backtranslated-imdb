I simply give this a three because it met what my friends and I hoped it would do: entertain. <br /> <br /> I wasn't stupid enough to hire this mindset, it would be a zombie movie up there with similar like Romero or Fulci, but what I rented it was a laugh. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie for entertainment or a movie that makes you shake your head in embarrassment, go for it. This is perfect for junior "Mystery Science Theater" fans, but the only downside is that it's so bad it makes fun of itself. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think it's a shame to relate this to any other Hollywood title we might know, because when a movie sucks like this, it has its own genre.
