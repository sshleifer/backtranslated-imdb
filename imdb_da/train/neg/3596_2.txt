To be as honest as I possibly can, the Devil's Plaything (or blurry blood or vampire ecstasy or the curse of the black sisters or ????) is a complete boy. The film has a good premise behind it ?? The resurrection of a long dead vampire through a descendant's body through the help and help of a group of women dressed in black? but the execution is horrible. There are big, long moments of screen time when there is literally nothing happening. Signs just stand with nothing to do. There is no mystery, no excitement, and no plot points to worry about. The action is simply abysmal. Most of the play involves a group of below average looking women who dance naked while staring at the camera. They do it repeatedly. And what little plot exists seems to be designed to get more of these less than attractive women naked so they can participate in the dance. Although it is not as bad or pointless as the dance or plot in something like the Orgy of the Dead, it comes close.
