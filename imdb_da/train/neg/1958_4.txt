Where to start. This movie started out as something that seemed like a rip-off of "Darkness Falls". An old, fateful woman who lives in the woods and gives the children gifts for their teeth. Sounds good? Then it changes. In "Darkness Falls" the foot of the tooth only killed you if you saw her. The gum in this movie killed you no matter what. Why do they need rocker, his hippie girlfriend or Bubbas and their sister? I think the movie would have been fine without them. It seems that the producers sat and decided to put extra people in the movie so the tooth foot would kill people. Although it is nice to see a beautiful blonde girl who is not portrayed as a bubblehead for a change. Okay to rent, but I don't suggest buying it.
