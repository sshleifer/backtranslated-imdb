If there was a scale below 1, it would get a -10 that follows in Godspell's footsteps. The actor (if there was such a thing) was horrible, plotted in shambles. And Rene Russo was morally sweet in her role, enough to get a person to retreat. Ten thumbs down for a silly movie. Save grace: Kudos for your costuming.
