Are you talking to me? (1987) is a pretty bad movie with star games that I have never seen before or since starring like a guy from the neighborhood trying to become an actor. He has a heavy jones for the Taxi Driver trying to use it shtick to make it big. When he learns the hard facts of life, he does what everyone else does, changes his image! He goes from good fella to a surf up guy overnight. His friend can't believe the change (but he scores with Faith Ford and gets a cool paying concert). Can this young punk keep his street cred while making it big? <br /> <br /> This is a real lame movie that tries too hard to incorporate too many things at once. An interesting idea that falls apart due to poor performance. Who knows, maybe someone will pick up the ball and run because the filmmakers fumbled the ball this time. Don't waste your time with this movie. Unless you want to see a hot Faith Ford and a young Forest Gump Bubba. <br /> <br /> xx
