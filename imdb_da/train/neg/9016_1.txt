Dragon Fighter is the first Sci-Fi Channel (though I assume it's now Syfy?) Original movies I've ever seen. But I've seen one or two other things, and I can tell you they were stupid, but this really scrapes the bottom of the barrel. CGI is made bad, the play is bad, the script is ridiculous, and what happens at the end is unexpected and out of place (if you've seen Dragon Fighter, you know what I mean, I wouldn't put a spoiler in my review) . Plus, there was this musical tune that was used in virtually every dangerous order. It was really stupid; they just played it over and over again. And it is certainly not original; I know I've heard it somewhere before (I just can't remember where). This is one to avoid.
