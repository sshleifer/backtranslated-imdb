This is a movie that had a lot to live up to. In this year's release, legendary film critic Barry Norman considered it the worst movie of the year, and I had only heard nothing but bad things about it, especially a plot that was criticized for being too complicated. <br /> <br /> To be honest, the plot is somewhat of a red herring, and the movie suffers even more when the word "plot" is used, as far as I can see there is no plot as such. There is something that involves Russian gangsters, a character called Pete Thompson who tries to get his wife Sarah pregnant, and an Irish block is called Sean. How they all fit into something called a "plot" I'm not sure. It's hard to explain the Guy Ritchie movie's plot, but if you see any of his movies, I'm sure we can all accept that they all possess one, no matter how complicated they may be at first impression. Also, a James Bond movie, even though the plotters are stretched out with action scenes. You will have a serious problem with thinking that RANCID ALUMINUM has some kind of central plot that can be explained with care. <br /> <br /> If you look at the cast list, enough warning bells are called about what kind of movie you want to watch. Sadie Frost has appeared in some of the worst British films made over the last 15 years and she does nothing to become inconsistent. Steven Berkoff gives a bad name (and he plays a character called Kant that sums up this movie) while one of the supporting characters is played by a TV presenter, probably because no serious actress would be seen dead in this <br /> < The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it is completely forgettable. I saw it a few days ago and immediately after I had seen, I would write a very long critical review and warn people what they are doing to see, but now I have mainly forgotten why. But it doesn't change the fact that I remember to ignore this piece of jaw immensely
