I wonder how and more importantly why the decision to call Richard Attenborough to lead the most unambiguous sensation to hit Broadway for many years? He is an Oscar-winning director. Yes, he won for Ghandi you moron! Jeremy Irons is an academic winning actor, will you watch him play Rocky Balboa? He has experience with musicals. Really? "Oh, what a lovely war, have you forgotten?" To answer your question, yes! The film is a disappointment, clear and simple. Not an ounce of living energy survived the great enforcement of the case. Each character danced beautifully they were charming, but their projection was theatrical. I felt nothing. But when I saw it on stage I felt everything. The film should have been cast with stars, unknown, newcomers, but stars with compelling unforgettable faces even the most invisible of the group. Great actors who could dance beautifully. Now Michael Douglas was in it. True I forgot I am completely wrong and you are right. Nothing like a Richard Attenborough Michael Douglas musical.
