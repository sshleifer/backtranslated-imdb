Well, I don't think the picture is as bad as most reviews make it. . . But there is no denial that it has problems. <br /> <br /> Mostly, the issues are in the script. There is a plot - but not much history, and certainly not one that anyone could call plausible; It boasts a number of self-conscious strange and / or stereotypical characters, lines, moments, what do you have and ultimately it has not added too much to this section. <br /> <br /> Sorry, I couldn't worry less about anything "socially ill" Farnsworth could try to tackle; There will always be a sector of the people who are willing to do almost anything to destroy their brains, even if it requires running around grain fields trying to steal ammonia or what that moron does. So, like a movie, you won't find me calling "Iowa" "important". But at a stylistic level, the picture is more than interesting, and some of Farnsworth's choices by depicting a meth-head's carved state are beautiful, fun, disturbing and - yes, I say - inspired. /> <br /> The play is uneven, but it may just be an accident of the afore-praised stylistic reach. See, Rosanna Arquette is a fine actress - but she is not very good here, so a discriminating audience should ask, "What happened?" It is strange that Diane Foster manages a simplicity and grace that so few of the other players can come anywhere. Eg. Can I even consider what explanation Farnsworth could provide for Michael T. Weiss's over-the-top tour as a sampler, but I doubt I would ever buy it; It just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> Again, it is the most vibrant, and the moment I saw John Savage appear this year. Then go figure. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of work that tantalizes but doesn't promise - and that's okay; neither Farnsworth nor anyone else is required to make movies. So, whether Farnsworth has another movie in him or not, it is still to be seen, but if he does, it seems quite likely that it will not be softly dull. At a time when people are planning their lives around the latest installment of "American Idol," we might allow, not contempt, Farnsworth's legitimate and unthinkable films. What's more, maybe we could welcome, not berate, his energetic, and sometimes blessed, idiosyncratic imagination.
