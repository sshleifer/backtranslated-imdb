My sincere advice to everyone: Don't watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Do not even go close to the theater where this movie is being played !! Even a glimpse of it is bad for health. serious. no jokes. it is 3.30 in the morning. and I returned from this crappiest movie on this universe. FOUR HOURS DAMN !!! I'm proud that I survived after all that! If this is called survival. <br /> <br /> I'm very frustrated. annoyed. disappointed. It was pure waste of time! money went into drains! no plot. Hope I wake up in the morning sane and without reminding this night !! RUBBISH MOVIE. <br /> <br /> Happy Republic day to everyone and everyone :)
