In Hollow Point, director Sidney J. Furie has created a postmodern absurdist masterpiece that challenges and constantly surprises the audience. <br /> <br /> Sidney J. Furie dares to question what happens to the tired conventional traditional paradigms of 'plot' and 'characterization' as you remove the crutches of 'motivation' and 'reason'. <br /> <br /> The result makes me say that my opinion of him could not be higher. <br /> <br /> One and a half stars. <br /> <br /> P.S. Nothing in this movie makes sense, the law enforcement agents are flat out of sight, and the organized criminals are full of insanity.
