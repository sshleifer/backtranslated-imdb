I'm a fan of both Shakespeare and MST3K, so I was excited to see this episode. I comment on the movie first, then the MST3K episode. The recipe for this movie: Take talented actors, rich and beautiful Shakespeare material and a bid of $ 1.25. Mix well so drain off all life and movement until it is dull and lifeless. Serve cold in a large, clear stone bowl. Movie, I give 3 out of 10, because the actors at least deserve some credit. Okay, now the MST3K episode. I admit it, the first time I saw it, I fell asleep halfway through. I understand it was also the reaction of several other veiwers. But when I saw it another time, I realized that there were a lot of intelligent references and good lines I missed the first time. The trick with this episode is: Listen carefully! It takes a few views to catch each line. Give it another chance and you will see what I mean. MST3K Episode: 7 1/2 out of 10.
