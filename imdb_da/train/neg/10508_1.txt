I thought the nadir of horror movie production had reached the "Shadows Book" I was wrong. This film makes it look like "The Magnficiant Ambersons" in relation to this shameless, unexpected frivolity case that has the pride to call itself a movie. I'd write more, but I'm still angry that I was idiot enough to spend Â£ 3 rent it, reel. <br /> <br /> And were these people English? and where is the forest? I have lived in the UK two-thirds of my life, and as far as I know, there are no dark, unclear woodlands in the middle lands. The entire conditioner looked like a national trust coniferous plantation. The angels looked like anorexic porn stars (turned most of them were, did my research). However, I did suffer a little when Judd was torn apart. <br /> <br /> I love and admire Tom Savini, but he can't act
