Michael Keaton has never really been a good actor; In Tim Burton Batman movies, he always falls in the shadows of his big villains. Here he stands as a widowed man who is recording radio frequencies that seem to be dead people trying to get in touch with the living ... It must be a pretty shocking thriller, but it really misses every place That is shocking to you. Because there are far too many things that end inexplicably, undiscovered and uninteresting. So where is the shocking excitement when it all gets so bad that the film is first made that WHITE NOISE makes a fool of itself? Really bad acting and horribly edited, this movie is nothing to see. Michael Keaton tries to make a thriller again, but ends up missing the goal more than ever.
