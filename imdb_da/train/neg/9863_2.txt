Christopher Guest does not have to worry, his highest team on the Mockumentary subgenre is not in trouble to be upstaged at least, especially not by this extremely unfunny jab at RPG players. The witnesses are past the lame. Not enough fabric to keep the typical length of a (especially rancid) SNL shit, much less the 87 horrible minutes I talked about, so I looked at this drift. The great William Cat (Greatest American Hero, House) deserves much much better. One thing and one thing alone makes the fact that I saw this worth in my mind, and it posts it here, so hopefully I will save someone such a bad experience.
