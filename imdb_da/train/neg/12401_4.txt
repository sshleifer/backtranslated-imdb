I have a particular disadvantage here. I haven't seen the first two movies in this series, even though I've seen many Larry Cohen movies. Fans of the series seem to think it's a good movie. Judging it on your own, it was pretty boring. <br /> <br /> You never get a really good look at the maniac policeman's (Robert Z'Dar) face, but what I saw was pretty cloudy. The death scene seems to be staged to eat the most movie, not to give any excitement. Maybe if I saw the NC-17 director's cut, I might be more impressed. The end with the car with Z'Dar, Caitlin Dulany and Robert Davi was quite intense. best part of the movie.
