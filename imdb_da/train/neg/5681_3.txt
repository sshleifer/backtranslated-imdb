Having seen and loved Post (yes, I actually loved Post) I decided to try another Uwe Boll movie and I picked Seed because I happened to stumble upon it in a local DVD store and it should be one of His better movie. While the first 10 to 15 minutes of the movie was very promising and seemed like the beginning of a not too common psychological thriller, it soon went downhill and from there it was broken down into one of the most generic slasher movies I've seen so far. including a massive amount of plot holes, unrealistic emotional reactions and sub-par action. It seems that Boll tried his best to come up with a decent plot, but after a while he just gave it up. Maybe he should stick to comedy? The few good things about this movie are that he manages to create a general frightening atmosphere that the special effects are better than I expected, and the soundtrack goes well with the overall atmosphere, but the unbalanced pacing of this movie combined with that complete generic character of it makes him last half hour quite boring to see, which completely ruined my experience. There are a very pretty good shocking scene, but they seem to be there for the shock value alone. And let's not forget the camera work that was pretty nauseating at times. I hope that one day Uwe Boll will learn what makes a good movie, because between many terrible movies he seems to make a decent movie every now and then. Seeds are just not one of them.
