I don't want to go too far into detail because I can't really justify wasting much time reviewing this movie, but I had to give an alternative statement to hopefully help people avoid the movie. The animation is raw and the story changes between boring / meaningless to extremely annoying. The humor was completely lost on the audience, and yes - Ghost in the Shell fans, this is NOT an action-sci-fi or anything - it's an attempt to slapstick comedy, and humor just worked after being translated. It was a total task to watch this movie and horrible way for me to kick the film, especially considering how excited I was and how open I was - I didn't expect a Ghost in the Shell sequel, but I was expecting something entertaining, and it simply did not. Yaaawwnnn ... Rent Cinema's Journey instead.
