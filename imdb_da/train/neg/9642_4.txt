I could not believe that part of the horrible dialogue came out of human mouth, and the end of the blowers attached to the movie's body was a real hoot. And we get titty shots of Angelique Pettyjohn (kind) and Loren Crabtree to start. <br /> <br /> A teleportation unit activated by psychic Angelique Pettyjohn brings a foreign container to an underground lab into the desert. According to director Fred Olen Ray, they were remnants of Klaus Kinski's film, ANDROID, which gives the film an added value beyond how cheap it looks. <br /> <br /> Within the container is a midget alien (played by Ray's son) who begins to pat people to death. It was quite fun to see this little "creature" in a black reptile with what looks like big car holes attached to it and running around in the dark. We even get to see the little stamp and tear on a poster of ET that I thought was fun. <br /> <br /> And then it looks like a snake that also comes out of the container being hammered to death by William Fair, after the mini-creature chews into Frank McDonald's throat in the kitchen. A low budget takes Alien on, I suppose ... Everything ends steeply and looks like they ran out of movies at the end before the blooper rush comes into the final credit. Talk about lack of funding ... Fred Olen Ray also mentions in the director's comment that they were not sure whether Aldo Ray would go through the shooting and remember his lines. He almost did not. <br /> <br /> Make budget cheese fresh. It's fun to see, I'll give you that. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
