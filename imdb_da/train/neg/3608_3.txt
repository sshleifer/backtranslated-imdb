I have a good collection of movies and this one was added to it. Number 274 must be exact. <br /> <br /> The title made me go in the beginning. Splatter University. I thought it would be a big scary movie. Was I ever wrong. Don't make me wrong, it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it could have been much better. I love all the movies, but one was one that was more of a laugh than a scare. <br /> <br /> Poor sound quality, poor action and poor shooting conditions are some of the areas that could have been improved. 3 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> Movies are ideal for a good laugh. If you're looking for one of these movies to make fun, then this is one!
