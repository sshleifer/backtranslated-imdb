I'm a great Steven Seagal fan. Hell, I weigh as much as he does, even though I don't have street credit to track the milled mole tail. Having said my own bias and love for America's favorite corpulent scene and screen hero, it is with a heavy heart that I have to declare this to be his worst movie ever. I'm not sure he could make a movie worse than this one. <br /> <br /> In his defense, the major problems with this movie appear to be in post-production. It is painfully obvious that this film should have a different story. This results in mourned voiceovers, where Steve's voice is not nearly synchronized with the dual voice. The editing is pisspoor and generally it gets bad, gets even worse, and eventually you want you to have rewatched The Da Vinci Code instead. Yes, it's so bad. <br /> <br /> After that, I don't know what to expect from Steve. My friends are still laughing at me to listen to his CDs. Is it time I start checking out some of Van Damme's direct DVD-nutty logs? If you are tempted to watch this movie, scratch your eyes and rinse them down the toilet. A lifetime of darkness is better than 89 minutes of this.
