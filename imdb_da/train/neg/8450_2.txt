What happens to ITV Drama. First, "Losing Gemma" is simply the worst television drama I've seen this year, and now "Perfect Parents" a complete shambles from start to finish. Anyone who is responsible for starting this drive must receive P45 at special delivery. <br /> <br /> In most drama / thrillers, a requirement to suspend certain levels of faith is required so that the plot line can evolve, but "perfect parents" took this to a new level, I suspended so much faith at the end of this rubbish. I felt I had been fed on a truck of magic mushrooms, it was as if the manuscripts had decided to try to create a "drama by number" involving some serious problems - Religion, Education, Greed, Fear, Murder, Paedophillia It the only problem was as the great Eric Morecambe once said when playing a piano: "I play all the right notes, not necessarily in the right order". For your next Script guys, I suggest you try to read a few script development books than "Script writing for Dummies". Due to the ridiculous script and the complete lack of excitement in the direction the action was appropriately low key, not the actors fault as the cast was top notch. But I suggest that all the actors involved in this enchanting piece of drama should instruct their agents the next time Postman tries to deliver a script from the ITV drama department, make sure the letterbox is tightly closed!
