A fabulous book about a fox and his family doing what foxes do. to steal from farms and kill prey. Until a trio of farmers decides that they have had enough of this fox and try in various ways to "solve" the problem. They are, of course, "out foxed" at every turn, and while the trio is camped out by the foxhole, the family performs raids against the land of the three farmers. <br /> <br /> The "movie" version, and I use term film very loosely, is more a god horrible pastiche of American heist movies especially Ocean's movie. They even have George Clooney as Mr Fox to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of history altogether. So kudos to them. They will make lots of money and destroy another classic Roald Dahl children's book.
