Perhaps one of the most overrated so-called horror classics ever made, Halloween has the memorable Michael Myers and some great plays by Jamie Lee Curtis. <br /> <br /> However, its rewatchability factor is very close to zero, as there is an unforgettable amount of time spent on dullness / culmination to actual events. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you can walk away from to microwave popcorn and not miss anything at all. <br /> <br /> How it created so many followers, I will never understand. <br /> <br /> Thank God, Rob Zombie re-introduces this. And generally I hate remakes. <br /> <br /> Surely, he will more than compensate for all the random timed gaps with some unrelenting points of interest that the original is seriously lacking. <br /> <br /> This is a movie we feel we need to suffer, just like the way we learn to enjoy Dickens. <br /> <br /> Don't assume this is a classic.
