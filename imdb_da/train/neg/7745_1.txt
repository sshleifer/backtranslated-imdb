Where to start? Special effects should be called special deficiencies. When the director shouted "action" I also assume that he has also indicated to the actors to perform the worst performance they could think of. Perhaps he was annoyed with the producers and wanted to make sure that they would not recover a single cent from their investment and that the work would be a case study on how to make movies. Or maybe he hated art school and wanted to be an accountant, but his family did not let him be. The only thing that is certain is that whoever uses him in the future is because she is in love with him (so its objectivity jumped through the window) or because he changed his name and deleted all previous past references.
