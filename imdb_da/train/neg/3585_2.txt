As a big fan of gorilla movies in general, I expected this to be great - and for the gorilla effects, they were pretty good - that's all I can write about this flop. The movie claims to be based on a true story, but in reality it doesn't even come close to what actually happened to "Buddy" - who in fact was the famous Gargantua sold to Ringling Bros. by our supposed "heroic" Gertrude Lintz, known by many animal enthusiasts as a woman who hardly had the animal's welfare in the best interest. As Buddy was portrayed as aggressive, it was totally fiction and in no time did the gorilla actually take such behavior. buddy actually fled his wooden box (not a lavish burr room as shown in movies) during a storm to seek the comfort and comfort of the house, which feared Gertrude Lintz to sell him. No, Buddy was not released to a gorilla family surrounded by lush trees in a zoological paradise - he was abandoned in a wooden box deep in a garage for some time with only one bulb of comfort and then sold to circus - where he actually lived a better life with peanuts thrown at him until he died (historically the oldest living gorilla on record, by the way) before a show in Miami. Also note in the film how Buddy gets older, but the chimpanzees never age. (By the way, the chimpanzees were not raised with other animals, including Buddy, who portrayed in the movie)
