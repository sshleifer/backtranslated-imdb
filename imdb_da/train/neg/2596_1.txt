Dear God! I waited for this movie to "get started" ... so I waited to redeem myself ... and as it didn't, I just sat there and stumbled it: 1) it might be so bad and 2) I just wasted a few hours in just plain stupidity. I had faith that Drew couldn't have made it bad for a movie ... and boy, did I ever lose my faith! Don't bother with this one! Drew tried but the movie was poorly written, badly acted and just badly conceived! I can't believe in a script this poorly ever funded! It had a million chances to actually do something with the idea (the word "concept" is too big for this movie to even qualify for!) And it doesn't continue somewhere! It's just pitiful! Where the other reviewer got the idea that it was not the worst, confuses me! Because believe me, if it got worse, I would have split my wrists before I finished it!
