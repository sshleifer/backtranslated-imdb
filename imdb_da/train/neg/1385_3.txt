"Hak Hap" or "Black Mask" (English) was a disappointment. I was told it was a kind of "Japanese version of the matrix". Imagine my disappointment. The movie was either badly called or the soundtrack did not go well with the film. Another thing is that the dialogue was pretty poor. There was very little thought in the English version of this movie and it only appeals to the genre "senseless action". Not a movie I would like to see again.
