I am easily entertained. I enjoyed "Hot Shots" and "The Naked Gun" and their many successors, even when most found them unbearable. I've even managed to enjoy most Pauly Shore movies. There is only one movie I have seen that I can honestly say was bad ... and that was it. It's been a while since I've seen it, but I remember sitting in the theater thinking, "This is a stupid movie. Why did I see this?" It is honestly the only movie I cannot recommend.
