In the beginning we see the start of a secret advice of some sort. It all looks very promising out of the guys. When some supernatural elements are thrown in, the mystery becomes more interesting at the moment. The protagonist, acting as a good blocker, comes into trouble because of his demand for money, he is entitled to (temptation) and other factors. You really empathize with the guy and you want to know what's happening right now. Normally, a person in their situation will have more options. Somehow he does not have these opportunities. In this movie, there seems to be only one solution, even when it is clear, it is not his fault. Out of the blue he meets signs that speak of church, prayer, and God. And they give the answer to his problem. It must be obvious at some point in the film what this solution is. Now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message. Since it is always useful. However, it was really necessary to hide this message. This religious element actually ruined the experience for me. While the message is good, the simplicity is not to escape the fact that, in fact, more needs to be done to solve problems presented in this movie. The mystery presented to us is never solved. Instead, you have to deal with another topic that essentially has nothing to do with the plot. Don't be fooled by Malcolm McDowell. The once brilliant actor is sufficient, but if you look closely, you will see that he is not serious at all. He must really be desperate for money. Otherwise, it would be an actor of his caliber to act in a movie like this.
