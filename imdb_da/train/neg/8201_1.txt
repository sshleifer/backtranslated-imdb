Snuggle into your favorite chair and turn on the play station as you throw it into the waste handling unit. Spend a useful 90 min. Live your favorite game. Disjointed - poorly filmed - non-targeted unwanted. It takes a while from several other "science fiction" films and bad attempts to participate in the parts of a pathetically weak story. There is nothing new here, the filmmakers do not seem to realize that giving simple entertainment would achieve a gambling, but a clue to skill and flair is needed to make it a good movie. Any money spent watching this is a waste, and personally I would like to have my 90 mins of life back.
