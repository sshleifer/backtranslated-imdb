OK I'm not American, but in my humble Scottish opinion, Steve Martin is not, never been, and will never be a fun man as long as our posters are pointing in the south. Phil Silvers as Sergeant Bilko was a fun man, undoubtedly because of the talented writers and directors and all the other talented team characters in the series, who perfectly contributed to one of the funniest and dateless comedies ever produced by America. How anyone could make the sound even try to replicate Phil Silver's character is beyond me. For compound things, the exercise was repeated in Martin's sinister attempt to be Peter Seller's Inspector Clouseau, another abortive attempt, in my opinion, to revive a demonstrably unfunny career. Some of your contributors say 'Steve Martin puts his own stamp on the character', for that I would say 'balderdash', his pictures will be long forgotten when they are appreciated by Silvers and Sellars in future generations
