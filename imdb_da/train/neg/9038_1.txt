This is a horrible production of Bartleby, but not as the other reviewer has said, because it is "bad" but rather because this version does not maintain the book. It tells the story, almost painfully so. I could see the pages of my book and follow along, which is not so funny when dealing with an adaptation. Instead, see the 2001 version of Bartleby featuring Crispin Glover. The version, while humorous, brings new details to the film while maintaining the spirit of the novel. What is important is the spirit, not the minutiae of things like setting, drawing names and costumes. The difference between these movie versions is like night and day, boring and fun. This version is a lesson on what can go wrong if an adaptation is handled poorly, painfully, mindless schlock.
