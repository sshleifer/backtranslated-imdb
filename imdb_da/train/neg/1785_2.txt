.... And having seen this pile of crap you will not be surprised that it was not published <br /> <br /> !!!! SPOILERS !!!! <br /> <br /> This is a horrible movie by all standards, but when I point out that it is one of the worst movies named Stephen King in the credits, you can begin to imagine how bad it is is is. The movie starts with two characters staring openly in the mouth of a horror scene: <br /> <br /> "My God. What happened?" <br /> <br /> "I don't know but they are sure hate cats" * <br /> <br /> The camera pans outside a house where hundreds of cats are tense dead and mutilated. Boy, this guy is right, a person hates cats and with a deduction like that he must be a policeman. Oh wait a minute, he's a policeman, and when a movie starts with a policeman making an oh so obvious observation, you just know you should see a bad movie. The reason why SLEEPWALKERS is bad is that it is very illogical and confused. Finally, we find out the titles of the titles that need blood for virgins to survive. Wouldn't they be better off looking for a virgin in the mid-west Bible belt rather than an American coastal town? When we have said it at least we know about the motives of the monsters - that is the only thing we learn. We never learn how to change shape or are able to make cars become invisible, and these jars with the end that seem to have been stolen from the TERMINATOR. Monster's mother walks around and kills several police with her bare hands or blows them up through a police hand-gun (!), But if her monster race is immune from police force, why do creatures have the ability to change shape or become invisible? The death of the animal is as ill as being killed by a mass base of domestic cats. If they can be killed by cats then why didn't the monsters squeeze all the cats around the garden? There was a whole horde allowed around, but the monsters never thought of killing them. I think it is so that the production team can come up with an end. It was that they started the movie my complaint lies <br /> <br /> We are treated to several scenes where famous horror movie instructors like John Landis, Clive Barker and even Stephen King make cameos. I think the reason for this is because every time a fighting unknown actor reads the script, they immediately decided that no matter what they weren't going to get into a movie, Stephen King had to call his horror comrades to be able to fill in the casting. It's so bad SLEEPWALKERS are <br /> <br /> * Amazing, as it didn't seem to be the worst line in the movie. The worst line is - "The cat saved my life"
