I never really understood the popularity of Saban's Power Rangers show, which was simply another set of American version of Japan's ultra-popular super sentai series in the last three decades! What was cool about the Japanese version is completely lost in the American version, characterization, special effects, etc. Of course, many children will say that power controllers are the biggest, but they would be wrong. <Br /> <br /> I'm sure if they spoke Japanese, they would learn how much better super sentai is over the American version. <br /> <br /> The Power Rangers are horrible, try Super Sentai instead! Looking for a better show, try Voltron The Third Dimension instead!
