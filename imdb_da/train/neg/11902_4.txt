The hysterical thing about this movie is that, according to the director, it is difficult to find a distributor in the United States because most of them who saw it could not reconcile the apparently conflicting messages of Christianity and American anxiety. The idea that someone sees this as a religious film at least is ridiculous. Because a minister on a mission asks with the homeless or wants some "Godspeed", does it make it a "Christian" movie? One can interpret that it actually falls for religion in the "Land of Lots" with all its material profits, the best an organized mission can do is handing out a bowl of soup and a Bible verse. Lots of unlucky or dimmed maybe? Lots of useless homeless missions? What about lots of psycho Vietnam veterinarians? As a pill-jumping errant survivor of "pink" agent, do we mean that America is a "Land of Plenty" of paranoid patriots? Maybe we have lots of psychiatric patients? We certainly didn't have a lot of people worried about Palestinian policy based on the protagonists of the phone call in the movie. Of course, if you worked in a German homeless shelter, it would be much more concerned about peace in a distant country than their own personal survival, as the world knows how Europe is "the Almighty of the continent" when it comes to sophistication. /> <br /> In fact, I agree with the title in the end, since the United States is "Land of Plenty" and in this particular case it refers to the abundance of bad scripts, amateur and dispassionately directed films. Life is too short, and one, even an American, does not have "plenty" time to waste to see this piece.
