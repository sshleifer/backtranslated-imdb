Baba - Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life. This is the movie that caused his downfall. It was released with much hype but crashed badly and added serious financial losses to its producers and distributors. Rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the lost costs. Soon after the release, he tried to go into politics, but otherwise failed. It is a very bad movie with horrible plays, poor quality makeup and pathetic manuscript. Throughout the film, Rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease. I'm one of the unfortunate souls who saw Baba, first day first show in theater. The audience was so sad that most of them left the theater before the break. Sorry, I would not recommend this to anyone.
