Why is it that everyone who has seen this movie feels it is their responsibility to tell us whether they are squares or not? That point is absolutely immaterial to any argument that must be made against this overall dog in a movie. <br /> <br /> I think sports movies fall into two categories; well made films about the human spirit and competitions, and `by the sword '. In fact, this movie could never decide what it would be, a touching drama to try to be the best in life, an accusation of competitive motivation or martial arts. In the end, none of them made convincing or complete enough to give me an ounce of care for any of it. <br /> <br /> For the record I am also a fence instructor (and now I'm officially as bad as the rest). But putting a bad fence in a movie doesn't make it badly automatic. I mean watching Star Wars (episodes 4-6, good movies, bad fences). I liked these movies. But when you put bad sports into a bad movie for some reason, people think it's only the purists who think it's a huge effort. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by any comments about the minor fence issue. This is just a bad movie. Ultimately, this film has nothing for the fence enthusiast or film film or simply anyone with a pulse and three brain cells. When I watch a movie and are forced to think, 'Man, I wish I saw the mighty ducks. 'I know it's time to bypass the argument with the theater director to get my money back and see if there is someone in the lobby that somehow will give me two hours of life back.
