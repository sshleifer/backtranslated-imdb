One of the requirements of science fiction, at least before it begins to become satire, is that it is somewhat plausible. I would think an anti-material bomb would do much more harm than what it was supposed to be. But I leave it to the physicists who may have seen Solar Crisis. <br /> <br /> It's a crisis that the earth is facing because sunlight gets out of hand. They come close to Earth, so much so that it becomes unusually hot, as if the whole Earth was Death Valley. The answer is an anti-material bomb that a spaceship must take to the sun and explode there. It will divert flares off in the direction of say Mercury provided it is not in direct conformity with the earth. <br /> <br /> Who will deliver it, but Captain Tim Matheson and his crew. That is if he can keep an eye on the business that is present and not on the round son, Corin Nemec. Taking care of the personal side of the family problems is Admiral Charlton Heston, Matheson's father and Nemec's grandfather. <br /> <br /> There's also a villain, Peter Boyle, who is managing director of a multinational corporation, who in this crisis is trying to control the world's food supply for the survivors. The idea he may not survive does not go into his thinking. He does his best to sabotage Matheson's mission. <br /> <br /> The solar crisis seems like a bad mix of 2001, a Space Odyssey and Voyage to the bottom of the ocean. Boyle seems to be taking his signal from Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor in Superman, he is apparently the only one in the cast who discovers that he is in a turkey and thus overcomes. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is stalwart, sandy blue and dull. Except possibly. Desert Rat Jack Palance, who finds Nemec and cares for him. <br /> <br /> The key here is that the movie was directed by said Hollywood purveyor of flop films, Allen Smithee. The movie gets as much as four stars for the cast involved and it was out in time for a Thanksgiving carving.
