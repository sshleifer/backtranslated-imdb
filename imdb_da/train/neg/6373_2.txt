Oh this was a really bad movie. The girl playing Jennifer is ok, but I think she works bitchy through the movie, not because she has her organs torn out of a raven at night, but because she is thinking of shooting her agent to put her in this piece of shit. Faye Dunaway seems to be remaking Mommy Dearest and the end is completely silly. I really can't recommend this movie, although as a fan of Edgar Allen Poe I was fascinated by the references to his work (Ravens, House of Usher-like family curse and being buried alive) would probably turn in his grave if he knew about this movie.
