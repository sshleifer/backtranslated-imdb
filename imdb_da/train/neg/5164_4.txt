The basic plot of this movie is not bad. A lady makes it big and comes back to her alma mater who is being loved. But despite the good play by Robert Young and Eve Arden, the film is a mess. I blame this for either Joan Crawford or the director or both, as her performance is just awful. Instead of being a real person, she makes a wonderful imitation of a deer caught in the headlights. In other words, she stares out into the room and has a "golly, I'm SOOOO stunned" expression. After a few minutes it became really annoying to me. Now it's certainly not the only Crawford movie I don't like for her performance, as she had done more than her share of overactive - in movies like JOHNNY GUITAR or many of her later films that BERSERK! My advice is to try another Crawford movie - that was probably better.
