This movie was so disappointing. From the blurb I got to see Phantom Love (why is it called?) I expected something artificial and thoughtful with beautiful pictures. It had some interesting pictures, but these often seemed random and made no sense. In fact, they seemed to be deployed to fill the time. In the end, the effect was dull. <br /> <br /> I think the movie was supposed to be atmospheric, but it just wasn't. The lack of a coherent plot did not help. You might say it was mysterious, but I think it was just incoherent without atmosphere. The protagonist seemed to be disturbed, but the plot didn't take me enough to worry about her situation. Without looking at the cast list, I would not have known that you see the main character as a child. The film has very little context for time, place or character. I'm not a prude, but the sex scenes (there were several) seemed meaningless and confused me further, I recognized Lulu, but I wasn't sure if it was the same man, different men, a lover, her husband, or she was a prostitute. It was only when I saw the credits that I discovered the hard back were supposed to belong to her lover. This movie managed to do what should have been shocking (dream sequences involving Lulu's mother) seem a bit boring. The nail filing was actually more sensible, as it provided an indication of Lulu's emotional state. I will not fault the actors as I did not have much to work on. <br /> <br /> I don't know if the lack of context or flow in the movie was due to inability or because it was pretentious but the end result was boring. <br /> <br /> I can't be bothered to talk about it anymore.
