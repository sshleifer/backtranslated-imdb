Things to call "House of the Dead" is the worst movie all the time, it really isn't. There are worse movies out there. I see many Hong Kong ninja films that are basically the result of an unfinished Japanese police drama that has images of ninjas put in the end to create something that could technically be called "a movie." however, the dead are one of the worst movies I have ever seen in the theaters. Going halfway through, I actually felt that I was a little stupid for having put 45 minutes of this piece of waste.
