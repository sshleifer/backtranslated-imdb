I thoroughly enjoyed a man called horse when it was released in 1970, but back played as a typical sequel. Everything about it - budget, script, plot, casting and acting - was inferior to the original. Gale Sondergaard as Elk Woman, an elder of the yellow hand trunk, looks nothing like an Indian, nor half of the other "Indians" who were played by Italians, Mexicans and Latinos with cheap wigs. And the old guy who played the boss seemed more like a fat old squaw than a hard-headed warrior. He even used the bow as a woman! Finally, Richard Harris, who did a fantastic job in the original, seems to be throwing this time. I suppose he could not withstand the easy pay slip he was given to render his role as a horse. To be fair, there are some interesting moments in the movie that horse is under a painful cleansing ritual to "find his vision" and rally the yellow hands against their Indian enemies and white oppressors, but overall the return is uneven, boring, corny and predictable - like most followers.
