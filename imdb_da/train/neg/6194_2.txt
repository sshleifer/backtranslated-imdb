With the title "borrowed" from Werner Herzog and liberal helpers by Kubrick, Haneke and Noe, it is painfully obvious that Thomas Clay considers himself a slice of the usual kind of nonsense that our British cinema struggles out. "Robert Carmichael" (too short) sets himself up as a realistic study of youthful alienation and, at the same time, apparently a criticism of the Iraq war. The problem with realism is that the characters are so overtly unrealistic and atypical - unlike the hard fantasies of "extreme" filmmakers, most teenagers are not drug addicts. As a criticism of the war in Iraq, a film about youth violence (by a talented classical musician - the subtitle community damaged for this sensitive individual) is so infantile that it is almost impossible to think of. There are signs of technical ability, but some reviewers have exaggerated this. Like Kubrick and Noe, he shows that the desire to shock associated with suspected serious intent may be the worst cinematic trick of the latest movie. People liked "Clockwork Orange" and "Irreversible" because they liked the rapes and violence, but most of all, they liked to feel culturally superior to the things that most hated. So too much Kubrick and not enough Haneke (a serious and moral filmmaker) feel this as one of the most moronic films this year. (I'm not against violence in movies. Doing it seriously is a hard trick - people in cinemas cheered Alex in "Clockwork Orange", showing how Kubrick's supposed intention was missing for miles. Free violence is much easier to achieve and less offensive than performance for many film directors.)
