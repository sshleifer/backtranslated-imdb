This movie offers nothing to anyone. It does not succeed at any level. The action is horrible, boring long-winded dribble. Of course, they were trying to be shocking at the length of the end sex scene, but ended up being pretty much a parody of what the movie was meant for. Complete garbage, I can't believe what a ridiculous movie this was. <br /> <br /> And I'm very sure that Rosario Dawson ended up in this movie because, though this would be her collapsed break in, a wowing NC-17 movie. The problem is that no adult will stick to this movie, as the movie plays out as an uninteresting episode of OC or something aimed at teenagers. Pathetic.
