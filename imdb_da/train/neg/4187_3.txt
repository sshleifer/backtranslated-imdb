A film written and directed by Neil Young, "Greendale" is a little more than an 87-minute music video for a dox or so by the songwriter's works. Instead of dialogue, the film builds solely on Young's texts, which are strongly twisted with socio-political comments, to tell "the story" while the actors are performing the scenes. <br /> <br /> Given the hammy performances and the creepy grainy of the picture, the effect is the same as Young, who inflates some of his own home movies and releases them for public consumption. While there is supposedly a "story" running through the movie, we really have no idea what is going on thanks to the movie's unpolished appearance, lack of dialogue, and the amateur endlessness of the actor. All we get for fifty-eight minutes is a bunch of aging hippies cavorting silently through an incoherent tale, while Young's songs play endlessly on the soundtrack. It all becomes a boring exercise in complacency. "Greendale" gives off-Hollywood, low budget film-making a bad name.
