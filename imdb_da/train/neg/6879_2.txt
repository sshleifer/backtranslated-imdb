Rosie wasted a lot of time talking about Tainos as if they were super influential in the dynamics of modern Puerto Rico. They were not. The truth is that the Africans and the Spanish were and she knows. What kills me is that she stands on the screen and looks like an average light-skinned black chick (with an obvious black girl, cousins ​​and aunt) who pretends to recognize the real essence of what makes them modern Puerto Rican but hardly mentioned how Africans influenced the way their Spanish is spoken on, food and music. She is so typical and I lost a lot of respect for her and will not support anything else she does. Since she also wants to dance around her African ness, she does not have to take on more roles in blackness (ie Lackawanna Blues). We can find a prideful Black Latina next time (thanks Zoe Saldana, Gina Torres, Gina Ravera and Melissa DeSousa). <br /> <br /> Here, Puerto Rican said they are African and not "black". ...thank you. We "black" certainly have nothing in common with "you", so there is no love lost. But since you are probably in the states and benefited from the civil rights movement, we would like you to refuse any decent human treatment you received gratitude for the blood, sweat and tears from the back of the "blacks" you do not share something with. <br /> <br /> If I'm correct, Puerto Rican's has a horrible picture in the media, but we blacks don't spend our time trying to respect you because we know the media loves to exploit the low points and behavior of all minorities to maintain mindless generalizations. But you've obviously fed in hype that you're somehow white or superior ... you're not. Also you feel compelled to believe that the black culture is BET ... again, you are wrong and have to take a holiday out of the hood. Try to visit Atlanta, GA, Houston, Texas, Charlotte, N.C. Believe in me that none of these blacks will claim your "culture" either.
