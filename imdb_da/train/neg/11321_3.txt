You can't really go far when the original story isn't that big. The premise for cyborg's blood needs is just drowsy. <br /> <br /> The scripture is blas√© '. The actors do not have much to work with. The sets were staged in the desert to reduce costs. It is a trademark that if the background is desert, then the film has no budget. <br /> <br /> Missing budget is okay if there's a story. "Solarbabies" and "Blood of Champions" are examples of decent work from no $. But this movie looks like they should scrape their change together just to buy the camera man a sandwich. Again, forgiveness if only the story didn't just hit it. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie commits the greatest crime to everyone: It's not finished! It just ends as if it is a commercial break away from the rest of the movie. But the rest never comes. Just strange. <br /> <br /> Just bad.
