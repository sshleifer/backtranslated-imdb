Really, really, abysmally, garishly, horrible. But the actor Clayton Moore (the movie Lone Ranger) releases herself competently as an actor. He's the only one. <br /> <br /> A rare treat for five minutes if you want to vertical the depth of grotesque transparent special effects, Southern California as "the moon" (again and again and again) and act so tragically unfortunate that it can be a spoof. . . except that it is clear that it is not - no humor here, except inadvertently. <br /> <br /> The dialogue can be worse than any of these other aspects and costumes. . . well enough. Reason? What plot? Bad guy and his henchmen, including his earthly agent, called Krog (listen carefully, or you will suspect it's a spear on the name of McDonald's founder Ray Kroc) and his incredibly eerie guns (which, however, have small arms that never need reloading, like Commando Cody, so there are many firefighting). <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
