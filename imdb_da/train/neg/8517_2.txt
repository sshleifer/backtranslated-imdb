Veronica Mar's greatest mystery is not one that she had to tackle on the screen. <br /> <br /> Also, the mystery is why this perennial ratings disappointment is still in the air. This week marked a nadir for Veronica Mars: it ranked 146 out of 146 shows in the Big 6 (soon to be Big 5). Yes, you read right. Veronica Mars was beaten by every show in the now-completed WB and every show at UPN. It was beat of all the shows at Fox and of course of all shows on ABC, CBS and NBC. Now says hip hypesters: but this was a re-run. But everything on TV that week was pretty much a re-run! It boggles the mind why CW would choose this evidence of disappointment as one of the few shows it rescued from UPN. It is clear that something is happening behind the scenes. Favorites are exchanged and influenced peddled. <br /> <br /> Sorry to be so cynical, but what other explanation is there? "Veronica Mars has the potential" line is clearly dead now as it has had two years to set up and failed. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's Joel Silver's influence and complaint, but honestly I'm lost why anyone would choose to spend their complaint on a bad show that no audience sees. <br /> <br /> A great mystery and a very inauspicious debut for CW.
