I'm a big fan of horror flicks, and zombie movies are a definite favorite for me. That said, Zombi 3 is one of the absolute worst movies I've ever seen. So needless to say, I really enjoyed it, it's the best bad movie I've seen for a long time. The story has some similarities with Dan O'Bannon's "Return of the Living Dead", but while that movie was intentionally fun, one is the opposite. It has some of the most ridiculous actions I have ever witnessed, especially from the main investigator's character. His scenes with the general were just hysterical. The effects are also subordinate and in many cases sloppy, and the death scenes are often just rather stupid. This of course makes it very fun. POSSIBLE SPOILER - The worst is the scene where the guy opens the refrigerator door and sees the cut zombie head that then opens the eyes and somehow FLYER OUT OF THE FRIDGE (apparently pulled out with a little string) and locks on the boys throat and kills him . Zombie heads have the ability to float in the air now? It fights any physical law known to man, and it is one of the most absurd things ever filmed. It's just one of many really stupid moments in the idiotic mess. I can't believe it's been so high a rating here. If you are a fan of bad movies, do yourself a favor and hire this sucker.
