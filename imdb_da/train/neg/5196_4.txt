Though a bit more polished technically than the previous movie in the series, BULLDOG DRUMMOND ESCAPES, this is a weaker escapade in both a plot that is less exciting and a leading man who simply does not have Ray Milland's charisma. <br /> <br /> That said, several actors and characters continue in their roles and manage to keep the flag flying. Also John Barrymore is present and pops up throughout the film in a variety of outlandish aprons. It is still another endless night for BD, when he and his cohorts intend to rescue the poor girl he intends to marry. The guides are stupid, but again the supporting actors make them entertaining.
