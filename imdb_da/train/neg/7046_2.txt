I saw this boring waste of time on the HBO's comedy channel, so I realized completely innocently and obviously this was a comedy. But there is absolutely no fun here. A good casting is essentially wasted on a script that I could have written with my left buttocks - after it had been beaten sensually by 15-year-old Inquisition torturers. The first half is particularly bad, as it has some of the most boring, pointless dialogues I have found in a moment, and zero comma-zero plot to talk about. Just the fact that stars like Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this little movie and yet this movie has less than 1000 votes on this site, tell everything. A few great shots of waves hit the cold British coast, but it's about it. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie being made just because the people who wrote it have good connections (family connections, preferably) and / or lots of cash lying around.
