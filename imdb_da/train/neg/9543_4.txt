Let's see it - if you rented a STDVD sequel to a forgotten 80's gem and expected to be better than the aforementioned, you're an idiot. Wargames: The Dead Code joins the long list of unnecessary successors that the DVD market has filled so easily. Movies like this don't have to spoil because you already know them. The "plot" for this "movie" is as follows: Nerd meets girl; girl likes nerd; nerd likes girl; nerd is accidentally involved in the Top Secret Government computer; geek and girl go to another country geek and girl end up being persecuted by state moves in the other country geek and girl meet with some important old guy who dies at the key point of "movie"; geek and girl are caught The top secret government computer gets crazy nerd is hired to beat Top Secret Government Computer; nerd beats Top Secret Computer using the same old Top Secret Computer from the first Wargames "movie"; nerd saves the day nerd is laid. <br /> <br /> The end. <br /> <br /> The action, script, effects, score and movie are what you would expect - B class. Some known faces are in here, and unless you are a mega fan of Colm Feore, you should avoid this. Permitted, the movie will not make you insane enough to eat your own toes by seeing it, so if you like cheap to see STDVD followers then you're right at home. Hopefully, Mathew Broderick was also involved in some "masterpieces" that he couldn't even make a five-second cameo in this one. But can you blame him?
