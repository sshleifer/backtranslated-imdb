This was possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. The reason did not make a lot of sense and the play was terrible. I'm a big fan of Amber Benson, I think she's usually a wonderful actress, I can't imagine why she decided to make this movie. Her character, Piper, is full of almost the entire movie, with the exception of the opening scene. On the plus side, there were several points in the movie where the play was so bad, I actually screamed loudly. But in spite of that I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It's only 80 minutes long, but it's 80 minutes in your life that you will be completely wasted.
