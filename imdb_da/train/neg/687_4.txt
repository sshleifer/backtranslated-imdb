I'm a big fan of Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard. And in addition to that, Charles Butterworth (a very entertaining entertainment player) was in this movie ... so why am I not particularly good at it? Well, despite a good throw this is one of the poorest written and most cliché "A pictures" I've ever seen. Considering talent and money used to make this movie, it's shocking how the slip-shod writing was. I knew the movie would be boring when I found myself predicting what would happen next time in the beginning of the movie - and I'm always right! And it's not because I'm a kind of "movie savant", but was because almost no imagination or effort went into it. In fact, it almost seemed as if the film was just a long string of cliches clustered! Also, I found it a little annoying that Fred mistreated Carole so badly throughout the movie, and yet, she ended up coming to him in the end. Uggh! There is more excitement in a Lassie movie ("will he bring people to rescue Timmy or will it rope he scares off break?"). <br /> <br /> Despite the very tired and cliché script, there were a few positives about the movie. It was pretty cold when Fred looked like a ruined lush at the end of the movie - it was pretty credible and he looked like he hadn't eaten, shaved or slept for days. Also, Charles Butterworth's "prattle" gave a few mildly humorous moments. But all this was just not enough to make this movie look different from a "B movie". It's a shame it could have been so much better.
