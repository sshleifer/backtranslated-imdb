"Freddy's Dead" did the smartest thing it could have done after the disappointment of the fifth movie. It started from scratch. Sure, this "final" movie in saga is stupid, but at least it's original. Some of the pictures are even a bit breathtaking. And the story of Freddy's children (Lisa Zane) returning to the city to meet her evil father is unique. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is nothing more than a comic book made to bring children to the theater. It has a bunch of good actors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Lezlie Deane) who look pretty stupid and wandering around getting ready for slaughter. It's one-sided, it's a magic trick, and in the end it's nothing but fat, childish entertainment. <br /> <br />
