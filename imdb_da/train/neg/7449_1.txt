Very disappointing version of Lorna Doone. Too many missing characters, no romantic scenes, changes in the story line, too short, appeared low budget. Hardly enough dialogue to understand the story if you are not familiar with the novel. In some scenes, it seems that Lorna has cold sores on her upper lip. I'm sure make-up made it best to hide it. I suppose they didn't want to stop the recording until it was cured. Most likely why this movie lacked kissing scenes. Only a disappointing kissing scene at the end. Lorna Doone is a great epic tale and should be told. The 2000 version of Lorna Doone is twice as long, more romantic, much more enjoyable and more true to the book.
