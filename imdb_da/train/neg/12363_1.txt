This is one of those movies that apparently tried to ride on the wave of martial arts. It's like Billy Jack I guess. However, while Billy Jack had a remarkable martial arts scene, no one in this one unless you are considering some gentlemanly grappling and roughhousing as such. We are introduced to the star, which is described as having learned Judo in the marines. I was in the marines, and although they are quite established in boxing, I really can't remember any weight on Judo. As a result, the antagonist, James Macarthur, refers to Judo when he gives an excuse for why he, a state break, was so easily defeated. Lame.
