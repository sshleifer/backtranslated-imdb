Anyone who wrote the script for this movie does not deserve to work in Hollywood at all (not even stay there) and these actors have to find another job. The most horrible hour and a few minutes in my life ... and I only kept an eye on whether it would get better, which unfortunately did not do me. <br /> <br /> Even at the end, the credits gave me anxiety. I suppose there were not many people behind the movie, so they had to roll the credits slowly ... very slowly. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely an amazing "How not to make a movie" guide. Too bad I can not give a 0.
