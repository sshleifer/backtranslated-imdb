Filmfour will have to do much better than this little cop of a movie if they get the right kind of reputation for themselves. <br /> <br /> This movie is set in Glasgow (though only a few secondary characters have something approaching a Scottish accent). The prerequisite for people whose lives do not go anywhere that everyone meets in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning, when they have night jobs, could have made a really fun, insightful, quirky, cult film. Instead, we have a group of self-obsessed saddos and a plot that has been so made to bits, I'm surprised it's not been banned. X and Y are friends. X sleeps with Z. Y also sleeps with Z. Oh, you find out. <br /> <br /> A total waste of time. Painful dialogue - it sounded like something a group of 16-year-olds would have written for a GCSE drama project. The female character was completely superfluous - just written as a token woman hoping women would be surprised to see it. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of thicko lad that laughs at beer ads and can usually be found wandering around in packages shouting on Saturday night in indefinite city centers, then you will love this movie and find it "a really laff ". Everyone else is running, don't go away from this horrible little misfit. And a question when the group left the "boring" seaside resort (Saltcoats randomly, though they changed the name of the movie), to go back to Glasgow, why did they do it via Forton Motorway Services on LANCASTER, which is in England?
