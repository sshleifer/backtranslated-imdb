Not fun - how can anyone link this to Monty Python? It's totally ridiculous - there's no laugh. This is not fun. Over the top, but ugly, weird just for strange sake, and it seems to me that these people were on something all the time. Unfortunately something that didn't make them fun. <br /> <br /> Some points should be given for effort etc. Whatever. In fact, it looks like there's a laugh track - or is there one? Hummm .... Since there is almost no laugh, there is a question that can be discussed. <br /> <br /> Maybe I'm doing it unfairly - maybe it's a kind of exercise. Some kind of art - in that case nothing goes wrong. <br /> <br /> But these guys play high-altitude women, screwed nose. Come on !!! Not funny. <br /> <br /> There's only one heir to Monty Python's intellectual white, and that's Stephen Colbert, and maybe Jon Stewart.
