This is a very strange movie ... I was not really sure what was happening, some N London lowlifes find a silly child in the woods, as they all think is a kind of oracle and thus making them all in their own way , change something about their lives that usually ends in disaster. The movie ended after about 90 minutes, leaving me feeling completely unhappy, almost annoyed by the infinite. I didn't care about any of the characters - neither of them got a chance to end up with the viewer. <br /> <br /> What was the message? Should I be weak? It was just strange. What happens to Runner? Why does Emilio shoot the child? ... it made absolutely no sense, meaningless. Can anyone help me understand this mess in a movie?
