Worst movie I've seen since Gingerale Afternoon. I suppose this is a horror / comedy. I predicted almost all scenes in this movie. The special effects were not that special. I think I could get so good from effects that I have been lying around in the house. I wish I could have something good to say about this movie, but I'm afraid I won't. Even Coolio was ashamed to appear in such a turkey. After some thinking, I have one thing good to say about this movie - it ended.
