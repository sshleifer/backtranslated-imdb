This film commits what I would call an emotional rape on the viewer. The film seems to be a bit due to the critics in Cannes, but for me, the last scene was just a pathetic attempt to make a novice director feel. Hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other matter for that matter). The protagonist's metamorphosis from good but troubled boy to the evil rapist is almost nonexistent, while the rape scene (which is an overdraft, exaggerated version of the "A clockwork orange" rape scene) is unbearable and I refuse to comment on its aesthetic values. There are some things an artist should not do to try to reach his goal. At least in my opinion. <br /> <br /> To unpack it: shockingly brutal, disgusting and not worth your time. Instead, see "A clockwork orange" or "Le pianiste".
