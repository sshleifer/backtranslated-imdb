I watched this movie the first time at noon on a Saturday night. It's really the perfect time for this. I have never ever seen a movie that was actually more predictable and drenched with stereotypes. If you want to see an exciting action movie, don't see it because you might lose the will to live halfway through. But if you want a good laugh, you can see it! I even bought the Chuck Norris 3DVD collection thanks to my enjoyable Saturday night. What struck me in particular is that the only scene that would be expensive to make was copied from a Discovery documentary or an old TV special on the US Army. In addition, I was amazed at the fact that they did not make the slightest effort to make production a reality. Afghanistan is, as far as I can remember, nothing near any sea and yet with one click Deke escapes from the terrorist's sand castle with his jet package and is taken by a submarine (probably Discovery). Later in the film, Deke throws an Islam terrorist against the wall. In the slow motion scene, you can beautifully see the long hairs of the Korean stuntman flap in the air as you smash against the wall. Maybe love it. I recommend you see it with some friends and a good amount of beer, but only then do you understand why I've been crazy enough to spend 6.99 euros on the box.
