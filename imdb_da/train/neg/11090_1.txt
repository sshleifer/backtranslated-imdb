This movie looks like it was made for TV. For years I was waiting for some movies about Rubin Carter, because I loved watching him box on the old MSG and seeing this movie was very disappointing. I have great respect for Mr Washington, but he was horrible and boring. There really is nothing good to say about this movie, except I liked the song.
