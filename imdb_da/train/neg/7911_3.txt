It was not remarkable enough to be really awful, it was just incredibly lame. The story wasn't half bad, but the performance was just awful. <br /> <br /> Initially, it moved too fast for us to become emotionally involved in what was happening. It was just paced badly. The dialogue was so extremely sparkling, just flat and boring. <br /> <br /> And the signs, cribs common, they made Deadpool boring. How in hell do you make Deadpool boring? He wasn't even fun. He wasn't crazy. He was just an annoying guy with a couple of swords, he didn't even know how to use properly. The Gambit was boring. And since when did he have telekenisis to make the cards flow and fly around, or super strength to jump hundreds of feet into the air? And what was the stupid helicopter movement? I mean, we know they are mutants, but they still exist within the realm of physics. A round living staff is not a helicopter blade, you cannot fly by stumbling super dups quickly. Which Gambit wouldn't be able to do anyway. Nor Deadpool, especially when using it as a substitute for true combat choreography. <br /> <br /> And this film proves that wiring work should only be used by combat coordinators who know and know better than using WTH in every single one. shot. as a substitute for true combat choreography. <br /> <br /> Three of the most physical warriors in Marvel comics (Logan, Creed and Wilson) and some of the worst combat choreography I've ever seen in the latest movie memory. It was as if the stunt coordinator just shrugged his shoulders and left it all to the special effects guys. <br /> <br /> And then you had a break with all those mutants who didn't do anything. Even mutants that had been shown in their cells to have the powers (nice to see a Quicksilver key) did f-all when they came out. Only Emma-really-Lame-for-this-movie-Frost and Cyclops did something. <br /> <br /> And when was Logan so beautiful? And the stupid: "The ball will take its memory away." Don't you think Xavier and X-Men would have noticed the big freaking bullet holes in his adamantium skull when they x-rayed him in X1? I was sorry Liev Schrieber man, he actually downloaded a good Sabretooth in view of the script. He made one of Marvel's more simple super villains feel real. But he couldn't save the movie from his own epic lameness. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this "Daredevil" level was sucked. Decent story, good actors, absolutely horrible performance.
