I picked up TRAN SCAN from the library and brought it home. We considered taking a trip out of the east and thought it would give us a sense of how it was. The movie was a total waste of time, if I went out to buy it, I would call it TRAN SCAM as I saw that it cost $ 49. <br /> <br /> The DVD ran for 8 minutes and showed a roller coaster ride across Canada, where my stomach feels sick as they walked up and down and around the basket with the movie at high speed. There were a lot of footage, they probably shot at this, and you would think they could have made a better product. If I would have done this project, I would give more footage, stopped on road signs to let people know where they were and were in places to see nature. To make a movie like this, it should have been 60 to 90 min. Oh yes the case said it was in stereo, the whole movie was a hissing sound from sped up car sound, it could at least put some music to it. <br /> <br /> If you want a good cross Canada movie watch The Railrodder / National Film Board of Canada starring Buster Keaton (the final movie he made) in this comic movie, Buster Keaton moves on to a railroad tracker in Nova Scotia and travel to British Columbia
