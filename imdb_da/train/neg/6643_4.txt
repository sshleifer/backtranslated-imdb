Terminus Paradise was outstanding, but "Niki ardelean" is too late. We already have enough of this and we want something new. Large directors should not have trouble looking beyond their time, not backwards. Why do people only see Romania as a post-revolutionary country? <br /> <br /> We are just born, not reincarnated, and no one gives more about ancient times. Most people cannot remember or will not remember, and the new generation of film consumers do not understand a bit. This should be the first day of the Romanian movie, not the final song - priveghi! Perhaps younger instructors should take the move.
