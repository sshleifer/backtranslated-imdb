William Shatner in small doses is tolerable. Unfortunately, instead of leaving its character as a minor annoyance, and in the moderately entertaining, it has been seen as capable of enlarging its role and exaggerating it. Like it did in the original Star Trek series. I think I will never understand American humor, which often goes 'over the top' to get the message through. I agree with my feet. I no longer see the show, which is a shame because the rest of the casting was good. It's a shame that Shatner's exaggerated role also affects James Spader's performance. But the majority show how society goes, I think. I do not travel on the same routes. Open
