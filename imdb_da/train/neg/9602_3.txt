Daniella has some problems brewing under her attractive exterior. She begins to lose her thoughts when she finds out about a distant family (which she looks like) that was burned to be a werewolf. She goes a little wild when she beads horny men and slants out their throats. She ultimately finds a man who helps to contain his inner animal, but when others destroy their bliss, she extracts her fierce and hard revenge. 'Werewolf Woman' is not a very good movie, but it constitutes a good folk film. A fun time could have had by having the bad play / dubbing / translation and the very simple cheesiness of the production. But on its own, it moves slowly but has ample nudity to keep you awake.
