Back in my days as a usher "Private Lessons" played on the 4-plex I worked. It was a sleeping hit that sold Friday and Saturday nights for several weeks. I never came around to see it, but saw that it was on cable last weekend, so I decided to give it a shot. What I experienced in the next 90 minutes was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and one that made me very uncomfortable to see. The basic film is a teenage boy desires for her sexy girl (Sylvia Kristel). She also seems to feel an attraction to the boy, but for more scary reasons. So we get scenes from the boy who looks at her dress and her invites him to see. And it goes from there. <br /> <br /> As a teenage boy, Eric Brown must be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. His "scared" reaction to every time Sylvia takes off a piece of clothing or when she touches him is terrible. I didn't even laugh during this unwanted push. <br /> <br /> And let's not get started on the sub-plot of the girl and the driver who is planning to extort money from the child. Let's just say it involves killing a death, burying a body .... I could go on, but it becomes more ridiculous. Gender scenes are the worst I have ever seen. Although Eric Brown was older, he looked, in fact, he looks like a baby. It seems that he has no idea how to kiss a woman (if it did, I might have to think about my criticism of Brown), and it just came too close up for child pornography to be erotic. I have never been so off of a sex scene, even though Miss Kristel is pretty beautiful with and without clothes. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER WARNING ** I should mention the last scene. For me, it's just plain sick, but I can remember the audience cheering as film freezing framed and dissolved in credits. Our hero returns to school and starts flirting with one of the female teachers. He asks her out for dinner, and she gives him a look as if Tom Cruise has just asked her out. She nods affirmatively and he goes away and smiles at the camera in triumph. GIVE ME A BREAK! Yes, I'm sure teachers everywhere would risk everything for a plain-looking teenage kid. <br /> <br /> I will never understand the appeal this movie had in 1982. It was more than nudity because there were lots of teen sex comedies with nudity being bombed at the box office. And to think that the same teens who cheered that movie 22 years ago are now working on business ladders and possibly helping drive that country. It's a scary thought.
