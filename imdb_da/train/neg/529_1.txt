This is undoubtedly the most offensive "chick flick" I've seen in years, if not ever. The printer and characterization are so riddled with stereotypes that the film is forgotten in parody. Before we left the theater an hour and five minutes in this disaster, we were exposed to the following themes: having a baby solves all your problems, "performer types" are miserable fairs, and musicians cannot be good mothers unless they throw their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle. What a waste of a talented cast & some great sets and costumes. When Natasha Richardson told Toni Collette that unless she lives a more ordinary life, she will end up - shaken - "alone!" I felt angry. I can't believe this movie made it into theatrical releases. It's the kind of ticket you expect from the "women's" cable channels that I always pass by when surfing the web. I am a woman and over 35, so I must be part of this movie's target audience, but boy, miss the "evening" goal.
