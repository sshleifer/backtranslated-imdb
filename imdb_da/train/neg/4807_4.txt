"Ambushed" is no ordinary action flick. It is much too bad to be commonplace. A man goes against another with a machine gun flaming. The other man burns a round and traps the man with the greater firepower without so much that a body from the lead height falls down on him. Guess which one is the good guy. You h. Such is "Ambushed" through and through. Not a good action girl, not a good drama, not a good movie, "Ambushed" fails at all levels, with it's cast of B-movie veterans mechanically through the movements almost as if they know they are making a real loser. Not recommended to anyone. <br /> <br />
