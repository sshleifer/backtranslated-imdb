STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> James Dial (Wesley Snipes) hides on his ranch in Montana after failing to catch a notorious terrorist. Then he is approached to the agency again to travel to London to get another one. His goals have been arrested there and under heavy police protection - but they just don't want him to catch their husband - they want him out. Everything goes well, but as the mission is hit, and when a senior police officer, Windsor (Charles Dance) is killed, blame falls on Dial's feet. Hunted as an animal, he takes refuge in a nearby house and turns to a young girl named Emily (Eliza Bennett) who deals with her own problems and becomes his ignorant sidekick as he goes to clear his name and train of whom betrayed him. <br /> <br /> This latest Snipes for DVD escapade came out of nowhere, with minimal disclosure even for such a small amount of time (I can't remember seeing any advertisements or trailers anywhere). With this in mind and after Snipe's story of duff DVD action, this could have been like one that Snoop Dawg would tell you to drop as it is hot. But I felt compelled to give it a try at least. It is not among his worst, but it does not reach anything higher than some of his better standards (Detonator, 7 seconds, says it all right) either. <br /> <br /> This is, at best, mildly exciting, with minimal action, all in the way of a cool dialogue, and snipes are not at best in the lead. Likewise, in a main supporting role, it is clear that Dance has only been shown to the paycheck, and it is generally one that none of the casting should shout for the hills of any of their CVs. <br /> <br /> It says a lot that in the end is the only "contract" that keeps you interested when Snipe's will ends with Sony and with it an end to further subparents EL DVD action movies. **
