Quite predictably silly shows about a man who has killed his wife by cutting her down when he drove and claimed he was black. Why did he still drive a car? Why did he still feel able to drive a car when he killed his wife with one? This question has not happened to the authors. The story then revolves around a psychologist and her failing marriage bound in the failing marriage of the cross-dead blackout driver. An omniscient mother and one-dimensional child are thrown in a good sense, and the whole builds on a predictable breakdown and rushing finale. Are police psychologists so easily taken in? Deadful writing that the actors are doing their best but they are doomed to failure. This is on par with a Harlequin Romance. Don't waste your time watching this unless it's what you are looking for.
