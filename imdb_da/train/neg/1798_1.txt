How can a movie have Ozzy Osbourne and still suck? I just don't understand that. Trick or Treat succeeded. This sucks and likes it. <br /> <br /> Trick or Treat is one of the movies I should warn people about. It is a vomiting inducing cruelty that just asks to be seen so you can feel much worse about yourself. Trick or Treat has no redeeming factors. <br /> <br /> For a heavy metal movie, it doesn't seem to understand what heavy metal is or what it represents. This film manages to get heavy metal to look past and it was in 1986, probably one of the heavy metal's strongest hours. It's quite a feat, though negative. Trick or Treat = so bad that you will be angry with yourself for seeing it. This simple equation hopefully keeps you away from this brainless and ghastly movie.
