There seems to be little in the way of the midfield, where Watch on the Rhine is concerned. One also likes it a lot, welcomes its sincerity, its liberal point of view and fine actors, otherwise detesting its obvious propaganda, mediocre dialogue, cardboard character and general tendency. I fall a lot in the latter category and found the movie and the game - about the European refugees' activities in Washington during wartime - a crushing well-worthy drilling, and even then only intermittent. That the author Lillian Hellman was on the side of the angels is irrelevant. Her plays were written for people who shared her point of view, and she rarely examined ideas that were not already contained by the author and audience, except pointing out how awful the other side is. Even when I find myself in a hundred percent agreement with what she has to say - as in the Rhine - I still can't stand as she says. Her characters are unreal, and while her ear to dialogue shows a particular facility for the way people speak, she has no genuine shine or originality. She really had nothing new to say. I totally agree with the late Mary McCarthy's long-standing abandonment of Hellman's reputation some years ago. For those who believe that the theater is dead or in extremists and longs for the good old days, I call for a look at Watch on the Rhine, just as bad in the way of angels in America, showing only that the theater had a foot in the grave for sixty years ago.
