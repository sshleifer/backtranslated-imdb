I found the documentary titled Fast, Cheap and Out of Control to be a rather interesting documentary. The documentary featured four "mini" documentaries on four interesting men. Each of these men was extremely involved in their work and showed pure love and enjoyment for one's job. The sad part I have to say should be the subjects where these people worked / studied. They were interesting for about five minutes, then became boring and lasted too long. <br /> <br /> The video was filmed in a very creative way. I enjoyed a lot of movie of a thing with a voice, dub over another. It played very well and also coincided with the music.
