Back when Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were a mercurial, warm-hearted, high-powered Hollywood couple, they filmed this (almost) scene-by-scene remake of Steve McQueen-Ali MacGraw's 1972 action thriller on a fleeting twosome. It worked almost for the first time because McQueen was such an important presence on the screen - even stones quiet and tired, you could feel his watch ticking, his cagey magnetism. Baldwin is not in Steve McQueen's league, but he has his charm and is probably a more versatile actor - in which case this is not a showcase of his attributes. Basinger does it well and looks good, but James Woods is artfully hammy in a silly mobster role. A subplot with another couple taken hostage by Baldwin's ex-partner was unbearable in '72 films and playing even worse here. As far as the action scenes are concerned, they are rather old hat, which makes one wonder: Why recover the original? ** from ****
