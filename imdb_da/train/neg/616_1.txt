Let's face it; some llama children who die and have their soul transferred to a scarecrow. It's not going to happen anywhere! OMFG This stupid loser child, who cannot stand up for himself, gets his ass handed over to him by a drunk bastard who scares his mother. As he dies, he looks up at scarecrow and lets his spirit go into scarecrow. The drunk guy covered his death by making it seemingly suicidal and thought he had gone away with it. We later see that he is thrown out of the trailer and later serves another meeting with scarecrow. They had a brief meeting where the drunk calls him a loser, and scarecrow rescued with "getting to know one, losing!" The scarecrow is freaking out of the building, calling him "far-o", and then the poor man rages. We can see how this amazing movie unfolds from it. He continues to kill many people afterwards. He mainly kills those people who gave him a hard time in rl and goes out to kill some random ass people, just for some laughs. No laughs here. He adds a stroke line to every kill. Every time he killed someone, he would make some karate flips and finish it all with one of his signature punchlines. In the case of someone who was hard of hearing, he would say "Here you have an ear of corn!" then push it up in the ass. OR we can actually take an example from the movie! He just finished killing a policeman and was about to kill the only person who ever stood up for him. Her father, the sheriff shouted to the madman to stop, and he said, "Hey, stay awhile!" and threw a dagger threw his chest and stuck him on a tree. At the end of the film he killed two guys and threw in the punchline "Gotta split!" and killed two guys by pushing a scythe into their heads. Wowzors, this movie made me cream my pants so badly. Maybe the next time this guy makes a movie, it won't be gay.
