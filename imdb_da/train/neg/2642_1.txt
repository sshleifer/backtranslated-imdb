Slowly, slowly, slowly ... There is no mystery or excitement in this movie. If you can't figure out who "mole" is in the first ten minutes, you must be brain dead. The secret service must have been too, because it took them the whole movie to put it together. There are no compelling characters in the movie (not movies). The pace of the movie is slow, there is no tension. The hired murderer is an excellent shot unless he is aiming for Michael Douglas than everything he seems to be able to hit is large glass panes. The funniest scene in the movie is when the president's wife says the password at the anti-slime end. It's ridiculously laughable. At least six people left and left the film early. I would have joined them if I wasn't in the middle of the line. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
