Before this movie I had only seen two films by director Andrea Bianchi: the trashy zombie flick Le Notti del Terrore (1981), famous among horror fans for its unforgettable performance from the male child Peter Bark, and the cozy blurry giallo strip Nude To your killer. Neither movie was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema, but both were entertaining in their own special way (and the fact that they had lots of fun and nudity didn't hurt). The massacre, however, is dull, boring, dull, despite a little splatter and the odd spot of gratuitous just meat. The story of a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror movie resides during their shooting, is confusing and oh-so boring: when the blood does not flow and the skin is not on display, the film is a real struggle to go through (it took me four attempts to finish), with endless scenes of irregular characters that connect with each other and make very little of note. The only interesting place in the movie is that its producer, Lucio Fulci, used several of his death scenes to paddle out his mega-gory movie Cat In The Brain (AKA Nightmare Concert). And if you have already seen that movie, there is very little reason to bother with the massacre.
