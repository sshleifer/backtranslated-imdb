This is one of the movies that you and a bunch of friends sit around drinking beer, eating pizza and laughing. Unfortunately for me, I found myself watching this one alone. My friends and I rented a large block of movies and never came around to watch this one. It was due back and I figured it was a waste not to see it. So I did, and I was impressed by how horrible this movie is. <br /> <br /> Now, I love bad movies quite a bit, and I would probably have liked this if the "hero" wasn't so utterly disgusting. Throughout the film, I hoped he would put that stupid sword down and let someone kill him! He does very little heroic thing in the movie. He is a carnal, disgusting, stupid thing. He has less redeeming qualities than the bad guys do. And what about all the naked chickens? I mean, I love naked chickens as much as the next guy, but this movie went a bit overboard in that section. <br /> <br /> Well, anyway, if you love bad movies and can stand a disgusting "hero" then I'm sure you like this hype of a movie.
