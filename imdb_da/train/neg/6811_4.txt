When I first saw this movie in cinema 11 years ago, I loved it. I still think the director and the movies are great, just like the music. But it's really the script that over time began to bother me more and more. I find Emma Thompson writing self-esteem and cheating on the original book; She has reduced Marianne to a side character, another enemy to her too old, too heavy Elinor - she in the movie gets many kinds of "focus moments", and often they seem to be there just to show Thompson himself. <br /> <br /> I understand her cutting off several letters from the book, but leaving one scene where Willoughby in the book is redeemed? For anyone who red and appreciated the book long before the film, it is always difficult to digest. As for the actors, I love Kate Winslet as Marianne. She does not get the best script in the world to work with, but she still gracefully pulls it without much sentimentality. Alan Rickman is great, maybe a little old, but he plays the role beautifully. And Elizabeth Spriggs, she's absolutely amazing as always.
