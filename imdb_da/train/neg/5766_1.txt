This was considered to be the flagship work in the open source community, something that would stand up and scream at the world media to notice, as we are not stuck in the marketing trap with our ability to produce fine work with open source tools. After the basic version download (die hard fan here on a dial-up modem) eventually I hit my first snag. Media Player, Mplayer Classic & winamp couldn't open it on my xp box, and then Totem, xine & kaffine couldn't open it on my whiz server. Mplayer managed to run it flawlessly. Will be hard to spread the word about if normal users cannot open it themselves ... <br /> <br /> The Film. Beautiful soundtrack, great lighting, masterful camera work and flawless structuring. Everything looked right. And then the two protagonists moved ... and talked ... And the movie died for me. Everything besides lip synchronization and the actual animation of the two main characters (except Proog in the dance scene) looked fluid and completely alive. The two main characters were animated so badly that I sometimes wondered if there are any games on the market at the moment with cut-outs that cause less realism than this. <br /> <br /> Any frame in the movie is amazing .. like a frame, and it's good if none of the actors move. I'm so glad I didn't recommend this to anyone. I would ruin my reputation. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the final fantasy had a more follow-up and cleverly conceived plot. <br /> <br /> This movie would get 10 stars if it wasn't for tragedy sitting right there on the screen.
