Regardless of this, the subject is an amateur, an exhibition movie - or an effort on one - which is as interesting and bold as a mood high school student's composition book full of death sentence "poetry". For sure, it will disturb viewers who are hell-bent on being disturbed, but success can be attributed to themselves, not to the director. To really get under a person's skin requires sensitivity, discipline, technique and talent as well as eye and ear. The movie contains an evocative image that appears as a still image (and is also used in the video box), but without development leading up to or away from it. If the director had noticed, he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie - that is, a movie.
