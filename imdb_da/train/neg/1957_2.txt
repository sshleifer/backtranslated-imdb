I enjoy this movie most of the time, but I continued to notice that I was watching a children's movie. I honestly think someone wrote a pg script and then decided to add in some blood, nudity and language while they were filming. It was a big disappointment. There are those who believe in the children's magic found in films such as "babe" or "angels in the field" that defeat the evil tooth. The parents end up believing in their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and utilize this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth foot. when I bought this movie, I thought it would be a b-movie response to the terrible darkness falling; Somehow manage to make a better movie with 1/4 of the money, but they don't. They made a worse movie and would probably lose the same share of money lost in the dark.
