This early John Wayne Lone Star Western has a bit more to go for than the upscale oat Wayne made for Lone Star until then. For one, it has its old friend Paul Fix in it; Fix, be a much better actor, so the standard Lone Star villain brings a very necessary professionalism to the surroundings instead of the usual hesitant line-readings often provided in these oaters. The reason for the mistake, release and murder is just as tired and perfect as you would expect to be in a low budget Western 1930s, but Wayne is the straining good look, easier charm and way of a line going far to make this more enjoyable. Plump, balding Eddy Chandler is not entirely credible as Wayne's womanizing "partner" and there is an ongoing gag about something that happens when Chandler and Wayne are entering a fist fight that gets tedious. On the other hand, Waynes love interest of no one other than Mary Kornman, the little "Mary" from the early "Little Rascals" fame. She is an adult 20-year-old now, blonde and sweet as a button. Most of Wayne's leading ladies in these Lone Star / Monogram "Bs" were pretty bland and colorless, but Mary is perky, sweet and yes sexy. There is a scene in the shop where she works, where Wayne asks her to get him a bottle of "nerve tonic" that happens to be on the top shelf, so she has to get a ladder and climb to the top shelf. Wayne sucks her a little backwards as she walks up the stairs, then again when she comes down, then again a few minutes later when he asks her to climb up and get him another bottle, it is surprisingly quiet for a movie made In 1935, Wayne does no try to hide the fact that he is definitely checking her ass. Anyway, it's an interesting little "B", not big, but not as choppy and random as many of his LoneStar productions of the time. The final firearm is not handled so well, and Chandler gets a little annoying after a while, but overall it is worth seeing if you can only see a cute and sexy Mary Kornman.
