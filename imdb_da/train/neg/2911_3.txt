This movie is overblown, predictable, pretentious and hollow in its core. The settings are faithful to the era, but self-conscious in their magnification at prolonged exposure. The lingering over artifacts stops the action and complains almost as much as the empty dialogue. Tom Hanks seems to be sleepwalking much like Bruce Willis did in Hart's War. Tom, you can't give depth to a character just by making your face shiny! The content did not justify the histrionic act of Paul Newman. This is a dud wrapped in a nuclear bomb house.
