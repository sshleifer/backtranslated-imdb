Sometimes a movie is so horrible, it has a devastating effect on your morals. You really start asking yourself, what does it mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low? Can they honestly expect us to endure these many clich√©s and still be entertained? <br /> <br /> Of course, it's still a Hollywood pillar that makes GUN the great character, plot device and source of all conflict and resolution in movies. Characters need a gun. Gets a gun. Can't do it because he has a gun. Puts his gun down first. OH MY GOD What should we do? He has a gun! He waves it around and acts more viciously than real people ever do. He pushes it in the face of others for 90 minutes and calls questions. The hallmark of any conclusion will be the comforting sound of police sirens. <br /> <br /> Making such a tired, hackneyed formal work is a real challenge again; a movie must be very clever and well done. This one is neither. It has no life and no personality, and it will suck those components from you. It will make you feel WORSE about living in the time and space you do. Really who needs it? So yes, I say it: I think it may be the worst movie I've ever seen. Anyone who was involved in making this sub-mediocre soul killing garbage should be publicly embarrassed by the disobedience they have done to all of us.
