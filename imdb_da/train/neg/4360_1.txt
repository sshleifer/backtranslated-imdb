Let me first say that I had to think a lot about writing a comment on this movie. The best review for this kind of cinema can just be the silence. Films addressed to housewives and to grandmothers. This film tries to look "real" and the characters must be assumed "real people". An Italian could never believe that the characters could be "right": they are just "low profile" stereotypes. It gives a very spoiled vision of what life is like in the Italian landscape. The reason is weak (plot? What plot?) And humor does not laugh any older than 12.
