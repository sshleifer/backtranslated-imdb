Even the first 10 minutes of this movie were terrible. It's hard to believe anyone other than John Cusack would have put money into it. With a series of anti-military / anti-war films already destroyed at the box office, it is almost unthinkable that any study of any kind would be associated with this script. <br /> <br /> Initially, it may have seemed a kind of politically motivated derivative of Grosse Point Blank with Akroyd and Cusack (s) again. But only about 90 seconds in the film it becomes obvious that this is a talented attempt at DR STRANGELOVE. <br /> <br /> I liked so many Cusacks movies that I thought I'd risk seeing the DVD of this one. I have to say that I don't know if Cusack is sensible enough to even see another feature that stares him back unless someone else can guarantee it. Cusack seems to be so irreparably damaged by his hatred for George Bush and the Iraq war that he is willing to commit career suicide. Tom Cruise was never close to being so far away. Not even close.
