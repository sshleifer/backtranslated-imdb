After seeing the poster from the movie Smother, I knew I was living one of the intolerable movie experiences that made me take my eyes off. But I felt a little optimism because the movie had a solid throw that I thought it would save the movie. Unfortunately, this has not happened. Mom is a horrible movie, but it's not execrable.That's the best I can say about it. <br /> <br /> The play from Smother (written by the same guys from license to Wednesday, something that explains that they have anything but talent for writing movies) is filled with cheap and predictable humor. Very hard, I didn't even laugh when I first look at this movie. Moreover, the solid cast I mentioned earlier is absolutely wasted. After the large number of garbage she's been involved in (like the monumentally cruel and executable because I said it), some people may think that Diane Keaton's career goes out. But it is impossible for me to forget the excellent performances she has brought in previo for decades on films such as Annie Hall or Baby Boom. At Smother she makes her best effort with her performance, but her character is so terribly written that she can't do anything about it. Dax Shepard has left me a good impression with his solid notions on the movies Baby Mama and Idiocracy.However he does what he can with his character.Mike White also makes a good effort but he does not reach too far away.He is a very talented scriptwriter (as he has shown on films such as The Good Girl and the School of Rock), so I would have liked him to be one of the actors of this movie, rather than just acting on it. Liv Tyler suffers from the same situation for all the aforementioned actors: being wasted. <br /> <br /> The worst mistake from Smother is to be completely boring and unfunny. Its manuscript is no more than a collection of forced scenes and situations we've seen at sit-coms.Stay far away from this crappy comedy .
