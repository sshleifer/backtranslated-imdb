I saw this director's "Woman On the Beach" and couldn't understand the good of good reviews. This movie is much like the one, two people caught in a relationship with very little dynamic and even less interest in someone else. Just like his other films, you have to listen to vacuum dialogue, wade through very little, and become enchanted with signed, rather uninteresting characters. If you feel like you like this movie, don't let my review stop you. I like minimalism in movies, but I feel that Tsai Ming-Liang's movies are far better. He has a pretty amazing actor in Lee Kang-Sheng in his films. There is nothing here. I wish I liked it, but I don't. Oh yes.
