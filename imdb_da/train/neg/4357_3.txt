A group of friends come face to face with a family of hideous cannibals while playing on the beautiful German landscape. <br /> <br /> The concept of "mutant cannibal family" is almost as old as the hills that the inbred freaks often call home, so any director trying to revive the genre must come up with something beautiful especially for to impress. With Barricade, Timo Rose tries to give the well-established routine a teutonic twist by transplanting the action to the Black Forest and giving it the German low-budget splatter treatment. The result is a very bloody but completely unoriginal effort that is made almost impenetrable thanks to some terrible director decisions, especially the uninterrupted use of fancy filters and annoying editing methods. Had Timo Rose opted not to take advantage of every nafftrick that his editing software offered him, Barricade could have been a reasonably entertaining gore party: his inexperienced cast makes it reasonably good; the bloody effects are appropriate gastric flow; And there are one or two scary and even some well thought out scary moments. All of this, however, is completely destroyed by the horrible camera work, choppy editing and overwhelming visual gimmickry blocking used to give the film the distressed look that is so inexplicably popular with today's filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I give Barricade 3 out of 10 exclusively to the outlandish gore, which includes a sophisticated scene where a guy is forced to drink acid, lots of unpleasant wounds caused by a variety of sharp tools, and some pretty decent shotgun damage.
