What is this ? A low budget sex comedy? Yet it describes the perfect people in Spain. They could come up with a better idea, I think they do this kind of movie since the 60s ... and people like them! This is neither a teenage comedy nor a family one (you can't let your 12 year old see 2 guys in bed kissing, he'll never go to Spain). This should be judged as "R" because only people 35+ seem to laugh: S I'm really disappointed, maybe I don't like homosexuals (which is a very important part of the movie). <br /> <br /> Foreign humor is horrible in movies (except Kusturica), stick to making dramas! If you want a new comedy, try Talladega Nights
