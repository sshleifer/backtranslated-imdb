There is something sad to see someone who is so good at doing something, trying to do something very different ... and ending up being mediocre. I thought about Jordan playing baseball, but the same goes for Steve Martin. <br /> <br /> This movie is reasonably well-groomed and targeted, but the script is a stinker. Martin did a good job of adapting a classic story to a "Roxanne" comedy, but this effort to bring a Victorian drama to the modern scene tastes right into a wall of insecurity. If you want to see an old story updated with some style, best to rent "Great Expectations".
