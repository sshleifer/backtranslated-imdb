Set up and pulled out when a kidney stone turned its merry way through my hereditary urinary tract, with absolutely nothing better to do than let the painkiller flow into half-madness, I happened to catch this movie on cable. I don't want anyone to think I paid to see it in a movie theater, or rented it, or ?? heaven forgiving! ?? that I saw it right. <br /> <br /> After playing this sensationally horrific video game and defying the condemned rooms and terrible passages in the house, Wagon (Type 27), The Hanged Man (Type 041) and Other Impossible Sentinels are fighting my curiosity was piqued on how the game would transfer to the movie screen. <br /> <br /> It doesn't. <br /> <br /> The banal plot revolves around a group of "crazy kids" ?? a la Scooby Doo ?? participate in a remote island for a world-famous "rave" ?? no matter what it is. (You kids today with your hula-hoops and your mini-skirts and your Pat Boone ??) After grabbing a boat captain thousands in cash to ferry them there (a stupidity that asks his own rhetoric network), they find " rave "deserted. <br /> <br /> Passing mentor is made of a "house" ?? presumably the titular House Of The Dead ?? But most of the action takes place on fake outdoor sets and other locations separated from any aspect of haunted residence. A fallen camcorder acts as a flashback filler that shows the island in the shirt of a ?? party?! Is that all? Oh, so this "rave" thingy is just a "party"? In the great tradition of reviving "used cars" like "pre-owned" or "shell shock" as "post-traumatic stress disorder", is the word "party" now too square for you with drugs, implanted, metrosexual jagoffs? <br /> <br /> It's learned that the party was broken up by raging zombies. Intelligent thought stops here? <br /> <br /> I don't think the pinheads who call themselves scriptwriters and directors understand mythos behind zombie re-animation. Zombies Can't Die? they are already UN-DEAD. They do not bleed, they know no pain. Unless their bodies are completely destroyed, they will continue to be animated. It is at least my Jamaican witch-priest who tells me. <br /> <br /> This means that a .45 shot in their "hearts" will not stop them, even a machete to the torso. And a shotgun blast to the chest certainly won't produce gouts of blood. At least in the video game's logic, the slider pumps so many rounds into each monster that it is completely decimated, leaving a time-lapse that cannot re-create itself. <br /> <br /> But every actor-oblique model becomes their Matrix circular camera moment, killing zombies on all fronts with single balls and karate chops for the sternum. Seriously, these zombies are more ineffective than the Storm Troops of "Return Of The Jedi" who are knocked out when Ewoks speaks them. <br /> <br /> I assume that movie author Mark Altman has written non-even -shabby "Free Enterprise", felt compelled to insert a Captain Kirk reference in the character of Jurgen Prochnow, who must have used for milk money desperate to have succumbed to appear in this aromatic fungus. There is also a reference to Prochnow's first role in the magnificent "Das Boot" when one of the untrained B actors mentions that he "looks like a submarine captain". "I wonder how many of the film's target audience of squamous pigs picked up on any of the clear references to other movies that, when Prochnow declares," Say hello to my little friend "presenting his machine gun moment. /> < br /> The purpose of a demographic that is not intended to understand the sisypan futility of the video game concept (ie the game ends when you die - you can't win), it is only a slasher movie for the mindless and mindless That is why everyone dies with time, with the exception of a heterosexual couple of attractive white people. <br /> <br /> A better need for this movie's sharp but abused budget could have been to send the cast through the Acting School, though Ona Grauer's left breast did a good job, like her right breast and the dormant scenes: priceless! I especially liked the last scene with Ona trying to act as if she was stabbed but looks like she's just eaten ice cream too fast. <br /> <br /> Trying to do some more conformation with my time, I pulled out my digitally restored 35th anniversary, special edition, widescreen anamorphic DVD of "manos: the fate of fate". Oh yes! ?? drugs were appropriately brain-numbing - now was there any quality film production? <br /> <br /> (Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)
