The good thing about this is at least fresh: Almost no films about dance music and the club scene (if it is made) hit the cinemas. And it also radiates a lot of energy from the music for Ibiza's decor. <br /> <br /> But the biggest problem is that it can't decide what it will be. Although it is definitely a mockumentary in the line of This is Spinal Tap, decision makers also discovered that they would not want to play copycat. However, it fails grossly on the jokes because it is not very well written and most characters are underdeveloped. And it has no bow in its script and controls to make it 90 minutes, so why not edit it down to 75? The production department and the cinematography still try to save the day (eg Paul's home). In a strange and unexpected way. It's completely gone. Pete Tong works much better as a simple drama in almost Nostalgia. The scenarios with Beatriz Batarda in particular offer some plays. Conclusion: It's a mess, it entails something at a basic level, but you better spend one night in your favorite club.
