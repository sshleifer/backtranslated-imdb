I got this DVD from a friend who got it from another (and it goes on enough.) Even the cover of the DVD looks cheap, just like the whole movie. Shots and fist battles with delayed sound effects, some of the worst actors I've seen in my life, a very simple plot that made me laugh "until my stomach is hurt! With very few financial resources, I have to admit it so professionally Seen as a movie, one of the 13 in a dozen wannabe gangsta flicks that no one is waiting for, so: if you are tired and want a good laugh, watch this movie, if not, throw it out by the window.
