I have "guts" to inform you to stay away from `Dahmer ', the biographical film based on the real story of the grotesque serial killer. `Dahmer 'strays more in relation to the mentality of his focused subject. Jeffrey Dahmer, who murdered over 15 young males and ate some of their body parts, was probably the most sinister serial killer in our generation. But the real sick individuals are the filmmakers of this horrible play that should have had their heads examined before they decided to green this horrible "dahm" project. It is not an easy movie to digest, although Jeffrey could easily digest it with some passionate `brainsadillas' appetizers or even some real life` Mr. Potato skin '. * Error
