Jet Li is one of the best fighters in the world. He has been for over 20 years and he puts others in the genre to shame. While he is big in Asia, he is almost unknown here in the United States. <br /> <br /> Black Mask must be a breakout movie for him, but it fails terribly. First of all, it is baptized. Though it may have camp value (duplication is not even close and it is flat in tone), it seems inappropriate for the regular movie viewer. Secondly, the director of this movie, Daniel Lee, does a terrible job. He cuts scenes so quickly, sometimes you don't know what's going on. Other times, the camera shakes and wobbles. Fans watch the Jet Lis movie for the amazing martial arts. The director is editing the scenes so quickly that you don't even know who is half the time! Other times, a scene remains hanging (ie, Li begins to cut a hole in a jeep's floor while the badguys arm their weapons, two seconds later, both Li and love interests are already under the car!) Other scenes are so unlikely that they cross over to be absolutely ridiculous (killing cd-rom? just give him throwing stars !!!!). Li, needs a director who is less likely to cut machine gun and more to create a cinematic mise-a-scene. The added rap / techno music goes from being okay to intrusive. The plot has options, but is all destroyed by cartoon-like characters who disregard any credibility that this film aspires to. And should we really believe that love interest would not recognize Simon because he has a half mask on it? Wouldn't the hair, lower jaw or voice give it away? <br /> <br /> To watch a Jet Li movie, try Iron Monkey or his classic Shaolin Temple. This inconsistent mess is a complete waste of time ..... 2/10
