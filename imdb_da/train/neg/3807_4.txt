Don't forget me, I'm a big fan of many of Woody's films, of course his late 70's masterpieces (Annie Hall, Interiors, Manhattan) and most of his late 80s / 90s dramas (Hannah, crimes and abusers, men and Wives) In fact I even liked some of his latest bets (Melinda, Anything, Small Time Crooks), but it was scary, though it couldn't be any worse than last year's Match Point, but how wrong I was. <br /> <br /> It was stupidly plotted - basically a cross between Match Point, Manhattan Murder Mystery and Small Time Crooks, with all the jokes being taken out - Woody also seems to be out and slipping it most of his lines and "hilarious" catchphrases "I mean with all due respect ..." over and over again until the mix of everything gets too much for the bar. <br /> <br /> I know most actors buy up to work with him, but at least they should read the script first - Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman are so much better than this - and Woody should really take one more behind the camera's role in the future if he has any meaning about 20 miles behind. <br /> <br /> It wouldn't be so tragic if we didn't have so many good Woody movies to compare this to - but it is clear that his best days are behind him and judging by this effort, Woody Call it a day before he becomes an industry joke. embarrassingly bad
