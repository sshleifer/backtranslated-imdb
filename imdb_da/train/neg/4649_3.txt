A 1957 (yes it's the right date) J. Arthur Rank production with James Robertson Justice, Margaret Rutherford, Wilfred Hyde White; it must be a smash comedy, right? Oh, it's just awful. It's a gag movie: Watching people be shocked at the sight of a little alligator. Music is thrown in, most inappropriate and forgettably. Jeannie Carson is a lively dancer and competent singer. But what is she doing in this movie? Diana Dors is also here and delivers oh-so-bold images for use in the previews. Her acting is not bad, but she is in the movie to teach someone. Now you have to do something beside the moan under this movie. The movie is being sold on VHS now by people on e-Bay. Save yourself the expense and waste of time. A comedy without a laugh. A musical without a memorable song or dance.
