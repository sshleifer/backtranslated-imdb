Had the original casting idea been kept (hunting Rutger, not Ice-T), this movie could have worked. Unfortunately, racism had to enter the picture (literally) and destroy it. The predominantly black production staff could not let the antagonist be black, so they switched Rutger and Ice-Ts's roles. This was just the start of the downward spiral of this movie. Ernest Dickerson's newsroom approach to 'directing' only confirmed that this was another job-creating job creation. Master shot, close up, close up. Gads, 'Who's Line, is it anyway' even uses more creative camera work. Eric's rewrite of 'The Dangerous Game' is at least an attempt to modernize the classic narrative, but fails to give us any motivation for why the characters do this. We never get other reasons than "no one will miss these people," why the leader (rewritten as Rutger) does these things. Except for John McGinley's heartfelt performance and a fair work by Charles Dutton, don't bother with this. A little trivia that was a really intoxicating accident during the shooting of the injured F.Murray Abraham, and resulted in the death of the drunk young driver who caused the accident.
