Boy oh boy oh golly gee, <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing in the movie was the hilariousness of the bluescreen effects used to create mother's "invisibility". They looked like they were shot at cheap video, and it looks totally unreal and not even in a good way where it is so much fun to end up loving the movie ... I did not end up loving this movie. Tests on "steadicam" shoots were also very pathetic. I mean, hey, if they had a low budget, that's fine. You can still make a great movie with a low budget. But a bad movie and low budget and effects. It gives a bad combination. In this case, such a convicted combo created the craptastic film "Invisible Mom." If you have children and your children have no taste, they may be awake throughout this one.
