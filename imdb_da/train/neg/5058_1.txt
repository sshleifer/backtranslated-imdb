(When will I ever learn?) The ecstatic reviewer at the NPR made me believe that this turkey was another Citizen Kane. Allow me to vent my spleen ... <br /> <br /> I will admit: The setting, presumably New York City, has never been so pretty ugly and unpleasant. I recall that the 70s were a bad decade for men's fashion and cars. And all smoking! If the plan was that the cheaper signs succeeded. <br /> <br /> For a movie to work (at least in my simple discretion) there must be at least one sympathetic character. Only Ned Beaty came close and I couldn't wait for him to finish Nicky. If a crooked shot had hit Mikey, yes, it might have caused a move of indifference. <br /> <br /> I can't remember when I refused a movie so strongly. I suppose I'm a rube that doesn't dig "art" flicks. Oh yes.
