The news of hearing clean-cut Jay Leno spout four letters is the only memorable aspect of this formal mismatched police-partner caper. In COLLISION COURSE, the pelican employee is kept up with the late Pat Morita to track a stolen prototype turbocharger (think car loves Leno played a hand in the plot?). The two leaders are trying hard, they really do, but Leno's no actor and Morita's fish-out-of-water routine is getting old. The film carries a bit of cheesy '80s appeal, but its worthy moments are becoming increasingly scarce as it fills its long 100 minute run time. Fans of Leno's significant comic talents will feel let down; everyone else will just get bored.
