I was previously unaware that Devry University in the early 1990s (or was it ITT Tech?) Added Film to its wonderful repertoire of technical education. Now, this film must have been the product of the class's valedictorian. My friend and I rented the original 1980 Boogeyman on my Netflix and this movie was on the back of the DVD. Don't waste your time with this movie. Terrible awful horrible. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker adds 2 main characters, a woman and her therapist. The woman has had dreams of Boogeyman and his victim from the first movie. Over 50% of this movie is stocked from the original movie. The rest of the movie is the protagonist who has the bad dreams while her therapist drones on a narrator. These scenes are pushed through a filter, so the thick characters light up. They would make Angela Lansbury look 25 years old. So to recreate, horrible. Don't watch this movie.
