It simply should not have been done. It is predictable and clich√©. The on-screen chemistry that made the first "My Girl" so captivating is nowhere to be found here, and the play as a whole is stalked and forced. The writing also leaves much to be desired, some of the "memorable" lines like "earpeircing a barbaric custom" are just shocking. Where "my girl" provoked a true sense of sadness and some really fun moments that so many followers "My Girl 2" are trying to recreate these emotions generated by the audience and fail miserably. Perhaps I find it difficult to film because of the size of the first, but frankly, it offends the quality of the original with the kind of drive this episode serves. It is safe to get close to the "Mask's Son" as being one of the worst sequels of all time. In both cases, the old saying is right; "If it's not the ink, don't fix it."
