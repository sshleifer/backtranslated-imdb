I agree with the last reviewer that this film had horrible action. Yes, there were a lot of doings and some nudity. But it was overshadowed by a slow, meaningless plot and stupid end. Where should it be filmed anyway: a Canadian chinatown or Hong Kong? Hostel was a much better movie and I would recommend seeing it instead. One technical annoyance I had with the DVD is that if you close the Spanish subtitles, they will return after a few scenes and then go back to the main menu and turn them off again. Don't waste your time on the deleted scenes because there is no sound and it just looks like tourist photos.
