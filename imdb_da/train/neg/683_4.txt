Lulu (Louise Brooks) works as a typist and lacks something in her life. She goes into a Miss-French competition against wishes from her boyfriend Andre (Georges Charlia) and she wins. She goes for the Miss Europe title, which leaves her girlfriend behind. She wins again, but returns to others because he has asked her to. Once back together, her life becomes everyday again so one night she writes a note to him and leaves to experience the fame that awaits her as Miss Europe. Others follow her ..... <br /> <br /> This movie is a silent movie with a piano music track throughout. It's also sped-up, so everything looks fast. Limited dialogue has been added afterwards and it is very false. Castings are in order to remember that it is a silent movie. The best part of the movie comes at the end, but the story goes a little too long. After seeing this, I'm not quite sure what the big deal was about Louise Brook's appearance - she has a terrible hairstyle that makes her face look greasy. I don't have to see it again.
