As the summary says, you've just made the most ignorant comment I've ever heard of an RPG. You seriously thought they were gay? Are you retarded? If you went to save your best friend and someone decides out of the goodness of his heart to help you, then you are in a serious debt to that man. Lavitz was a good person and each time they helped each other made them closer as friends. They weren't gay lovers like your bitch. And to tell you the game is set in a medieval period. Then, women only prepared food while the men fought. Do you even know your story? Do you know how long it took for women to be accepted into the army today? This game contains a lot of realism, though your too scary is, of course, catching it, and you really have to spit some solid evidence instead of ignorant assumptions based on your misguided action to interpret the story.
