Something very strange happens when you talk about Global Warming: science goes out of the window, and "faith" and "consensus" become the topic of discussion. It is because of the fact that I give a wrong sign to Al Gore's documentary. <br /> <br /> Instead of promoting intelligent discussion, he held the debate level with "faith" and "consensus". <br /> <br /> Of course, when you try to sell the world to spend thousands of dollars to "stop global warming," it may be a problem to tell the scientific truth: we don't know where much of the current warming caused by humans. Perhaps none of it, maybe some of it, or maybe it has over-ceded the next ice age and we have really lucky not to have cooked the planet. But the fact is, we don't know it. <br /> <br /> so we are asked to "believe" in "consensus". Never mind that any scientist who differs from "consensus" is excluded. Never mind that scientific research is about deviating from consensus. Einstein did not believe in consensus, nor did Copernicus or Galileo. <br /> <br /> So why so much passion is placed on the great scientists who would advance the field by asking the hard questions? If global warming is so invincible, a few people who test this theory cannot be so threatening. What happens here? It was the movie I hoped Al Gore would have made. Instead, he chose to support his support with the "faithful" true "believers". <br /> <br /> Sad, really.
