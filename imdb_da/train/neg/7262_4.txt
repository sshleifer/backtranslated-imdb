There are some really amazing ideas in this violent movie that, if it was executed clearly, could have elevated it from spaghetti-western blend to something special. Unfortunately, a TOWN CALLED HELL is one of the worst edited movies imaginable! Scenes start and end suddenly, characters are left for long stretches, the actors' performances (and accents) are rather inconsistent, etc. Robert Shaw is a Mexican (!) Revolutionary who, after taking part in the extermination of a village, remains priest (!) .. Ten years later, the village is led by "Mayor" Telly Salavas. Stella Stevens is going to seek revenge on the man who killed his husband. Colonel Martin Landau arrives looking for Shaw. They all shout a lot, and they all shoot a lot. Fernando Rey is also in it (like a blind man). The performances are not bad, but they are very uneven. Savalas has an accent sometimes, like Landau (there is really lattice here). Shaw and Rey prove they're not capable of really embarrassing themselves, and Stevens looks pretty foxy (if it's a little out of place among the sweaty rubbish).
