This movie, apparently a thriller, had about five subplots that evolved at the same time into the climax at the end, but it ended up more like a gab. The writing was thin, the pace was slow and uneven and the signs were dull. George Clooney looks as if he is going into a gym, Matt Damon put it up and the others seemed to read their lines from a teleprompter. The worst part of this movie was that it was carefully designed to be politically correct and then it ended up saying nothing at all about big business, oil and the Middle East. I've seen documentaries give more excitement. See it only if there is nothing else to do.
