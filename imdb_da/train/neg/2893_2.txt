What should this be? A remake of Fisher King? Why are we concerned about Sandler's character? What a slow, boring, boring, as-giving-a-fucking-about-these-people movie !!! Just simply painful to sit through, I knocked it off before it was over. It is so obvious that Cheadle needs help as much as Sandler; As I said, can you say "Fisher King"? And how does this psychotic character work in his daily life? We should not think so deeply, I think. Why does Cheadle continue to give Sandler a chance to become violent to him? If they were such good friends, how did they break apart? If Cheadle is so in control, why is he continuing to seek advice on shrinking on the street? We are never told. Therefore, the Fisher King was a better movie on so many levels and why it just sucks. Almost 8 out of 10 average scores? I do not agree. Not at all. Even the top films are lucky to get such a high average rating, and this crap doesn't deserve to be in the same universe with them.
