Having seen Versus earlier, I had great hopes for Alive. The description of the film on the back of the DVD jacket was promising. Live didn't deliver. VERY slow development. Lots of potential with cast and cool pictures. The prerequisite was exciting, but the payout did not compensate for the build-up. Could have done so much more at the end. Most of the movie is just "sitting around". To put it plainly, three of us were amped to sit and watch this movie and with the 50 minute field we struggled to make it to the end. It really needed more shock elements. If you're looking for the Ichi Killer or Versus type battles, save yourself $ and lots of disappointment.
