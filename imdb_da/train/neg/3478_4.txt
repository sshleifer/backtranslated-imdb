Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) is determined not to be lonely this Christmas. Not only is Drew a millionaire; but also unpleasant and guilty of being very grandiose. Drew goes back to home, he grew up and offers the family who lives there, $ 250,000 to be his "family" through Christmas. Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) is reluctant, but is greedy enough to take Drew's offer. Christine Valco (Catherine O'Hara) has little to say in the matter, but learns to have Drew around ... not as much with Alicia (Christina Applegate), but it also has room for change. Drew's boyfriend Missy (Jennifer Morrison) tracks down Drew and wants her people to meet her family. Real fun is in the store as a happy Noel becomes a fun dysfunctional nightmare. Other cast members: Josh Zuckerman, Bill Macy, David Selby and Stephanie Faracy. Affleck is comical, though weird.
