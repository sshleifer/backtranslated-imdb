I wasted 5.75 to see this crappy movie, so I just want to know a few things: <br /> <br /> What was the dog's point being split in half at the start of the movie, the disease had nothing to do to be split in half. <br /> <br /> What was supposed to pull Karen into the shed, she had already completely infected her room, they could just have locked her in there, where she would have been safer. Why would Hermit run around the woods and ask strangers to help him as he might just have asked his family, the caretaker, to take him to the hospital? Why didn't it? t any of the characters disturbing to enter the city for help when things started to get bad, are they all really so lazy? Although Paul was threatened by the shotgun guy to look at his wife, Paul could just have sent Jeff or Bert back to the house to ask for help. the girl he loves is getting worse. <br /> <br /> Why did Jeff return to the cottage when he left when everyone else got infected, if he was so big to leave in the first place, wouldn't he just go home? <br /> <br /> If the police went to all the trouble picking up the kids and burning them at the fire pit, why did they throw Paul halfway in the river, it wasn't even necessary for the plot because the water was already polluted. <br /> <br /> Who makes lemonade out of river water that crap has dirt leaves and bugs in it. Why couldn't the two kids just use the tap, it was also polluted so the stupid end would still work.
