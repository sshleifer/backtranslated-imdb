Oh god, what a horrible, horrible movie. Supposed to be a comment on the state of society, it is just a reflection of the worst worst in reality TV. Interstitials hosted by Jason Jones and Don McKellar are the most unpleasant part written in a tone that is supposed to be reflexive and insightful. These moments are rather numb when talking to the camera with dialogue written by a person with love for abusive, discouraging speech that pushes the movie's "meaning" into the viewer's neck. <br /> <br /> Also, a point to wild filmers: Long take and quiet scenes are not uniform. Also, extreme angles or logic radiate to the point of absurdity. <br /> <br /> If anyone out there is interested in watching this movie, don't do it. Seriously. Please. You have better things to do.
