When Stanwyck's spouse is murdered on the eve of their wedding, she goes back to a mountain hut where she escapes (kind of) a rock and is rescued by wealthy lawyer Morgan. Morgan falls in love with her, leading to a certain one-sided marriage spent on a large property in Chicago (which seems to be surrounded by mountains!). Stanwyck is tempted to throw Cortez, but turns to Morgan in a very subdued and inconsistent resolution of history. <br /> <br /> This movie has a great cast (Morgan is especially one of my favorites) and a great director, but the manuscript is meandering and often seems meaningless. I was so ready to enjoy this movie, but I was finally disappointed. Worth looking at the cast, and it's good for anyone who likes the 1930s movies.
