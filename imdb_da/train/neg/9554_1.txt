This is the worst, and I mean the worst computer-based movie I've ever seen. The whole plot is completely convincing and full of stupidity. <br /> <br /> I mean ... The guy in this movie can actually talk to the computer as a real person. Now you probably think this should be a super-chilled high-tech computer, that's it, but it also does with other very bad and weak computers that don't even have a graphical interface. <br /> <br /> And the main idea how to overload the "super" computer by connecting it via computer games online is really stupid. My cell phone will shut down the lighting to conserve energy, but apparently, this ingenious computer cannot decide whether to use its resources to deal with national security threats or to load computer games. There are also some other bad things about it, but I just don't have time for it. <br /> <br /> I just can't believe anyone could actually record movies stupid like this
