OK, I'm not Japanese. I know a little bit about Japanese culture and a little less about Japanese pop culture. Apart from that, I'm Spanish, I eat paella and I like black humor. <br /> <br /> Well, with that point I can comment on the movie: I have no idea how comfortable it is for Japanese audiences, Mamoru Oshii is quite a good director - despite the all too pedantic postmodern things in Talking Heads style, and even it was curious and somehow interesting - and I'm surprised he came up with this. It may just be one of those translation cases, I'm afraid it is, but as a European viewer who sees the movie with subtitles overloaded English subtitles, I just thought it was terrible. The jokes seemed bad, the manuscript was overcooked - I mean, give the audience a break and shut down a little silly narrator - to the point of almost getting their heads exploded over an overkill of fast and absurd acts. br /> But I thought the animation was really cool. The idea is great and it is well utilized in the animated scenes. However, eye candy ends as soon as the characters are left aside to begin with an endless, no fun on all mumbo jumbo speech over still images. It just makes you want to fast forward to the next carved hysterical character scene. <br /> <br /> I read Mamoru Oshii actually planning on a sequel to this. The idea was good but terribly exploited. Perhaps the other part comes up with the good parts of this first and actually makes an interesting movie, or maybe it gets more and more overstated scenes. But hell, if you thought Talking Head was close, Amazing Life's Fast Food Gifters would cause a stroke. Of course, this whole comment is based on the experience of one that is European. Probably this is completely useless for Japanese people, perhaps it was a really fun movie that was lost in cultural boundaries and translation. Maybe.
