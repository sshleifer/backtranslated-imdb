This movie is a vehicle for the Schwarzenegger clone Alexander Nevsky. However, his charisma is insufficient to lift this movie over the level of its poor script. He has little to add to his Arnie action. <br /> <br /> Michael York is quite pathetic as a beggar diplomat. Looking at him again his D'Artagnan action from the time he was a better actor made me feel uneasy. Come on, you can do better than that! <br /> <br /> The story is full of gaps and inexplicable relationships; The top of this bill is Vlad's informant, who sounds like an American woman, but from the context it seems to work for a Russian government department. <br /> <br /> Although the story takes place well after the end of the Communist regime, all the Russian characters are still very communist. In contrast, Vlad is allowed to run a pimped up all utility vehicle as a police car. The action scenes are poorly shot and therefore lack dynamics. <br /> <br /> Not a must see movie ...
