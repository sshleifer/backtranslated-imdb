This is basically a low budget, made for TV, type of movie designed to exploit the success of the original. I'm a fan of b-movies, and it might well have been good if they hadn't linked the name "Cube" to it, for the same thing was the director's and the plot of the original better, and this movie was almost ruined for the whole series . The signs are annoying and clich√©d, there are problems with continuity and several direct production screws. History hardly gets a chance to develop because of superfluous dialogue and suffering from it. They use more or less the same horror gimmicks over and over the film, and because the first one was so good, it simply turns out to be a disappointment. <br /> <br /> If this was a stand-alone b movie, I'd probably give it a four. The "1" rating I give it was pretty much a statement on how it completely settled in effects and intelligence compared to the first.
