I haven't seen the first two - only this one called Primal Species in England. I don't think I will bother to see them out. <br /> <br /> This is a horrible movie. Terrible acting, poor dialogue, cheap rubber monsters. Everything knows it's so uncomfortable. The most sympathetic characters die really fast and leave you with those annoying, especially one called Polchak, who is an incredibly smoker. No such one would survive 5 minutes in the army. He lasted for years, but I was happy when he finally got his head chewed off. I had nightmares, he was supposed to survive. The Colonel was also rubbish - all moody pouts and clueless shouting. And the specky doctor looked and acted like she was out of a porn. I waited for her to take off her glasses, shake her hair and turn into a vamp, but she didn't. Pity it, as it would have lived the movie at the end. <br /> <br /> Not Roger Corman used to make half-decent movies once?
