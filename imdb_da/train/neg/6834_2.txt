Give what a heck of a movie! ... I said I would become a specialist in bad movies from all decades, so I decided to start with this one. It was a pretty appropriate choice. I stepped into this adventure to find some lost pearls and incomprehensible masterpieces, but I did not see any of these in this pastel-colored mess. I haven't really seen many bad movies before, but I have the feeling that this is what is called "so bad, it's good", probably because it's so unintentionally damn fun! First of all, there are inaccuracies. There are plot-related inaccuracies, physical inaccuracies, and also psychological inaccuracies. The latter is especially so insane as Van Damme's ass hair inside the blue spandex. Extremely sticky lines are also available, and I don't even want to start talking about some of the funny actions. There isn't exactly bad to trade from everyone involved in the hot mess of a movie, except in a particular case. Geoffrey Lewis looks completely pathetic like Frank, who is a completely stupid character. And to tell the truth I was actually very surprised to see that Van Damme did a decent job of playing the twins. He managed to achieve a different tone and mood in the two roles that were convincing to me. But the film was mostly very bad, and the sad part is that it was produced by a large film studio ... which is now bankrupt.
