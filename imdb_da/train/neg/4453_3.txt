I'm sure people see this step outside of Britian this movie will be an entertaining watch, but for anyone from the UK it's painful in it's error. <br /> <br /> Right at the start of the movie, Elijah Wood gets a tube at a bank station that has been scrapped. He says to his sister who he meets: "What's happened here" and she answers "Oh Tottenham was in town yesterday" !!! Tottenham is already in town .. they are part of the city, they don't have to go there! And if Tottenham fans wanted to fight against other fans, the last place on earth was that they would do that, Bank Station, where there are probably more security cameras than anywhere else in the world. There are several other similar errors, but the biggest failure for me is the actor who plays lead hooligan. He decided clearly that it was not worth trying to talk to an East End accent and instead chose a Dick Van Dyke-style mock-ney that made my ears soft. It was accentuated by the fact that the rest of his gang all spoke the way you would expect West Ham fans to speak. This mistake made him incredible in the role and really spoiled the movie.
