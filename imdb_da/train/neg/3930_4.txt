The second Renaissance, Part 1, shows us how the machines first revolted against humans. It all starts with a single case, where the machines claim that they also have the right to live while humans indicate a robot, they are something they own and can therefore do everything they want. <br /> <br /> Although an interesting premise becomes the story really stupid from that moment on (violent!) dissolves between the robots and humanity. Somehow it doesn't seem right, as another reviewer points to it, it's too little. <br /> <br /> The animatrix stories that are close to the core of the matrix (especially Osiris) work for the best. As for the second renaissance part 1, I would say that it is too violent and too stupid. 10.4.
