I'd really like The Pillow Book. Exciting story, interesting character, Ewan Macgregor in the wonderful. Unfortunately, I hated every minute of it. Greenaway was so enchanted with presenting the movie uniquely and not for the benefit of the movie. I don't even come into Vivian Wu's eerie play. <br /> <br /> You get distracted from the story with 4 billion teeny windows and calligraphy scrolling at the bottom of the screen showing the lyrics of the music playing. It seems that he lost sight of presenting the actual story and developing the plot and became confused with foo-foo decorations that have nothing to do with anything. It's a bit like presenting a John Singer Sargeant portrait in a chintzy Hallmark frame that says "GRANDMA LOVES ME!" in large glittering letters. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be an accident by the instructor's ego rather than what it might have been - disturbing and terribly beautiful. In another director's hands (Jeunet? Coppola?) It could have been a masterpiece. In Greenley's hands, it is best referred to art forms that also take care of seriously.
