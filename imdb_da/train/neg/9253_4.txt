If I hadn't read his name on the DVD cover, I would never suspect that this rather old-fashioned and old-fashioned musical was made by a man so closely linked to the French new wave. In fact, the film is so far from the fact that I wonder if back in the 50s and 60s, New Wave authors would completely hated this type of movie - it is so ... so ... unreal. And it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films. This is not necessarily a bad thing - just a very surprising thing. <br /> <br /> What I also found a little surprising was the amount of praise some of the reviewers gave this movie - especially when there are so many better French musicals out there. The songs in this film were simply not very interesting and the characters all seemed so sweet and stereotypical. If I had to see another nice person fretted about how hard it is to be rich or get a good selling price on a designer outfit, I would puke. The bottom line is that of American musicals, not all French musicals are gold. This movie is not another "Les Parapluies de Cherbourg" (UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG or "Huit Femmes") and despite Audrey Tautou's presence I can't see much reason to recommend it as anything but a boring oddity.
