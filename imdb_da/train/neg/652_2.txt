I think it was an overrated PG-13 crap! At least BRITTANY SNOW's performance was good, and some others like IDRIS ELBA were also good, but some other teens in the promenade like the leading friends were not so convincing. The killer was so stupid and so too stupid. The deaths were stupid, boring and totally unoriginal. The film was also very boring and very overrated. It was not exciting at all, I almost fell asleep. Its another bad PG-13 remake, it's really a horrible movie IMO. The finish was so stupid and the climax was very hasty and boring. The movie is also slow. Overall, the only good thing about this crap party is perhaps BRITTANY SNOW, I think she gave a good performance and IDRIS ELBA as well, but besides that, it was a horrible movie and horrible remake. Now that's just my opinion. I gave it a 2/10.
