I feel blessed to own what is known as the worst Steven Seagal movie ever made. I knew I was on something special when Steven opened his mouth and someone else's voice came out. In the middle of the movie, my eyes began to hurt, and I almost fell out of my chair with uncontrollable laughter. <br /> <br /> Steven is Steven (with an ever-changing voice) and incredible in his role (as always). Who in the hell leaves people with bad soft-ponytail mullets in power anyway? He also always writes for incredible love interests with women for at least 20 years his junior. The supporting actors all look as if they have been shot in the dark - btw, did they shoot the movie in the dark with just a torch for lighting? <br /> <br /> This is really abominable in every way possible. Invite all your friends around and make a social event out of it - this is really special.
