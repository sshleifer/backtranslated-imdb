There are three films with this animation style that I remember pleasantly from my youth. This movie, "The Last Unicorn", "Flight of Dragons" and "The Hobbit." I own copies of both "Dragons" and "The Hobbit" (both excellent) and I hadn't seen "The Last Unicorn" in more than a decade. It was until today, and now I wish I didn't. What bothered me most was the script. It was incredibly choppy and often inane. Things would happen for no reason, and other things would happen without explanation. We're not just talking about little things here either; we are talking about key plot points! The story itself is not so good at first, but it could have worked if the script was decent. Not even close. In addition, the music was horrible! I know that music in movies like these rarely has what you would call classic pieces, but the music in this movie made me turn myself unconscious with a bowling ball. This was one of the movies I was going to show to my children one day, but it was just cut. I don't think I could ever put myself through the crooked party again. The drawer puts it mildly.
