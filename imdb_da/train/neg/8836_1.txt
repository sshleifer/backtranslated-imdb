This is not art, it is inner-urban, politically correct propaganda! Jindabyne's political intolerance is more than unforgivable ... it doesn't see people as individuals, but rather as members of categories. This is the most patronizing offensive Australian movie I can ever remember (and it's up to some rather stiff competition!). A message movie, every tired theme that is loved by the trendy left is there: Aborigines are victims; white men are violent or alcoholic; White women are not so bad - especially if they are lesbians - but they are most likely of a depressive nature. <br /> <br /> Four men who go fishing find the body of a murdered woman (Aboriginal, natural) and leave her in the river for several days while they catch trout. It is a strange decision made with almost no discussion as if the men are animals. The one man who confuses briefly is the good ... we know because he lives with a bisexual woman - he likes to keep his baby very much - and eventually moves to a more fashionable seaside resort (away from all those beastly bushes) -wellers). <br /> <br /> This is a movie made of the trendy urbanites living in fear of the Australian landscape and the evil rednecks living inside. It is ignorance of the country's life, is almost as shocking as its contempt. The film has been shot through with long distances from the bush supported by vain, mysterious music. It is very clear at the end that aboriginal people are the only ones at home in this landscape. It concludes with a grim scary scene with black-and-white reconciliation. In Jindabyne, the country's life is reduced to a little more than a backdrop for a story that implicitly proclaims the superiority of the values ​​of enlightened left-wing urban dwellers over other Australians. <br /> <br /> This movie was not made by people with real jobs but funded by the government's film finance company. It is a product of the artistic set that soullessly populated by the beautiful people for whom lavish public funds maintain these patronizing offensive projects (which are as separate from real life as possible), as opposed to making popular films, people will see. It doesn't matter if the movie is a stinker, they are still paid. <br /> <br /> Be sure to waste time, avoid it like the plague. More enchanted social comments than the actual entertainment, this movie deserves to pan!
