Caught this by accident on a tsv. shows - and could hardly believe how horrible the whole experience was. For comparison, the original "A Man Called Horse" was spelling binding because it had its interest throughout. But this piece of nonsense - word fails me. It was bad enough to have some sort of "story" presented with all the effect of a wet breadbread, but that error was enhanced by the obvious lack of subtitles all the time when the so-called "Sioux" spoke. For the sake of goodness, the filmmakers could not have found enough North American Indians, who were also actors and actors to perform as "Indians" in this farrago instead of the imposters they actually used? I also found it rather embarrassing to see Richard Harris cavorting around the country on the obvious mastery of the instructor standing just behind the camera and telling him to run and jump from pointless point A to pointless point B just to make movie footage and minutes. Absolutely terrible in all respects!
