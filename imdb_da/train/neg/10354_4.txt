I looked through Netflix and stumbled upon this movie. Having good memories of the book as a child I decided to check this out. This is a movie that you really should pass. <br /> <br /> It's just not worth seeing. It is very boring and uninteresting. I feel that it would be the way to small children themselves. It has no magic that the book contains. This movie is not horrible, but you just won't find yourself caring for ten minutes in it. <br /> <br /> There are moments that just come out as weird. The witch character is not very good. The family seems to have nothing to do with these odd things. I know this is a children's movie, so as an older audience we must not look too deeply into things, but the whole movie just feels like it was written and produced by people who have never had a movie experience before. <br /> <br /> The DVD I had started skipping into the last minute movie and instead of trying to fix it, I just knocked it out and sent it back to Netflix. I really didn't care how it was done. Skip this movie and read the book instead.
