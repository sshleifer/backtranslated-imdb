David Arquette is a young and naive security alert <br /> <br /> selling the taken under Stanley Tucci's wing. Arquette is a golden boy who scores a big sale on his first call to widow Kate. <br /> <br /> Capshaw and her drowsy son Ryan Reynolds. Things go <br /> <br /> well to Arquette, he appears in the commercials of safety <br /> <br /> firm and he is in love with Capshaw. <br /> <br /> So Tucci and his right hand, Mary McCormack, let him <br /> <br /> be a bit secret - they sometimes break into their <br /> <br /> houses to scare them and get their neighbors to buy <br /> <br /> company security systems. Arquette decides not to involve <br /> <br />, take Capshaw to meet his family and go through life <br /> <br /> with a steady smile on his face. Then someone breaks into <br /> <br /> Capshaw's home and kills her and her son. Arquette suspects Tucci and sets a series of traps, resulting in a gun to his boss as Tucci invokes his innocence. <br /> <br /> Based on a scene game, "The Alarmist" doesn't open well. The <br /> <br /> scenes where Arquette takes the Capshaw to meet with his parents <br /> <br /> are poorly played and completely unfunny. They are also out of the queue <br /> <br /> with the character Capshaw playing when she gets drunk and tells sexually explicit stories to Arquette's mother Michael Learned. Other <br /> <br /> than Capshaw is not much to do, but she <br /> <br /> does a lot with the little she gets. <br/> <br /> Stanley Tucci, similar to Terry O'Quinn, is a rebellion that <br /> <br /> the security firm owns. He's a crib that doesn't really understand. <br /> <br /> Arquette's moral disgust. But when he turns into an <br /> <br /> snorkeling whiner after Arquette kidnap him, he's fun. Mary <br/> <br /> McCormack seems to have played a bigger role, but <br /> <br /> she stands the most and agrees with Tucci. Ryan Reynolds <br /> is too old to play a stupid teenager, but he's fun, especially <br /> <br /> tells his own explicit sexual history to Arquette. <br /> <br /> The play lurches from romantic comedy to dark comedy also <br /> <br /> soon. Capshaw, who meets the parents, is completely unmotivated, except to give her a reason to get out of town, so anyone can <br /> <br /> break into her house. Capshaw and Reynolds are in the movie just <br /> <br /> to give Arquette a reason to revenge on Tucci. <br /> <br /> Arquette, who has proven himself to be a good actor, is horrible here. He <br /> <br /> relies on the constipation that has caused him through these <br /> <br /> AT&T ads, and he's not a strong enough presence to build this <br / > <br /> weak film around. In fact, Reynolds may have been a better choice in the role. <br /> <br /> Dunsky's direction is good, nothing that will win an Oscar soon. <br /> <br /> Christophe Beck's light jazzy score is reminiscent of the type of film noir this movie is trying to be, and it's really jailed over it. <br /> <br /> Despite the pluses, Arquette's failure as a lead and scripting <br/> <br /> schizophrenic quality is dropping the movie. I do not recommend it. <br /> <br /> This is rated (R) for physical violence, gun violence, something going, <br /> <br /> strong profanity, short female nudity, sexual content, strong sexual <br /> <br / > references and adult situations.
