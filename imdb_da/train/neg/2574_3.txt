I know that movies do not necessarily have to mirror reality, but this one came on my nerves. It continues ignorant stereotypes of "mental trauma" and mental illness. The "psycho mother" thing has been done many times before (and usually done better), and much of the rest of the plot is also widespread. The action was not horrible, but nothing to rave about. A highlight: I'm a long-time fan of General Hospital, and it was a trip to see one of the roles that former GH regularly played, Jon Lindstrom. <br /> <br /> Whether or not you can overlook the false psychoanalytic part of it, you must likewise suspend reality / judgment when you see many movies, so this movie can be tolerable. If you have nothing better to do and relatively low standards. I'm sorry I spent my time watching it.
