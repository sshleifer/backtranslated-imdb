I had to compare two versions of Hamlet to my Shakespeare class and unfortunately I chose this version. Everything from the actor (the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera) to the camera pictures (all medium or close-ups ... no scene shoots and very little rear space in the shoots) was absolutely horrible. I saw this over my spring break, and it is very safe to say that I feel like I was snatched out of 114 minutes of my vacation. Not recommended by any kind of imagination.
