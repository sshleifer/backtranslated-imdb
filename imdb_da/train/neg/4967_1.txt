SciFi has had some great luck with making quality films lately (such as Minotaur or Dog Soldiers). Grendel was supposed to be based on the great epic Beowulf, but it differs so much (and offers so little in comparison) that the advertisements on television might as well have the title "a little shitty Christopher Lambert movie". I didn't expect to be as accurate as a full-blown Hollywood production, but I do expect that the 'artistic integrity' does not interfere with the actual story (though a little was changed to make a two-hour storyboard flow nicely in those assigned time slots). <br /> <br /> Does the instructor and manufacturers have any idea what they are doing (has there been any research on this?). Of course not as one could tell from the massive horned helmets that Beowulf and his crew (afraid of mullet boy) carry. A big problem I have had with Grendel myself, if ow 斤 拷 if Beowulf were to fight him, should he not have been 16 meters tall and weigh 2 tons? Grendel's death segment was also missing in every way ?? in my opinion, one in the epic was actually better than the customized counter on the script; for example: Grendel must have his arm ripped out of the outlet by Beowulf ?? not cut off by the forearm after being burned by an exploding arrow from an armband that looks like it weighs 300 kg! And Grendel's mother? Did they just combine her with the dragon at the end of the epic, where he eventually dies when he goes after his wounds? And honestly, what the hell was that with that mullet? <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie because its connection to the epic is not, because there really is not one (except for sign names). The only way I could recommend this movie is if you liked the movie Druids (directed by Jacques Dorfmann)? although I do not recommend seeing either.
