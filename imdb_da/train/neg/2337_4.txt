I dunno what the hype about this is ... This is really a bad movie ... it didn't matter to me, the only descent scene is where everyone gets together at the party and a good song plays, uplifting beat and nice cinematic shots, that makes you move .... it was the best part of the movie ... Otherwise, this movie lacks everything to suck the viewer. There is no story there is nothing to think about as some say there is no connection between stories ... it was more an attempt to restore Anderson's 'Magnolia', which was brilliant, but it fails blatantly .. Okay it's easy and easy to see, but it's also movie clips. Maybe first write a story before you make a movie ... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian movies I've seen
