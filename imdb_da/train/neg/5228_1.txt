I watched this movie the second night. I can't even begin to express how much this movie sucked. The script, the voice that appears, even the claymation. Terrible, terrible, terrible. It's like watching the 24 hour C-Span because of comedy. It just doesn't work. It literally falls flat in almost every possible place. <br /> <br /> The film's animation is also very poor quality. I know this is a movie made by a person, but believing that he could make 97 minutes of shame, at least he could make 1 second worth of fun. <br /> <br /> This show can take cake to be the worst movie all the time. Yikes. It was really that bad. If you are looking for a movie that makes you laugh, you will remove this abomination. My advice: Don't even buy it or look it up for that matter. Your brain wants you.
