Someone should tell Goldie Hawn that her career as a teen gamin ended thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies released this year, an unequivocal disaster, where the two leads to a frenetic display of their trademark tics in an attempt to make up for a bad script and bad leader. This thing should have been suffocated at birth. I hope John Cleese was paid a lot for having his name attached to this disaster. He is the only practitioner who came through this stinking mess, more or less unharmed, his only fault is not to realize that the rest of the cast would sink the picture.
