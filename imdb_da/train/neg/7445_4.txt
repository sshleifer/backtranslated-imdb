Extremely boring drama starring to a very young Roddy McDowall, training a wild horse, the title Girl and is the only reason to watch the movie in the first place. Coated in blaring, indulgent music and balanced by schmaltzy dialogue, this is one of the endless movies that drills you to the point of a gnawing headache. The naffly-titled successor, Thunderhead, Son of Flicka, where McDowall is training the next generation of nag, is marginally better than the original, but the pace remains slow and the score continues to poke you for submission, although at least one is or two scenes that do not cause a coma.
