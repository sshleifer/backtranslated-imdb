This movie sucks a lot. I'm in the army and the soldiers depicted in this movie are horrible. If your in the military and you see this movie, you will laugh and be disturbed throughout the movie because of the way they acted as a group. It was ridiculous. They acted like a bunch of normal people with army uniforms not knowing what to do. It was a beautiful gory movie I should say at least. There were a couple of scenes where they were trying to make you jump. I would recommend seeing it if you get bored and want to see a violent gyro movie. It will also be a better movie if you are not in the military. I should also say that I liked the first one better than this one.
