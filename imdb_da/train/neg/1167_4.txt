I really tried to like this movie, but in the end it just didn't work for me. I have seen most of Kitamura's output and have found it very variable. Alive, like all his films have an interesting plot, some nifty sequences and a lot of creativity. However, these qualities are in painful scarcity in Alive. The reason is cool if not all the original and could have made for a beautiful ace movie. Unfortunately, pacing is painfully slow, and the film takes an age to get started before getting pretty predictable places. The action is just about being acceptable, with the final fight pretty cool, and the former about OK. The former is also mistreated by surveillance of camera work, resulting in less coherence. There are some nice visual effects, and some interesting ideas float around in the dialogue, but the film still draws poorly. The characters are neither well flattened nor well-behaved, and the setting and general color scheme are boring and boring. The movie is not quite horrible and has some points of interest, perhaps stunning to use the fast-forward button could improve it. With about twenty minutes taken off, this may be a pretty decent sci fi thriller. But the full-length movie is boring. Only recommended to very patient and firm Kitumura fans.
