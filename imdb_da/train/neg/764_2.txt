The script for this Columbo movie seemed to be pulled straight out of a sappy 1980s soap opera. Deep character-driven movies are great, but only if the characters are convincing. And in this movie, the only convincing thing was my desire to change the channel. The villain dialogue sounds like it was written by a Romanesque novelist. The big Lt. Columbo itself is not how close to his famous, lovable, self-destructive, curly self; and the bride / kidnapping victim is a killing, one-dimensional doom (she fears in fear of a tiny scalpel kept diligently in the hand of her abductor - come on! -What for 2 seconds). In any kind of reality, this character would at least have tried to fight or fight back at least a little. And talk about reality .... the story is about a kidnapping that is worked and solved by the police. The police?? Give me a break. Everyone knows that the FBI takes over every kidnapping case. This was no Columbo, just a low and totally predictable criminal drama with our well-known Lt Columbo written and stretched for 2 hours.
