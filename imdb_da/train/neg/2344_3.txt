For me it just looks like a soap opera. I suppose any image of profitable people can be considered "social commentary". But in the end, I don't care how to characterize this movie. None of the characters are very sympathetic or engaging. I didn't feel chemistry between Hudson and Bacall. If there is a love story here, it is lost in the weakness. And, despite the twisting end provided by a complete and immediate (and therefore incomprehensible) conversion of Dorothy Maguire to the testimony, history is insufficient to hold my interest. No matter how much Freudian symbolism and psychology is cast, this story is blurry, melodramatic and pale. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson is noble wood. This is Lauren Bacall's least engaging role and one of her worst performances. Dorothy Maguire and Robert Stack deliver more inspired performances, but her character is boring and his is pathetic. Robert Keith is the most sympathetic character of the loving, out-of-touch father of two miscreant adult children. Most interesting, however, is the serious Robert Wilke in a small role as a bar owner. He is best remembered as an eerie henchman in countless westerns, but here he is an honest, sympathetic guy. <br /> <br /> I take my social comment with an interesting, engaging story and a few sympathetic characters, thanks.
