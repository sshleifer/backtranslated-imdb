I admit that I liked the first one and I was really looking forward to the successor. <br /> <br /> I was let down. Sure the special effects were technically amazing - but they weren't credible. It looked more like a cartoon. Okay, I admit to suffering 80% of the chase scene - but the battle with all of Mr Smiths? It was, of course, animated. <br /> <br /> I can accept all that. What I cannot accept is that the non-actionable parts were crap. Every time Morpheus opened his mouth, I knew I was in for a speech that went on forever and drew nothing. <br /> <br /> I was also disappointed with the little plot that existed. What this movie did was tell us that there was no truth in the first movie (except for the existence of the matrix). This movie was a bit like seeing the episode of DALLAS, where you find out that the entire previous season was a dream. Ugh! I want my $ 7.00 back!
