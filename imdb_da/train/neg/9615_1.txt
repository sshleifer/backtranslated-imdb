It seems clear from this adaptation that he did not. Not only did he leave the plot behind, he made his own! The things he chose to leave were so ridiculously incredible that I was happy that he chose to leave some of the most important parts of the novel. The reason was unclear, inconsistent and rude to say the least. I don't want to say anything that is medieval about the actors, but they can't act! Dickens is of course difficult, but it is pathetic! Micawber was no more than a mid-nineteenth-century Kramer, and the less said about Betsy Trotwood the better! To see the real Copperfield, see the wonderful 1999 BBC customization. As for the scriptwriter, I think he is reading Cliff's Notes!
