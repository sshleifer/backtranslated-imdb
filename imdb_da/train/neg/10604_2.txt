This time, the hero of the first movie has become human and this time uses fist and foot combs against super universal soldiers and a computer that has gone wrong and is willing to take over the world. I'm pretty sure it was Double Team who convinced everyone that Jean-Claude Van Damme was no longer credible in providing watchable action flicks. But that was what kept his credibility forever. While Universal Soldier: The return is not as boring as Double Team or Quest, it is still pretty terrible with none of the style and style of the original and no star pairing. This sequel is made simply for children who enjoy professional wrestling. As I look back, not even the sequences of action were so exciting, and therefore this film is a worthless dud. In other words, another clunker in Van Damme's assembly line. <br /> <br /> * out of 4 (bad)
