While "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians" is usually mentioned as one of the worst movies ever made, this 1959 Mexican-made movie is so bad that it makes "SCCM" look like "It's a wonderful life." One must wonder what the people who made this movie thought; perhaps they meant it as a third world war on capitalist greed and conspicuous consumption. Oh. . . They were just not very good. The same production company made an even more disturbing version of "Little Red Riding Hood", where the wolf's occupation with our heroine has unmistakable hints of pedophilia. (Perhaps this was the inspiration for "Freeway.") Back to "Santa Claus": Instead of the North Pole, Jolly Old Saint Nicholas is in a satellite in geosynchronous ground (shades of "MST3K"); instead of rivers, his toys are made by children selected from all over the world; and he had sophisticated spy equipment to control which kids are naughty and cozy. The result is like an Orwellian outer space sweat store. It is enough to extinguish Christmas forever. This and other low-lying Mexican children's films were dubbed in English and widely used in the United States in the early 1960s; No wonder the sixties became so turbulent in American history. The baby boomers who were forced to endure these "family" films as children would be too eager to become revolutionary.
