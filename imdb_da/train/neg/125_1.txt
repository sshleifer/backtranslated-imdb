If only to avoid making this type of movie in the future. This film is interesting as an experiment, but does not tell any adjacent story. <br /> <br /> You can feel good about it because it affects so many important issues, but it does so without any visible motivation. The viewer comes away without new perspectives (unless one comes up with one's mind wandering as it will always do under this meaningless movie). You can better spend your time staring a window on a tree growing. <br /> <br />
