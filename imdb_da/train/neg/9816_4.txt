This movie was like a bad train wreck, as terrible as it was, you still had to continue to watch. My boyfriend and I rented it and wasted two hours of our day. Don't make me wrong now, the play is good. Just the movie as a whole scared us both. There was nothing positive or good about this scenario. After this movie I had to rent something else that was a little easier. Jennifer Tilly is, as usual, a very dramatic actress. Her character seems manic and not all there. Darryl Hannah, although she played over, she does a wonderful job of living up to the situation she is in. More than once I found myself shouting at the TV that said she should fight back or stay violent. All in all, very violent film ... not too weak of heart.
