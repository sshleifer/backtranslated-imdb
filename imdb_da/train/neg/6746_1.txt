* SPOILERS INCLUDED * <br /> With a title like "Bleed", you know that the creative juices didn't run high when this puppy was perceived. The movie is your basic run-of-the-mill low budget slasher movie. Oh, it's trying to be creative with the premise of the "murder club", but we learn it was just a joke anyway. Okay, for those who really care about these things, the basic plot is that the new girl in town starts dancing her colleague. He invites her into her circle of friends, and at a party they tell her how they have a "murder club" and they murder people, among other things. Now we learn that it was a joke, but not before our heroine kills a lady in a parking garage. Now the "members" of the murder club are killed one by one. Oh, and the bad guys win and the movie ends in a downer. At that time you will not really worry yourself. <br /> <br /> In setbacks, the first 10 or so minutes in this movie make no sense. The motive for the killings at the beginning of the film has never been explained. I would say that it was a way for the director to exhibit the movie, but on the DVD, scenes have been deleted! I'm not sure why anyone will see more than the feature length version of "Bleed", but apparently the folks behind the DVD believed the viewers would clamoring for more. The box says that there are Easter eggs, but why in hell would I like to waste my time searching for extra on this movie is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a bad movie and "Bleed" was delivered on that front page. However, it was not a funny bad movie. Everyone looks good in the movie and there is plenty of nudity, but the play is just awful. My least favorite character is the guy who ends up being the killer ... I think he should be fun and entertaining, but he ends up coming out as a tool. I think the funniest moment in the movie is when our heroine kills the lady in the parking garage in a hilarious death. Heroine pushes the women into the parking lot's cement pile, and the woman looks as if she hardly hits the case and she spits a mouthful of blood and "dies." <br /> <br /> For those who think filmmaking is a complicated, creative process done by professionals, check out "Bleed". It will change your mind and you will realize that any hack can make a movie. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money on this.
