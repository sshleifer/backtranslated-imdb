Strange ... I like all this movie crew and dark humor film; but didn't like this one at all! It's terrible, terrible and certainly not fun at all. Shame can't do a whole movie plot, disgust either. And it was really boring. Long empty moments fill the film; it could have been removed. It should have been in a different shorter format, for sure. Maybe I expected too much from the crew - just like saving the movie lol -. It is also full of overused clich√©s of characters and situations ... I don't understand why people liked it ... "Poetry", "hope"; no 'mother, so do nothing like that! ^ All in all, it is empty and raw, pitiful and hopeless. Oh darn this ........
