Eleven "big" filmmakers, eleven pieces of waste. Eleven minutes each of pure tedium, sophistication, abandonment, complacency. Treat people in all nations. Yussef Chahine of Egypt gives a "hip hip hooray!" for terrorism in his amateurish segment. Across the green line, we have Amos Gitai from Israel, who uses his eleven minutes to show a terrorist act and focus on a jerking news machine. Alejandro González Iñárritu from Mexico concentrated on the Twin Towers, but seemed to forget to turn on his camera. Sean Penn did not know that there were no buildings within the shade of the Trade Center on 9-11. Shohei Imamura from Japan ignores it all. Claude Lelouch focuses on a trivial and cliché love affair. Ken Loach in the UK focuses on Chile. Contract. Contract.
