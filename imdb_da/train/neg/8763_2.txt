I thought I read somewhere that this was the last monogram production, but whether it is true or not, it doesn't matter, because if it wasn't, then it should have been. It is a deadly boring affair with John Carradine with something weeping in his hair to make himself seem like an older scientist experimenting with his young apprentice (Robert Shayne) to bring the dead back to life. Each time their subjects are revived, they seem to have a whitish face as marble, as they are attached to the big table. Carradine manages to restore his faithful dog to life after it is dead, and the nut gets an unusual ability to walk through walls in a ghostly way (wooooooooohhhh). It's all about everything she wrote. <br /> <br /> For an ultra-cheap monogram quickie, this thing at least actually uses a more fancy-schmancy lab setup than normally assigned. The funniest jumping joke in the movie is that the "older" doctor Carradine constantly refers to his "young" assistant Shayne as "m'boy" when Carradine was actually 40 and Shayne was 45 when they did this!
