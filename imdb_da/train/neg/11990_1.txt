I wish I could give this movie a zero. Cheesy effects and trades. The only reason to watch this movie is to see how bad it is. Let's start with the kid playing Brian. What a geek! I couldn't believe the mullet! Then it spoke to itself. I suppose they couldn't just make the movie silent, but still. Of course, they had to get him skinny-dipping too, not something I wanted to see. But Jared gave a good performance compared to the special effects department. Everything from the bear to the crash was something I could do myself and better. I seriously doubt that Gary Paulsen had anything to do with the production, since the movie isn't even called Hatchet. Finally, I don't think the author ever read the book, since nothing was the same. I think the book was great, but this movie stinked like a smelly goat!
