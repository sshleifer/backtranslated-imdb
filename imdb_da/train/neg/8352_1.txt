I rented this movie because it falls under the genre "romance" and "western" with some Grand Canyon scenes thrown in. But if you expect a typical healthy romantic western, forget it. This movie is a clean trash bin! The romance is between a young man who has not even been through puberty and a medieval man! The child is also lusted by other hiring men. It's boring. <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda is portrayed as capable by trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields, and her character is mostly the one pursuing the relationship. He tries to shoo her out first but eventually he gives in, and they run out like a happy, loving couple. It's disgusting. <br /> <br /> I can't see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles.
