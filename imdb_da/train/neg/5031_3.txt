The original 1965 Japanese film "Gamera" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an update of the darker, less kid-oriented Gojira (Godzilla) in the 1960s feelings. Gamera is, of course, a giant flying flame-cutting turtle that literally uses energy - not quite as big as some versions of Godzilla, but generally the same in most ways. <br /> <br /> This version of the original movie was edited and recited by the infamous Sandy Frank. And like the American version of Godzilla ("Godzilla King of the Monsters"), "Gammera The Invincible" gets more than just the spelling error. The American scenes are almost as ridiculous and annoying as they added to the great Gojira, but do not add much to the story, not even because there is little follow-up on them. <br /> <br /> The movie starts promising, there are a few scenes worthy of character development, and there are enough personalities to create excitement outside the main plot. When Gamera pops up, the movie begins to fall into a rather giant kaijuf movie. <br /> <br /> The action is good enough - even the American additions are ok. The management is pretty good at this period and genre, and the special effects are not at all bad for their time (all thumbnails). Some of the sets and backgrounds are actually very good. Of course, the biggest problem here is that there is little to nothing original about this movie. Gamera, however, develops a much more unique personality in his later movies - most are worth seeing if you are a kaiju fan.
