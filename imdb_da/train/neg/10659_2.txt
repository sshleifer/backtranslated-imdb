Philosophy: Excellent, cozy camera angles (I can't remember watching a movie late, with good close-ups until this one). Could have avoided cruel scenes with a soft camera. NY is the picture well. I liked the upward angle, especially (another pressure). <br /> <br /> Music: Not impressive. The songs do not hold you in your mind even after watching the movie. Maybe, I expected the same quality as "Anniyan". A disappointment. <br /> <br /> Actors: Kamal must slowly move away from hard-core action sequences. His age and stomach really show up. He should also avoid dense romantic sequences forward. It was a very awkward to see a mature / aged star still trying to play as a 20+ heroic scene. Love can be expressed in any age; As we age, you can still express love nicely from a distance (without touching a woman too much. For example, the love expressed by Rajinikanth in "chandrmukhi"). <br /> <br /> Jyotika is only shown for namesake in the movie. Not sure why she accepted this. Well, that's not my problem, I think. <br /> <br /> Others only have a small presence. <br /> <br /> Direction: I expected Gautham to excel (or measure up) to his second movie "Kakka Kakka". He disappointed me. It took a long time to release the movie due to various problems. He slides in few scenes. Even envious things were thrown from a famous director. <br /> <br /> Overall: Just an okay movie. Too much graphics. DEFINITELY NOT for children (and adults who expect some kind of "entertainment"). <br /> <br /> Thx
