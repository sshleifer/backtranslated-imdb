First and foremost, I'm not a big fan of today's Turkish cinema, because the usual pattern of creating a casino success is hit by the waist. This film is nothing of an artistic masterpiece dealing with taboos that director and marketing ads entail. In my opinion, the only purpose of this movie is to make money by touching a sensitive morality (in fact, it is mostly considered as taboo in the home country). Cheap populism can give a short definition of what I meant. <br /> But the play is almost perfect. In fact, most of the casting has a theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what Altioklar lacked; talent! All members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job, even the less experienced. (As Janset) At least Altioklar deserves a little word of appreciation just because he knows how to choose the cast. Apart from that, he is just a media leg who assumes as a director with an artistic talent. Come on, art is not something that consists solely of dealing with naked / half naked women. And just because the media boasts, no director becomes a milestone in Turkish cinema history. Just close your ears and o some real artistic, I eagerly await your next work. Hope this time, we succeed in achieving an artistic approach. <br /> In short; Benefits> Good acting, hot women (just fun!) :) Disadvantages> Every single thing except the throw
