First, I really enjoyed Zombi 2 by Lucio Fulci. This movie was completely garbage bin. I couldn't stand to see it. The story was a joke, the actor was a joke, and the fact that Zombi 3 has nothing to do with Zombi 2 is even more a joke. <br /> <br /> We jump from Voodoo to DEATH 1 THE HARMFUL AGENT BRINING People back to life. Regardless, this movie is not worth the $ 1.00 it costs to rent it. I really enjoyed lucio fulci movies, but this one was horrible. If Zombi 3 is an indicator of how Zombi 4 and 5 are going to be, I think I just want to skip them. <br /> <br /> Zombi 2 is a great flute tho.
