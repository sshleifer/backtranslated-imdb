TV pilots, don't you love them? Quinn Martin tried this out after having been successful in a bunch of other TV detective films, but this does not go anywhere except in the MST area where it belongs. Roy Thinnes is Diamond Head who takes orders from Aunt Mary to find super spy Lovejoy, I mean Tree. Zulu and Tso-Tsing are there for ethnic comic relief and not much else. Wood sucks like a bad guy despite all his aprons that make him look exactly the same as he usually does. There is more unnatural clothing fiber here than you can ever imagine (required in the 1970s) and the show itself is so anti-climatic. Why didn't it go to series? You find out, it's pretty obvious. Again, it's fun for MST, but not much else !!
