This child is pretty bad, but in no way do they make him the type of infant and can foil experienced thieves at every turn. No, he is not so abrupt because he is a child with serious emotional problems. A nice couple wanting to adopt is pretty suckered to adopt him, and while the man is a little more willing to give this child a chance, the mother is not. Through a bizarre Michael Richard's character and the always annoying Gilbert Gottfried and you have yourself a pretty bad movie with a few laughs in this and there. In fact, I prefer the sequel to this movie as I like that they brought Amy Yasbeck back as another more sympathetic character, as there is one or many signs in this movie that is thoroughly unlikely as it is. Even the child is rather annoying at first in this, and they kind of chill him also in the sequel. The reason is simple enough, although the potential parents go to adopt this child, whom they think is great, as the orphanage throws a party when they leave, they quickly realize that they themselves have a small hellion. In addition, this little Hellion comes in contact with a judge of some sort. Not sure about this character, I first thought it was his real father or something. Not so good, but I will choose this in front of the Culkin kid every week of the week.
