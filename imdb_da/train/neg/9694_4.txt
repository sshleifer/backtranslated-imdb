Otto Preminger leads this light as a spring story. Bohemian Jean Seberg and her straight bohemian widow David Niven vacation in southern France with nutty Mylène Demongeot. It's fine until family friend Deborah Kerr shows up. The level, a degenerate womanizer, finds the conquest of Kerr too hard to resist. It's fine with Seberg as long as Niven loves her and leaves her (when he's finished with all the women in his past ... including Demongeot). When it looks like she is going to be the second course in the level of life, Seberg sees exact revenge on Kerr. Preminger tells the story in flashbacks from Seberg's perspective and wisely combines black and white with healthier color scenes. The cinematography of Georges Perinal is amazing. The movie contains some of Premingser's hardest hand, though he rarely allows any close-ups, making it hard to figure out what the actors really feel. Arthur Laurents wrote the manuscript and it is filled with sour dialogue and fun scenes (mostly involving hairy Demongots). Seberg rejects quite well, but Niven is in his least appealing ... and he shows no chemistry with either Seberg or Kerr. Preminger really mis-steps with that casting. It is a role that seems tailored to a person closer to Charles Boyer. With Geoffrey Horne as Sebergs would be suitor and Martita Hunt as his daffy mother. Juliette Gréco plays the song title song in a Paris nightclub. The big titles are by Preminger ordinary Saul Bass.
