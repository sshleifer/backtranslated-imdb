This is the most mournful collection of cliches stretched together in a straight line, with no clear plot or decent way to act, I've seen for a long time. Canibalizing scenes from Star Wars, Fire of Fire, Godzilla, Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, went to an all-out war on viewers' intelligence. Was this movie good? There was no movie at all! Although it doesn't go so low that it is actually fun and achieves cult status as a comedy, the movie offers some fun. The trick is to put the copied scenes in context with their original movies. Gandalf can be fun talking Korean, the basilic-looking snake fun if you compare it to a kitten, and the evil hands can give a lot of fun switching back and forth between Sauron and Jaja-bing, or whatever his name was. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Any pleasure derived from this movie is entirely dependent on the state of knowledge, and not on the director / author. Shame on you, Shim!
