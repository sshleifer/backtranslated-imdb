This American soap opera, 'Knots Landing', has all the entertainment values ​​caught in a lift. Each episode contained plots such as rape, murder, kidnapping and drug trafficking, not very different from the other drama exhibitions of the period. As for the casting, I have seen better actors on a cereal box. From the middle to the late 90s, repetitions of 'Knots' U.K-Gold stacked up like a mountain of soft bladders. I'm sorry to announce that I had to like this when my mother was a big fan of the show and wanted to see it religiously. Although since then, re-runs have been few and far between (let's hope it stays that way). The only positive thing that can be said about 'Knots' is the catchy saxophone signature melody that is later used as the title music for I.T.V sitcom, 'The Upper Hand'. Great legacy it, eh?
