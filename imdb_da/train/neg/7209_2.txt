I used to have a fascination with the comic book back in college when it was made. It had the very charm of "Get Smart". Although it did have its faults, it was quite fun. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was very interested in watching the movie version. It was before I saw it. Then I wanted it to have never been done. Besides being miscast around (who on Earth, even though Broderick was close to the role?) It just didn't make the character. <br /> The effects were reasonable and perhaps the only thing I liked about the movie; watch a live action version of gadgets in action! What was missing was a story and treatment that made it fun or charming or interesting. <br /> <br /> The original was a crazy cartoon with a very light heart setting. It was fun. The film became scary and took itself seriously for real. If it had seriously had a good plot or became insane enough to make it a "movie on film", it could have been fun. <br /> <br /> As it does, it does not deserve to be considered part of the "Gadget Legacy".
