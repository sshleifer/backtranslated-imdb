I've read a few books on Bonnie and Clyde, and that's certainly more accurate than the Beatty / Dunaway version, as its costumes and locations echo actual photographs taken by the band. Particularly well done is Buck Barrow's death and the capture of his wife Blanche. This actress looks like the photographs taken that day when Blanche grabbed her dying husband. However, this movie is still Hollywood, and our anti-heroes remain pretty much even after being shot full of holes (in life, Bonnie was badly burned in a car accident the year before their famous ambush and didn't look like a perky cheerleader at the time of her death). The scripture is boring, and the play is poor, especially the leaders. Very disappointing. Stick with Beatty and Dunaway. Their may not be "the true story," but it's a good movie.
