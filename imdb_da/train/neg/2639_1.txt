First, let's start this review with the fact that I just wrote to the listing and lawyers to save their money !! <br /> <br /> This was one of the worst pieces of waste I've seen since The Hulk. The story was the most predictable waste you could bring. If you expect 24, but on the big screen, flush the expectation down the toilet right away with the money you want for a ticket. You can get more joy that way. The action was horrible, the plot was completely unrealistic (along with the so-called "twist" at the end. I have to say it. The end surprised me. I'm not referring to the plot twist that surprised me, but instead the effortless way they put it together, what could be considered the only scene of some decent action throughout the film, they hastened the conclusion so quickly that I didn't even realize it was over until I saw the credits rolling and at that time I was considering burning the film's roll, If I could just figure out how to get into this screening room, Casting was terrible for a couple of reasons, first of all, they have to accidentally change the signage because Michael Douglas played the role that CLEARLY Keifer Sutherland should have played. While Douglas wrapped around agents, hit telephone lines, slammed into systems and took out people chasing him, Sutherland plays the less skilled agent who is always in ab ad hum s even when things are not going so bad for him. He plays a very gentle agent, nothing like his Jack Bauer type rolls us 24 fans love. <br /> <br /> I can almost just promise you that this movie will disappoint in all areas. It can best be compared to a remake of "The Fugitive" / "In The Fire Line", but written by people with mental disabilities.
