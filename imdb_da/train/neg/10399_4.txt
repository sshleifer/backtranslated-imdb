One of the biggest flaws in this movie is that even though the mocking of the flashy yuppies is satisfactory, it does not understand that the filmmakers themselves are guilty of being one of those who deserve to be deceived. One of the characteristics of these yuppie types is the astonished misconception that they (the yuppies) are the only ones who are sophisticated enough to understand art. While the film ignores this feature and instead focuses on their misconceptions about eating, I find it ironic that only people who enjoy this movie boast the same astonished taste in movies as the characters do in their choice of dinner. If those pompous characters in this movie have a video library at home, I bet American Psycho would be one of those movies.
