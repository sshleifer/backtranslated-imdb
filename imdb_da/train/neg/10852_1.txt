This movie is a very funny movie. The violence is bad, the play is ... Well, Dani, keep singing or screaming or whatever the hell you do. The random chicks barely carry anything just to catch sexually frustrated goth lads. Personally, I think this movie really sucks. The story and the characters can be very good if you say that the actors and other small nibby things were made better. But the movie is just bad, the only reason people like it here is because it has Danni in it. This movie may be the worst B-rate movie ever. And believe me it's hard to achieve, especially when competing with Def by Temptation and over crappy excuses for "serious" horror movies. I'm not a CoF fan, and then I just see this as another nonsense movie ... A really bad one. If Dani did this as a comedy, then he goes well. Very well done. Above that though, I rate it low, because it's crappiness. See it when you are in a happy, happy, happy, joyful fashion, so that you can laugh at everything or if you are high on several different types of fabrics.
