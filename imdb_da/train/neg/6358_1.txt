And how many actors can he come in for his own neurotic, compulsive uber-New Yorker persona? In this movie, Woody is played by Will Ferrell in what is mercifully less a direct imitation than that of Kenneth Branagh in "Celebrity". It's an annoying repetitive story now: nebbishy, ​​neurotic man with a wife or boyfriend falls crazy in love with a shiksa queen, on which he projects all sorts of perfection. All live in perfect gigantic apartments in large Manhattan neighborhoods, all of which constantly support expensive, upscale restaurants, where all characters relate to fascinating anecdotes and discuss Arkan philosophy. There is always a trip to Hamptons, where the nebbishy protagonist is spazing about sand and physical exertion and possible exposure to disease, and of course, the protagonist feels guilty of his desire for the Shiksa queen, but still pursues her, sometimes succeeds, sometimes fails, etc. . <br /> <br /> This is a tired formula and evidence that Allen is not a great movie artist at all. He just seems like a dirty old man with a 20-year-old libido and emotions who intend to tell the same boring old stories over and over again.
