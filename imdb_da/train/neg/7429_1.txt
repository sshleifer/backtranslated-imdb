Who me? No, I'm not talking. That's what really stands on the video box. <br /> <br /> Plot; short version: Pretty Woman standing around smiling. This for some reason makes all men kill each other. <br /> <br /> "Find Ariel ... Where's Ariel ... Can't find Ariel ..." She's just behind you, your idiot ... <br /> <br /> Most of what can be said about this horrible little Space Opera has already been said, looks. <br /> <br /> A bunch of corny actors who play mostly prisoners come in after the first selection of actors is off very quickly. Then they are turned off in the same way. Each scene is broadcast almost fifteen minutes in advance. Perhaps it was a drawing of straws to see which actors had the most screen time and bigger paycheck. The alien virus / hologram / VR witch / glitch seems physically powerless and does nothing. Why can't she just stay in the computer instead of doing her "teleporting vampire" routine? (In fact, it would have been more interesting if she had been a vampire or more than just looking around at people, which is all she ever does. This is enough to kill all the men ... ) <br /> <br /> This is not really a room girl. There are far more shots of the old western track, 1950's Easy Rider path, the Film Noir nightclub scene, even a jog on the beach in fantasyland, none of which has any real depth or even makes sense. The nightclub scene is of course in black and white. Worked on "The Wizard of Oz". Doesn't work well here. This is probably a good thing since the few shots they show of the room are depressingly stupid. You will probably cry in these moments, especially by seeing that swirling "spaceship" that looks about three inches long. Nothing is felt for any of the characters, not because they are prisoners or have no personality, but because they have serious needs for acting, except for Billy Dee Williams, who really looks depressed and lost, probably by being in this work. .. This is one of those movies that, when seen with friends, will cause some extremely "high" postures, especially when the geek beats his comic strip lines (including the French-kiss a meteor ...? Did I hear it right? Maybe not ...) <br /> <br /> The original virtual reality girls are "killed", which means nothing since they are not even right at first. Well, the other "signs" aren't either, but it's next to the point. Haha. What is fun is that the scene that adorns the video box is a kind of skull horror alien that looks things (the green filter is added to give it more of a ... hh ... green look) which is actually android, after he is killed and eventually has nothing to do with anything else. <br /> <br /> Another weird deal I noticed. When there is an explosion (at least on my cheap DVD copy), everything becomes very pixelated. I don't mean a small pixelated, I mean big blocks around the 1 / 16th size of the screen. Wow.
