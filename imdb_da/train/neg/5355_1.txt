Now I don't hate cheap movies. I just can't see why you were wasting money for a movie you could shoot with your dad's camcorder. If I rent a movie, I want it to be a movie, not a lot of people who think it would be a good idea to waste some MiniDV tapes. Maybe I hate it so much because the guy in the video store said it was great, and it wasn't. Maybe I hate it because it's cheap, has the stupidest plot ever, the most unrealistic characters ever and the really, really, really WORST SHOWDOWN in the history of the movie ever. Even Tom Savini cannot save this. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this is a complete waste of time.
