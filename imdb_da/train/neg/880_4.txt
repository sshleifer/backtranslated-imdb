Garson Rabbit wrote and directed this look on "modern" Las Vegas and the gap between generations, his first leadership effort since the 1940s! David Janssen is somewhat disappointed as a big-shot casino owner who reunites with his son (Robert Drivas, who looks disturbingly like an older Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches all scenes in the same way: defensive, with a chip on his shoulder. Playing this role cool and laid back asks too much from Janssen, who bends at all like a grouchy man (he even cries out Don Rickles and makes him cry!). His son, a ne'er-do-well, in search of his own identity, makes hip comments on how young people look down at Vegas (give them another ten years), and his disapproval of father's lifestyle causes friction. Brenda Vaccaro is cute as a self-confident secretary, and Edy Willaims has a fun bit like a showgirl at an audition. Unfortunately, "wherever it is", nothing else has to go to the other than the now-dated discussions on ethics between adults and their children, some quick T&A shots and entertaining satirical bits on the high game world - most of which have been covered by now, by nauseum. ** from ****
