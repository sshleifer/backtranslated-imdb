THIS MOVIE IS LAME, LAME, LAME !!!!! It takes a lot to bring me excessive exaggeration about a movie, but this movie stunk up my house !! I haven't even finished the movie yet and I had to stop commenting on how bad this movie is. I have never done it !! As a consumer, don't spend your money on this movie. Wait until it comes out on a cable duct or something. It's hardly TV worthy. I REALLY REMEMBER TRASHING A MOVIE BUT THIS MOVIE IS TRASH! Hardly over porn. Must have and X rating! Good plot, some frontal nudity (if it floats your boat), but HORRIBLE high school level acting. Don't know how this movie received distribution. (Must have been a contractual thing.) Really, if you really like watching good movies, don't waste your time with this one. From a movie lover to another. YOU WILL BE FOOD ON YOU! Let me say this too, if you have been through something like this, you might relate and it will have some value for you. In that case, I say you can take something away from it if you don't just see something that has happened to you to be traded out of another (has therapeutic value).
