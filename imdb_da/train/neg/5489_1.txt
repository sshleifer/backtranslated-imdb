The story resembles ET: an alien running around the earth and trying to get home. While it remains on our planet, it will create friendly ties to humans. <br /> <br /> But unlike ET, which exudes drama, comedy, poetry, this movie is just fun. It's actually a pure Dysney production: its core audience is kids and the movie is more in the visual than in the message. Thus you will find some fun scenes (the city's first observation, a "cosmic" vicious bread roll) and the casting is experimented with special names for "Doc", which rejuvenates in a "Mac Fly" character and to Hurley, which is open to autosection. <br /> <br /> Ice on the cake: The main title is scored by Danny Elfman, and like any other great composer, you recognize his "voice" before being credited himself.
