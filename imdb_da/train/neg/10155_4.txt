I have read several good reviews that have defended and criticized the various aspects of this film. One thing I see over and over is annoyance with Megan, the idealistic politician who is trying to change the world. I loved her character. Maybe because I am a 23-year-old political science student, and I think I will change the world too, so I relate to Megan. Besides, she is sweet. She is no super model, but more of a sweet girl next door. <br /> <br /> So she cried and screamed a lot. It is very dramatic, and seems exaggerated, but does not suit her character? She goes to the show for the purpose of sacrificing her life to prove a point. She believes that people who enjoy such a show are sick. I think she did her very well. Of course, she is a young naive girl, scared of what she is about to face. I think her play shows a young girl who shows moral courage despite her overwhelming fear. Besides, I think she maintained some dignity throughout the film despite the desperate situation she was in. <br /> <br /> What the movie in general, except Megan, was pretty much what I had expected. It had excellent gore scenes, by micro budget standards. The reason perhaps took a quick thought, hardly any consideration. It's basically just a dark humorous meaningless slasher movie, as its name suggests. I love the doctors' sadism. He continued to tear out Megan's shirt, not only for the cause of sleaze (though, on the whole, it is), but also to plague her before killing her. The chainsaw hick was fun. For slasher movie lovers he was probably the best character. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4 out of 10. It had a good setting, almost no plot and a mix of good and horrible actions. I would recommend it for a cheap thrill, but hardly a diamond in the rough that is micro-budget horror.
