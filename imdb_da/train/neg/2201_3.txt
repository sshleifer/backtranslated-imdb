Horror / Sci-Fi that is interesting as it is ridiculous. F / X pretty good ... for what you can see. A made for TV thriller, which is not as bad as the worst of them. Jeffrey Coombs plays a brilliant though deceptive scientist who tamper with stem cell research and manipulate human DNA with a hammerhead shark. The terrible results give a hell of a killing machine. A group of researchers led by William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo are invited to a remote island to check out the brilliant new experiment. Of course, after laughing and deriving in awe ... Coombs' creation is by the way its own son merged with a hammerhead, loosely to hunt one by one of his father's colleagues. Revenge is not always rewarding. Also in the cast: Elsie Muller, G.R. Johnson, Arthur Roberts and Velizar Binev.
