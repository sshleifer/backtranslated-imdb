This is not a movie, it is an 111-minute evangelical Christian sermon draped over America's # 1 state-of-the-art sport, high school football. Another of the long, serious messages to the convert that is supposed to be fired by the spirit of traveling abroad and transforming their unanswered neighbors. <br /> <br /> Dialogue like "You Won the Great When You Accepted Christ" loses any possible rubbish at the disturbing intensity of director / coach Alex Kendrick lowered black eyes. Then there are "parables". <br /> <br /> Two farmers asked for rain, but only one prepared his field to receive it. What do you think God blessed? This rhetorical question is intended to foreshadow the miraculous climax during which Coach asks his pointed back-up kicker, "Son, do you think God could help you make that kick?" It is the kind of entertainment we could have expected to receive faith-based funding by infinitum if only the evangelical Christian bush administration's hegemonic pursuits around the world had convinced us to become "devoted" to their example. See that the bad Giant's trainer in the apocalyptic finals, and calls on his team to cry "Who's with me!" while the devoted eagles, on the other hand, were quietly doing the work of the Lord. <br /> <br /> Do you think our scared back-up makes his kick over to overcome the self-centering goliath? Well, we all know that jealousies cannot lose. Put it this way: Transfer the rental space to the deserts of the Middle East, replace Christian proselytization, and this virulent nonsense can easily be repackaged as a Taliban vs. Superpower parable, which the devoted worshipers of that waste might think for a minute. <br /> <br /> Luckily, they don't care and don't: As a coach, his team of serious empty ships pregame, the answers are right here in this book. And the Christian right will devour this on their way to their rapture, the final victory they have prepared for their fields.
