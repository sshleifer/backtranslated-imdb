This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It's bad even on television movie level standards. The reason is profound, and the known names in this movie are wasted on confused, uncertain characters. I don't know how the director managed to keep this excuse for a movie together - it's so bad. Billed as a 'Psychological Horror Thriller' - it is certainly Horrific. There is nothing exciting about it. And it can hurt you psychologically! The initial opening scenes held such a promise - a possible boarding on whether the soul is only one aspect of the brain, but the complete shambles that came with the car crash scene are without faith. No matter how hard you try, you can't break the signs. There are so many sprinkled ideas that the movie is at best a collage of offline phrases from Chinese philosophers, and in the worst case, the movie will actually make you go Brain Dead! I've bought over 300 movies on DVD, and it's the FIRST I'm going to get my money back on. STAY AWAY FROM.
