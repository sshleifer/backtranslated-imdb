60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. The NBC mini-series (later released for video / DVD as full-length movie) about the treacherous 1960s, seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. The first half of the movie is powered by Dutton's excellent pastor, Willie Taylor, and evenly spread the story between the families. However, Dutton's character is killed halfway through, and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull, incoherent, and even horrible second half. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later classified PG-13 for video / DVD release).
