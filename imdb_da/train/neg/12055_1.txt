Don't spend your money or your time on this pitiful movie in screen of film. When every third word is devoted to spooky language and there is no real plot, as well as having a cast of old actors who still provide the same dated performances of the past and have not developed in their careers, leave much to be said. I expected something better from the award-winning actor Benicio del Toro. The vision that others may have of Puertorricans will be irreversibly distorted by such waste as Maldeamore. A full word at a given time in a movie can be used to emphasize a given point of view and may even be fun or sad depending on its context (see the movie Elsa and Fred for example), but it should not permeate the plot. The film is a general shame and there was absolutely no fun or even sweet about this movie.
