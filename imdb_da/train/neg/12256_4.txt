Oh God, I must have seen this when I was only 11 or twelve (don't ask how) I could have been young, but I wasn't stupid. Everyone could see that this is a bad movie, uncomfortable, rough, rude and very stupid. I've seen more impressive effects on Disneyland, I've seen better performances in a school game, and I've seen more convincing crocodiles in the zoo where they do nothing but sit in the water and ignore the kids tipping on the glass. <br /> <br /> History is set in Northern Australia. A handful of ambitious youngsters are trying a new water sport that is surfing in shark-filled water. It soon becomes clear that something more dangerous is in the water. After learning what, they get help from a grizzly middle-aged fisherman who wants to kill the animal to avenge his family. <br /> <br /> I think I've seen every crocodile movie made in the last fifteen years, the best of which is Lake Placid, and the worst is its successor. Blood Surf will have to be the second worst croc-flick I think with Primeval and Crocodile tailing close behind. <br /> <br /> The Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there, resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths each year. Movies such as Blood Surf do not only destroy the huge picture of such a creature, but half and a half hours of the viewers' lives. Unless you really want to see it, avoid Blood Surf.
