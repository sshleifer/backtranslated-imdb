I confess to having a rather troubled sense of ghost film, and while I sometimes enjoy the genre when it comes to horror, but when it comes to comedies, they really have to be crazy to be funny. 'Over Her Dead Body' seems to be taking a little too much life, and in my opinion it fails from almost every aspect I can think of. The story is amazing, of course, and failed to convince me in the comic book or in the sentimental register. The choice of the main actresses was terrible. While Paul Rudd is at least beautiful and looks like a good guy, the taste of ladies of his character seems to need serious improvements as Eva Longoria seems too old (sorry) for him and Lake Bell seems too attractive (sorry again). A romantic story without good enough reason for romance is due to an error in the beginning. Jason Biggs and Lindsey Sloane were actually better, but they only had support roles. The rest is uninteresting and uninspired, with flat filmography and cheap gags borrowed from failed TV comedies. Nothing really worth seeing, nothing to remember.
