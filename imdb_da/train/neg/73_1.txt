This must be the worst piece of waste I've seen in a while. <br/> <br /> Heath Ledger is a heartbreaker? He looked deformed. I wish I had known that he and Naomi Watts are one thing in fact, because I spent 2 of the longest hours in my life wondering what she saw in him. <br /> <br /> Orlando Bloom is a heartthrob? With scraggly beard and deer-in-headlights look about him, I can't say I agree. <br /> <br /> Rachel Griffiths was her usual amazing self, but Geoffrey Rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get out of the set. <br /> <br /> I'm supposed to be upset by bank robbers and killers? This is far from Butch Cassidy, who was actually an entertaining movie. This was trite, cliche and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced it would get better. It didn't. <br /> <br /> The last 10-15 minutes or so was accidental fun. Heath and his gang are hailed in a green hotel, and women and children die because of their presence. It is not fun. But it was fun when they went out of the hotel with armor because all we could think of was the black knight from Monty Python and Holy Grail. I waited for them to say, "I'll bite your leg!" We chuckled with laughter, as were several other swollen members of the audience. When we left, pretty much everyone talked about what a waste of time this movie was. <br /> <br /> I may not have paid cash to see this disaster (snup preview), but it was definitely not free. It cost me 2 hours in my life that I never come back.
