I hated the way Mrs Perez portrayed Puerto Ricans! We are not all ghettos - and we speak Spanish - not Puerto Rican! I can't speak to the untrained people you've been driving in. But our language is intact, our island is our pride. Puerto Rico is better economical than any other Caribbean island! I am glad that we are not like Cuba, Dominican Republic or Haiti, free of US influence? Free in true poverty, not American standard for poverty. We are not victims, we are elastic, humble, honest and intelligent people. Our ancestors include strong African roots, but not "black" roots - I have nothing in common with black Americans 9th research. <br /> <br /> MLK was a great hero, a true revolutionary - an honest man who saw a day where we would all be free. <br /> <br /> Che Guevarra helped Castro Create Cuba today, why is the boat full of Cubans risking their lives to come to America - because Che has made a better place for them? You had a fantastic, great, light idea, but you politicized it too much. We have so many things to be proud of as a people - let us not shame our people by sacrificing ourselves. I am not a Nuyorican and therefore I cannot share your views. I am Portuguese, I speak Spanish, I am not a victim and I have been able to accomplish many of my goals in America. If there is part 2 in the future - less politics more history more stories of triumph - there are many. <br /> <br /> Damaris Maldonado
