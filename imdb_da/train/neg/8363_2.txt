I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because I think "Wongo's wild women" are worse. This is an exercise in patience. It's like having your teeth cleaned by a bad dental hygienist. There is no plot. There is no logic. There is certainly no action (although the shark has a quality dialogue). We are not wondering about anything. We don't know how people got where they got. It is always great for me how things like this are published. I agree with the previous author that it is not even fun bad. I know. It is about 90 minutes long and it will fill up much space on a DVD collection. It's like a paper weight. Or a bad painting you bought at a hungry artist's sale. It covers the crack in the wall.
