I need to qualify the title now that I think about it. Checkout is not completely worthless. I've had the opportunity to see it twice, and the second time I got a big laugh at the film's expense. So I think it's worth it. And also it is worthwhile for the unpleasant pain it caused me on my first visit. As another reviewer pointed out, this movie is hackneyed in every sense of the word. not a single original thought entered this movie (which makes the comment below about the originality of the premise completely confusing to me). the film is nothing but a large number of clich√©s that are tied together and paraded like a movie. It is certainly not the next Clerks, it is certainly not original, and it is definitely not "good, pure fun." the movie is absolutely tormented by the uninitiated (after seeing it for the first time, the second time may be quite fun, abusive). As I looked around the theater, it was obvious that almost anyone who might have excluded the elderly was totally sad or distressed by this movie. During some of the particularly emotional scenes that Nick chews out his mother, the audience was actually ringing because it was so poorly done. I have even heard some * groaning * in the theater, something I have never witnessed before. I don't care where you have the chance to watch this movie, be it in a film festival or in an indie theater, or anywhere. Do yourself a favor, skip this movie with revenge. Unless you are like me and just can't resist the ability to see what can really be the worst movie ever made.
