... except for Jon Heder. This guy poured the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The reason was entertaining. A 29-year-old slacker son (Heder) still lives with Enemor (Keaton), who happens to meet a new love (Daniels). Slacker son is jealous and eager to lose his pleasant life and try to sabotage the relationship. He also meets a girl (Faris). I really liked the performance of Daniels and especially Faris, but the one who threw Hades would be better off selling hot dogs on the beach. Honor's performance is annoying, which would be a good thing when he plays an annoying guy, the problem is that he is too bad for an actor to lose this action, making this guy equal in the final. In the end, you still want you to be able to face the guy in the face, and you are sad. In the future, any movie with this guy will be a no, go for me!
