Nothing like a movie about a group of friends who not only do not like each other when they are abominable, but they have little or no redeeming qualities to make an * audience * like or empathy with any of the characters either. There are movies so bad they are good (a la Ed Wood or Tod Slaughter movies), and it's just pretty bad (like 99% of Uwe Boll's "work"). This movie is almost unacceptable, although you are an excellently talented MSTie riff (eg Mystery Science Theater 3000). Luckily, while I'm quite talented in that respect (that's how my mind works all the time), for those who aren't as naturally talented in MSTie riffing, ultimately for * this * movie, you just want to pull your own head away, painfully aware of the movie "Taboo" deprives you of an hour and twenty minutes, you will never come back. Even my MSTie talents were hardly a struggle for this slow pace, boring waste of time. The most astonishing aspect of this movie is that * someone * green and / or funded it ... I rented "Taboo" solely to the normally talented Amber Benson who must have clearly been harassed to make this movie. I have another lesser known movie of her in my rental queue, the reviews that I could better read first. Ironically, the best aspect of the movie was the impressive labyrinthine mansion for its inner location.
