Does anyone think that this show actually helps some people, or does it just anger the people who see it? When I flip through the channels and come across this show, I'm half to keep an eye on morbid curiosity. I understand that Pat Roberson is not all. What I do not know is if his viewers are like him or if they are good people and think they will have a better life if they listen to what he has to say. Pat Roberson has a slight consequence. He is an old man who thinks in an old way. fear of condemnation no longer has the same influence as it once did (thank goodness). Now if anyone wants to please the answer to my question, I will fake lightning bolt for the rest of eternity.
