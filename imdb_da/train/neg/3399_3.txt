The birthday girl doesn't know what it will be - is it a comedy, it's a drama ... it just doesn't know. What could have been a very fun or touching movie ends in no man's land. The prerequisite is original enough to have justified a script full of interesting scenarios, but hardly delivers anything and ends up petering. It is a real shame if you look at the cast - it is very solid all the way through, but they do not get the chance to shine. Very disappointing.
