"Salaam-e-Ishq" is a beautiful but superficial comic soap opera from India that directs us with six interwoven stories of romantic love (which are at least four stories for many in my estimation). <br /> <br /> The movie looks like a cross between an MTV music video and a Super Bowl beer advertisement. The movie is an exuberant mishmash of exotic settings, dazzling colors, sexy showgirls, high-step song and dance numbers, dreams and fantasy sequences, flashing character aside, corny dialogue, and over-the-top comic performances - all pretty much standard issues things when it comes to Bollywood happenings these days. It is an exhausting chore that just tries to keep all the characters straight when dancing, prancing and embellishing through the incomprehensible story. There is plenty for the viewer to attach his eyes here - not least of all the dead dead beautiful women - but he wants patience for Job to get him all the way through.
