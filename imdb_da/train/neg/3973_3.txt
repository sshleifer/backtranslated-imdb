The action was weak, but in a horror-flick I can live with it if the story is good. It wasn't. The original event was a clumsy and obvious ploy to exploit most people's worship of children. Okay fine. Fast forward to the "place in the country" where they will recover emotionally. I like the revelation of the ghosts. Okay, yes - it will be a supernatural kind of horror story with rotting things partly in our world partly in ... where ever. Then the action begins to draw like a three-headed dog in a flurry of cats and birds. Is there a vicious force trying to attack them directly? Is there a vicious force trying to attack them? Indirectly - get people to do terrible things they wouldn't really do? Oh, wait, no, maybe the whole REGION is a kind of mental echo chamber where the surrounding discord can reverberate to murder? Okay, keep on - maybe it's really just a little mentally split "Delbert" style redneck boy who misses his mom and is on a kind of spree like a K-Tel Norman Bates turns off? Oh, yes - extra point off: the only black person seems to be the grandchild of a "Our Gang" pullman gates. The actor plays it just as much as he can give the crooked dialogue, but the fact is, his goal is "You are finished coming out, hey, boss!" At least they wrote him smart enough to GTF out there. The bit with the little girl who was silent and pulled away was absolutely creepy, as was the chicken in the shower. It was just two of a lot of delicious laps in this movie. The problem is that they are combined in disharmonious ways, like a slice of steak, a slice of chocolate and a bite of a rubber bear. Each is big on its own, but mixed up? Bleah! Such a potential. Wasted.
