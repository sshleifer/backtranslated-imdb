I don't know how to describe this movie. It's definitely one of the strangest movies I've seen for a long time. It is very disturbing at times, but also boring elsewhere. The scenes in dental torture are very elaborate and can attract anyone who is into gore and splatter. I found myself holding the teeth under some of the above scenes. The wise thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears, and the dentist is therefore quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> The movie's humor is somehow hidden and cannot be recognized by anyone. But if you're a fan of strange and weird entertainment and teeth are being drilled for dust, it's just the movie you were looking for. <br /> <br /> If you read the comment and feel somehow attracted to this kind of entertainment, try it! <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (maybe a little too strange for my taste)
