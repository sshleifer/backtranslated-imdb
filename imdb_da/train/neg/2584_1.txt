So, American Pie: Beta House is the 6th American Pie movie in the series. Though it really has nothing to do with the original three American Pie movies, unless some of the characters have to be related to the characters of the original trilogy, and Eugene Levy is in it (can't that guy get better footage?). <br /> <br /> There is very little to compliment this movie on. There are no funny jokes. The action is painful to look at, especially the girl with the "southern" accent, which more closely resembles a Canadian imitation of a British woman pretending to be a hillbilly using the word "ya'll". This movie makes me feel such an idiot. Why didn't I apply for a college where no one is in the class (but everyone gets good grades), girls always take their clothes out in the public, everyone has promiscuous unprotected sex with no burdens of babies and STIs, and you can ejaculate everywhere a girl's family photos without her thinking? Really, this series has lowered itself to the standards of softcore porn. Maybe for the next, they will finally break down and hire Ron Jeremy as a leader. I'm sure they can just tie it into the series by once removing their character Stifler's third uncle or something like that.
