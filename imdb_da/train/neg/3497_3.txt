Unfortunately for Sarah Silverman, this show does not fully compliment. The character is not even extremely sympathetic, and it is not a situation where you think "oh, she is such ib * tch i love her" just "she is such ab * tch". This character is just an ordinary old self-righteous, privilege, b * tch.Sarah seems to struggle to have to carry this show because she is the only semi fun in it. The mood, the dialogue is all so terribly dull and dry it is like listening to your grandfather continue and continue about the marble he collects as a child. <br /> <br /> The Sarah Silverman program is so incredibly boring that I thought about changing the channel to see old repetitions of married to children something that is fun because the characters are so "immoral" and "rude". I'm sorry, but I don't find a show filled with dry humor and corny off the wall story lines about something angry, bitter, losing is angry, bitter life with her annoying as hell's sister and gay friends who look like Keanu Reeves with a cold place anywhere for fun. I can't stand this show, though I generally find Sarah Silverman to be "I love her because she is such an ab * tch character" as in School Of Rock, and most of her stand up. I think this show is boring with signs that seem to be mediocre and say and do things for shock value eg. the constant pube, diarrhea and $ generally suffered from laughing. The Sarah Silverman program tries to be fun and fails it, either needs a laugh or better writers. Someone compared it to South Park, but it's not even close. I have expressed my views on The Sarah Silverman Program and will not be an annoying troll that means you can't see me being ab * tch and constantly posting things like "This show sucks" and "Why is it not canceled yet" .I don't do as The Sarah Silverman Program if you enjoy it.
