I don't know what the other review was talking about. This is definitely not a bimbo movie, in fact I don't think there was a decent-looking girl in it. No, it's just cheesy, badly done, Ed Wood-style science fiction schlock. And that's bad. I can't even begin to tell you how bad it is. I saw it late at night on cable and I was in shock. The fact that this film was ever released is an insult to us all. The actors were either the producer's friends or mentally retarded, the special effects being a joke, and the pace is insanely slow. For myself, the music tops it all. A monkey could write a better theme with a toy's xylophone. Don't rent this thing, but if you ever look at it, you should see it. You are surprised at how bad a movie can be.
