Mary Pickford becomes chief of a Scottish clan after her father's death and then has a romance. As other commentator Snow Leopard said, the movie is quite episodic to begin with. Some of it is fun, as Pickford whipping his sounds into the church, while some of it is right there. All in all, the story is weak, especially the recycled, ornate romance plot line and its climax. The transfer is so dark that it's hard to appreciate the scenery, but it doesn't seem to be director Maurice Tourneur's best work. Pickford and Tourneur once again collaborated in the somewhat more accessible 'The Poor Little Rich Girl', which writes Pickford's type rating as a child.
