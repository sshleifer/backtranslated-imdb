Movies about dinosaurs can be entertaining. Then Whoopi Goldberg can film. But Whoopi AND Dinosaurs? After the first 20 minutes of "Theodore Rex", I had come to a conclusion: this movie is malicious. Bad, vicious, evil and reprehensible despite the audience. Nothing this badly made by accident; this is the visual equivalent of a torture chamber. First and foremost, Whoopi does not make good action movies (see "Fatal Beauty" if you think I'm lying), but the filmmakers don't care - she's a tough policeman here again. <br /> <br /> See a million cop friend flicks this week? Well, here's the number one million and one, buddy. <br /> <br /> Don't you like cute, humanistic animated dinosaurs since the Spielberg TV show about them? It's too bad, here's another one, and he's also a policeman! You are one of those people who hate cargo, shooting, sloppy dialogue, boring futuristic FX and watching talented people (Goldberg, Mueller-Stahl, Roundtree) stuck in a movie that looks like a tax depreciation? A big tax write-off? <br /> <br /> And you read this review all the way to the end. You DESERVE a successor. Seriously. <br /> <br /> No stars, not one. And if they really make a sequel to "Theodore Rex," Hollywood deserves to be attacked by a whole herd of cleverly crushing foam rubber idols. Now I want to pay to see it.
