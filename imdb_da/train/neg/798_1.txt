Okay, the movie is good, but I give it a 1 because the idea that a computer virus becomes an organic virus is pure adventure. This kind of crap just adds to the uncomplicated miss moron's paranoid delusions that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus. First of all, strings of code and dozens of 1s and 0s add up to computer viruses. An organic virus is much more complex, although it is tinier. While considered as one of the simplest forms in the universe, organic viruses increase hollowness in your cells and attach to the RNA, and then change your own RNA code. Explain to me how something like this could be treated from a screen? Perhaps the radiation has some effect on the user's cornea, which makes your eyes in these viruses? I could see it, but of course the author didn't think about it.
