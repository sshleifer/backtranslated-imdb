The first "Home Alone" was one of the funniest movies from the 90s. The second was as much fun with the same cast and jokes! Now comes "Home Alone 3". I was curious how they could continue with the same story when Kevin would have been 17 in 1997. He could take care of himself, right? So what does the instructor decide to do? He takes a child just as annoying and makes him sick. The child is like 6 years and the mother leaves him alone in the house? What kind of team of burghers are these idiots? I don't really want to get the details in detail if you want to watch this movie. But thank you, I would recommend that you stay away from it. It is not worth your precious time. Go fold a piece of paper, make decorations, balance a pencil on your nose or take a nap! It is better to do so to see "Home Alone 3"! <br /> <br /> 1/10
