I rented this movie to see what could be a bloody, non-stop action movie and get this overly-animated and super-cheap low-budget action drama that makes Kickboxer look like Die Hard. Lou and Reb are in Vietnam and when Lou saves rope from the gambling, he is shot in the head of what is easily one of the worst effects ever. The Vietnam scenes are shot in any backyard, I swear! Lou is now brain damage, and Reb and he live together and own a bar. Super homoerotic. Lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money, and Reb goes on a killing to get him back. There are no good fighting scenes at all, the punches are two inches away from a person. Character personalities change within seconds. A guy is bad, and in the next scene he is good. The act is horrible, and the music is something too sentimental Frank Stallone's sounding song that would make you sick. I hated this movie.
