Another variation and improvisation on the famous and beloved children's story, La Bee (1975) aka The Beast is trying to imagine (very graphic and what may seem offensive and disruptive, but in reality rather stupid and comical way), what actually happened between Beauty and the monster? I am entertained by many reviews and comments that seem too deep into this movie. I would not go so far as to say that it is a serious and dark exploration of such issues as sexual frustration, longing, fulfillment or satirical criticism of the Catholic religion. I wouldn't even call it a horror-erotic movie. It is more of a parody of all genres it touches or mentions, although it has some shocking moments in all departments that will surely remain in your memory. The long (far too long) scene between an aristocratic young woman and the seemingly horrible but the most ridiculous I have ever seen in the film with really impressive ... well anatomy, is set to Scarlatti's clavichord music and is hysterical. My husband and I both laughed at exaggerated details of the meeting. The scene's morality is - beauty can and will defeat the monster. The question is - who is the target audience for the movie? For an erotic image it is too noble; for an art film - it has too many jaw-dropping scenes of pure madness and I would say a sudden ending. IMO, the film maker did not make a serious drama. As a parody of the art house / horror / erotic it is fun and certainly original. Get a good laugh and try not to look for a deep meaning. This story of the curious beauties and the delightful animals is certainly not recommended for the children. The opening scene, which can shock an unprepared viewer much more than the infamous scene of bestiality, can successfully be used on the Discovery channel for the program as "In the World of Animals - Pairing Habits and Ritual Horses".
