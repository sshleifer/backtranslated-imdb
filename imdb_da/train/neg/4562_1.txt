I did not feel like I had been raped as I did with ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS, but BELLE'S MAGICAL WORLD is still antithesis of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. As a greeting BMW hates its audience, but not so much. It's ugly, uncanonical, idiotic, and the writing is terribly bad. None of the stories work. It's not the characters we loved by BATB at all, they are a bunch of podfolk. I would dissect it, but after a few minutes I gave up because no one in their real mind would take that blow seriously. What we have here are three stories. "The perfect word" is an indulgent, caring study of forgiveness. "Fifi's Folly" works only if you can accept that Babette's name is actually Fifi, and that she is a creator of James Bond's scourge and that Lumiere is an idiot about women. The "Broken Wing" (or "Broken Wind" that I like to call it) is probably the most promising of the pile. Beast hates birds? Since when? Don't look at this crap-every copy of this video deserves to be cremated. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is still a cinematic classic, a transcendent celebration of love, art, intelligence and human soul.
