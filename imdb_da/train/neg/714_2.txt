This is a movie of tired but oddly childish clich√©s. There is a Nazi witchmaker who performs sf-related experiments in the basement? Oh thank you! <br /> <br /> The purpose of an insidious horror and fear is the general impression of the movie that it is a very immature perception of scare. I don't have any expectations in advance, I'm back with: an aged Xander from Buffy and a heroine with a monkey-like face who doesn't seem to know how to act. Said Adrienne Barbeau I have only experienced before in the much more comfortable "Cannibal Women in Avocado Jungle of Death". Camera and editing add to the general impression of lame.
