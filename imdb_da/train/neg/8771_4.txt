Okay, I was bored and decided to watch this movie. But I think the most important thing that brought this movie down was that there would be one hour of recording, so basically the same hour repeated 4 times. It consists of 1. Collects the troops and discusses the attack plan. 2. Flashbacks to the men's wives 3. The troop approach marches into a wide variety of 4. Men run uphill and shoot, usually the first being shot in the head then rescuing 3 other men. 5. The enemy's defeat and call to base to tell about success 6. Men flash back to wives and sing 10 minutes of songs. It was the basic movie, and the same sequence of events happened about 4 or 5 times. And every time it made a flashback to the wives, it would show the man, then his wife and him. There were about 10 men or more who wanted a feedback so it took a long time. Apart from that, the men could not kill their enemy except with bayonets or grenades. I liked the music and there were a lot of actions, even though the action was repetitive. Overall, I probably wouldn't see it again, but it wasn't that terrible.
