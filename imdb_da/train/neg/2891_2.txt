I start writing this review during a break when I watch the movie. It's the first time I've tried to do that, but I have trouble getting through this without occasional breaks. It's not because it's intense, but because it's bad. It's almost painfully boring and incredible, especially when the preternaturally robust dying brother Ryan (Colm Feore) on the screen is tragic and bitchy, self-indulgent and self-pitying. This would have been a much better movie if they had just left the character out of the story. <br /> <br /> He adds nothing but mawkish, maudlin, very annoying melodrama. Maybe someone decided that if they couldn't make Ryan credible, they would just make him uncomfortable. The problem with that is: Who cares about a spoiled, whining, unpleasant tremor is dying? Not me. The only thing this character has on his way to him is that he dies and apologizes, but that is just not enough. Death makes no special. We are all dying sooner or later. It does not give any right to expect sympathy while they act like a jerk. The other two characters, and the actors who play them (David Cubitt as Theo and Chandra West as Sarah), are much more interesting, and their story, without Ryson's self-disruptive disturbances, would have made a much better movie. But it's not over yet, and it's time to turn PLAY back on. Maybe something good happens before the end. <br /> <br /> No. Pardon. This hired turkey goes back tonight!
