I don't like Sean Penn's instructions very much, and this early work, The Indian Runner, is no exception. The film has no core, it is colored with a kind of redneck, anti-authoritarian tweeness, who honestly holds most of Penn's work, his latest work even more than before. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, seems to produce such a fundamentally banal product, apparently in some fidelity to honesty, but ends up being glorified pro wrestling matched and moralistic, almost as if Hallmark cards had developed one line of Hell's Angels greetings, and bring me to the days of longing, which is a fine movie. Viggo Mortensen's play is much, much more credible here than the ridiculous eastern promises he made with Cronenberg, and it's about it. The movie is dead meaningless, and seems to be an exercise, a series of techniques, more than a story. Kudos for Charles Bronson, however, proving he can act. And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis' character. A miserable 3 out of 10 for this Indian Runner crap.
