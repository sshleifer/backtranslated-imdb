I sat in this movie tonight and forced myself to hold on to it even though I never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them because the two leads, Gérard Philippe and Michèle Morgan, were great movie stars in their The era and I wanted to see them in "something else", which it certainly was. They both gave good performances, but of unpleasant figures. In fact, the whole movie is about a shabby little town in Mexico inhabited by almost uniform unpleasant signs (the doctor is of course the greatest exception). What Michèle Morgan ever sees in Philippe to fall in love with him is never explained. <br /> <br /> This is allegedly based on a work by Jean-Paul Sartre. All I could think was that if Sartre's work is something like this movie, it must be a very mediocre attempt to imitate Camus's masterful novel The Pest, which treated a plague in North Africa. <br /> <br /> A well-behaved but uninteresting film.
