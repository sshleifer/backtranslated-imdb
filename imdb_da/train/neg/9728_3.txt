Tobe Hooper made amazing movies so I was sure this couldn't be bad. I haven't read any reviews and tried to see this unintentional humorous movie. Sometimes it made me laugh, sometimes I almost fell asleep, sometimes I almost made CRY for Hooper. I rated this 3/10 because its 1990 "horror" movie and many interesting or funny things happened there. Throughout the film I thought of something like "they just can't add more stuff to this movie ..." .. but they did. <br /> <br /> Some say this is a kind of Firestarter clone, but really isn't. It's based on that idea, but that's all. This is a combination of horror, comedy, strange religion / god stuff, fun doing, simple effects, drama, horrible acting, incredible script .. and more. <br /> <br /> * spoilers * History is: Government tries to create ultimate weapons using nuclear power or something and fails, while process children are born 2 subjects. When mother sings to her child after birth, both husband and wife burn and that is SPONTANEOUS CONSUMPTION. The government buries the whole thing and lets this child live among other people and ... then after x years this child has grown up and realizes that he has been born for a reason and who he can burn things with his brains. So, everything goes incredibly cluttered, nothing really explains anything and .. Well, when the government recognizes "okay now he can put this fire to work" they take him to the normal hospital where some nuclear toxic is what they need on this man they could kill him, no they can't shoot him no! .. and argh, i think that's enough to tell, i promise there are 100 more weird things in this movie. Well, if you want good laugh, take it here. Gosh.
