The second attempt by an intellectual New York in less than 10 years to make a "Swedish" movie - the first is Susan Sontag's "Brother Carl" (which was made in Sweden, with Swedish actors, no less!) The results? Oscar Wilde said it best, referring to Dickens 'The Old Curiosity Shop': "You should have a heart of stone not to laugh loudly at Little Nell's death." Almost much the same here. "Interiors" are chock full of solemn intoned howlers. ("I'm afraid of my anger." Looking into the distance: "I don't like who I am.") The direct quotes (to use a polite expression) from Bergman are close to parody. The incredibly self-reliant family keeps us aware of how brilliant and talented they are, to the point of suffocation. ("I read you a poem the other day. It was in - I don't know - New Yorker." "Oh. It was an old poem. I processed it.") Far from not worrying about these people, but I found them quite hilarious. Much of the dialogue is exactly like the fun stuff from Allen's previous movie - only he instructed his actors to play the lines straight. As he has not thrown into the movie, he has poor Mary Beth Hurt copy all his thespian tics, intonations and neurotic habits that make her an embarrassing surrogate (like Kenneth Branagh in "Celebrity"). <br /> <br /> The basic plot - dysfunctional family with quiet dominant mother - seems to be lifted more or less from Bergman's "Winter Light", the basic family melodrama cheated up with a lot of existential anxiety. It's all the time in the business visual / sound-proof tricks: The deaf scraping of a pencil on paper, the towering surf that dwells on the people walking on the beach. etc, etc. <br /> <br /> Everyone's later "serious" movies are less embarrassing, but also far less entertaining. I take "Interiors." Woody has rarely made a more fun movie.
