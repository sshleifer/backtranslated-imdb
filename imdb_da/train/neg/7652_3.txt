In 1967, my workers find the remains of an ancient civilization known as Abkani, who believes that there are the worlds of light and darkness. When they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago, some evil went through before the gate was closed. 28 years ago, the Paranormal Research Agency Bureau 713 government was instructed by Professor Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), who conducted orphan tests. At present, one of these children is the paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), who has just been given an abkani artifact in South America and chased by a man of skill. When an old friend of the foster house disappears in the middle of the night, he reveals that demons return to Earth. With the support of the anthropologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid) and the head of the Bureau 713, Cmdr. Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff) and his troop, they fight against evil creatures. <br /> <br /> Despite having a charismatic good casting led by Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, "Alone in the Dark" never works and is a complete mess, without the development of characters or plot . The reason can be explained by the brilliant interview of director Uwe Boll in the DVD's enhancement, saying that "video games are the best sellers of the younger generations who are no longer run by books". In addition, his target audience would be people between the ages of twelve and twenty-five years old. Sorry, but I find both allegations disrespectful with the younger generations. I have a daughter and a son, and I know many of their friends, and they are not the kind of stupid stereotype that the director says. Furthermore, IMDb provides excellent statistics to show that Mr. Uwe Ball is completely wrong. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Alone in the Dark" O Despertar do Mal "(" Alone in the Dark "The Awakening of the Evil")
