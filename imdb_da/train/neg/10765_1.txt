An excellent example of how Hollywood could (and still can) take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly destroy it. <br /> <br /> In the case of "The Big Sky", author Dudley Nichols and the company arrogantly adopted a classic pioneer novel by Pulitzer award-winning author, AB Guthrie. In this way, they removed the soul of history and every edge and influence it might have had as a film adaptation. The epic character of Guthri's book and the evolution of the protagonist, Boone Caudill, from a naive, Kentucky let in a hardened and competent survivor / mountaineer, has been replaced with a scaled-down riverboat farce that doesn't resemble the author's intention. In the film version, Boone's presence is nothing but subversive. <br /> <br /> Exciting and even shocking plate elements that give Guthrie's romance and excitement have been eliminated for no apparent reason. The most confusing thing of all is the emphasis on the Zeb Calloway character, which was a random, minor character in the book, which only seizes a handful of pages. On the other hand, a very important and fascinating character, Dick Summers, Veteran Pioneer, completely lacks !!! It is also evident that Director Hawks decided the Zeb character in the movie, played by actor Hunnicutt, was not annoying enough. So Zeb / Hunnicutt got a significant portion of the time doing the unpleasant, voice-over tale that is Hollywood shortcut for incompetent screen writing, editing and direction. <br /> <br /> Some movies are actually enhanced on books on which they were based (William Wyler's "Ben-Hur" is an excellent example). But it is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel, but as a movie to itself. The story is boring and clich√©d, and the characters - at least those not edited out of the script - are just superficial and boring shadows of Guthri's literary vision. And unfortunately, Kirk Douglas' star apple, which could have helped lift this movie, was scolded by the milestone role he got. <br /> <br /> If you can, the movie version of Guthri's Pulitzer Award-winning sequel "The West Sky", which also stares Kirk, is even worse. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Big Sky" further strengthens Howard Hawks' place as one of the most overrated, lukewarm leaders in film history.
