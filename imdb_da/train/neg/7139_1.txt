Redline is a knockoff of Fast & Furious, without any of the redeeming qualities. It doesn't have to have a coinciding plot with multiple twists and surprises, but it needs something! This is similar to a porn movie in which the story and the dialogue consist of 60 seconds at the beginning and the same at the end. Except that this is worse because you don't get your money's worth. Mind-numbingly boring, impossible race sequences, and a terribly waste of expensive beautiful cars that almost acquire negative points for appearing in this movie. Yes, it's hot, but who is desperate for a woman on the screen? I want the director to sit there with a hat full of dialogue and plot drawings and chess an 8 ball each time they changed scenes. No serious person running or knowing about it would watch this movie and enjoy race scenes.
