Tasteless. I can't even write intelligently about the movie. I laughed the whole movie. It shouldn't be fun. Matt Farnsworth has no idea what he is doing. His story is written, it works without any knowledge of the Iowa culture and the meth problem. I know Farnsworth is from Iowa, making his movie even more confusing to me. Why do the two main characters have accents? It makes no sense. The action was at best mediocre and sometimes difficult to see. Gratituous violence and six full movie. I guess the violence and the sex would make the movie edgy, but it came across as incredible and offensive. The end of the movie is so brilliant bad that all I could do was laugh and look at the rolling credits with disbelief. When I left the theater, everyone else left, laughing with me. The end of the movie was meant to cause tears, but it did the opposite. Don't waste your time on this horrible movie unless you want to see ignorant, sappy, exaggerated, clich√©d drivel.
