I could mention many funny movies. There are comedies that were fun, and are. Some movies, such as A Gymkata, trying to be serious, but end up being fun. The Ladies Man is a movie that desperately tries to be fun, but could not be less fun if it was a guy who got many chickens in the middle of the wreck of a nuclear holocaust. It's anti-fun. <br /> <br /> I don't think I'm laughing harder than a chuckle on something in this movie. It is simply unfunny. It's boring, stupid, scary, annoying, insane, but not fun. I'm not paying particular attention to Tim Meadows, or this character from SNL, but I expected better than this. <br /> <br /> The film lacks logic or common sense. It's as if the scriptwriter had a bag over his head while he was writing and he couldn't see which keys he hit. They tell the "Origin" of Ladies Man, but fail to include a motivation for its bizarre fascination with acting as it is still seventies. The film tries to get humor out of a man who seems to care for porn, shortly after he tried to hang out. This is comedy? I like to consider that I have a great sense of humor (spend a lot of time writing comedy as I do), but maybe I'm just not quite clear enough for this movie. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans, as funny as Tucker in There is something about Mary, is outrageously bad here. I asked for him in the head to shut up. <br /> <br /> In the end, I was breathing on my chair, mumbling under my breath, and if the movie had gone, it would probably have tried suicide. This movie may not be as bad as Battlefield Earth, but it's the first movie I've seen that has come close. <br /> <br />
