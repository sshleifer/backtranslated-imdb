Bah. Another tired, desultory recast of an out of copyright work that has never been designed to be filmed. On the plus side, Toni Collette is excellent as always (being a current actress you see) and there are some nicely handled transfers between scenes. There are even a few really fun lines, and the film work, the score and the editing are competent, except for a bizarre decay in voiceover and talking to the camera against the conclusion. But ah, but. Much of the casting seems to be on autopilot, and they are almost all very clear to old (and in one case too young) for their stated ages. Worse, they all talk "austin", the peculiar falsetto self-satisfied song song that could not be further from the way people actually spoke at Austen's day (think Yosemite Sam, I'm not asking you). This is particularly sad when we finally see the decline of the equally far-flung "Fakespearan" that Olivier and his companions were so happy to bully on top of their lungs. And worst of all is Gwyneth Paltrow. She has only ever played a character in her film, and she remains true to form here and runs through her entire range (smearing to sulking) for the first ten minutes, and then repeating herself for the rest of the long film. There is absolutely no chemistry between herself and any of her admirers, nor any apparent reason why they would be interested in her apart. In short, there is very little reason to see Emma. It's a gracious enough adaptation, but if you have to pack a movie full of anachronism (that is, a beautifully thin lead that can't shoot a bow or handle an accent), then you might as well do it properly as with far better "Clueless".
