"Raising Victor Vargas" is one of the bright, family movies you can see and do N.Y. Times crossword at the same time. And if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a corona, you don't need the "pause" DVD. Just let it roll, because you won't miss something really important. No twists, turns or tensions. It's not really an ethnic movie, it's a movie about a poor, fighting immigrant family that happens to be latino. They could have been no ethnic group. It made very little difference. I've seen it all a zillion times before. Just join a Jewish family, an Italian family, a black family, or an Irish family. Just accents and names were different. If the Vargas family were called Bush or Clinton and were presbyterians, the movie would have been a total snooze. <br /> <br /> It's fun that the critics here couldn't get the site right. Some said it was Spanish Harlem. Some Bronx and another Brooklyn. As a lifelong New Yorker, I vote for the Lower East Side. And it seemed that the family never met with anyone except other latinos. They lived in an isolated / isolated small enclave. Some interactions with non-latinos may have caused some excitement, interest or excitement. Remember West Side Story? <br /> <br /> And now for the often criticized movie. I do not know if it was my TV or what, but all indoor shots so much ORANGE to me. The apt, the furniture and the faces were all ORANGE. What would that mean? And the apt. so beautiful to me. Someone here mentioned that the old apartments had very large rooms. Well, maybe 50 years ago. What landlords have done is to break up a large apt in 2 or 3 very small and push as many immigrants as they can into them. <br /> <br /> And another annoying thing .... This is the second family movie I've seen and criticized this week that highlighted a teenage girl "appalling." Is this private sex action necessary for us to see? Please save me! What about these directors? <br /> <br /> So "Victor Vargas" is a pleasant little movie. It was nice for a change to see young Latin actors given a break and a chance to show their talents as they did. But the authors shut them down and give them a flat, unspecific script to work with. Enjoy the show, but keep your fingers close to the "fast forward" button.
