There is so little here in the amazing Anne Rice book that what is here does not make sense. Some of the characters - intense and surprising characters - do not make it to the screen at all, and those who do win down to the point that there is no reason for their existence. <br /> <br /> Where is the relationship between Christophe and Marcel? Where is the continuing affair between Marcel and Juliet? Why does Dolly Rose seem at all when her story has never been explained? Where is Marie's rape and redemption, whose greatest attribute (and doom) is that she can pass for white - and her marriage to Richard? Why does the movie end with Marcel's blow in the hands of his father? We learn nothing about Aglae beyond what she is a bitch who hates her husband; Why is there no backstory that explains this hate? <br /> <br /> Regarding the performances, there is not one that is better than mediocre, though probably due to the miserable script. The best part of the party is that the actor plays Richard - but Richard is not on the screen enough to save the movie. The worst is Jasmine Guy as Dolly Rose, but again it comes down to the actress who has nothing to do with what little she gets to work with. All in all, this is just awful. I thought it would be impossible for any Anne Rice book-turned movie to be worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but FEAST OF ALL SAINTS makes that mess a critical hit. How is it that rice is such a blunt she will let her best works become so unwanted on the screen?
