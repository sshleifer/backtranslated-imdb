I haven't seen many low-cost movies I have to admit, but it's the worst movie ever enough, the protagonist the old man talked about, he had a lobotomy and lost power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds, a 5 year old could Shop better. The story had the most horrible plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was an army, and then he just went over the top, I just looked at laughing, how bad it was and hoped it was the leader of the real movie . I can't believe it was under 2 night rental stuff by blockbusters, instead of a please take it for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was a semi-decent actor other than the woman, I think the only thing that was ok with the budget was the make-up, but they show all the important scenes in the movie at the beginning music bit. Awful simply awful.
