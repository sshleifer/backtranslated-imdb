What really makes me hear about this movie (that is, the case of this movie that makes me physically ill) is that somebody has actually paid to make it. There is absolutely no meaning for the existence of this movie. It's not scary, it's not thought-provoking, it's not entertaining, it's not good. It is a sleeping pill made of cyanide. The DVD case compares it to Blair Witch, Evil Dead, and a few other decent films that make the filmmaker's desperation obvious. It's nothing like any other movie ever made; It is far far worse. The claims of an "extremely shocking ending you will never forget" correspond to a ton of smelly horse drops. Never waste your time watching this piece of waste because it can make you sterile. The man who wrote this movie must be deleted by the Writer's Guild member list and must never be filmed again. Because if he thought it was a movie worth doing, he probably doesn't have much to offer in the future. Zero stars. May Grod has mercy on the soul of someone who is unlucky enough to see this. I have to go vomit now.
