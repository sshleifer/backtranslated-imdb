Another movie that relies on the sad, worn clich√© of the mad scientist has become mad. The film is centered around a surgeon whose life's ambition is to bring the dead back to life. I know I know ... you've never heard one before! Of course, as all these movies go, the experiment goes very, very wrong, creating a manic, bloodthirsty being. For this promising setup, you think it would be at least a little exciting. Wrong. Like many movies in this era, the idea is good, but the performance and script are mediocre. Not the worst horror movie I've seen (no, Abominator: Evilmaker 2 still takes the cake) ... but not one of the gems, neither.
