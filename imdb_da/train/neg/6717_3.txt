This was god horrible. The story was everywhere, and more often than not I was confused because of horrible editing. I felt no sympathy for anyone because their characters were not developed enough. They were extremely superficial people without dimension. Cheesy, cheesy stereotypes with subplots that went nowhere. The stripper chick was just a distraction, though she was decent looking. I don't know what this was trying to be, but how shocked was I when they showed this garbage on Sundance? I almost canceled my subscription. You would think a channel like it would show more quality movies. There are much, much better gay and lesbian theme movies out there. "The Celluloid Closet" is an excellent documentary. I thoroughly enjoyed "Wigstock: The Movie". I'm sure there are others who have been looking forward to me at the moment, but what I am trying to say is that this was just not worth it. If you catch it on TV, ok, but otherwise do not interfere. <br /> <br /> There were maybe three or four shots that looked really nice (sad, I can count them on one side), otherwise the cinematography was pretty crazy too. The lighting was far away in many places. I think some of the effects were used to try to add to something that almost didn't matter. <br /> <br /> I can't deny Johnny Rebel is pretty hot (without the blonde hair of course). Too bad his acting did nothing to me. Stick with real porn, buddy. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
