While the original titles of the intellect, this inexpensive remake is designed solely to shock the sensibilities. Instead of intricate plot twists, this so-called thriller simply contains sudden and seemingly random historical changes that only serve to debase it further with every bizarre development. Worst of all, replacing the original spicy dialogue is a overthrown salt-filled full of unnecessary four-letter words, leaving a sharp but uninteresting flavor. There was promise - unfulfilled promise. The prospect of Michael Caine, who draws a Patty Duke-like Keller-to-Sullivan exam, is certainly exciting. Unfortunately, this brilliant and respected actor has only sensed his reputation, first by accepting the role of this horrible re-scripted nonsense and then turning into a performance that only looks competent to Jude Law's amateurish overactivation. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the classic original, you overlook the dated pictures and gimmicks. Hunt it down, see it, and just enjoy a story and a half. Regarding remake, this insult passes to the original.
