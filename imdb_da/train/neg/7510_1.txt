The movie is a collection of cliches on almost everything out there. It has no focus at all, no goals, no real message. Symbolism is pushed over the top, and stereotyping is abundant and scandalous. This movie cannot resist the temptation to make drama where there does not exist. Every little exchange of words immediately turns into a long-standing, unjustified dialogue, which is so typical of a play. Where there is no substance for this exchange, the actors (no matter how good they usually are) cannot help with excessive emotions, including "raising the stakes". To act, to put it simply. The management is without help here. Nothing can save this non-story. It is forced, forged and boring for tears. Inaccuracies in portaraying punk rock with The Who, piercings and flashy 90's outfits. Characters roam without a role, detail and motif. Places are arbitrary. This is Boogie Nights with The Good Fellas with Saturday night fever, with meaning and art ripped out. <br /> <br /> Good DP. I'll give it that. <br /> <br /> Some movies have errors. This movie is Lee's mistake. He sold like the rest of them. Was irrelevant. He has nothing of interest to say more. <br /> <br /> I have no desire to see anything again from this guy (which I will refrain from naming from now on).
