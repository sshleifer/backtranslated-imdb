I rarely moved to comment online about a movie. But I can't understand how this was made. Who did it? How could they have thought they were able to make a feature film? Did they do a weekend course at some film schools, get a good big check from dad and kidnapped David Badiel's family one by one until he agreed to be in it? Or was he by chance a long-standing family friend / distant relationship making this out of clean, misplaced friendliness? I don't care, won't know. Even he looks very embarrassed about being in it, muttering his lines and saving his face from the camera. Meanwhile, the DOP must have been gaffs from neighbors, there seemed to be absolutely no sound design, the manuscript, the direction and the editing were all immense, and frankly, the apathy that overwhelm me right now means I can't be bothered by using More of my life thinking about this movie.
