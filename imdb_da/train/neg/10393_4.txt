Okay, you have: <br /> <br /> Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-Tweed, B.B.E. (Backbone of England.) She's killed in the first scene - that's right, folks; This show has no backbone! Peter O'Toole as Ol's colonel from the first war and now the famous lord of the manor. <br /> <br /> Joanna Lumley as the ensweatered Lady of the Manor, 20 years younger than the Colonel and 20 years past her own prime, but still glamorous (Brit spelling, not mine) enough to have a toy player on the side. It's okay, they have Col. Cricket's full knowledge and consent (those guys even come around for Christmas!) Still, she's mostly faced with the colonel enough to have said toy boys their own age (what crazy!) <br /> <br /> David McCallum who said toy-boy, just as pointless glamorous as his press. Pilcher could not provide any cover for him in the story, so she gave him a hush-hush job at Circus. <br /> <br /> And finally: <br /> <br /> Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups, Venerable Headmistress by the venerable girls boarding school serving tea in the office with a touch of deep, exciting advice for life in the outside world just before the exam. Her best advice: "I've only been to Nancherrow, the local Stately Home of England. I thought it was very beautiful, but somehow not part of the real world." Well, we can't say they didn't warn us. <br /> <br /> Ah, Susan - the time was, your character would have run the whole show. They don't write them anymore. Our loss, not yours. <br /> <br /> So - with a cast and setting like this, you have re-makings of "Brideshead Revisited," right? <br /> <br /> Wrong! They took these 1-dimensional support roles because they paid as well. After all, acting is one of the oldest temp jobs there is (you are called another!) First warning sign: lots and lots of backlighting. They come around by shooting outdoors - "Hey, it's just sunlight!". Second warning sign: Leading Lady cries a lot. When not laughing, the eyes are moist. It is the law of Romanesque novels: The leading Lady is "deep eye." <br /> <br /> Looking ahead, leading Lady will be known as LL <br /> <br /> Third Warning Sign: LL actually has stars in her eyes when she is in love. Still, I will give Emily Mortimer a prize just for having to deal with the spotlight in her eyes (I wonder. Used those contacts?) And finally, fourth warning sign: no one on the screen female character is "wife" she is either "Miss "or" The Lady ". When everything was said and done, I still couldn't tell you who was pursuing who and why. I couldn't even tell you what was said and done. <br /> <br /> In summary, they all live through World War II without anything at all. <br /> <br /> In the end, LL finds she lost her parents to the Japanese prison camps, and baby sis comes home catatonically. Meanwhile (there is always an "in the meantime") a young young LL had a crush on (when I didn't know it) coming home from some warlike spots and found on the street at Lady of the Manor (must be some street if she must find him there.) Both war accidents are whisked away to recover at Nancherrow (some must be "whisked away" NEXT in these romance stories!) Great drama.
