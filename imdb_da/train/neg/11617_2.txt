This movie "Joshua" is extremely disturbing and even meaningless. It actually makes me shake to think there are people who would like to see it. Without telling the story, it's about a young boy's reaction to his newborn sister, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Throughout this film, the viewer is exposed to some of the most disturbing notions of child behavior. Accidental damages, at the end of this movie, there is absolutely no real result except for the exercise of purely evil in the hands of a child, no less who adorned a whole group of stupid adults. There is no redemption, no justice earned, and a whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what's going on around them. Frankly, I didn't like watching this movie. It was extremely disturbing. Even for those who might like horror movies, this movie can be too much. Despite the fact that this film was well-acted, the story itself is so disturbing that it looks like it is a 90-minute wait in a dental waiting room in anticipation of a painful dental procedure.
