The title above is used to introduce the movie "Gen" to the audience. Gen is about a young doctor (Doga Rutkay) with a sick mother. The movie starts with her leaving her mother behind to start her new job. While she is driving, we realize that she is not as close to home as the hospital is in a remote area. As soon as she enters the hospital's garden, she sees the body of death in a patient. This is the beginning of a nightmare the next few days. <br /> <br /> Two police officers come to the hospital to investigate the suicide. In fact, they have to stay in the hospital because all roads are cut off due to bad weather conditions. All their communication with the outside world is also cut off. There is no way out !! In the few days there will be more unpleasant murders. Now everyone suspects apart. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the idea is brilliant. It could have been very scary indeed. Of course, there are positive aspects of the film. I really like the start of the movie. Especially when she goes to the hospital and her first moments in the hospital. Actions are okay. Some of them are trying too hard to be mysterious and scary. I think the final shock should have spread throughout the film. What I say is that it was a good twist, but instead of showing it as a parody in the end, we should have realized that when we see what happens. The director needed to explain the whole thing that I think didn't work well. Also, the most dangerous patient in the movie must be at least 48 years old, but his body looks so young and fits a person who spends most of his life in this hospital. Finally, I would like to say a few things about the director. I'm sure he'll improve. This is his first attempt. I recently found out that he is only 21 years old. It made me feel more positive about him and his future films. I will not rate this movie * out of ***** though.
