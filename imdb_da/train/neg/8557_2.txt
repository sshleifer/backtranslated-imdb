I admire 'Kissing on the Mouth' for its sincerity ?? sharp hairline and masturbation, especially from the leader / director Joe Swanberg. They were not afraid to show faith in everyday "private" events. Unfortunately, the film falls under 'The Brown Bunny' rich, but with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy. Yes, it mirrors 'Bunny' with a lot of nothing going on, or too many movie shots focused (or sincerely unfocused) on absolutely nothing ?? feet, hands or genitals. Again, unfortunately, I can see why this film was released and why people rent: true life views and full frontal (as well as man and woman) nudity. Apart from that, it was a complete waste of time. We quickly learn from an after-fellow male / female roommate, where he has obvious feelings for the female who sees him as a friend while constantly having sex with her ex-boyfriend. Apart from that, we are exposed to everyday events in their dull lives: she works for her parents; He works on an extremely uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer. In order for this whole to work, the dialogue must be interesting and the real reality. Neither work nor it is so boring to see anyone driving for an hour, ie 'The Brown Bunny'. The only actress who stands out is Kate Winterich, and she herself does something dubious. (DVD extra with her in front of a mike is actually worth seeing / listening to.) Again, I admire the filmmakers, especially Swanberg, to shave everything and not be afraid to expose themselves or shower habits, but generally the film falls flat. It has stories that do not fit the scenes, too many boring everyday events and convincing action that you wonder about than the soft porn factor why you rented this.
