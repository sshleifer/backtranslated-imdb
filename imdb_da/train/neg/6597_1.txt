This is far worse than the horrible Laurel and Hardy cartoons from the 60s. They were awful, but at least they were the simple ripoffs of a then Stan and Ollie revival. The new audience had rediscovered the couple's comic genius, and the comics were fun numbing waste aimed at cash in children's interest. It was to be expected. But how do you even try to rationalize this work ... I can't even think of a word. I'm sure decision makers hoped it would somehow inspire another Laurel and Hardy revival, but you can't inspire interests in the past with a low and eerie caricature of what made the original so appealing. The Impressionists (I hesitate to call them actors) do a Vegas action and this is where it belongs. The reason is even flimsier than those used in the old days, and trying to stretch two-wheel ideas into a feature. If this movie was someone's first exposure to REAL Laurel and Hardy, I'm sure the viewer would reject the original duo's reputation as senility has gone crazy. The only movie I hate worse than this is I eat at your grave. And you know these filmmakers did pretty much the same to Stan and Ollie.
