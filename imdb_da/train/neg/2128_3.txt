Inevitable remake, and it can't get close to capturing the charm of the original. The extreme length causes more than a few yawning inducing parts. This version is ridiculously politically correct. The film lacks style, and it lacks virtually talent, not only with acting, but direction, set, costumes, etc. Are all under par. It has a blatant disregard for periodic rules. Vanessa Williams is the only cast member to show any flair, Tyne Daly is not too bad. They should have left well enough alone. The song spans well (Vanessa Williams) to the poor (everyone else). See the original version of 1963 and skip it. There is not much to recommend here.
