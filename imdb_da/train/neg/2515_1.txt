This film is an abomination and its representation should have been considered a capital crime. <br /> <br /> One of the great mysteries of film making is why no one has ever made a fitting movie adaptation of this wonderful mystery. It is a tale of a really gripping mystery, lovely old-fashioned romance and dry English humor. Why should decision makers change Richard Gordon from a Scotland Yard policeman to an amateur detective, introduce his English servant's idiotic role and change his main story of the murder charge and circumstances of Gordon's struggle to save the accused, etc., etc.? These manufacturers and directors, who always think they can make a better story than the one in the book, should write the original script themselves and not rape another person's product.
