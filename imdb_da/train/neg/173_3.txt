A decent sequel, but does not pack the trunk of the original. A murderous scriptwriter (Judd Nelson) takes on new identities to direct his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. Still reckless kill, but movies seem very heavy-in-cheek. Any humor is not the funny kind. Overall project seems to have the quality of a quickie and at times Nelson is way above the top. This movie is about a script that is rewritten before going to the screen ... this should have been the case with this script.
