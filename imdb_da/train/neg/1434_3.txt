James Bond in the desert? Well, it looks like: Pierce Brosnan is, after all, best known as Bond in "Tomorrow Never Dies" (1997) and "Golden Eye" (1995) - both shots before this release. Frankly, the film's two leaders are both mistreated, and Brosnan turns to the marginally more convincing performance, and with Annie Galipeau (like Pony, Gray Owl's love interest) having to contend with carelessly written dialogue. <br /> <br /> By contrast, the two aunts are perfect. But the film is not about aunts. It is about the wilderness in the Canadian wilderness. And while the photography can be beautiful, there is no laugh at the hard reality of living in the wilderness. Annie Galipeau, like Pony, fails to be convincing, unfortunately because I really would believe in her. She was a relatively inexperienced 20-year-old on this movie and it could have worked, but Richard Attenborough might not have been hard enough on her. He makes her look vulnerable, which of course she is ... but in the wrong way. <br /> <br /> But one thing is certain that she sees picture perfectly throughout. But mascara and eyebrow thickening in the desert? It just doesn't fit, especially since she only seems to be in forest trials with Bond (sorry, Gray Owl) and use photo-ops to kiss close-ups. <br /> <br /> I've been living with pacifists in the Pacific Northwest, and they simply don't look so beautiful and so sweet as they struggle to survive. It brings me to another point: The film fails to evoke the time it is set: the 1930s. I blame it to a great extent on a lack of lust script that is set to preach at the expense of dramatic bow, plot points and the small details that can trigger period through action. <br /> <br /> William Nicholson wrote the script and his latest offering, "Elizabeth, the Golden Age", opened three days ago, so I hope there is an improvement. Yes, I have read the comments others have submitted, but I 'I am not convinced. Much potential, but mistreated and perhaps even mistreated. If it had had a religious film, it would have been panned, but because it preaches the environment, the film remains somewhat criticized as it is "politically correct". Sorry, for all that, I don't buy it. Amen.
