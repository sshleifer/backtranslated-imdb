If you've read the book - don't put your hopes high if you don't - read it and never see the movie. It's strange to hear that Toby Young was actually involved a lot in the script's writing (as he claims in the book's post). Because the film is very different from the book. What the movie looks like - takes a rather thought-provoking and entertaining piece that combines philosophical ideas with ordinary fun sarcasm and simplifies it so that everyone would understand it - it is accomplished with perfection. The movie is full of bad and cheap jokes that fit a sitcom, and has lost any meaningful message it might have had. <br /> <br /> You better not see it.
