Although this is not a "big movie", there is something convincing and memorable about it. As another commentary on the film I saw this in childhood. It has been thirty three years since 1952, but I have never forgotten the story or its ridiculously cumbersome title. See it if you can. You will feel like a voyeur of small town life as it develops over the decades. More than any other film, this brings a human face to the historical drama of early twentieth century "progress". It is engaging enough for a young seer and memorable enough for an elder. Moreover, it is easy to like the characters and see their passage through time.
