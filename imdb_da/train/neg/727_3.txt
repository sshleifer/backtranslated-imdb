I am really shocked that a great director like Chuck Jones started making some of the most incredibly boring cartoons I've ever seen. I didn't even laugh all this short, and it's a Bugs Bunny comic for Christ's sake! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always fun, not boring! Unfortunately, this brief appears to be Good Night Elmer (another incredibly boring Jones card) with the addition of Bugs Bunny. The first warning sign of a boring cartoon is always no gag payout. Goodnight Elmer was boring because it beat the same two gags forever with predictable payout. This cartoon, however, is affected by the second warning sign of a boring cartoon: there is too much dialogue. The comic has at least more than two gags on the sleeves, but most of them seem longer than they are thanks to the huge padding dialogue. At one point, Elmer ends up having dinner and says, "It was very unusually well away from the wamb", possibly the most redundant dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon (characters reading text high in later Woody Woodpecker comics don't count in my book). Although this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, it feels like 20 thanks to superfluous dialogue like this. <br /> <br /> Elmer's Pet Rabbit was not a fun cartoon for me, but if you sold your soul to Chuck Jones and is unable to recognize that he was leading a few clunkers during his career, You can enjoy it.
