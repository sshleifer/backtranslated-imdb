After the success of "Paris, Je T'Aime", a group of board members decided to come together and make a similar antology film based in New York. Unlike the original movie, the stories in this movie sometimes seem to come and go too fast - when you think of entering a story, it is over in many cases. And often start and stop and then begin again - with the stories woven together. As a result, there is no title to suggest that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure. Unfortunately, while "Paris, Je T'Aime" was hit or missed (mostly hit), most of "New York I love you" was missed. The stories tend to be much more sexual in nature, but also much less sweet - and often quite awful. It was an incredibly boring and uninteresting movie with only a few extraordinary stories - and perhaps the often depressing music made it work more. Now understand, it was good quality music, but its gloomy tone really, really made me like to cut my wrists! Amongst the better was the story of the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom, the couple talked about cheating outside a restaurant (although this was also in the first movie) and the sharp old couple. This is all so sad because I loved the first movie so much - and I really wanted to love this movie. I respected what they were trying to do but simply didn't like it much. <br /> <br /> By the way, and it's NOT a complaint, but I was amazed at how many people are smoking in the movie. For a recent movie that was unusual in our more anti-smoking culture. <br /> <br /> Also, if you get the DVD, there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the movie. One consists of Kevin Bacon (wearing a cool fedora) who eats a hot dog .... and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes. The other has a teenager who uses the movie's video loss world - including a very unhappy couple.
