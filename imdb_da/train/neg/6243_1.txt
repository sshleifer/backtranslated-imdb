Do not drink the coolant. <br /> <br /> This is a perception disguised as a documentary. And that title it as a "truth" is just plain crap. The debate on global warming is far from over, and will only be over when eco-zombies begin to recognize the evidence mountain in violation of their beloved theory. Just Google "Global Warming" and "Hoax" or "Junk Science" and you will find a flood of information that reimburses almost any link in the logic chain, like Gore sites. The reason why it is so important for people to educate themselves is the catastrophic economic impact that global warming prevention measures will have. Wake up people. Anyone with a computer, a little time, and some sense can find many many reasons why this theory is not even credible. Don't just read articles that support your current opinions, read everything you can find. There is no thorough analysis to do, really. There are simply too many alternative options and refute that the theory has the most basic level of scientific credibility. It is so unusual that it can be the only major hoax in the course of human existence. It is time that people start talking to this kind of propaganda, and it is time for people to admit themselves and others that you can be both a savior and recognize the clear conclusion that global warming hysteria is a great lie.
