Unless someone tells me, I really have no idea what this movie is about. It looks like a picture with a message, but it is far from it. This film tells a pointless story about a New York press release and about his problems. And that's pretty much everything. When this agent is played by Pacino, one must think that this is something important. But it's not hard to think of how meaningless and boring this movie is. For one of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, this is the second film of the year (the other is "Simone"), which deserves the title "This year's most boring and meaningless movie". So what's up with Al?
