Wow. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with so many great actors who had such an important role, so mistaken. Justin Timberlake is perhaps the only worst actor landing a bigtime role in a star-force movie and money behind what Edison had. His acting was contemptuous to observe. The story was OK, and all the other characters were played by professional actors, heck, even LL Cool J was fine, as he had many small parts to cut his teeth. How the director and film company expected Timberlake to be ready for this role is no way to understand. His character destroys the whole experience, since every time he is on the screen, you are actually rooting for the corrupt police to make his upset and he should be the hero ... I wouldn't waste money on this in the theater or on video. Maybe if you have HBO and have nothing else to do at 2 o'clock on a Saturday night and you're full and rocky, it might be OK. Seeing Timberlake in this role was like watching a human 'Kermit de Frog' act in a Hollywood Blockbuster, just didn't work at all.
