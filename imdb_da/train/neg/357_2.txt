Just show showcases Sean Connery as Harvard Law prof, Kate Capshaw (will she still work?) Like her wife (little age difference) and Lawrence Fishburne as a racist southern politician (!) And Ed Harris in a hero of the top rendition of a fundamentalist southern serial killer. <br /> <br /> Weird casting, but the movie plays serious mindf ** with the audience. (Don't read if you've ever been serious about watching this movie or ever seeing the movie seriously because of the spoils). First of all, I felt myself repeatedly on the liberal stereotypes: the pads are all sadistic and hit this black guy without evidence. The coroner, the witnesses, and even the lawyer of the accused cooperates with him (he is accused of rape and murder of a young girl) because he is black. Connery is a Harvard Law prof that gives passions talking about injustice against blacks and against the savage death penalty. He approaches the convicted grandmother's grandmother to defend him and resume the trial. <br /> <br /> Connery is stonewalled (gab ...) by the small town officials and the good IL 'boys club, but finds the case against Blair, the alleged killer, now in the row of deaths, was all made. The main proof was his confession that was knocked out of him. <br /> <br /> The Beaten was managed by a black politician (!) who even played Russian roulette to get the acquaintance out of him. Connery finds out that another prison on the death row actually made the murder and after a couple of teas a teaser with a seriously abusive Hannibal Lecter-like Ed Harris, he finds out where Harris concealed the murder weapon. <br /> <br /> He gets a new test and Blair is freed. <br /> <br /> I think ... movie over .... <br /> <br /> Suddenly! It turns out that Blair is a psychotic psycho and that he used "white guilt" to exploit Connery. He confronted the story with Ed Harris in return for Blair performing a couple of murders for Harris. Now Blair is loose again thanks to Connery's misleading PC principles! The last 30 min. is a strange action movie dressed in a legal drama, Connery and Fishburne are fighting the serial killer in an alligator childrens house on stilts (yes you read it right) in the everglades. It was a strange movie. So the whole system is corrupt and ineffective, the police are just bullies and Abu Graib type torturers, but the criminals are really psychotic and deserve to roam. <br /> <br /> Really depressing on every level! The system is completely rotated and the PC white gold types that challenge it are seriously confused. <br /> <br /> Two thumbs down. Of course, Connery had to make a mortgage or something.
