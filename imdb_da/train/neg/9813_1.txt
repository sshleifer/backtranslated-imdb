... and I've seen some bad ones. <br /> <br /> I have nothing good to say about this movie. The plot is poor by Jennifer Tilly - as one might expect. Daryl Hannah does an OK job, but nothing close to saving this movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest flaw in this movie is that the plot is so weak - though based on a good premise - that the author resort to the "stupid heroine" to create a constructed tension. When all Daryl Hannah was to be hidden, she ran out in front of her pursuer. The hospital is absurd. Without putting too much on what passes for a plot, I think it would be difficult for a bloody petit woman to carry a pregnant woman from a hospital without being noticed. Lame. Very lamb. <br /> <br /> Save yourself time and choose another flick.
