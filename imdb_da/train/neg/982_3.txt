The real star of this ridiculous story is brilliant technicolor. A visual treatment for the eye fails to stimulate the film to stimulate the mind and heart. I was primarily fascinated by the idea that Dietrich and Boyer left religion to "find" their ability to love. The following is a huge disappointment. Boyer is the only real actor in the production and you feel his pain. Dietrich's amazing wardrobe stands out from her performance - sometimes her face is scary to look at - an unpleasant mask. As a monk, Boyer kept the formula for the monastery's liquer (which reminds me of the true story of Chartreuse) - when he leaves his "marriage to god", the reaction of his fellow monks retains shock and fear of maintaining the organized religion. The viewer feels that Boyer was free of his past. But the journey that follows is far too predictable.
