Let me confess. I found this video used and bought it because Guttenberg looked so sexy in his underwear on the jacket. But inside was another story. In addition to the fact that the movie was basically a parody of "invisible man" genre-special effects (highly visible strings and other such accessories), the script did not hit a chance - it actually went out of its way - by insulting all non- -WASP ran and real-imagined gay. Any insult to a person in the script was either homophobic or racist or both. It begins to congratulate your nerves along with the appalling sound, honest photography and photography of camera style and melodramatic history. However, the end is somewhat of a surprise. But when you get there, you hardly care less. Too bad it could be a reasonably good movie.
