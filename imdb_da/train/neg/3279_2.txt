Oh Geez ... There are so many other movies I want to see out there ... I got stuck with my nephew over the weekend and that's what he wanted - Yes ... I used to see this show when I was in college ... it was thoughtless, a little fun and something action-oriented. The show had a good heart tho ... and the characters were cute; no one was ever killed or even badly hurt ... it was like a comic came to life. Cut to 2005 ... What happened? This doesn't work. As others have said, there is simply no coherent story, and the performance is weird ... almost annoying - absolutely not true to the original characters ... the whole thing is like a Mad TV shit and it lasts more than 100 minutes ! This was one of the few times I have been excellent at watching a movie. What did they think? As I can best tell, I must have been for product marketing, toys, etc. All I can say is let this die a quick death. It makes the original dukes of Hazzard as masterpieces of theater ... I think the only remake left to do on TV is Gilligan's Island ... Good Luck!
