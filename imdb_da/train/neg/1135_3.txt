I have not read a biography from Lincoln, so perhaps this was a precise depiction ... And maybe it is because I am used to the even alienating and unrealistic worship depictions that unnaturally deprive Lincoln of radiant, glorious, and the Savior our country ...... <br /> But why should they make a movie that represents Lincoln as a buffoon? While Henry Fonda made an excellent Lincoln, his portrayal of him as an "aw shucks, I'm just a simple guy", apparently a little offensive. [Granted, it was Bushie Jr.'s entire campaign to make us believe he was "just an ordinary guy", so we wouldn't worry that he's a rich and privileged moron - but that's a completely different story.) <br /> <br /> Not only did the movie show Lincoln as a simple (almost simple-minded) kind of guy, the film states that Lincoln has just been lawfully by law accidentally and that He was not even interested in the law - only with the erroneously simplified idea of ​​the law is about rights and accidents. In the film he is not a very good defense lawyer (he lounges around with his feet on the table and gets the fun of the witnesses), and the result is mostly determined by chance / luck. <br /> <br /> Partly because this was funded by Republicans (in response to any game sponsored by Democrats who had come out) and partly because it was only the feel of the times, the film is unfortunately religious, racist, and conservative. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this movie!
