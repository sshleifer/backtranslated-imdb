Users who have rated this movie very simply cannot have seen enough good movies to compare it to. Have they all been brainwashed? I have rarely felt so disappointed with a movie, and some of it must be due to the ridiculous hype around this movie. From the first, BU is just a hunting movie. We pick it up at the end of a hunt and go straight into another. And another. And another. And another. Can you see a pattern emerging? There is almost no time "wasted" on plot, character development or boring old reality. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the other two Bourne movies, you're pretty lost. If you have - you only WISH you were lost - somewhere far from a movie theater. <br /> <br /> Paul Greengrass's creepy style worked exceptionally well on United 93, which was an emotional overload desperately happening, but on Bourne and his endless misery, it only results in removing the audience from engagement with the character. He runs. He jumps He stops. He gets blown up. He cleans tall buildings. Yada yada yada. Above all, he survives. He survives like a plastic Action Man survives, which only makes the ridiculous stunts he pulls more and more lax and lacking in any kind of excitement. Then he runs a building? So what? He will survive. Grass. <br /> <br /> There is a girl thrown into the mix because Bourne's love interest died in a previous incarnation, but she's just decorating. I've seen more character depth and seedy dialogue in episodes of Captain Scarlet. <br /> <br /> Bourne's own journey of literal self-discovery is dull and formless and tells us nothing we didn't know from the first movie. He was transformed into a killing machine. Big deal. He finds out his true identity. So what? It has no emotional resonance when it comes. <br /> <br /> The "Twist" end is telegraphed and weak. Oh, dear, the more I think about this movie the more I hate it! I've already reduced my score to 4 while writing this comment "I'd rather finish now before the slide continues. <br /> <br /> I love a good action girl and I love a good thriller. The Bourne Ultimatum is neither. It's a tall and boring series of flashy edits, ridiculous sound effects and comic book . <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​"showing the way" to the Bond franchise is completely crap. Casino Royale knocks it out of the water.
