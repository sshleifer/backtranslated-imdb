I read some gushing reviews here on IMDb and thought I would give this movie a look. Disappointed. On the positive side, the male leaders are good and some interesting photographs, but on the whole this film fails to convince. Seems to be filled with its own self-sustaining importance in trying to say something meaningful, but falls far, and all in all, the image is an invincible mess. It is one of the films classified as a film noir that can be defined as follows: <br /> <br /> "A movie noir is characterized by a mood of pessimism, fatalism, threat and cynical character". <br /> <br /> Well, this is the story here: 3 losers stumble over each other with their collective problems involving mental illness, alcoholism, laziness, indebtedness, etc. And together they make up to kidnap a child and overtake each other. <br /> <br /> Would have been a much better movie if the story was limited to kidnapping instead of kidnappers' character errors. I thought the women's leadership was far from her depth and came across as an amateur actress. <br /> <br /> While some good moments I ended up wasting my time. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
