I was very excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. However, the film did not meet my expectations. After reading the book, I recently prepared myself for great disappointment, which often happens when stories are translated into movies. The characters did not seem to fit well with the book. The direction was weak. I had a hard time getting into the characters. There was no real connection with the viewer about what was happening. The dialogue did not adequately explain what happened. It just seemed to clap and hurry through. All in all, I was very disappointed with the movie. I suppose if you haven't read the book, it might be okay though. At least it can entice you to read the book, which you will probably enjoy more. <br /> <br />
