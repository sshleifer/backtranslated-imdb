How can comments like the one of the high school girls do it on this site, it was the stupidest movie I have ever seen, it was ridiculous, how can moron sit there and say it just because a movie makes you jump It's a great movie, it can be the most idiotic thing I've ever heard, I could sneak behind you and go "Boo" and that would make you jump, but that doesn't mean I'm qualified to writing or correcting a movie, not to mention "they all tied up at the end" is not a good reason for a movie to be well received. What kind of movie would it be if they didn't tie everything together, I think it would make it a half movie, not a whole movie. So basically this idiot girl compliments them to complete the movie and I love how today's youth hold the media and production companies to such a high standard. No wonder the political system in this country can get away with what they want, we have idiots like what comes up in our country, what would happen if that girl actually ended up leading something someday It's a scary thought. Get a life and watch a real movie sometime, try Shawshank Redemption or On the Waterfront or something, and don't comment that it was "boring" after seeing it, just use the little brain that God gave you to analyze It a little.
