I saw Chan Mangler when it first came out, about four years after moving from San Francisco to New York. Perhaps it was the perspective a few years away, but this movie seemed to capture the essence of the city and its people better than anything I had ever seen (still doing). It concentrates on a particular society - the Chinese - but that's fine because so much of the city's soul is broken through the settings, the faces and perhaps above all the characters' voices. <br /> <br /> These are not San Francisco tourists. The settings are humble and everyday: a taxi, the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant, Richmond District townhouses, small Chinatown apartments and small business offices, the quays, a Filipino elderly center. This is what the city looks and feels like day to day for the people who live there - even now at a time of Silicon Gulch Urban rebuilding. In contrast, Dirty Harry (in his way, also an excellent San Francisco movie) says everything is filmed at street level: We are going to understand the point of view of the character from the perspective of their surroundings, not from some fancy vertiginous shooting. <br/> <br /> Apparently, Wang was filmed in B&W because he didn't have the money to do otherwise, but one of the strongest visual elements in the movie is the natural light he achieves. The often hard, pervasive quality of sunlight is one of my closest associations with San Francisco: It seems to reveal everything that brings the buildings, hills, other landmarks to scale and in a fun way makes people pass on the streets seems more individual and potentially closer to you than they might be in another place. Wang's photography perfectly transmits this and even helps the story together on points. <br /> <br /> Wang captures the speech and conversation style of Chinese and other San Franciscans better than anyone ever has, I think. If there is such a thing as a true San Francisco "accent", it is what you hear from the balding taxi medallion the mediator (I think) that seems to speak on the phone in a scene (listen to the way he calls the person on the other end "you are stupid!). <br /> <br /> The story is exciting, and despite a few very small mistakes, they make their points beautiful about the longings that draw in the hearts of people living in old immigrant groups - including the legitimate political and ethnic angry and small ironic amusements that help burn them, all of which are delicately conveyed - perhaps why some respondents think the movie is wobbling. Two taxi drivers' quest for Chan becomes a quest for something more personal. <br /> <br /> Chan's missing ends with a Chinese travel book sequence supported by a foggy 1930s news song (I guess) about San Francisco and all its crazy diversity An American caricature, j a, but not completely off the mark.
