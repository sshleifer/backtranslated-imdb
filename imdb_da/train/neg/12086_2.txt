... this verse does not lack Bard so badly. It is still a horrible minimalist production, Hamlet's Dutch uncle inexplicably explained by a Spaniard (whether it is Ricardo Montalban or is not subject to debate), and Maximilian Schell is as never before. Most of the dialogue makes it unharmed and the fact that the MST3K version is obliged to point out repeatedly that the speakers are long * duh * makes me not so incredibly humorous. For the most part, it's just bad to act.
