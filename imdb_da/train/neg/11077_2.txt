The only reason I chose to give this flick a shot was due to the presence of Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine. All I can say is that it was the biggest waste of a good actor ever put on film. As far as I could say, Borgnine was the only actor in it. The other performances were so uniformly awful, I am surprised that a studio would actually pay "performing artists" to appear. Couple this talent level in the acting department with a story, so plodding and insipid that I thought my eyes should start bleeding the moment the credits rolled and you have a perfect movie disaster. Of course, the film was made to appeal to an audience of children, and for its credit it was better than most of the original programs on the Disney Channel and similar child-focused networks. But honestly it doesn't say much.
