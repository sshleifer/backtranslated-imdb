At least among the movies with 100 votes or more. Nominated for Best Manuscript written directly to the screen? Brenda Blethyn nominated for best actress in a leading role ?? Nominated for Best Picture ?? I always disagree with many of the Oscar pickers, but this movie may well be the worst movie of any time to be honored by the academy. Writing and acting were both terrible. Blethyn's performance was especially one of the worst I've ever seen, and probably the most over-rated performance of all time. Terrible movie, not worthy of the big screen and not worthy of cable or television channels that have ever played it, including HBO (where I saw it). I'm just grateful, I actually didn't pay to see one of the most overrated movies from all the time.
