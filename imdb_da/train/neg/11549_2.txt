Although there were some entertaining moments, I thought the movie was pretty boring. The longer it ran, the worse it became. When the action entered Monument Valley, I found myself watching the magnificent outcroppings more than the more stupid and inconsistent interaction between the characters. The daughter's character was particularly incoherent. First she is on the deal, so discover the truth and she bails. Then she's back again and then deserts them again. Then she's back again. There is no apparent motivation for any of her decisions. There were interesting characters, some interesting scenes and many missing opportunities. I have to say that the pictures were much smaller than the sum of its parts. Apparently, the people who liked Repo Man were inclined to like this. Searchers 2.0 is no match for The Searchers.
