The movie is a bit boring. It is mostly a silent film, with the mass o story delivered through a series of voice-overs. While making a silent movie like this one is not such a bad idea, it is one of those films where the lack of dialogue and the repeated early scenes make it simply boring. You do not understand the reason for the tedium until it is well into the picture, and then it is too late. The first 40 minutes of movie is one of a slow piece of Mexican soft porn and an imaginative soft porn on it. Later in the film, the style of the first 40 minutes begins to make sense, but it is too late because the audience is lost. There are some good sources of location at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. I have often wondered why more movies have not been shot there. The campus is built on the edge of lava fields, giving the campus a very different world feeling. My biggest problem with the movie is that the director / author has made the film as he wanted to see it without regard to how a viewer who does not know the story will see it. You can't ignore the audience when you tell a story.
