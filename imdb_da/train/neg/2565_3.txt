There are just so many things wrong with this movie. <br /> <br /> Initially, the first 20 minutes of the movie could have been compressed to just five or maybe ten. The overall movie is already (mercifully) short, but it could have been made up by giving a little more attention to Mean Lion (how did it miss a reference to "The Wiz" on one?) And working with his subplot a little closer to the main drawing. In short, the script had a good idea, but needed a bit of rework. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it could have done without the raw humor. The original also had something it could have done without, but at least it was almost an afterthought - here flatulence and urination are huge. <br /> <br /> Third, the show is a little too self-conscious. The original series was good enough, just like the first movie, but here is the only way too much. The Brendan Fraser jokes were just over the top (and why no mention of "the new Ursula"?). Other gags with the narrator, especially a few interactions near the end, also exceed good sense. <br/> Fourth, a little more attention could have been given to the CGI work. In the first place, it was difficult to tell that Shemp was not a real elephant (except for behavior, of course), but here CGI stands out as a sore thumb. Ideally, special effects should only tell the story whether they are good or bad, and at least they succeed in counting, so it's a relatively small problem, but it's still there. <br /> <br /> All that said, Christopher Showerman's performance as George is decent enough. It lacks Brendan Fraser's charm, but Christopher only fails in the specific comparison. He even managed to give George a little personal depth, which should have been a big mistake in a Jay Ward inspired movie, but wasn't here. Julie Benz as the new Ursula surprised me to be even better than Leslie Mann in the original. <br /> <br /> Most other performances were pretty standard and didn't stand out in my mind as either good or bad.
