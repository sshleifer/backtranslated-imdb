I can't believe this movie was allowed. These people ought to be drugs out and beat with dumb objects. They should be tortured. This movie is an abomination. It's nothing but recordings from the first movie. Whatever is original is freaky and makes no sense at all. It is like a kind of fabric hallucination. Like what about laying on a mirror naked therapy. Also regardless of moron patched together, this turd did not even dare to see the first movie because they continued to call Suzanna Love's character Natalie when it is Lacey. I want to shout it on the screen, "IT IS HAPPY, IT IS CAREFUL!". I give it a -50 out of 10. My God !!!!
