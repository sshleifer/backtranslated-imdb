I sat through this movie and I have to say I just managed to keep my attention. The movie would have been a bit more bearable if I didn't have to see the awful CGI for future reference to the industry if you want to use CGI, then watch it so you know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> Apparently this should be a graphic novel for the screen, but the only thing I saw was a bad movie that didn't look like a graphic novel at all. All in all, the story was not as bad as CGI, I was totally impressed with the actor and thought the casting was good and a little more character info would have been nice as it got a little confusing to me at times, but that's not surprising as I said it just kept my attention, but frankly I wish I had given this a lady.
