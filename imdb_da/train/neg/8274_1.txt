Ahh this movie had so much potential! A good throw of quality B actors, Jessica Simpson's thighs and ... it's all about it! <br /> <br /> I think a guy in some named marketing department had an idea. Basically, we do some kind of legally blonde movie, but do it in New York. The big bright city with chances, power and money and where everyone is a heartless, power / money hungry person. Let's add to this Jessica Simpson, the little city bimbo, the brother of Owen Wilson and for some obvious reason Andy Dick (just because of him, you should ignore this movie). Basic story: <br /> <br /> Boys leave girl to NY, girl follows, boy's cheat, girl stays in NY with cousin, gets to work under false oversights, mucks up, is another boy's hip (Brother Wilson) and together save the day and kiss. <br /> <br /> A few words will come to mind as we reflect on this movie, that is, gloomy, horrible, tireless, unacceptable and xenophobic. <br /> <br /> Just don't watch this movie you want to be happier A reviewer referred to Guantanamo and I totally agree with him. This movie induces shock. And I know what you're thinking ... at least I'll see Simpson naked or dense too. It's not going to happen, save yourself time and YouTube her. You will get better sexy time! <br /> <br /> The movie's editing is flimsy, the play is unbearable, and why do they use blue screens? This is cinematic betrayal to be punished to the maximum. <br /> <br /> Another question, why will Willie Nelson always play a kind of figurine in almost every Jessica Simpson flick and why is there no black, Latin, Asian or European people in this movie?
