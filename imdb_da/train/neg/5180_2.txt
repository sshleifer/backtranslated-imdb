... there seems to be foolish people to see qualities in this movie that just aren't there. <br /> <br /> Near the dark, the same territory covered but with much more class and action. <br /> <br /> why the script kept their 'big secret' for so long was a total mystery to me - I guessed it at the breakfast scene at the start of the movie. When it was revealed to the viewer, it was just a case of 'big deal', telling me something I do not know. '<br /> <br /> I found this to be a pointless movie that might have challenged the genre conventions, unfortunately these conventions are horror movies tense and filled with true sense of horror. This was sad
