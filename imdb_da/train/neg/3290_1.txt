This movie sucked! They took something from my childhood and raped it in an outhouse! This movie was so bad I wanted to go home and keep my "Dukes" DVDs and cry in a corner. The cast was horrible! It was not "The Dukes", it was Stiffler and Jackass who drove a car. When was Boss Hogg hurt? When was Rosco a tough guy? They were never! Boss Hogg was greedy and Rosco was an idiot. When did Jesse smoke? He never did! Now I do not understand me wrong, I am very liberal and there is nothing wrong with a small chiba, but it had no place in this movie! The only good thing about this movie was the trailers before the movie and the final credits. It was a waste of money time and air. Avoid at all costs !!!!!!!!
