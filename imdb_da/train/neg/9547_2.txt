One under transparent video game becomes a kind of conspiracy to get the next terrorist discovered in the backyard of the United States. Welcome to lunacy of cheap made direct to video movies. It's full of non-name actors and actresses with a little valuable plot. In any case, this strange game and our "hero" betting continues real money and does well. It's like playing, except the gambling part is gone and it sucks. Instead, it is an online game with little real value and you get authority on your tail if you do well. <br /> <br /> What makes it even stranger is that two strange computer programs knock it out somehow and everything is hidden. I want to leave the viewer to see how it all works. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's not even worth renting $ 1. "D"
