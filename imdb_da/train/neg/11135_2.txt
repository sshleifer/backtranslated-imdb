What more can I say? The action was almost without exception amateurish. Management and continuity were pitiful. The scene play was predictably down to the very first scene and the dialogue was boring. One of the features of the DVD was labeled "Gag Reel", but it could have been a description of a viewer's reaction to most of the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most entertaining things was in the director's comments on the DVD. He said with a straight face that he had set out to make a movie with high production values ​​and a name tag - and he succeeded. With delusions, it is easy to understand how the film appeared as it did. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster. Darkwolf suit was a modified monkey suit (per 'making of' function on DVD) and rather seen it. The mask and claws were a little better than from shelf jobs from any costume store. The CGI effects were painfully obvious and of quality similar to a cheap video game.
