This woman, who works as an intern for a photographer, goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling. Then she goes to find out that her neighbor over her is a photographer. This movie could have had a great plot, but the plot runs out of every hope. The problem I had with this movie is that every ten seconds someone sniffs heroin. If they took the scenes out where someone spoke heroin, then it would be a really good movie. Every time I thought a scene was going somewhere, some inhaled the white powder. It was really fun to have so much drug use in a movie. It drew attention from the main plot and a great story about a photographer. The lesbian stuff didn't disturb me. I was looking for a movie about art. I found a film about drug use.
