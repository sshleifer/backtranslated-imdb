When I first watched this movie, I thought it should have come from the children's section - it is very fun and sometimes humorous and is actually quite a good story, but it seriously lacks the "romantic chemistry" that actors like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins is able to deliver. I have to note that Walter Matthau is perfect for Albert Einstein, and his performance is exceptional, but that is the only exception. This movie seems a little forced, the director lacks substance, and oh yes ... the music is ridiculously horrible, it didn't give me a very good mood. But if you don't expect a smart, well-made comedy / romance story, then it might be entertaining as I said. It must be in the children's section. Einstein and his friends are a good relief from Tim Robbins' boring, almost tense quest to steal Meg Ryan's heart. A very conflicting film, but as long as it is not taken seriously, it can be a good movie.
