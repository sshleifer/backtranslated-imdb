Dynasty Revisited in Hawaii ... Full of clich√©s, very predictable, unrealistic and sometimes even stupid. If you have nothing better to do, however, it offers 40 minutes of simple, unpretentious entertainment, endless looks at beautiful male and female muscles and very good photography of the spectacular Hawaiian landscape. On the other hand, if you're looking for something more than that, stay away ... Oh, and by the way, if you've ever worked in a hotel or know anything about driving one, you have two options: 1. You want to feel sick every other minute by the sheer stupidity and stupidity of how the show presents Hotel Business or 2. Look at it as a science fiction comedy as I did, equate, relax and laugh about it!
