Semana Santa is displeasingly bad. It's so wrong in so many ways that I'm not where to start. So let's see ... Mira Sorvino, whose judge man has been shot under her protection, goes from Madrid to Seville for her policeman. During the Holy Week (Semana Santa, see? Everyone begins to fall asleep. It's bad in so many points right from the start). A killer performs his victims as bulls in a bullring. She stops with the male chauvinist pig Olivier Martinez and the fine Feodor Atkine. Soon she discovers that she will be the next target for the killer (who has a red cap). Why, oh but why? <br /> <br /> Why ..; It is the question that the whole movie has been in my head. <br /> <br /> Q: Why did you go to see that A: Because I love Mira Sorvino (I even apologize to her for the first time) Q: Why were we only 8 people in the theater this Saturday in the first week end? A: ah-ah-ah. Spider-man was relaesed the same day. But also the fact that the movie has been blown up with executable reviews. <br /> <br /> Q: Why this movie is made? A: Money I guess. But boy, Mira needed the money. <br /> <br /> so ... why ???????????? First of all, there is always something wrong with European co-productions. here you have a French-English-German-Italian-Spanish-Danish production. yi-ha. <br /> <br /> It will play on the same playgroung as American thrillers / slashers / whodunit / mysteries / whatever. Even VALENTINE, although it was unnecessary and poorly written and shot, was much better in excitement and fun. <br /> <br /> So to give a little credit to the story, one wanted to add a political view to the story. Wrong: Made in flashbacks in a Traffic-like photography, it's definitely the most interesting thing in the movie. Could hold on to it, it would not be necessary to sit through the whole movie. Better going straight to Guillermo del Tros is DEVIL'S BACKBONE (El espinazo del diablo) for some clever fun. <br /> <br /> So homophobia. Bullseye! The first victims are S&M drug-abused homosexual twins who were stabbed to death. The annoying olivier Martinez goes to a dating agency held by a badly shaved obese transvestive with a blonde platinum wig. Calling mira sorvino character a great dive all the time. Do we need this kind of thing? Oh. Just unnecessary offensive comments, like oltimes. <br /> <br /> So the excitement. Yipee. No apparent motive. The first killings are common illusion, as they represent a famous painting. But no. And the revelation of the killer (a horrible fascist, of course) could have been done from the beginning when he looks at the end of the movie, as it was time for the director to say "wealth, time to finish that damn movie. Let's reveal who the killer is and why he is killing. "<br /> <br /> So the director thinks he's an instructor. Wrong: no sense of excitement, no sense of controlling the actors, no knowledge of change of pace. A huge, mega-bore. The scenes of the Holy Week are unnecessary (perhaps a co-production rule that says: ok, shoot in Seville, but show some credits of this beautiful and historic city with Easter festivities. There we are: a mystery movie for tourists!) <Br /> < br /> So the actors. All accidents. Mira Sorvino drills to death: she practically does nothing except being stabbed in the right hand. Everything she did best (Replacement Killers, Mighty Aphrodite ...) was as they never existed. Olivier Martinez ... hi, someone here? When the producers will learn that he is not an actor but a mannequin without speech or emotion? Feodor Atkine, bland and transparent. We only pay great respect for Alida Valli, one of the greatest actresses of the last century (and I hope for more roles in this present). She is the biggest attraction here as she is the only one to give life to her bad lines. I will not mention the other actors as they are only one-sided characters, uninteresting and low. <br /> <br /> Incoherent direction, inconsistent actors, incredible plot. Idiocy incarnate. <br /> <br /> Superwonderscope says: 1 <br /> <br />
