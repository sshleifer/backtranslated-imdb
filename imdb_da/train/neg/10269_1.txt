This movie is outrageous. By outrageous, I mean horrible. I had more fun watching the paint dry at my local hardware store on an August day while suffering from a migraine and heat stroke. the play became progressively worse as "film" advanced, and the directors' use of euphoric drugs became apparent as the final scenes approached. When Misty was shot to death, she decided it would be cautious to blink the postmortem. it was not intelligent. True, Stevie Wonder could have caught it with his eyes closed. If you decide to play with a nail gun while drunk and watching this movie, keep in mind that the nail gun will probably give you a better story to tell your friends.
