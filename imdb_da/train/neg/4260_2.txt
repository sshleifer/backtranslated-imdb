Yes right. <br /> <br /> I spent the first hour waiting patiently for the movie to go out. It was terribly boring and consisted mainly of people who drove randomly around the hills without apparent direction. Then the hero enters the picture. Born as an Asian, but when he grew up, he became white. Obviously white. He wasn't even close to passing for Asian. He looked like Justin Timberlake. It was extremely distracting and the story did nothing to help the cause. Spotless battle sequences and lame dialogue. It's an hour and forty and five minutes long, and in the end I tried to eat my own face. I saw this because people in the video store, where I work, always ask me if this movie is good. Now I have an answer. It goes like this: ahem. "No! Good God No! It's honest! Don't make it to yourself! I would recommend another movie, maybe one that is entertaining."
