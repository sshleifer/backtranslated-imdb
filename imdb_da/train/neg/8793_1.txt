For those who decide whether or not to watch this movie and read these comments for insight, I first offer these four words: Don't waste your time! "Chungking Express" was shoddily filmed, teamed up quickly and seems like it was conceived in its entirety by someone standing in line at a Hong Kong Burger King. I can't remember ever watching a movie with an assortment of such one-dimensional characters trying to work through a script this versatile! It's an absurd effort with philosophically ridiculous dialogue (a man walks into his flooded apartment and offers the amazing revelation that "tears can be wiped with a tissue, but the water takes time to drip"). The same sign is also seen on a deep, meaningful report with its towels, soap, stuffed animals, dirty clothes, etc. The shaky, wandering handheld camera work was another annoying feature I could have done without. And if that's not enough to make you poke in your popcorn, we hear the old 60-year-old "California Dreaming" of Mamas and Papas blaring over the sound track over and over again in a particularly long sequence. <br /> <br /> Quentin Tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to America through his Rolling Thunder Productions company, although I can't figure out why a man with his talent would bother me. He was known to have noticed, "I'm happy to love a movie so much." Many of us hope, however, that he will concentrate on making his audience happy with more valuable discoveries in the future.
