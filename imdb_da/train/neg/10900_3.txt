You can't resist too much by knowing that it was made in four days and I was expecting to be campy anyway. (It's not all that is campy in reality. With the exception of Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter who don't take seriously, the rest of the role plays halfway straight, Riley Smith is exceptionally bad.) The ridiculous story is actually paid attention to what kind of shocked me; I assumed the whole purpose of these ultra-low budget horror movies was to accommodate the most basic sexual fantasies and not confuse the story, but they use many words like "technological" and "physical" in the script to get their point across. (Although it is possible that history is only important to explain why there are so few cast members.) No one cares about this stupid story, and the only things that are interesting in the movie are mocking cultures and softwares. core homoeroticisms (which are not all that edgy). I would have liked it more if there were just some casual killings for no reason. The film is grainy, with a television quality view and acting. There are a few "sexy" scenes that are okay - the boys writhing in bed in their boxers, feeling up; or be tied down and make orgasmic faces while wine is poured on them - and some of them are a little funny. And I liked the tombs of L. Ron Hubbard and the intended irony of a story of religious cultists told with intense gay overtones, but it's still not good. 3.10
