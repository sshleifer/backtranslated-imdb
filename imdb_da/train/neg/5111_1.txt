I used to be an avid viewer until I personally spent long cold hours helping build a home for the white family, only to be ill to see the house a year later. All the beautiful stone landscaping has been removed, the beautiful stone pavement and front fountains have been removed, all pine trees and pecan trees in the front have been cut down, sprinkler system has been torn out. It now looks like a disaster area. They don't even live there anymore ... they live "in town" and only come out on the weekend. It sings me to think of all the hours that the great people of Oklahoma donated to these people and to see the result. The story, we all watched on television, wasn't quite the truth ... don't believe in everything you see and hear.
