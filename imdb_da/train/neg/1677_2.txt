Unlike others, I refuse to call this graceful excuse for a movie that is a triumph of style over matter (I don't want to give style a bad name). Yet it is the most appropriate description that comes to mind. <br /> <br /> A pointless, unpleasant and ultimately pointless assault on the eyes and ears, "Wonderland" leaves a wondering only why the film was made in the first place and who in their right mind gave green light to this boring and cumbersome mess. A biography of porn star John Holmes? A study of who the man was, why he went into the store and how it hit him? Great. Tied to being convincing, bound to be entertaining. Tied to being enlightening and fascinating at about a million levels (and I have no interest in porn). <br/> But a confusing, violent, Rashomon-style study of a series of murders Holmes was associated with after his career ended? Who the hell cares? What insights do we get? This film completely ignores the most interesting aspect of John Holme's life - that he was a porn star! "Wonderland" might as well have been about someone: that the protagonist is the most famous male movie star in history, is almost irrelevant. <br /> <br /> To make thousands of times worse, the picture is filled with jerkoff gimmicks - annoying machine gun editing, sloppy Dogme-95 camera work, unnecessary screen graphics and animation, etc. <br /> <br /> In the absence of a compelling story and outstanding character, the director (and I use the phrase loosely) has thrown a dozen or so techniques from other films and decided to call the resulting root a movie, among them: the trendy, bleach-bypass look of "Narc" or "Traffic" or "Minority report;" The scary, often incomprehensible, throw-the-pieces-of-movie-in-the-air cut style of "Natural Born Killers" or "28 Days Later;" sound-every-moment-of-silence-with-an-old-song-to-induced-the-period soundtrack of "Goodfellas" or "Blow;" The red, retro title sequence of "Velvet Goldmine" or "Autofocus" or "Catch me if you can." The list goes on and on. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. I had great hopes for it. "Wonderland Avenue" had existed for years; If the murder context had been highlighted instead of the murders themselves, I think it could have worked. Had the murders (and Holme's growing involvement with seedy L.A. types) signaled the end of a career, or the end of the swinging 70's, I think the movie might have been meaningful; It could have served a purpose. As it is - meaningless. Meaningless. Who cares about how many prospects there are on a number of murders that are generally not known to the public? The case is not famous enough to deserve such careful investigation. <br /> <br /> This movie should have been the third act of "The John Holmes Story." That is it. Period. And it could have worked. What is it? Oh, right, right, they didn't want to tell a traditional historical story. They didn't want to make "Boogie Nights" or "Goodfellas" or "Star 80" or "Autofocus." They wanted their movies to be different. Right? <br /> <br /> Well, somehow, it succeeded. There is a big difference between these movies and "Wonderland". The difference is that the films are good. <br /> <br />
