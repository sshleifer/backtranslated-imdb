I tried. I really did. I thought if I gave Joao Pedro Rodrigues a chance, I could enjoy his movie. I know that after seeing O FANTASMA, I felt sick and almost disgusted to the core, but some of the reviews were quite good and beneficial, so I was like, "What the hell. At least you paid at least 10 $ Quad. Give it a shot. "<br /> <br /> Sometimes it is better to go to your dentist and ask for a root canal without any previous anesthesia to relieve the horror of so much pain. I often wonder if it would not be better to go back to my childhood and demand that my former mobster really let me get it. On other occasions, I often think that the world is really flat, and that if I go far away, I will not only get away from it all but get over it and that something evil, Lovecraftian stuff will tear me with its 9000 tentacles and hug my life - and some French fries from 1995, still in my esophagus - out of me. Is there a reason for Odete? I don't want to say ... just it seemed to her Creator to write a story centered on her madness (one that makes Alex Forrest look like Strawberry Shortcake) looks not only scary but flattened out sick to the leg. First of all, she decides to leave her current boyfriend (in screaming hysteria) because she wants a child and he thinks they are too young. She later breaks down a funeral of a gay man, and - get it - to get closer to him, she celebrates being pregnant while she is indulging herself in the dead man's mother and loving in the saddest ways. Oh, of course she screams like a banshee and doesn't throw herself one, but a good three times on her grave. And there is this ridiculous business that she gradually becomes "Pedro", which summarizes a weak-as-bad-tea explanation that love knows no sex. Or something. <br /> <br /> I want to say she's like nuts like a can of cashew nuts, unsalted. But then again, so is the director. And me, to take a chance on this. At least the men look good. Other than that ... not much else to see here.
