Unless you are a geeky film student to see everything, this movie will not only waste your time and money and a huge disappointment, but it will also make you angry at belief. <br /> <br /> There may be a story worth telling somewhere in, but Hopkins decided to hide it and code under so many incessant chaotic seemingly random audio camcorders, making the viewer's patience run thinly after a very short some time. <br /> <br /> Why would anyone like Hopkins choose such a heavy, hardest and very unstable project like his first script, first score and third movie one can't guess. Perhaps he played with it in his mind for so long until it became unrecognizable as it was, not even for himself. The result shows that he far from having enough experience or skill to achieve the desired result. Even the most peculiar Carpenter and Lynch movies, to name just two unscrupulous filmmakers, had 90% more coherence, 95% less sign and 99% more history flow. <br /> <br /> Sir Anthony directed you to the stars, but unfortunately missed a few light years. Stick to acting, in that department you are an unsurpassed giant and no one should ask more from yourself, not even yourself!
