I don't know much about filmmaking, but good movies have to tell a kind of story ... your characters have to start and end their journey. In the end to Brooklyn they can, but it is not in a satisfactory way, and I do not mean a good ending, just any end. <br /> <br /> Last exit to Brooklyn, set in Brooklyn in 1952 during a very brutal strike, sets a number of story threads. Most involve some of the most incredible characters ever to cross a movie screen. But the last exit to Brooklyn fails to bring these stories to any conclusion ... it leaves some of them dangling without end, or exploding in a bizarre stratosphere into an "artistic" end. <br /> <br /> Two cases in the lead and they contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> A sad transvestite character (an important character in the movie), hit by a car and killed. And that's it for him in the movie .... he's gone too well, deleted from everyone's memory .. no reactions from his friends, enemies, lovers .... nothing. <br /> <br /> In another thread stupid, clueless and secretly gay strike leader, been rejected by labor, his gay lover, and found out of neighborhood gay, being stomped by bullies. The final scene to the bank shows Brooklyn's streets, and the streetlights are very, very similar to the Nazi death camps ... and the scene draws on and over and over ... and the camera stretches down to the body of the supervisor and he has been crucified ... .. ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. And of course it's also for him .... brain management ..... away. <br /> <br /> The bottom line .... no matter what the reviewers originally said in 1989 about this movie ... This film is a depressing slam. Avoid it. And if you're not warned, it really deserves an NC-17 rating for massive amounts of physical, emotional, and sexual brutality ... don't let teens see for themselves.
