Warning! Spoilers! <br /> <br /> This is your typical Disney movie. <br /> <br /> 1.Politically correct what about the foster home that has an even breed distribution. <br /> <br /> 2. Invest in viewers' intellect with their simplified lines. <br /> <br /> 3. Boys' slezy father is almost directly taken from Never Ending Story 2. <br /> <br /> 4. In a world full of crime, disase, corruption, hunger and other neglect to be handled, only a losing team is worthy of divine interference. UHHHHH !!! <br /> <br /> 5.You know angels don't like swearing! Where the heel came, it comes off! <br /> <br /> 6.I help the team, cause the angel pain and humiliation at the adversary community. Very Englishman indeed! <br /> <br /> 7. The team angels help is called ... can you guess ... the angels! Disney at worst! <br /> <br /> 8. "Just got his training wings." Spectacular line! <br /> <br /> My claim: I didn't like it at all.
