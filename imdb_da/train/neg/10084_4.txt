This movie was okay, but it certainly defeats the claim that homosexuals are "born that way", especially when a woman can get out of an unhappy marriage and just fall into another woman's arms. It almost seems like Kate's gender preferences turned on and off like a switch, making this movie a bit simplistic. Also, as is common with movies trying to push an agenda, it was unfortunate that the characters in the movie that had questions or disapproval of gay lifestyle were labeled as "bigots". And there was no good medium. It was either Kate's friends and relatives completely embraced her or they completely removed her. This is not typical of interactions between gay and non-gay family members and friends. It is usually a mix of emotions and values ​​that come into play. It is possible to love people and treat them with respect, while not necessarily tolerating the choices they make. Unfortunately, the film showed none of these types of interactions. For a movie trying to portray tolerance and acceptance, it struck me as a very intolerant movie! So at the end Kate apparently decides after all these years that she wants to be with Mac and everything is hunky dory - is that what is gay, really is about? Come on!
