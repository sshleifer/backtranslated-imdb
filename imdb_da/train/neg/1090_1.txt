It was the most pointless movie I've ever seen since there was no plot and the actors didn't seem to care. 90% of the film had absolutely no plot at all, I laughed so much that my ribs began to hurt. The bit where the old men, when they were to catch Robert Duvall, was ridiculous. At a directorial level that makes a noir film, not many rain sequences and meaningless close-ups involve the main character. this is a failed attempt to create a noir thriller and instead alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes. Since this was based on a 'manuscript' by John Grisham, I do not count this as one of his book adaptation books, as it does not show any of the excitement and engaging history of movies like the 'company' or 'calculator'.
