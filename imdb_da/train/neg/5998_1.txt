The basic formula for the original series was; Take a person, make the audience like them, and put them in deadly danger. This formula worked for the 32 episodes made between 1964-68. <br /> <br /> Now, we're leaping forward 40 years to 2004. We're introduced to Alan Tracy, a slightly less than diligent schoolchild, with his friend, Fermat, a young know-it-all. They are whipped by Lady Penelope in her pink Ford Thunderbird to the island paradise where the Tracy family lives until school holidays. Almost immediately, they are left behind by Kyrano and his daughter, Tin-Tin, while the adults go to rescue John from Thunderbird 5, which has been damaged by a staged accident. This is a part of The Hood's plan to take over Tracy Island so he can steal the Thunderbird machines ... <br /> <br /> To rob a bank! Yes. The plot is as long as that! <br /> <br /> The dialogue is banal that works more wood than that of the fiberglass fabrics, effects, anything but special and Hans Zimmer's score ??? The tiny thing of Barry Gry's glorious theme shone through Zimmer's noisy orchestration. The rest of the score was extremely forgettable. In fact, part of the song was broadcast the following week on the radio and didn't recognize it! I didn't even bother to witness Busted's mediocre action with the final titles <br /> To be fair, Ron Cook worked pretty well as Parker, he and Sophia Myles as Penelope seemed wasted. With the right material they could have been exhibition stoppers. The CGI work was what I would have called the front edge - five years ago. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of the main vessel were just wrong; The original serial models moved at least as if they were mass <br /> <br /> Another big point is that the whole production seemed to be a long set of product placements from each vehicle built by Ford for the entire contents of Tracy Freezer is produced by Ben & Jerry's. My son (9) enjoyed the movie, but this cross between Spy Kids and 'Clockstoppers' that corrected right in his age group added nothing to Thunderbird's legend. When Star Trek hit the big screen in 1979 with 'The Motion Picture', a whole new lease of life was breathed into the franchise, which then continued for another 20 years or so. With this film, Frakes has missed a golden opportunity to do the same with Thunderbird's franchise. <br /> <br /> I predict that this movie, like "The Avengers" and "The Saint" before it, will sink into turmoil within 6 months, leaving the original series to its "classic" status.
