If you want to watch a good movie about how women can fight back against sexual assault, this movie is not the movie you want to see. It was a social comment about a woman who became the victim and struggled back. Spoiler: Rosario Dawson turns the tables on her attacker. Instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim places himself to use vigilantism. She essentially abolishes the legal system. The movie "The Accused" was a much better movie because the victim uses the justice system and wins. What does the "descent" do to tell victims of attack that they should resort to violence? Is the victim better that the prosecutor? None!!!
