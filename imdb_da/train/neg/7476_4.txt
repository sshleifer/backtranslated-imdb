Malicious aliens owe a huge debt to Peter Jackson's early movie Bad Taste and Braindead. I have to admit that I never enjoy these movies in particular, and I say the same about this. Jake West is a director who clearly lacks inspiration from his own and chooses to steal from those he looks up to. I lost count of the time a great Hollywood movie was quoted especially by James Cameron's Aliens. The amount of blood and doing at the show here is not fun either, the latter of the film being tired and dragged. Maybe it would have worked better as a short movie. The actors are poor, the direction is weak and the plot is non-existent. I can see what the director was trying to do, the tribute he was trying to pay, but others have done the same much better than presented here. 4.10
