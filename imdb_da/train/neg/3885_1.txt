This movie wasn't just bad - it was terrible. After I saw it, I actually felt it was necessary to take a shower to get rid of me. Running 'gag' with an older couple making out, it's not fun, but it's disgusting. The monster poses were cool, but that's all. The continuity errors alone will have you angry - at least I was. Editing is really bad. <br /> <br /> Almost anything else you could do would be better than spending time watching this movie. Though your group of friends is in "bad movies" this is unique in its unpretentiousness, I couldn't even make myself laugh at it. You have been warned.
