I hired out the hybrid on the weekend. What a disappointment! A stupid attempt at a telephony. The guy they got in front of them was quite weak and when he drove {he did a lot} so he was eating these minty sweets ... with his back! The wolf contacts he wore were great, although I feel that the actor was dependent on them too much, since there was nothing threatening to his actions at all. The clever native American Indian chick has to be one of the most rocky hard ever seen. Talk about a sour cow! She smiled once for the whole movie, and I think that she had sex. The sex scene was also paralyzed. They may as well have shown blowing curtains if you can dig it. <br /> <br /> Last, and all this and this is a big pet hat of me, on the front and DVD menu, the losers lost digitally in cool sharp teeth to the guy. They were nowhere to be seen in the movie. :(
