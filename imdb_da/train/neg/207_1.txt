This movie is a 90 minute Ramone concert with short periods of stupidity and absolute boredom. What kind of high school is it anyway? <br /> <br /> Unless you are a big Ramones fan, you DO NOT repeat and I will not waste your time as I did. This is completely unmatched from start to finish. This movie is called Ramone Fever. Everyone seems to like them in this movie. There is no plot in this flick. As for teenage comedies, scrape the bottom of the barrel with it.
