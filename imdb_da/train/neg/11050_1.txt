Terrible use of stage interruptions. All continuity is lost, either by horrible scripting or dull direction. The evil robot ... the mustache was a jazz dancer? Also one of the worst soundtracks I've ever heard (monologues usually drowned out of music.) And ... where did they get their props? That ship looks like a milk carton ... I did better special effects of 8mm at age 13! I would recommend any movie student to watch this flick (5 minutes at a time) so learn how to NOT produce a movie. Or was it the editor's fault? It's really too bad because the scenario was actually a good concept ... just poorly executed all the way around. (Sorry Malcom. You should have sent a "stunt double. You are too good an actor for such a stink bomb.)
