I'm not preoccupied with The Pallbearer, it's not that bad, but just very slow at times. As the film continues, it becomes a little more interesting, but nothing brilliant. I really like David Schwimmer, and I think he's good here. I'm not a massive Gwyneth Paltrow fan, but I don't mind her and she's okay here. Pallbearer is not a highly recommended film, but if you like the managers then you like it.
