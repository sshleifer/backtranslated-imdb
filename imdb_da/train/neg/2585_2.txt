This was the worst movie I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> Not only does it have nothing to do with the other American Pie movies, the story is obvious, flat, and definitely not fun. <br /> <br /> The girls are nice, but spending your time watching a cheap soft porn might be bigger than watching this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be a very bad sex ad, made for an audience older than 12. <br /> <br /> I never visited an American college, but I would seriously doubt that anyone who did could really laugh at any of the scenes. <br /> <br /> Save your time, do something else.
