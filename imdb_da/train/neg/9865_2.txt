I downloaded this movie in the hope that it would look like the hilarious "The Gamers" of Dead Gentlemen Productions (which is highly recommended, by the way). Boy, what a disappointment! The film is shot in this fake documentary style that became famous by the office, but it fails to deliver. The reason is partly the rigid action, but mostly writing and control. True, it can be fun to use all kind of clich√©s that are about role-playing games, but here it is done in such a way that it becomes extremely predictable. Already at the beginning of each scene, you know what "joke" is about. But perhaps the biggest problem is that everything is depicted far above the top. There is no subtlety in this movie, if there would be captions "LOW NOW" or a cheap 80's false-laughter track, it wouldn't make much difference. With some scenes, you can't help thinking "Yes, I get why they thought it would be fun", but the way it is done takes all the speed out of the possible joke.
