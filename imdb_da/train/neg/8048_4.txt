Suppose you have been on a desert island for the past ten years. Have not heard of Scream and left when Halloween Part 1 entered the cinema. Then this movie would have been a blast and a whole new vision of the horror scene. <br /> <br /> Currently, a 2.7 rating is on IMDb and it doesn't deserve such a low appreciation. Slashing all the way, like "I know what you did," and who is it that when I got to the end, I convinced me about who and why. <br /> <br /> No big surprise, just a good flip to see with a coke, popcorn and no urge to get a difficult plot, deep characters. If the video rental is outside the top titles, you can take it without risk, but don't expect a masterpiece. I've seen a lot worse.
