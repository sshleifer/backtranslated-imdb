I saw and liked the first two a lot. Especially because the other is not just an attempt to make another as good as the first. And it's a story that stands alone. You don't need to know the first movie. I liked it in the "Free Willy" movies too. <br /> <br /> But ... the third one here is completely useless! I tried it with my friend because we both liked the first two. We decided to stop after half an hour. The movie is okay, there are fun parts in it okay. But what for? Timon and Pumba were funny creatures in the first two films. What Lion King 1 1/2 is for me is: a tough attempt to become even more fun of the first movie than it already had, plus to tell the story from their point of view. But what for? I really want to know. You know, the idea of ​​the two of those sitting in the cinema, watching the first one, is really nice. But what comes after is mostly unnecessary. I think many people liked Timon and Pumba, and so do I. But for me, many parts were very constructed with an attempt to be fun. No chance, most of it was not fun at least, at least for me. Btw. What was the movie about anyway? Was it a) about Timon and Pumba or b) an attempt to get more fun out of the first movie? I tend to choose option b and I am very disappointed with it. <br /> <br /> If you like to see stories like: "the story of xy", see "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" by Tom Stoppard with Tim Roth and Gary Oldman. It's really fun and doesn't try to get more out of "Hamlet", so have it.
