First of all, to get my own personal feelings out of the way, let me start by saying that I hate so-called comedies, where each character is written and played as being so stupid that you wounder if they are a result of inbreeding. <Br /> <br /> Now let me say that I saw the first three American Pie movies and while they were not the most amazing movies I had ever seen, they were okay (and direct masterpieces compared to the three American Pie Presents "movie, I still feel compelled to ask, what the hell did they think when they made this movie? <br /> <br /> I also have a few other questions. <br /> <br /> Who thought this was an acceptable use of study funds and production resources? <br /> <br /> who approved the final script (and what was the person smoking when they approved it)? <br /> < And finally why did anyone think it deserved to be released to theaters where the average cost of admission is between $ 10 and $ 15 depending on where you live when it should have gone directly to the Blockbuster or Wal Mart discount box? <br /> <br /> There's so much wrong with this movie that I can't write a really comprehensive review of it, because it would exceed the maximum allowed words on this forum, so I just want to touch the biggest things that are wrong with it. The plot is generically uninspired and stupid and characters are about as interesting as watching paint dry for 80 minutes, but the biggest thing I can see wrong with this movie is the play. <br /> <br /> While most of the players are talented, no namers are likely to be forgotten in a few years, <br /> <br /> the only big name in this movie is Eugene Levy who almost uses all the time he is on the screen with this wide smirk on his face, saying to the viewer "I know this. It's not fun, and I'm wasting my talents, but hey, I'm paid for it, who cares." He not even trying to make some of his jokes fun (he deserves better than this garbage). <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, most of the other castings are terrible, although some of them have been in some really good TV shows, plays Tyrone Savage (from the classic Canadian series Wind At My Back ) a character so unbearably excruciating and annoying (there are things he could learn for tropical skin diseases) that you almost want to die a slow and painful death on the screen, Christopher McDonald (NCIS, Law & Order) just hangs about Screen and games, what talent he is about to be in this movie. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the next movie in this series is just a soft core story with a storyline so they can get around the MPAA and get an R rating this movie goes all out with useless nudity vulgarity and unnoticed offensive sex content that it should have got the X rating (the rating card must have been full or on the drug as they reviewed this film for review). <br /> <br /> It is interesting that 25 years ago when Wes Craven sent a nightmare on Elm Street to MPAA for a rating review, he forced him to cut 25 seconds of footage (I think it was part of a death scene that had a silicone molding of a chest in it) to avoid getting an X rating and he had no choice but to do it, or the movie would not have been released <br /> <br /> But this kind of unnecessary offensive waste can get R-rating today because everything is done in the name of the comedy if this movie was a drama or a horror movie of this kind, there would have been a big stink over the content and it would have been the dreaded X rating. The last thing that really annoys me is the writing, this film is written to play out as the wet dream of a twelve year old child with an extremely overactive sexual fantasy, it is very young and extraordinary crass, almost all the show conditions to be moving the body of this movie calls a plot along is so telegraphic that any intelligent viewer can see it come a mile away, and the so-called characters are just stereotypes of stereotypes of stereotypes, never against the often repulsive sexual references and constantly unnecessary scenes of Deviant Sexual Behavior It feels as if this movie was written by some incompetent first-year hack in a low clean film school writing room. <br /> <br /> The long and short is the time to kill this series before it becomes more stupid more crass and offensive, this pie is filled with road apples.
