The championship is only a few days away, but things in New Orleans are not as they should be. From players with marital problems to overdoses with substance to game problems to a killer on the loose, life gets in the way of what must be a memorable, wonderful time. Can things be put in order again and a killer stopped before the big game is destroyed? <br /> <br /> Despite what you might think when you first read about the Superdome, it's not a football movie. In fact, football is no more than a plot unit and an afterthought. Instead, the Superdome is another of those miserable soap opera-ish 70s-to-TV movies populated with Hollywood having bones and those who will never be. The thrown sleep walks go through the case without anyone looking really good. The best (or worst) example is Van Johnson in a very small role that generally looks lost to why he is there. The reason is boring, uninteresting and incredible. Donna Mills as a hit "man"? Yeah right! It's about as credible as the affair she has with the liquid soaked David Jansen. The movie also lacks some pace. Trying to get all four or five story lines into movies zaps what the flow Superdome might have had. With no drama or excitement in sight, Superdome ends up being a very bad example of a 70's movie to television. The only highlight for me was the voice-over work of late Charlie Jones - a sports caster I miss listening to. The eloquent way he overestimates intrigue and overhypes the atmosphere of New Orleans is pure cheese at its utmost. <br /> <br /> Like most people who have seen the Superdome, I also did so with courtesy of the Mystery Science Theater 3000. It may be one of KTMA's public access episodes, but it is one of the best examples of the show early start. So even though I only rated Superdome a 2/10, I give this episode a generous 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
