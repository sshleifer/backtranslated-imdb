OK, this movie was made for a reason and a reason just to make money !! The producers, of course, didn't care about killing a classic horror movie. I knew this movie would suck as soon as it was a pg-13, where many pg-13 slashers movies have proven to be good? It's like asking how many women have been on the moon? The answer is NOT! Prom Night 1980 was no masterpiece, but it certainly deserves to be recognized as a movie that remains true to its genre and deosnt trying to be more than that. <br /> <br /> My problem with Prom Night 2008 is the way it handles the killer and I have 3 major issues with him ..................... < br /> <br /> 1) The way he escapes, he was unlocked in a mental institute and he escapes through an air conditioning fan !! WHAT THE HECK? Why would they have an air conditioning valve in the patient's room? Do they want him to be comfortable during his stay or something? 2) His intentions are somewhat uncertain that the killer will have all the greatest victims of family and friends died so that he can get her to himself, he says he loves her, but in the next moment he tries to kill her, so he also kill her, love her or just rape her ?? 3) The killer is too good, how did he develop all his abilities? He used to be a teacher, so in this one scene where he kills the boyfriend's boyfriend while she is at the very top of her sleep, and she does not feel it, all silly 2 stars out of 10 is terrible, silly and stupid attempt at a horror movie
