THE. WORST. MOVIE. EVER. MANNER. <br /> <br /> Having seen this supposedly gay movie, I suppose someone rounded off a brain-injured semi-blind neo-Nazi and made him make the worst gay movie ever, all in part trying to attack gay. I had to stop the movie and call a friend to come by so I had someone to scoff when I stopped the movie out of shock, disbelief and rebellion by such sheer stupidity. <br /> <br /> On top of all that horrible writing and action and illogical and stupid plot, it's just a badly made movie. A dog with a handycam tied to the tail could have knocked out better. <br /> <br /> Seriously, after reading the few positive reviews this movie has here, I suppose the author should have half a dozen IMDb accounts. Anyone who says this movie is even tough as anything other than a joke, is a liar or is being heavily paid to say so.
