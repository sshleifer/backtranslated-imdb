My main comment on this movie is how Zwick could get credible actors to work on this movie? Impressive cast ?? even for the supporting characters that do not really help this movie. I must admit that Tom Hank's cameo almost made it worth it? What was it about Tom? Did you lose a bet? The best cameo of the movie, however, was Joe Isuzu - by far a classic! The prerequisite is good. Basinger's character, struggling with the existence of a Pink Lady, makes way towards the Vegas motel at the motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales. This happens when Corbett's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver an Elvis dress to his soon to be ex-wife motivated by. What more ??. Udpressning. As they both make their way, they have many run-ins with Elvis impersonators on their way to an Elvis imitation convention in Vegas. Soon, the FBI will be involved and start tracking what they think is an Elvis impersonator serial killer. Unfortunately, the premise does not mean that the film was good. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, imagine you're back in first class ?? When stories and continuity are not really important. It is much more fun to just watch Basinger look beautiful in his Pink Lady outfit instead of wondering why what she does doesn't really make sense. The film is trying hard, but ultimately the way falls far short. In the end, it is filled with ideas that could have been theoretically fun, but in practice it was not fun. It's not the worst, but you can find yourself leaving the building when you see this one ???? Don't say I didn't warn you!
