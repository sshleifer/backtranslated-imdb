This movie was by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I'm not even fun. It was badly made and the actors couldn't act. It was a waste of my time and money. It looked like a movie my friends and I could have gathered on their own. The case the movie came in is definitely a disguise. Nothing in the movie looks like zombie on the front of the case. It seems that the director or makeup artist has just put a black eyeliner under some eyes and called them a zombie. The credits at the start of the film take up almost 20 minutes of the film. Which sees the credits was the best part of the movie. This was honestly a horrible movie, and I couldn't believe how bad it was put together. Scenes jumped from one to the other and sometimes you were like "what happens?" The sound was horrible, and the action shots looked like a couple of teenagers' fun around making a fake battle scene. <br /> <br /> If you are considering renting or buying this movie, I recommend you at least watch the trailer for it because it shows how terrible it really is. I wish I would have seen it before I rented it.
