I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and take my word, there was nothing externally accurate about the character played by Michael J. Fox - # 1 we simply don't go around with our pockets bursting with theater tickets and $ 100 bills! # 2 If I ever let anyone use a room for some afternoon joy, I'll be fired on the spot! The organization I belong to (Les Clefs d'Or) has very specific standards of ethics and behavior that we take seriously. # 3 Likewise, the concept at the end of Doug's movie was merely to remove his gold key badge and pass it on to another employee - we serve those keys and it is an honor and knowledge mark to be allowed to carry them. There is a whole application and wetting process to join our organization. <br /> <br /> This movie does nothing to eliminate the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money clearing mercenary. In short, it makes it scary for our organization. I welcome any comments.
