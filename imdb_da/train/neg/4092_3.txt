I like Fulci movies, I really do and not in a boring ironic way, nor do I, but I recognize that they seem hopelessly scary and distorted for many people. Conquest is where Fulci tries his hand at the epic fantasy genre and doesn't really succeed. Structurally, it's like most Fulci movies you've seen. Some things happen, some more things happen, and occasionally a scene may be tangentially related to another. It's really like Conan without sets, no script, no real actors (yes, Arnold Scharzenfartz is not an actor either), no budget, stupid dog soldiers and a bunch of gore. a hard one to get through and I could have lived without empty vaseline smeared on the camera to give it that hair metal music video looks.
