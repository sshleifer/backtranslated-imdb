Priyadarshan - When a person heard his name, his first thought would be 'comedy'. That's what this man is known for, or rather, was known for. After giving amazing bursting comedies like Hungama, Hera Pheri and Hunchul, his train slowly jumped with movies like Chupke Chupke and a few others whose names I can't remember for now. Now, with horrible movies like Dhol, the first word that would set us up after hearing his name would be 'torture'. <br /> <br /> Dhol is a mix of bad, unfunny toilet jokes, some drama, poor excitement and idiocracy. The only good thing about Dhol was one or two of the scenes that were fun, but not witty, and secondly, except Kunal Khemu and the hysterical grandmother, the play was decent. <br /> <br /> Talking about the play, I felt that Rajpal Yadav and Sharman Joshi were at the top (if you compare them to the others in the movie), then Tusshar Kapoor came, then Tanushree and finally two idiots mentioned above. The fault in Kunal Khemu was that he was tall in his jokes and even in his plays. The grandmother first looked like a ghost, plus she was not funny at all, but rather stupid. <br /> <br /> The reason was the same, seen before one. Four boys behind girls and need money but with a few twists. There is a "bad" man who is premorely stupid and stupid. And finally, the good wins over the bad, and everything is fine. The idea of ​​having a Dhol with a tone full of cash in it is simply not witty. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the movie is its length. After an hour or so you will be exhausted and will leave the theater. But being a critic is my responsibility to tolerate the whole two and a half hours of the film. The movie goes over and over, and the same kind of jokes are repeated over and over, and the situations are perennial just in another place. <br /> <br /> If your mother-in-law has come to your house and starts mocking you on everything, send her to this movie and have fun. 3 out of 10
