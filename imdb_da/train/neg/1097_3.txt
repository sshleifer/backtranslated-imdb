I realize that the US Army was demoralized in 1971, but this movie was incredible. It was supposed to be a training camp, not the SS battalion in a Sven Hassell novel. The author must be a true army hater. The psychosocialist who continued to beat the fate of mood belonged to a prison cell, and the useless black tops should also have been fired. These men went abroad, the receiving entities would surely have wondered where all the useless damaged recruits came from, and an investigation would have followed. The scene that blew it completely was the electrocution one. Farrell, the alleged barrack room lawyer, would have had the instructor over a barrel to issue an illegal order (to torture POWs in violation of the Geneva Convention), actually assaulting a mocked man, sexual assault and behavior outside an officer. Intead he just goes away. Then the discipline slows down to a madhouse level, and the film becomes unmatched. I don't know how it ended, I went to bed.
