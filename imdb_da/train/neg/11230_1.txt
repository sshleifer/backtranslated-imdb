In the sixth grade, each teacher had decided that it would be a good idea to make this film the curriculum for a whole semester. Each class had something to do with this horrible show. We saw it in English and wrote in magazines as if we were one of the characters. In mathematics we talked about charts and other seawater. In science, we talked about whales (there was actually something interesting, so it wasn't a 100% waste of time). The whole day was torture every day. Not only that, but they would subject us to this horror twice a day by making us see it also in the study story. I could see if this was a new series or something, but it was like '93. I'm still trying to block this out.
