This movie is not just bad, not just corny, it's repulsive. Something about Daphne, about the creepy call-girl, about the whole hell (and I use the word literally) film radiates a grotesque query that would offend a brothel moraine. This movie causes my skin to crawl, regrets me having reproductive organs and makes me unclean. <br /> <br /> One of the things that worry me most about this movie is that they used such a good concept. A creature that makes fantasies with disastrous results, rather than Clich√© Worst Nightmare and the overdone Twisted Wish, is a truly fascinating movie idea. The idea: The reason why hobgoblins have to be killed before the day is what they are attracted to bright light. During the day, the bright lights do not show well, so they could go anywhere. <br /> <br /> Count Hobgoblins: Four hobboblins run out of the movie studio, yet at least nine of the pernicious plush toys are killed during the movie. <br /> <br /> Discussion Questions: If you had a frigid, demanding, unappreciative girlfriend, would you go into gardening tools with a military piece head? Explain.
