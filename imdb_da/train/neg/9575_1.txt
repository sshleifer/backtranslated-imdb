First of all, let's begin by saying that Robert Englund Doug Bradley and Melinda Clark should be commended for being associated with this piece. I had to give this a 1 it wouldn't let me give it a zero. Want to know how bad this movie is? my mother calls me from all over town and tells me "son, i just watched the stupid movie ever. I replied to say" killer tongue huh? "She was like how did you know? It's so bad that this movie is. I think it looked like a good movie first Freddy Pinhead Melinda. Okay, I'll give it a try. I sat through the rest of this movie because I wrote a column for horror movie reviews, I ask you, don't play your time money or even brain cells on this ridiculous piece of crap, run away far away.If you are watching it on Hollywood video blockbuster or even your local video store, Turn it around and walk away .... and I still want my two hours back dang it
