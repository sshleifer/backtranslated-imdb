With the exception of the sound, none of the above-mentioned real criticisms for this type of no budget, (really) independent horror movie. Make-up effects and gore are very good and leading actor was effective, the leading actress, although attractive needs some coaching when she was particularly poor. The biggest problem with Frightworld is its length, in 108 minutes it is half an hour long to be effective as a slasher movie, plot wise only about ten minutes of the first fifty are relevant. In places it is visually engaging and sometimes lacking lighting works in the movies favor. But when combined with the bad sound as is the case with most of the movie, large parts are difficult to see. <br /> <br /> This could surely be an entertaining one whose original "serial killer from the dead" movie with some judicious and ruthless editing plays it in its present form as an unfinished coarse cut.
