Well. this was not a surprise. Many people will tell you this is gory. but they all talk "shiztz", this movie is very slow. It starts with a guy who makes a collision to feel no pain, he calls it "my son" there are some spawn scenes, but I found them weak. You might as well jump over 40 minutes of the movie and get to the eyeball scene, which was surprisingly impressive and sickly. There are some really stupid scenes in this. and they duplicate hits and slack with silly false slapping sound that makes me laugh! I would not recommend it. continue to see gorehounds. <br /> <br /> Check this out if you want the similar 20-10 minute end scene that is still not so amazing and has a random scene of the guy trying to suffer rape his mother .. yeah it is weird.
