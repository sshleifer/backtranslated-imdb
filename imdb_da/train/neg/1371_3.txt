I can't figure out how anyone can get a budget for a movie, so bad. It's like the TV station is desperate for something, anything at all. They are buried under a bunch of snow, the power is constantly flashing and off, but there is a magical backlight that remains constant. Where does all this (false) light come from? It, and all the stupid things that throw between the characters. They seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than trying to invent ways to survive. It tries to create that emergency and helps people. But because it's so bad to control and act, you won't make your Florence Nightingale with this flick, sorry. I go with the negative feedback and I agree that this is one of the worst movies ever.
