Now the big cash machine has done it again! Disney very sharply exploits morons like myself who feel we should own every video (good or bad) stamped with Disney moniker. Why is it that I continue to look forward to these "successors" who make Don Bluth on a bad day similar to Leonardo DaVinci? Cinderella 2 consists of three storylines (already a bad choice!) Is one of the most imaginative Disney creations at least deserved a linear story? Of these, only the last one comes anywhere near the quality of animation and storytelling that I would expect. The music is terrible and modern (meaning in 2 years, it's already dated) and doesn't add anything to the story. Why should everything be updated? You know, the original cartoon is still popular because of its timelessness, so why not be respectful and true to the original with songs that reflect the same style? Gee, I can't wait for a successor to Sleeping Beauty. Instead of music based on the themes Tchaikovsky, we get music inspired by Britney Spears !!! So Disney, if you listen, remember we're not all rude children out here. How about throwing a bone or two to the fans that have existed long enough to know the difference between craft and crap?
