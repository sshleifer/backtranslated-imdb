This movie is not fun at all, it tries to be fun with the lame humor that is so dry and boring that the movie is only 2 hours of torture. Throughout the film I thought of one thing, "when should it end". One thing to deal with is that they have very few mildly fun moments, which is also why I gave it a whole 2 stars. It is unoriginal and uses almost all old blonde joke in the book, even those who weren't funny the first time. It is basically a movie that spoils blondes and captures whole blind jokes. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, this movie's blond humor has gone bad, it's not worth paying any money to see, it's just that bad.
