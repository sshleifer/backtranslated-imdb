Since the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon came together, there has been a lot of talk about the revival of the Hong Kong film industry. Don't believe it. The people who now produce movies in HK give new meaning to the word crass. Running out of time 2 is a perfect example. Ekin Cheng is the name draw here, but he spends most of the movie just grinning idiotically and turning a coin. He runs the coin again and again and again and again. Why? Who knows? Sean Lau plays a policeman who is hunting for the coin-flipping beautiful boy. But once again: who knows why? There is a beautiful actress in the female manager running a kind of business, and she has to pay a ransom or something, but she looks pretty much like she'd rather be in a spa or mall than in front of a camera. Nothing makes sense. There is no action. There is no sex. There is no comedy. All there is is a name: Ekin Cheng. And you know what? So what?
