There are some good things about the movie. Music and movies are great. Alex Wilson is warm and gives a good performance. Ryan Bauer is also warm. The production was very fortunate to have thrown them because they really give the production value to the film. Jonny Vincent (Sean) and many of the boys in the movie who do not speak are cute too. Why isn't the actor playing Amy listed in the credits? Brandon Alexander gives a great comedy like Clitarissa Pink. <br /> <br /> The worse thing about the movie is probably the star James Townsend. He can't act. He is also very scrawny, not nice to look at. His arms are like spaghetti. It's disgusting. They have no muscle tone at all. It is no wonder that he has to make his own film and familiarize himself with it. No one else would throw him in anything. <br /> <br /> James Townsend is not trustworthy as a person who even wanted a girlfriend because he seems so gay. They should have thrown another as the management if they wanted what was best for the movie. Then again, maybe he just wants to use this movie as a vehicle to start a career in soft core porn, absolutely not real acting because he would have taken some plays. Plus, who does porn, is blacklisted in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous thing about the movie is probably the release of a tan-skinned Latina as Devon's mother. Sonja Fisher doesn't seem like an actress at all. All in all, this movie is soft-core porn and is no better than anything you would see on Skinemax. I think even Alex Wilson, probably the best thing about this movie, is embarrassed by it and won't be associated with it. There is no photo on his IMDb page and nothing else, so Alex Wilson is probably a one-time stage name. Plus, I ran into him in West Hollywood once recently, and when I mentioned this movie, he turned around and walked away. I understand. If I had been working on this movie, I would be embarrassed and would not be associated with it.
