warned: this movie tells many love stories without context. <br /> <br /> The only intent of this movie seems to show love in many different ways. Each story has only a few minutes, so there is no sign development and almost no plot. Just a sketched idea of ​​a plot. The author tried to build in turning points that would surprise the viewer. However, it just didn't work because you didn't know the signs before, or those "jokes" were just stupid. <br /> <br /> This is a movie about love that does not reach your heart. A dozen times. Or even more I don't know and I don't care.
