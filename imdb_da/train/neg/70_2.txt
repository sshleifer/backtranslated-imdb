This movie has never made it into theaters in our area, so when it became available on DVD, I was one of the first to rent it. For once, I would listen to the critics and move on with this. <br /> <br /> Despite the excellent line-up of actors, the film was very disappointing. I can see now why it went directly to video. <br /> <br /> I thought that with Bloom, Ledger and Rush could have some value. Everyone has done wonderful work in the past. <br /> <br /> The movie went slow and never penetrated me. I failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight for the urge to fast forward to the end. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie, even if you are thinking of renting it only for 'eye candy' purposes. It will not satisfy itself.
