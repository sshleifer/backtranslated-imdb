This movie made me really angry because the protagonists or all the characters have a southern accent. I have lived in Iowa for 29 years and I know people don't have a southern accent here. This movie is about a guy who does meth, and I don't know the right plot or what the movie is supposed to be about. It has some beautiful graphic drug use in it, and it's really offensive, so see that these people use meth as if it were sugar. I lost my brother to meth, and this movie makes me sick in my stomach because it glamorizes the fabric. The movie makes it look cool to use the fabric, but I was happy at the end as the guy almost did it across the state line. I also know that most women who experience a traumatic rape will not love their girlfriend or husband the next day. The movie is just wrong in all directions. I would suggest "The Basketball Diaries" if I were to suggest a movie about drugs.
