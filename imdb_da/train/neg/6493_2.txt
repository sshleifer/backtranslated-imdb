Oh dear ... as an Englishman and a little part Welsh, a fan of Anthony Hopkins' work in the industry ..... to date, I'm really disappointed. <br /> <br /> You see, I'm a no one hoping for better. So my comments are like 'straw in the wind'. But that's the point, isn't it? - I have no ax to paint on the commercial value of a work. I, a full member of the great unwashed, go to see a movie to be transported to another place. Yes, suspend faith for a short time. But not getting into a state of total misunderstanding. <br /> <br /> If this was by an unknown author and director, I would guess that this "production" would have been cast into oblivion. Unfortunately, it is not, and I was left with an eye and confused. Having seen some of the rave reviews given this work, I am slightly worried .... Maybe that's what I'm trying to do without anticipating seeing each movie on its own. Regardless of the author, instructor, studio or even the content of the content. <br /> <br /> My advice, so many before me: Don't write and control the same production. It's full of danger. Movies must be moderated to maintain credibility. <br /> <br /> As they say in the school reports "Could and could do better ..."
