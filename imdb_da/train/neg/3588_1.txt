The follow-up to the 1973 "Walking Tall" continues the real drama of Tennessee Sheriff Buford Pusser, but this episode plays like a lame television movie. Bo Svenson takes over the lead role of Joe Don Baker, but he is much too gentle for that part; He comes out as an ambassador with a bat instead of a guitar. Good supportive actors like Richard Jaekel, Luke Askew and Robert DoQui end up with little to do. I would give the film a star strictly on its good intentions, but the manuscript is a transparent and lazy mass of routine preachers and the production is cheapjack. Followed in 1977 by "Final Chapter-Walking Tall" and in 1978 by the TV movie "A Real American Hero".
