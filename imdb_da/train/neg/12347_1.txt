This is easily the worst Ridley Scott movie. Ridley Scott is a wonderful instructor. But this film is a black mark on his career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, both completely miscast in an over-aggressive film about a girl going to the army. Very stupid. And there is never a scene convincing in any way. It's really not hard to make a movie like this. Everything the crew did could have been an idea of ​​just one. The authors also didn't have much inspiration; many stupid dialogues that did not make sense at all; and some brainless actions. I highly recommend staying away from this rubbish. I hope the many talented people involved in this project realize this type of movie does not deserve their attention and that they will work on more honest and intelligent movies in the future than this useless mess.
