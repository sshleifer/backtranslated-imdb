Where is Michael Caine when you need him? I've seen most of the many seasons of MST3K, but this rare first season flash (episdoe K-20) is easily one of the worst movies ever made. Three "stars", Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith are struggling through the worst series of filmography ever and delivering lines that must have been written by a secret Dick Cheney-style working group of Exxon and GM lawyers trying to cut funds for mass transit and energy efficiency research. It seems that it was filmed in almost total darkness, possibly at Super 8. Lets Logan's Run look like the cinematic Sistine Chapel crossed with Shakespeare. I can't imagine seeing it without the Crow and Servo comment, as it is unmatched by it. Clearly, what is needed in Hollywood, a kind of 401K, prevents the need for actors to take on bad movies like this to pay for their health care. With its "rights to pollute and drive" theme at the end, I expect half to see a Charlton Heston cameo where he delivers his "cold-dead hands" speech. Lee, I could have forgiven you in 1989, but 1981?
