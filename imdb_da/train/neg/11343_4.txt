1. Watched 2/2/2003 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Jim Kammerud & Brian Smith): Crab and un-spectacularly supposed successor to the original classic animated `101 Dalmatians. 'Yes, the movie continues where it ended in the first, but the problem is that it plays much like the original. One of the great things about the original was the pacification of the story that this one does not have. The animation is also very un-spectacular for Disney and all we get is the same characters that go through the same kind of story again. When will Disney stop boring with successors and re-do's, etc. Probably when we stop renting or buying this mediocre fare they have put out.
