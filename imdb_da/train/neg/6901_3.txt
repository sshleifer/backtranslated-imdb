The most positive thing I can say for this boring witted local "comedy" production is that it is unofficial. In fact, it is so amazingly bland that you wonder how many dozens of rewrites of committees it went through to get such a complete removal of personality. It's not witty, it's not entertaining, it's not insightful, and it's not charming. It's just a stubborn, ridiculous, progression of four losers who have to change their ways - and their attitudes toward women - to be allowed to attend their best friend's wedding. With acting it will be subparent for local amateur drama society, a plot line so tired it would make a forty-third season of 'Allo' Allo look fresh, and jokes about as humorous as watching overdue vegetables, Sion's Wedding nevertheless scored Ten (yes 10) nominations in NZ movie awards recently. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, somebody saw, and nobody wins.
