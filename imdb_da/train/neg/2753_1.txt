Firstly, I would like to point out that Sam Niel is not anywhere to look in this movie. What a movie without Sam Niel. Have someone seen Event Horizon. The D-warriors had the potential of a movie about a dragon that controls lizards with rocket launches, sounds cool, but unfortunately it is not. No, no Sam Niel, no good movie. I recommend taking the 5 dollars or so it takes to rent D-Wars and add 10 to 5 and buy a Sam Niel movie - apparently to submit this, I need ten text lines, then here's a list of Sam Niel movies I recommend <br /> <br /> -Arassic Park -Dead calm -hunt for Red October -Event Horizon-Not Jurassic Park Tree <br /> <br /> Overall D-War is a pile
