Guys who ever even think of watching this movie have already got some disturbances through their heads. This movie has nothing to do with Jack the Ripper (incase you thought) his second B, I mean E-Grade movies consisting of a bunch of horny teens in some sex scenes are seen just before they get their spleen splattered on a nearby tree. It's not scary, fun or entertaining. If you really want gory stuff without a plot, then see Cabin Fever, at least the director does not fall asleep midway through controlling this crap.only see this if you absolutely have nothing to do in life and the only thing on TV is Oprah Winfrey crying on the TV.
