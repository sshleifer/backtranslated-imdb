Every time, a group of friends with a minimal budget, but bags of enthusiasm and talent, create a low budget masterpiece that takes the world of horror by storm. Raimi and co. did it with The Evil Dead, Jackson and Pals managed with bad taste; and Myrick and Sanchez made a mint with The Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br /> However, director Todd Sheets and his chums are set to wake up forever in relative turmoil if Zombie Bloodbath is something to pass by. A lesson on how not to make a cheapo horror serves this miserable effort (about a plague of carnivorous zombies natch) as a reminder that, although many people today have access to a video camera, most should not take it as their choice to try to make a full-length movie. <br /> <br /> It's not that Sheets has not noticed a well-framed shot (some of his camera angles and movements are actually pretty good) but rather that a) he has a miserable script b) he has a miserable cast, and c) he is not aware that he has a miserable script and thrown. This means that the final film is amateurish in the extreme, and it is unlikely to be seen in its entirety by other than zombie film accomplishers (like me) or members of the cast and crew (like those who have given the film good comments). <br /> <br /> Of course, Zombie Bloodbath is aimed at non-discriminatory gorehounds, and Sheets (currently having an incredible 34 titles under his belt as an instructor) are certainly out of their way to please with the buckets of offal and Blood thrown at every opportunity. But while these moments are unthinkable yucky, they are not very convincing, and soon they become boring. <br /> <br /> So to sum up, this is a really bad movie with almost no redeeming features. Aside from two: <br /> <br /> First, it has the only biggest mule in the movie's history, which was played by Jerry Angell, who plays Larry (as well as several zombies). The sensation of his child (combined with a harvesting mustache) is just reason for watching this movie. Second, it has 'pathetic stealth zombies': carnivorous bodies waiting for unfortunate victims to pass by before jumping from their hiding place to start a weak attack, requiring almost no effort to escape. Best known for lurking behind a door for hours and waiting for someone to open it, "playful stealth zombies" also occasionally hide behind low walls or sit in churches as members of the congregation. <br /> <br /> Normally a movie this bad would get 1/10 for me, but to celebrate Jerry Angell's flow locks I will generously increase my rating to 2/10.
