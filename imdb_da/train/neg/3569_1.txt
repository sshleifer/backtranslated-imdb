Wow! Only one movie, this ridiculously horrible could inspire the similar "Showgirls". I mean where to start? The inevitably terrible theme song? Pia Zadora's non-expression throughout the film? The fact that, although they are located in Los Angeles, aka "the landing bench" every man (and woman!) Fawning over himself to sleep with Pia Zadora, with all necessary means? Or what about the fact that each person in the movie is completely unsympathetic because they are either stupid (Pia) or obviously despicable sleazeball (everyone else)? And when this flick was written by actual screenwriters (sorta), it shows a shocking lack of understanding of the movie industry (who the hell would admire and kiss up to a SCREENWRITER?) <br /> <br /> But it is (unintentional) fun as hell, even though the "breakdown" scene alone will make you giggle and after seeing the climate "I'm not the only one who had to **** her to the top" scene on "Prizes" (all done In the usual trading basement level that we expect from such quality speakers as Pia, I sincerely hope that our dear Pia actually re-uses this speech when she "won" her Golden Globe. It fits in and it would completely make my day. > <br /> Anyway, if you're a fan of bad, tashy camp, give this otherwise sticky movie a try.
