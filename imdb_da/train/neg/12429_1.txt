Remembering the filthy details of this insidious, woven "film" is akin to digging into the breast cavity with a rusty salt. Perhaps "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" (1992) was a bit on the predictable side, but this pathetic excuse for a movie is just one of the most shameless bids of commercialization I've ever heard of. A boy fighting for spies / terrorists when he is home alone in a Chicago suburb with chickenpox? Ridiculous! Why should this movie be made? I'm the kind of person who thinks that even horrible movies aren't a waste of time, but rather learning experiences. But it's actually a waste of time. It should be avoided at all costs.
