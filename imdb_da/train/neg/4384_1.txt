The fact that someone has actually spent money on such a bad script is beyond me. This really has to be one of the worst movies in addition to the "Haunted Highway" I've ever seen. BAD actors, and a really bad story. There are no normal reactions to any event in this movie, and even though it is Halloween, normal people would have greater responses when they witnessed their father being killed, not to mention dull people with tape covering their Respiratory tracts cannot breathe (in a room with at least 50 people I can add) and a person dressed up as Satan pulls dead people out of the house, even an 8-year-old would see the difference between a doll and a person. Not to mention the fact that no one could be so naive and stupid to believe in the reality of Satan and Jesus' appearances the same day that this child does. When I was 8, I certainly had more brains than that. <br /> <br /> But the really stupid thing is that everyone else seems to be falling for this stupid Satan look-like, and no question asked. The question in the whole movie is, is it really Satan, or is it a crazy person who kills people when he feels it? Now he has human hands, arms, built and anything, so I suppose he should also be in the movie, or they did a miserable job that hid it. Then he could kill an old lady, a man and his mistress, 5 (!! ???) cops (all with weapons and training I suspect) and some other people. .... and of course everyone just stood there waiting for him or what? <br /> <br /> The whole concept and way of telling the story is definitely the worst I have seen and I will never recommend anyone to waste 1 hour and 30 minutes of their lives to see this overall crap.
