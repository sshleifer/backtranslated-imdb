Title: Robot Jox (1990) <br /> <br /> Director: Stuart Gordon Cast: Gary Graham, Anne Marie Johnson, Paul Koslo <br /> <br /> Review: Stuart Gordon whom we normally associate with extremely gory horror Movies like Re-Animator, From Beyond, Dagon and Castle Freak took a small detour here and made a little sci-fi flick. I emphasize the word "small" as this is a very low budget flick and is in the greatest weakness. <br /> <br /> The story goes on in the future. A world where the great superpowers (who, according to this movie are the US and Russia) do not pay tribute to their differences by going on a full-blown world war ... but by fighting with gladiatorial battles with giant robots. Our hero Achilles must go up against the evil Russian robot fighter called Alexander. Lots of cheap stop motion animation follows. <br /> <br /> Well, the idea is amazing, I guess. The big nations settle territorial disputes with giant robots? Interesting premise and one that could have been handled properly if the correct budget had been available. Unfortunately, what could have been a fun movie ends up being embarrassed by an otherwise amazing instructor. I, as a child, loved this movie and I guess if you want to enjoy this movie, you will have to return to the little kid fashion to have fun with it. I showed this movie to some of my friends, and when the movie progressed to my friends, where as "What the hell is this crazy about?" And I'm just as good, this movie is a sci-fi of one of my favorite directors Stuart Gordon? "But when the film went on to corny territory, I almost felt like hitting the stop and not getting them to go through the torture. I could go through it because I loved this movie as a child and there is still a little nostalgia but everyone else just didn't want to get it. <br /> <br /> And I realized that the movie isn't "It's really so good. First of all, the movie is about giant robots that kicking hell out of each other, and in order to achieve this in a credible way, use some marvelous good special effects to make it work, expensive effects It would help us to suspend the default, but unfortunately it is a small movie from a little company (Empire Pictures who went bankrupt after making this movie!) The effects only help us to giggle and laugh at them.Set and some of the wardrobe looks unfinished or half assed. <br /> <br /> OK assigned when you accept that you see a mixture of mother To stop animation and thumbnails, you can well indulge in the movie and even enjoy the big robots that kick hell out of each other. There are some scenes when the robots fight, which is pretty cool, and made me go "that's why I liked that movie!" But everyone knows and them, some crazy effect will take you straight out of the protective little cocoon you tried to hide in. And the boom your right back to realize this movie just doesn't live up to its premise. <br /> <br /> Here's another thing that disturbs me a little about the movie. This movie is basically a movie for children. Do you know gigantic robots do it? Stop motion animation? Hi? But this movie dialogue had many sexual innuendo, and the violence became a little bloody. So I kept asking myself is this a kids movie or not? After a while I came to the conclusion that it was basically a children's film with adult feelings, which really is not a good mix. So for those of you who don't feel like some naive childish charm watching two robots fight each other, and if you don't have a nostalgic connection to this movie (as I do), well Id suggests you get away from this one. Gordon's a great instructor, but this movie he made, just didn't do it for me. Well, at least not now when I'm an adult. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 out of 5
