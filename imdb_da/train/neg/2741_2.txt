Spoiler !! I love Branagh, love Helena Bonham-Carter, loved them together in "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" - but THIS - <br /> <br /> I can understand an actor's desire to stretch to avoid the romantic stereotype. Well, they did, but really - the script drowned on, Bonham-Carter's clothing was sixty-chic, and the occasional faster "madcap" sequence could have been a play from a Beatles movie or the old Rowan and Martin Laugh I. <br /> <br /> I never got the point - other commentators say the Branagh character was a dreamer. I never felt it. He was a loser, and not very bright, and certainly not contradictory. The business of the bank robber's disguise was only painful to see. Absolutely not fun. <br /> <br /> The realistic (a conjecture) attempt by Bonham-Carter's realistic speech was harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of the Lancashire accent in "Full Monty." <br /> <br /> The poetic end, with him high on a hill with her buried under his plane's monstrosity, was too orchestrated. Was there a choir of angels, or just a soundtrack? <br /> <br /> Go back to the classics or something with a back and a bow to it. Give this to PBS. <br /> <br />
