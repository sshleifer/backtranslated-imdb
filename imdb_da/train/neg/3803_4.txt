The film seems uninhibited and generally, poorly written. The play moves as if 10 different people wrote it, and none of them communicated with each other. Apparently, they wanted to take a page from a Miracle on 34th Street (the original) type of movie, but it's done in such a bad way that the movie is falling apart. This movie is only for the very young, and even they will see the fact that whoever wrote it knows little about nothing about baseball. Such as: <br /> <br /> ?? When the angels are in dead last place, does the owner seem to break, nor is he bothered by the fact that his leader just came into a fight with his pitcher ?? ON MOUND ?? or that the PUNCHED team play by play announcer on live TV. But when the team is a game of winning the division, he is bent out of shape over a story (taken by a 6-year-old) that the leader gets help from a child claiming to see real angels. What sounds worse? One loses tremendously outside the controller, whose team has lost 15 in a row? Or a winning coach on the edge of the playoffs, who seems a little eccentric and helps foster children? Owner's reaction makes no sense. And he has moved to change by Maggie and her 'straight out of clich√© country' speech during a press conference. <br /> <br /> ?? The angels will play for the Division in the last weekend series against the White Sox, but at the end of the game, the advertiser continues to say that the angels 'won the vimp'. The vimp is not determined until someone wins the LEAGUE Championship, not the usual season division title. <br /> <br /> ?? Whitt Bass, the goofball guy is the starter and wins the game that breaks the angels who lose the streak? so is the starter kettle ?? THE VERY NEXT DAY. Mel Clark (Tony Danza) is said in the ninth inning to have thrown 156 seats in a low scoring scoring. Typically in low scoring games the pit count is much lower than this, usually around 80-90 seats. "AL" says the angel at the end "The championship will be won on its own", though he and his angels have manipulated and fixed games throughout the second half of the season. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on again as there are many other examples where the story is poorly written. <br /> <br /> For younger children (under 10), this movie can be entertaining. It's too bad ?? done right this could have been a classic. Performed incorrectly like this and it is an unforgettable mess that will forever live like a UHF / cable Saturday morning leaching.
