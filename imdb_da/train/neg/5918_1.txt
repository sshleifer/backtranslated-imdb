Carl Panzram lived a fantastic life and scratched his memoirs on paper sheets for possibly the only person who had ever done anything selfless to him. The book "Panzram: A Journal of Murder" by Thomas E. Gaddis and James O. Long, who came out most of a century after the death of Panzram, gives the historical connection to a first generation US bill to run from home. West and be a cowboy, get caught, thrown into the boy's home, get away several times and thrown into jail again and again all the time being tortured and sodomized. As Panzram grew tremendously and strongly, he sought to avenge himself for the wrong done to him as he traveled to South America, Europe and Africa, and no matter what he shouted, robbed or murdered, because we all just as well worthless. <br /> <br /> This movie throws skinny James Woods like the coarse neck, medieval, son of a bitch Carl Panzram, who in the film is "full", overly dramatic and emotional, and never mentioning the joy of sodomizing men and boys. The film also elaborates nothing more than specifically on this world traveler and career prisoner (like stealing former President Taft or being released from the Oregon prison as long as he gave his word back). In short, I don't think Carl would be too happy.
