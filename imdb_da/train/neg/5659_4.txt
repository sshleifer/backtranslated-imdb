A disappointing end to a season that started so well ... Exodus Part 2 and other remarkable episodes were among the best seen on television in any series where it was pretty bad. <br /> I'm not sure if it was an episode that was a disappointment, but the cheesy guitar music that came with the closed sequence was ridiculous and would have been more at home in the original series. <br /> <br /> It's almost as if corporate execs didn't like the low key down note ending and wanted to jazz it up. They failed and spoiled everything. <br /> <br /> Let us hope this is not a trend for the future. <br /> <br /> At least we saw the return of a particular person, even though it was a bit bizarre and tritely done.
