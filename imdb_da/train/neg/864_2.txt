Although there is a repertoire of over 180 movies to choose from, this 'Succubus' is often referred to as the best Jess Franco movie. Heck, even the legendary filmmaker Fritz Lang, counts 'Succubus' among his personal favorites. So maybe it's me, but I thought it was a terribly dull and confusing movie. The opening is great and shows that Janine Reynaud performs an SM action on stage. Unfortunately, it is completely downhill from here. Reynaud's character is a maneater who eventually kills his lovers in a kind of trance. Franco had a decent budget to work with and uses it well in fine places, beautiful photography and a fascinating musical score. This could have been his greatest movie if it wasn't for the lame and uninteresting story. It must be psychedelic, but I would say that sophomoric is a better expression for describing what is shown here. Half the time you have no idea what is going on or what exactly is said, so even though the short-circuit of 80 minutes seems to be aged. It is certainly not Franco's best movie according to me. I would not even recommend it to die-hard exploitation fans. If you're looking for more superior Jess Franco movies, try to get your hands on 'Las Vampiras',' The Awful Dr. Orloff 'or' Female Vampire '.
