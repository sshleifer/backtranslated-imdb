OK, I'm blessed. I've seen two very strong stage productions, one in New York with the original cast, and another on the San Diego Rep (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, you rock!). Compared to one of these, the film is hardly available. I have plodding through the DVD the last two nights and am still not finished. Too much external dialogue and too many added scenes and people. Yes, the four major performances are pretty good, esp. Ms. Streep is. But the comparison scene to movies is definitely an example of "less is more." The thickening of the game to satisfy the filmmaker's need for scenic variations and specificity was a poor choice. Please find a stage production somewhere near you.
