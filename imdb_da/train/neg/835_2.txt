After seeing both the Lion King and Lion King II and enjoyed both thoroughly. I thought Lion King 1.5 could be worth seeing. What a disappointment! Disney must be desperate for revenue. Especially now, when they lost the deal with pixar. <br /> <br /> Basically, they've just picked up some bits of footage that were left on the editor's floor (or trash cans) and glued together to make a quick buck. Unlike LK I & II, both had strong history lines. <br /> <br /> This movie hardly has a story at all. While characters and animation are always fun to watch, there is simply not enough material here for a movie. Some of the pieces could have been good 2. slice fillers on the original offerings. <br /> <br /> Disney - Shame on you to put this trash can out to get a quick cash! <br /> <br /> Next time take time and effort and put our ongoing work.
