With a title as such it is beyond my understanding how this movie just didn't appeal to me. Permitted, there are a couple of decent cunning moments and a little gore, but the way the movie was shot and the overall storyline struck me like an idiotic and lazy attempt at massive "shock" tactics ... The inconsistent plot starts with a guy rape and murder a woman stranded next to the road. He and his brother are imprisoned until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend in the woods. He ends up forcing her into a house where they screw, and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement. The heavily driven prisoners consist of her old boyfriend who raped her, a "grabby" neighbor and her sexually abusive boss. He explains to her that he will kill them all. She wins the killing of HIM and then turns her focus on the men (or pigs) she tortures and kills herself. Most of the violence and humiliation have to do with eating and destroying genitals - all of which are far from disturbing and essentially mild. The best scene is a graphic dietary attachment for masturbation followed by some painful rape ... Surely, "I'm spitting on your corps, IP! Ss on your grave" was meant as an unofficial sequel to "I spit on your grave" based on mainly the title and a reference protagonist - suggests that her mother was Camille Keaton. I personally consider it to be a wild blasphemous claim! This movie is a boring, amateurish mess that strives for shock but mistakenly ...
