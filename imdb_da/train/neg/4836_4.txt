Let's start with the simple lines. From the viewer's side there are a few good "instructor details", some views on the movie scenes that are good. The special effects are good enough, also a good play. But the story is all too simple. It shows how an elite army bomb squad lives, acts and sometimes dies. It shows the drama of living in war. In my movie experience as a serious action movie "addicted" guy, I missed the click that gets my eyes and mind fixed on the screen. One of the things that must be present in a movie in order to regard it as a good one is the ability to immerse the viewer in the reality and time of the film. It didn't happen to me. I remained "conscious" of the whole movie. Honestly, I think this movie got its place in fame based on the "subconscious" appeal of American patriotism, a healthy and genuine feeling, but not the appropriate use as a film-based generator. More than a movie about war, it grows its popularity based on it. <br /> <br /> A simple mindset: If this was a World War II or I movie, only changing time, with everything remaining the same, would it be assigned this? Not sure. Why? Because there are good ones that raise the bar all the way to high. <br /> <br /> Compared to its rivals in Oscars, I don't think that all the prizes it won are properly awarded.
