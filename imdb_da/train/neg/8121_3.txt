Time is valuable. This movie is not. I have to learn to ignore critics who rage about small movies like Fargo and this complete waste of time. The theater was packed and everyone went back with the same reaction: Is that the movie critics rage about? What a piece of shit! The cake in this movie is the upward mobile black daughter looking out and finding her white trash family. Get it? <br /> <br /> The action is amazing. The production (lighting, set, editing, sound) is about 2 steps over a 60 minute story. The characters are superficial and unintentional. I was offended by the fact that these people could not find out what was overtly obvious to the public; The audience mumbled on the screen, what the characters should say next. <br /> <br /> I have had more fun making clothes.
