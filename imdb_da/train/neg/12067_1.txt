You know that a movie doesn't go well when John Carradine tells (eg, reads script & plot synopsis) about his character burial procession, just 5 minutes in the movie. The story is the last will and testament of his character. It is stated that his property is divided among his 4 children and servants. The children should split $ 136 million equally, but if anyone dies, this share is shared among the remainders. If all the children are to die, it is divided among the servants. To be eligible, they must stay in the family property for a week. It sounds like the typical plot of a reality show. <br /> <br /> There is little subtitle about the deans' character. They are a strong and severe dysfunctional family, but the real problems begin to drown out that dog. From John Carradine's opening voice, you expect this movie to lead to a Machiavellian cat and mouse game with a twist ending. <br /> <br /> This journey is painfully slow and meaningless. We draw minutes to watch people sit around, play pool, throw darts, abuse of "through the fish bowl" shot, dramatic conversations between silk cravat wearing men, constant bickering, misplaced circus music, bizarre flashbacks reminiscent of faux-german expressionism, the horrible class 4 aesthetics and heaps of dramatic overactive. This inevitably leads to the expected and unnecessary ending. You will be happy to be alive, but the pain can be too big to carry alone. Share kids, share. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
