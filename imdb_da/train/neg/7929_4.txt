I think if you're into sci-fi and horror stuff, it might be interesting. The action was okay, but not great. The two pregnant girls should be fifteen but played by overtly older actresses who turned out to be twenty-one at the time. The reason is okay, but the story is jumping around a bit, and you guess you are in Boston or Pennsylvania. The pastor seems to use chain speed between the two. The Catholic Church is portrayed as a secret sect to investigate events that only happen to those of that faith. What if the two girls were Protestant? Would Catholics break? Therefore some what constructed. Who knows, the Catholic Church today can even learn what the Bible teaches. If you miss this, you do not feel you have lost anything.
