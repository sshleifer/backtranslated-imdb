Really, really bad slasher movie. A psychotic person escapes from an asylum. Three years later, he kills a sociology professor, the end of the stage. A semester yesterday later (hi, that's what the title card said) a new sociology professor is at school. She makes friends with another female sociology professor who works there and starts dancing another professor. The students are all bored as we are. <br /> <br /> There are a number of title cards that indicate how much time has passed. Scenes are rather short and cut to different characters elsewhere, making too little progression of any kind. Many scenes involve characters walking and talking, or sitting and talking and serving a little purpose. Despite the passage of time, many of the characters always wear the same clothes. Sometimes the unclear timing, when we see a body for the second time, we ask ourselves: how long has that body been there? And also, at least one of the dead people doesn't seem to have been missed by others. <br /> <br /> The murderer manages to kill a person by sticking her in the chest, another by sticking him in the crotch, and another by cutting his forehead. Is his knife poisoned or something? <br /> <br /> The video box cover has a cheerleader: There is no one in the movie. The back cover has a picture of a person in a graduation cap and a dress that threatens a group of women in a dorm room. The central redhead in the picture is in the movie, but no one ever wears such an outfit and there is no such scene. The killer is strictly one-on-one.
