I may not have the longest attention, but it's the second movie I have refused to see all the way through, and I even bought it on DVD because of its "classic" status. <br /> <br /> I first thought the director played a big joke, so I waited for a decision, something to laugh at, something to keep my interest, but this decision never came. Rather, the writing was ridiculously amateurish, the movie dragged and felt uneven, as if someone were cutting a television series to feature length. The Academy must have been on drugs as they nominated this film for no less than eight Oscars. <br /> <br /> Once again, I repeat myself. This is the second movie I have refused to see all the way through. The first was "Exterminator". I hope it gives you an indication of how bad it really is. 1.10
