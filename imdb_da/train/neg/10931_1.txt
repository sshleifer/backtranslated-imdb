I went to see this movie with pretty low expectations as it would be a nice piece of fluff. Unfortunately, it wasn't even that. I could hardly sit through the movie without going out. I went with my two children (aged 10 and 13) and even kept asking, "How much longer?" After persistently until the end, I just kept wondering who would approve this script. Even the reliable Fred Willard couldn't save the trite dialogue, state jokes and the banal plot. I would suggest that whoever wrote and directed this movie (I use the term resolved) should take an online screen writing school or get rid of their local community course for a movie class. At least, there are many books on managing, screenwriting and film making that will teach them something about structure, plot, dialogue and pacing.
