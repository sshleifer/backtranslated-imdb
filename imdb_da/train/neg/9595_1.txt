In the latest movement to bring Asian films to America, this is the last movie to be released here. Being a big fan of Asian movies from all genres, I surf the web and come across this soong to be re-released to the US market, so I decided to check it out ahead of time and rent it at a local video store. <br /> Believe me ... the action scenes are incredibly disappointing, Crouching Tiger and Iron Monkey totally blew this movie out of the water. Jet Li would fall asleep and see the fighting sequences. If you're looking for martial arts entertainment, your time will be better with a Jackie Chan flick !!! <br /> <br /> Besides ... do you think you will see a martial arts around a girl engulfed in vengence for her parents death but surprise !!! A good hour in this movie in the middle has been filled with dialogue, a lack of action, the lack of devloping a tangent plot, pretty much nothing to do with the premise we are exposed to. It has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy and the boy with his conspiracy group, where the producer / instructor did not have time to elbaorating, and yet dedicated a part of the film to the problem. Would have been much better if they had just cut the whole hour and developed the story itself through another movie and focused on the martial arts aspect. <br /> <br /> Talking about which I really don't believe in choreographer of Iron Monkey, did the action sequence in Princess Blade. I was totally offended by the frequent use of slow motion and fast camera changes to portray the killer's physical speed. I just didn't buy it. <br /> <br /> Please ... I warn you that PLEASE does not waste your time / money with this movie. The prerequisite is intriguing, and the trailer can even tempt you, but I am positive that this movie is NOT suitable for the public (maybe in Japan, but not in the States) and will be the worst movie brought to the states from the Asian film industry.
