I have no idea what the producers of The Shield were trying to do, but the result speaks for itself: The shield is virtually unmatched. <br /> <br /> Probably the show at The Shield is great ... <br /> <br /> In fact, the show is so complex that you can't even see the show. For example, editing away from reaction shots before they have had their full impact. <br /> <br /> I don't know what intellectual reason is for it, but it deprives the show of all emotional consequences. <br /> <br /> I want to give The Shield a point of ambition in its subject, but it's pretty much anything I can give it. It is a shame to see a number of talented Performer wasting their gift on something so strangely filmed.
