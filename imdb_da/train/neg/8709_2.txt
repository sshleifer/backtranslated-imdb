Arg. The shuffling dinosaurs are back to take another bite out of our sanity in this all-horrible third movie. This time, European terrorists (Irish) would say that an army convoy would transport uranium. They pull into a yard, open the truck and discover our old friends carnosaurs. Pandemonium will visit when the rubber dinos chomp the terrorists, police and some marines. The whole movie seems to be (again) heavily inspired by Alien (as Carnosaur 2 was) with the pathetic marines going through the "claustrophobic" yard? guns on the clear. This third opus is probably the driest and most dishonest movie of the party, with only one spurt of blood when a rubber dino strikes a sea head away. Dinos are stiff, shuffling creatures as usual, and T-Rex sounds like a furious elephant when it roars (it also seems to have no eyes). One of the movie's most beautiful scenes is when the copper arrives on stage: they enter the building where the hijacked truck is kept and hear some strange noise from another truck. By opening it, surprise! Rubber Reptile Gang burns and consumes them. Why did dinos unlock in the other truck after deleting from the first? How were they locked in, as the truck door could only be locked from the outside? What was the point of filming this scene ???? Oh, who's worried? Both thumbs down for over-sized rubber Iguanas.
