Decent animation and some functional character development keep this animated horse feeder from DreamWorks at least durable ... but it's still a little slow and the story is a bit on the stupid side. It is interesting to see a reversal of the typical cowboys and Indian roles, but here it just seems like a nod to political correctness rather than a proper history decision. GRADE: C
