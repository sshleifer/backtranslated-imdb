From the creators of shrek ???????? .. ok that grabbed my attention. <br /> <br /> Well, the creators of Shrek also made Madagascar. Madagascar was half as good as Shrek. <br /> <br /> And now Spushed Away is half as good as Madagascar. <br /> <br /> This means that Flushed Away is not good. The animation and all the special effects were extremely good, but the film was not. <br /> <br /> The story of this movie was for children only. It is seriously not possible for adults to actually love this flick. <br /> <br /> But there were many jokes for adults. I bet children dint understand the jokes. <br /> <br /> Despite that, I think like this flick. I'm totally disappointed. 4.10
