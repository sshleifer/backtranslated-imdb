Oh, man, how low series had fallen like in 1952! This boring thing is precisely the kind of serial that annoyed Annie Wilkes (from misery). Not only the heroes escape the traps by adding scenes that weren't there in the previous chapter (and it couldn't be there - tell me that when the evil ones blow the plain in episodes 7 through 8, they wouldn't see signs jumping), but I think this series has the world's footage of archive films. I mean, most are stock footage! And not just from other series (apparently, all the flying sequences from King of the Rocket Men, and the cold "melted stones" scenes in episodes 2 through 3 come from Captain Marvel's adventure), but from themselves! The whole "trip to the moon" sequence (which is probably the shortest ever, it's 30 seconds long and the characters never seem to leave Earth's atmosphere) from episode 1 repeated in episode 8! And episode 10 is ALL scenes from past episodes! (Have you ever wondered why MST3K never did episodes 10, 11 and 12? Now they had to stop after 9 so they didn't have to do it all over again!). <br /> <br /> Don't get me started on the science factor. Prepare to see the hottest moon ever! And the moon men who can't breathe in their own world? What did they smoke? <br /> <br /> And if that's not enough, for talky and stunts (usually the best in series) are few and far. Visually, am I the only one who believes that Commando Cody's spherical helmet (or is it lemon-shaped) is completely ridiculous? Rocketeerens was far cooler, no matter how bad the movie was (and man it was terrible). The tank-like vehicle is not much better, it looks like a bunch of kids made it to Halloween. The only positive thing I can think of is that the actor who plays the hero is homely instead of the usual muscular hunk (hello, everyone has the right to be a hero!) But then he is so uncomfortable. .. <br /> <br /> Not even worth watching for nostalgia's sake. See Captain Marvel instead. 10.2. <br /> <br /> (BTW, check out the Memorable Quotes section for a real Women Lib gem).
