Guy is a loser. Can't get girls to be built up, chosen by stronger successful guys, etc. Seen it then, moved on. I must say that Rob must move past Adam Sandler part of his life. And came out of the Adam Sandler plots. There are two fun parts throughout the movie. I couldn't even finish the last 5 minutes. I was bored. "The Animal" is a good movie. I usually enjoy Adam Sandler movies that have the same plot. But this was trying too hard to impress. The witnesses are very old. So trust me. This is not a movie that most people could really get into. But some did, so I'll be good. <br /> <br /> 3/10
