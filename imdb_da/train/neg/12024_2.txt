Absolutely the most boring nonsense I've seen for a long time. The plot was full of irrelevance, and the play was the worst I have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, camera angles that made me feel sick were used, the random music was horrible and drowned the dialogue (perhaps not so badly), and the shot in San Francisco looked like whether they had been stolen right out of the city's promotional video. Oh, and the mandatory sex scene wasn't even half finished. Better lighting next time, please.
