Compared to other Columbo films, this can only be judged to be 1 (terrible). I don't seriously understand what the other reviewers have seen in this frightening train crash of a movie. It was only through morbid fascination that I continued to see it - to see what bizarre or inappropriate decision the director would make next. Another reviewer suggested that it was Falk's only direct outing because it interfered with his action role. In fact, I think the real reason lies with the studios that must have been horrified when they saw what he had done with their money. It's weird that they didn't kill him.
