I'm not saying that Twisters Night was terrible, but it was far from big. Mediocre in absolute best. However, I think every time a type of movie is released, one second must be at the same time. (Think of Armageddon and Deep Impact, Volcano and Dante's Peak) Night of the Twisters is really just Twister except worse and with earthly special effects. <br /> <br /> I have nothing against the actors who star in it, even though they weren't big, it was the movie itself, the control, the special effects, the whole story was just too strange to interpret. A series of tornadoes hits a city, and basically the movie is about people trying to find family and friends and deal with the damage. I really don't know why duplicate film duplicates seem to be released almost synchronously with each other, but this would have been better with Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt.
