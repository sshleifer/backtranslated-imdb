I stopped at BB and picked up 4 zombie flicks to see over the weekend. Now I understand that the effects will be cheesy, the play will be sub-pairs, and the sets will be suspect. So I don't expect much. But it must at least have a story. Stories don't cost anything except time ..... apparently they had no time either. <br /> <br /> "Zombie Nation" had 5 zombies that appeared at the end of the movie, which all looked like new wave listeners. The image of zombie on the front never comes in the movie. It was quite disturbing to see and had nothing to offer the genre. <br /> <br /> Driving time is only 81 minutes, but it felt like 2 hours. According to my wife (who could only hear the movie when she was on the computer in another room), it sounded like zombie porno .... as if you are thinking, sounds a bit rough ..... but it wasn't even the good . <br /> <br /> The only suggestion I can make is that the author might try to do too many things and end up with an incoherent mess. <br /> <br /> It ended up being a free rental and I still feel ripped off. I rated it for 1 out of 10 because IMDb doesn't allow me to use decimals.
