I would put this at the top of my list of movies in the Unstoppable Trash category! There are movies that are bad, but the worst kind are those that are unmatched, but you suppose to like them because they should be good for you! The gender sequences that were so shocking at the time could not even awaken a rabbit. The so-called controversial policy is strictly high school amateur nightmare Marxism. The film is self-conscious arty in the worst sense of the term. The photograph is in a hard grain black and white. Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle. Even the sound is bad! And some people call this art? <br /> <br />
