Basically, cruel intentions 2 are cruel intentions 1, again, only badly done. The story is exactly the same as the first (even some of the lines), with only a few exceptions. Cast is more unknown and definitely less talented. Instead of being seductive and attracting me to seeing it, I ended up getting dirty, because it compares to seeing a softcore porn. I'm not sure if I should blame some of the idiotic lines on the actors or authors ... and I always feel bad to say so because I know how hard it is to do both ... but it was basically a two-hour waste in my life. It literally surprises me that some movies are being made and that's no exception ... I can't believe they would make a third.
