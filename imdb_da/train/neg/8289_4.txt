I'm sorry, but it's such a bad movie, it's funny. Soccer hooligans argue in a travel lodge? Suit? Shades?! Alan obviously had no idea what he was talking about when he did this, it is so far from the truth that you can get. Casting was horrible ... Gary Oldman as a football hooligan? He doesn't look scary, scary or even encounters like someone who wants football. And what about the Yeti? What the heck? Suits, shades and sitting in a travelodge childish scare each other with "it's time you have your soft on". Please. <br /> <br /> And Yeti's gang splashes the ICC's underwear? <br /> <br /> I can't see how anyone can even take this movie seriously !. <br /> <br /> 4/10. It may be the most inaccurate depiction of the crisis at the end of the eighties hooliganism I have ever seen.
