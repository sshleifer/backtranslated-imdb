This is really a horrible movie and a waste of 2 hours in your life. It is at the same time gentle and offensive, with nudity and lots and lots of violence. However, the necessity is not so exciting, and the violence is repetitive and boring. Also the plot is flimsy at best, the characters are unrealistic and undeveloped, and the play is some of the worst I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I've heard that this movie should be fun, but it's not. I didn't even laugh while I watched it, and I didn't smile either. The actors in this movie tried to combine a comedy movie with an action movie and they failed both. <br /> <br /> Some badly made movies are fun because they are so bad, but it's not one of them.
