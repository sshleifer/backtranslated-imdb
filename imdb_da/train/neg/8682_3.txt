I would like to start by saying that I am Republican, although I do not agree with many of the things bush has done in the office. And I love the daily show and the Colbert report. They must be two of my favorite shows on TV. I enjoy the bush jokes on Conan, Letterman, Leno, because I admit that W is not the smartest guy ever to walk the earth (nor do I think he is the stupid one). But it comes to a point when enough is enough, and it's not really that much more fun. I see where it can be fun, and it is (hey fun of our authority figure, he's funny.). Comedy Central, but just trying hard to poke fun on him. Maybe I mean a special episode, but a whole series is just stupid. It seems that CC says just the same bush jokes that we've heard the road to many times. I really can't see this show going past 1 season.
