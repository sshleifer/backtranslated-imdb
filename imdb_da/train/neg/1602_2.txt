Anyone who thinks this movie has not been appreciated for his comic genius must have smoked with the two stoners in the movie. This movie is NOT underestimated ... it's a bad movie. <br /> <br /> There should be no comparisons between this movie and The Naked Gun or Airplane, as the latter two are well-written and fun. Class association is not one of these things. The sad thing is that it had such a potential (well cast, good story lines), but the good jokes are few and far between. The scenes that were supposed to be fun came out more annoying than entertaining. Stoner the guys, the vampire, the blind girl ... NOT FUN. The only fun character was Delores (the one who sold his soul to the devil). <br /> <br /> National Lampoon has made some really good movies (Animal House, Vacation), but it's not one of them. I certainly expected more from John Hughes.
