This film failed to explore the animal's humanity, which left me with an empty feeling inside. [Spoiler forward] I was not convinced that Dr. D really had a compelling reason to leave the big buyout deal to help his tough friends. While Babe (the original) bowed the trend of big budget hits by focusing on the animal's human virtues vs. their human counterparts, all the animals in this film were no more than comic caricatures that one would like to spread in the meat grinder (even more if one could understand their meaningless babble). Without Eddie Murphy's great behavior, this movie would be a flop.
