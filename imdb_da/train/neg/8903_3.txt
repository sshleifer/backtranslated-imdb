Prophecy II, what is there to say about it? They have completely abandoned the originality of the first movie, and simply made a Chris Walken splatter movie. It is not even written by the original author! <br /> <br /> If you have seen Nr. 1 don't see Nr. 2 it's a real disappointment ... <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen No. 1 don't see Nr. 2! Go see # 1 to experience something original and fun
