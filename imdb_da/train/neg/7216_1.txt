I love westerners. I could see them all day. "The good, the bad and the ugly" is my very first favorite. I saw "Silverado" probably the 8th time just the second day because it was presented at CMT. This movie, Shiloh Falls is undoubtedly the worst Western I have ever seen. The action was awful all around. They explain nothing at the end of the mysterious compass that sees things out. The only good part I can think of is the beautiful cantina girl. The very noticeable long breaks between the dialogue seemed appropriate just to make time to make the film of acceptable length. This movie was not even worth the new rental fee I paid at our local movie rental store. I felt I was robbed and deserved a rental payment if there was such a thing. The only reason I was finished with it was because I didn't hate to watch a movie through to the end. I hit it halfway because it was so bad. For the instructor, you should do a better job if you decide to do another. These are the kind of movies that have the potential to turn people into Westerns.
