There are beautiful landscape shots. Authors put fatigued mouths into the actor's mouth. With less players, this show would be silly. "Art must uplift humanity, or it is BS." Not so because the art of all those mentioned is also touching humanity and expressing the dark side. The protagonist even says that those who do not drink hide the shadow side. Wrong, he lived in the dark and suppressed his dark side by drinking and being one-dimensional without expanding his horizons with anything but landscapes. There was no respiratory organism in his work or expression of his pain. All the artist did was confining himself to dime a dozen landscapes. The discussions between the characters were class school, trite things always gave one sign the parent the author wanted. I tried to like it after reading all the first wow comments here. I had to dig deep to see those I agreed with. I reckon the big comments were from those who were associated with the movie. I was only moved once towards the end. The child was too passive. The scenery was nice and the music ridiculous. Just my opinion, but nowhere for me.
