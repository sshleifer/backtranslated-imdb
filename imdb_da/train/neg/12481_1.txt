This sword - & - troll story of a horribly brutal and clever "hero" who defeats an evil king is worthless in almost every detail. The action is horrible from the leaders to the supporting roles. The leering, gloating glee with which the director shows the hero lubricating blood around is absolutely disgusting; nor is it released by any justice for his cause, as he is as bad as the people he is struggling with. Z-movie editing is abundant, including a scene where a character "dies" from a sword that was clearly missing completely! <br /> <br /> The movie apparently knocks on the female leaders' charm, Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson, who are ready for most of the nudity of the film. As a 20-something male, I will not pretend that female meat on the screen does not attract me. But the treatment of their characters is so degrading, and the sex scenes are so relaxed and joyful that I couldn't enjoy this aspect of the movie myself. Most cheesy films in this era are at least something redeemed by a jolly, heavy-in-cheek feel (the sequel is better in this regard), but DEATHSTALKER seems to take seriously as heroic fantasy. No way! Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 out of ****.
