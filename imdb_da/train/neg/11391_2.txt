When I first started watching this movie, I was looking for some kind of subtle metaphor, but it soon began to me that this movie was actually about people on a train. The interaction between people is like the ones you can see any day in the street, and when in the apartment is a slightly more interesting situation, the dialogue becomes style and boring. It's not that I don't understand how this movie is trying to portray how people interact, it's just that in this movie they are very boring. If you want to see and analyze these kinds of relationships, you would be best to actually go out and buy a train ticket and look at the people on the train with you. It's realistic, but you wouldn't go to a movie to watch a movie about you sitting there watching the movie.
