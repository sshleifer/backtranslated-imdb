This is a rather boring movie about a scientist who creates a teleporter unit and becomes terribly disfigured when using the machine to transport himself. Simple plot done before in fly and others. Not only is he desfigured, but he can also electrolyze people with a push. What is really stupid about this movie is that we are expected to believe where this guy works is against him. He could probably make millions to the institution he is working on, but the head of department tries to sabotage his teleporter every step of the way. Eventually, the projected man strives for three people for no reason, so they go after those who have wronged him.
