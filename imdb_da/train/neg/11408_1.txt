This was just awful. I read this book to school, I did as on all the tests and to see it as such! My teacher forced me and 20 other people to see it and it was worse than Leonard Part 6, outer space plan 9 and the Hudson Hawk put together. What made this movie so awful was enough reason to kill yourself. First of all, it was made at Hallmark. Second, the play was terrible. Third, it was quite different from the book. Literally, it was so bad that I asked to be excused. For that reason I would rather see Basic Instinct 2 than see this. Take my advice, don't see this movie. Nobody wants to see this. It was awful. TERRIBLE!
