No scenario, bad actors (poor Melissa Gilbert) ... Beurk Beurk Beurk ... Give such a budget to do this ... In Belgium we make ten films that win all the awards in Cannes with this. <br /> <br /> The last time I saw such a NULL movie was Hypercube. But the scenario was better. <br /> <br /> Does anyone know if the director was a candidate in school films or a policeman? <br /> <br /> The better things in this movie were the word "End". <br /> <br /> Why approve selling this? 1รง is too expensive. <br /> <br /> I have paid ten dollars to buy this. <br /> <br /> For me this paid for my big cattle in the millennium. <br /> <br /> Too bad. <br /> <br /> Next time I break my arm but buy this type of sh * t.
