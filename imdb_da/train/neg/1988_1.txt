Okay, I walked past the horrible play. I passed the fact that Lil Kim sprayed some guns, and her arms or hands didn't move, I walked past the looms, I passed the colored contacts. <br /> <br /> That's what killed it for me: On the scene where the four roses were sitting at the table and arguing. Lisa-Raye and Monica Calhoun stand up, and then Lil Kim comes up to break up hostilities by saying, "Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, quit. Let's chill out here for a hot second." I'm a fan of the Western movie genre, and I've never heard anyone talk like this in any of Clint Eastwood's movies. <br /> <br /> If someone thinks this movie deserves over a 1 rating, tell me another movie that's worse than Rosesang. <br /> <br /> I'm through.
