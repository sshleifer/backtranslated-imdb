By the number of Kid (Prince), a singer, on the way to becoming a star. Then he falls in love with Apollonia (Appolonia Kotero). But he has to deal with his wife-fathering father (Clarence Williams III!) And his own self-destructive behavior. <br /> <br /> I saw this in a theater in 1984. I wasn't a big fan of prince but I liked the three great songs from this movie - "Purple Rain", "Let's Get Crazy" and " When Doves Cry ". The concert scenes in this movie are amazing - full of energy and excitement. Unfortunately, it is a very small part of the film. <br /> <br /> The story is screamingly obvious and has been done many times before - and much better too. The underpants are, in order to get in nicely, poorly handled. The love triangle between The Kid, Appolonia and Morris Day was so predictable and tired that I was actually offended. His wife's striking father is needed for the story, but the scenes are so poorly handled (in acting and direction) that I couldn't believe it. Scripture is horrible - miserable dialogue and some really painful "comedy" routines. And there are tons of misogynies here - The child's mother is beaten; The Kid hits Appolonia and (for no reason) Appolonia strips and goes topless to swim in a dirty river. Williams and Prince's characters also treat women in a terrible way all the time. <br /> <br /> The action is where this movie really fails. Appolonia is cute and beautiful - but no actor. And Prince is (easily) the WORST actor I've ever seen. His glossy face and tree dialogue delivery is so bad I couldn't believe it. This movie only comes to life during concert scenes, but there are not really many. The "dramatic" scenes are so poorly constructed and handled that they make this movie a task to sit through. They should have just made this a concert movie. I give this a 2 - just for the music.
