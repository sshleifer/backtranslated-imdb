I rowed for this movie, as it is a remake of a television series from the 1970s "Escape to Night", which, although chaotic and stuttering at times was quite strange, fascinating and disturbing. The action in "Paperhouse" is wood, unintentionally a joke. The overbells did not add tension, they only reinforced that I was watching a botch. Casting exclaimed the dull dialogue that resulted in conditions that lacked warmth, chemistry or conviction. As in most sharp films, there are a few good supporting actions that these people should be comforted, comforted, and assured that they will not be held accountable. Out of every possible conclusion, the most unexpected choice was ... lamer than I could have dreamed. "Escape to Night" deserves a proper remake, written by a person with life experience and aimed at a subtle mind.
