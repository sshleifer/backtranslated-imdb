Admirably strange, though medium-spirited comedy drama about a strange young man hoping to fly like a bird through the Houston Astrodome. Robert Altman-directed quasi-comedy with eccentric characters is so overloaded with strange that it starts crushing early from the weight. Some of the films are atmospheric, Shelley Duvall is a nail in his debut as a tour guide, and Sally Kellerman sees every empty glamorous kiss as Bud's vision of a "mother bird" (imagine Altman and producer Lou Adler explaining the role of her !). In the lead, Bud Cort - again, after "Harold & Maude" - is a genuine original; Not deterrent as, says Michael J. Pollard, Cort manages to be nerdy, crazy and unofficial, a tough act to pull off. Unfortunately, this is one of Altman's misfires. He can put together a roll and a play like no other, but let him be fired with some wrong inspiration and he spirals down. ** from ****
