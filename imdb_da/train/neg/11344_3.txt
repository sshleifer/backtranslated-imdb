I was very unimpressed with Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2, but it may be worse than both titles. First of all, I did not like the animation, very Saturday-morning cartoon, only worse in some scenes. I liked some of the characters, Thunderbolt and Patch, but the other characters, Cruella, were mediocre. Cruella was really vicious in the original, but she lost her quality in the sequel. What she said was nothing to write home about, and her animation was a bit ugly. Also, her artist friend Lars was a joke to be honest with you, and Roger seemed to have quit smoking overnight. The voice talents were very good, but especially Barry Bostwick as Thunderbolt, with the exception of Jodi Benson, the accent ruined it for me. There were some good moments, but the whole plot seemed to flare for me, and very suggestive of an extended television episode. All in all, a tremendously disappointing sequel to the most memorable of the 60s Disney movies along with Jungle Book. Sorry, I can only give this a 3/10, it was just not my cup of tea. Bethany Cox
