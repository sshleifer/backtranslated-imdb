It was 9:30 am last night at my friend's caravan, and we were so hyped to see South Park (a new episode). The case is, in my country, flying South Park at. 10.30 and we decided to kill time by watching the show now flying, Prides of the Pride. I start by saying that I have only looked at episodes. The first time I looked at it, I found it involuntarily and raw for nothing, so I thought '' Holy shit, I have a football game early in the morning, so I have to stop watching silly cartoons ''. But yesterday I tried to give pride's priest another chance. I find out that it is a complete rip-off of The Simpsons, replacing only yellow human figures of lions instead. <br /> <br /> The other thing is, I wonder why it's got the TV-14 rating. I find The Simpsons much more vulgar and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few gay (unfunny) jokes. The Simpsons are also much more violent (Halloween specials) and raw. I have also heard that the creator of the series has also directed Shrek 2, and I've got news for him: Shrek 2 was much better and I think he was too much in thematic family. However, I must admit that the pride father made me smile (even blown off laughing once) three or four times. All in all, I have nothing against the father of pride. I don't hate it, but I don't like it either. I've seen far better from 'The Simpsons'. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 10
