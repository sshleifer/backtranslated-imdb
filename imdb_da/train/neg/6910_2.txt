I have never seen this movie, but can tell you one thing about its production. While I came in 1988 in the comedy / oldies radio, I got a call from the production company. They asked if I would write and record a bit, they would fall into the soundtrack that sounds emanating from a TV (the TV screen itself would never be shown). I said for sure, wrote a parody of 50's sci-fi monster cliches, rounded off some sound effects and called for another DJ, Pam Landry, to play the female part. When she happened to be in the air at that time, she set a long song, joined me in the production room, and we cut the voicetrack in a single roof. Giggling, she then went back to her show while mingling with the bleak sound effects. We would never have done so if we had known that "Woodchipper Massacre" should be such a turkey - but then we were never paid for our efforts either! - Gary Theroux
