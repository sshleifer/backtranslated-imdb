There are many pretentious people out there who will pretend that this is equipped with some sort of beautiful meaning and that ignorant fools like me do not 'get' it. Of course, that means we have to stick to Hollywood dross. <br /> <br /> It each has an a-haem, artistic clich√© in the book - I think it's good that the director is one of the few. Almost a self-parody drowns in its own sense. The director of the (almost equally embarrassing) movie 'Ratcatcher' returns with another piece of artistic nonsense; It is hard to understand and apparently is a study of alienation. The best way to describe this movie is to alienate its viewers.
