I'm not sure why I clicked on "contains spoiler" because, frankly, it's not enough explanation ever to be given in the movie to know enough about what's going to destroy it. <br /> <br /> Visually, it delivers the most. Well, apart from some 80 cast rubber mask monsters. I say now that before I looked at this, I had never seen the Lordi band or knew anything about them that they won Eurovision. Apparently, the monsters here are members of the band, largely in their stage characters. No matter what. Yet I didn't know it while I was watching. I just thought the monsters / demons were most beneficial. Just about. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure there's a half-coherent explanation behind what we see on the screen, but it may actually be better not to know it. It would probably actually have been incredibly lame, come to think of it. The action keeps the rolling together pretty good enough to keep the viewer mostly entertained, although half of the entertainment factor is fun that wtf must be in this movie exactly. <br /> <br /> I gave it a four mainly because I got a good laugh out of it, especially from how it explains pretty much nothing. Maybe it's the mood I was in, but I found it fun for some reason. Then I see the film on the internet and find out that NOBODY knows what the hell it is about to do. It amused me further and raised my score an extra half point to a 4/10. It is not scary or very coherent, but it is pretty nice visually and sonically. Overall, far from essential, but clear. Don't expect too much and don't expect it to make sense and it can entertain you if you're in the right mood.
