When I saw this "documentary", I was disappointed to see Serbian propaganda again. Although Serbia and its nationalist politics are the main cause of the Yugoslav break-up, it is not mentioned in this "documentary" made by Bogdanovich, whose name tells us that he is Serbian and his film that he is far from objective. It is one in the lie set that is pushed by the Milosevic regime. All others are guilty of the Serbs being right and victims, although most war criminals tried in The Hague are Serbs, although Serbs are one who committed genocide against the Bosnian, and attacked Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia all independent nations recognized by the UN. of Yugoslavia was not avoided because Serbs did not want to release the grip their nationalism has placed on the federal Yugoslav government, so SLovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia were forced to become independent nations to protect their interests. If you are interested in an objective documentary about breaking up Yugoslavia, and actually led the documentary, it is not. You should see "Yugoslavia: The Death of a Nation", made by the Discovery Channel and the BBC.
