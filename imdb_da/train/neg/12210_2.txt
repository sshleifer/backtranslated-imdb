This movie is a joke and must be one of the worst movies Stallone has ever made. This is a typical 80's movie where you have a man who destroys the whole army by itself. "First Blood Pt. 2" looks very much like Schwarzenegger's "Commando", but there you have Arnold killed the terrorist, while here you have a particular nation shown as the evil ones. This movie is a typical American anti-Soviet propaganda. It was true, it was the peak of the Cold War, but I am ill to make Communists or Nazis always appear as the enemy. There are so many American films that have this one thing in common. Why can't a movie show Americans as the enemy? Who wants to believe that a single soldier will destroy the whole army? Do you really think something like this really would have happened? By the appearance of it, an average brainwashed American seer would surely.
