If you really enjoy the 2002 Resident Evil movie, just watch it instead of giving away 2 hours you never come back. I can't believe no one has commented that this movie is just a cheap hit of RE. First, a "special" command force is the unique defense of a system with a computer matrix having an AI and holographic projection. And this "hive" rip-off has a number of traps that inevitably kill a member of the team at a time. There is even a chess reference in the code's names that were in the RE dialog. In spite of the fact that there are no zombies, "Rook", the film's nemesis, is a kind of bio-description that is very fat that suggests necrotic tissue, with many cyborg components like a supermutant of RE. So, a watchman for Mr Richard Taylor to claim any credit for this story. <br /> <br /> Of course, they're not the same movie, but the author got the idea to see Resident Evil I think.
