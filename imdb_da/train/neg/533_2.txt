I knew that 'Evening' was a girlie movie so I expected to get bored. An evil thief on IMDb had said it was a "chick flick", but your companion would survive. <br /> <br /> Survive? Yes. I'm still here, but when the two came out, we were amazed to find that it only lasted two hours - it seemed a lot longer than that! I suppose for Yanks to be supposed to be lifting or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach - well next to the beach, in a house with a large porch and lawn, but no apparent lawn mower . If that kind of thing impresses you, it may seem a little short film. <br /> <br /> There's a Monty Python movie about a knight who just won't die. He ends up with a twist (why does Yanks add a third syllable to this word I wonder) torso in the road still shouts threats on his nemesis. This film is also about a kind of living death. Vanessa Redgrave (inappropriate name for digging dodges shown here) continues to die and at the same time have inappropriate guilt. She is not worried about being a wide-eyed, breathless bimbo, but imagining herself a murderess. Of course, being a girl movie is a chap that should be Mr Darcy / Heathcliff's character. I am not a woofter, so I cannot claim to be a good judge for such things, but the tedious who has run out of this role seems to have only the servant's title in his favor. He's a bloodless cypher. As you might gather, the protagonists are not much police officers, but the smaller ones are amazingly much worse. There's a guy whose only job is to respond to the news that his girlfriend is preggers. Fair enough, but it's not Hamlet's role - why did it shoot so bad? Forget it was a girl movie, I thought he should be thrown out because a decent girlfriend had told him that the sponge did not flatten him, but then I realized she must have encouraged him to grow a "beard" because he looked worse without it. <br /> <br /> I kept awake by noting which actors and actresses had their earpieces attached or freed and noted interesting exciting scenes - if you're dragged along with it, see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head , just the kind of things you can expect in a cottage. <br /> <br /> Apart from the obligatory wedding, there is only one piece of action. You would have thought they would have gotten it right. Unfortunately, the hit and run of the accident is done by a car that could not be there. When the accident is discovered, one strives to shout for a sign that they cannot know is nearby (but we do as the audience). If they have no idea that the person is within a few miles of the place, why are they wandering about without a shout for him? I suppose the director's excuse is that it should be a half-remembered dream sequence ... <br /> <br /> Another natural article that got my attention was a copper bundle. I didn't think the technology to do this developed until the fifties.
