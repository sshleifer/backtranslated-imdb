A low point in human interaction was reached by Maysles Brothers with this movie. Remember, those who used words like "masterpiece" when reviewing this movie that these Maysles creeps happened to not just drive to the Hamptons and accidentally shoot some eccentric people. No, when they found these two poor pathetic people, they had to fund their project (and imagine what they told the money people were selling the project). Then they became friends with the two extremely vulnerable women. There is no meeting here or a real conscience participation. These miserable Maysles smiled, kissed ass, did what they needed to get Beales to work, and exploited them as cruelly as ever. One would like to think that these hustlers had occasional thoughts of remorse and guilt. But the film making process, given the preparation, the actual recording and then the editing took a lot of time, and their goal had no provision for them to actually relate to Beales as humans. An exploitation film by the wildest of people. As their time is, their film-making reputation has been severely colored by what they did here. Their reputation as humans is cumbersome. That's what people will remember them as. Grotesque hustlers.
