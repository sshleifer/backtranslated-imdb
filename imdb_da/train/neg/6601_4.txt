I can see why Laurel and the Hardy Purists could be offended by this rather cautious 're-enactment', but this movie would be an excellent way to introduce children to the joy of classic L&H Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain freely release as the comedy duo and there is a relatively good cast. I enjoyed it.
