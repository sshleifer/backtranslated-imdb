In the honorable days of the 90's (God resting his soul) you could turn on the Great Comedy Central every hour of the day and watch the biggest sketch comedy show of all time Saturday Night Live. Whpat a wonderful show, that was whether it was the original non-ready-to-primetime players or SNL's second golden age, featuring greats-Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, David Spade ... and then it went to hell . I was first exposed to MadTV one and a half years ago and I think I must go out of shock. How could a show so terribly rule so long? There are so many terrible mistakes. I suppose I start writing. The printer is mostly terrible. It's no more than kindergarten bathroom humor. The cast is mostly talented. There are a few sketches I have enjoyed, such as some of Mrs Svan and Stuart, and there are a few talents on the show like the magnificent Alex Borstein. Phil LaMarr is a talented actor, just not as a comedian. Though there are a few sparse haha ​​moments, they are not enough to redeem this infinite line of horrible floods populated by babbling idiots. Miss this one.
