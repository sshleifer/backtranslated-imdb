Wow, here it is finally; the action "movie" without action. In a really low budget setting (don't miss out on the fun flying saucers flying a couple of times) in a future in Seattle, we find a hardbody who doesn't have the brain and who seeks to avenge his childhood. There is nothing even extremely original or interesting about the plot, and the actors' performance is only rival in stupidity by trying to steal from other movies, mainly "Matrix" without having the money to do it right. Yes, we'll see some running on walls and slow motion shootouts (45 seconds approx), but these scenes are just as cool as the stupid hardbody's attempts to make jokes about male incompetence now and then. <br /> <And yes, we also earn a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere as if the manuscript was thought through by the previously invisible throw while shooting the scenes. <br /> <br /> Believe me it's just as bad as it may be. In fact, it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously, but maybe I can't get some of you to rent it and save your money.
