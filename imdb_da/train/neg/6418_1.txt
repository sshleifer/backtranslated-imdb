Let me start by saying that I am not a fan of horror movies. I never see them. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you about my experience ... The only reason I saw this movie was because my boyfriend and her friends wanted to see it over Happy Feet. <br /> <br /> ... I've never seen Happy Feet, but I'm sure it's better than this ... movie? Anyway, we didn't actually expect it to be good ... we actually just went to laugh at it. Cool with me ... I have a problem destroying the movie to other people in the theater, but since it was just other couples talking and making out, it didn't matter. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes, 2 other people went to go into Borat, a movie I would have liked to see again about this. The movie was not scary, and not stupid, so it would be fun ... it was just boring. It was not terrible as "Baby Genuises" terrible, it was awful as ... not entertaining at all. Avoid. <br /> <br /> Now I'm no expert, but it seems that the problem with the horror industry these days is that you can get a PG-13 horror that's boring and not scary or you can have a R horrible horror movie that is either too bloody or too wild for people. <br /> <br /> You want a PG-13 scream that sucks, but it's fun? See "Grudten." Avoid this movie as bothered ... because it can literally kill you to death. <br /> <br /> 0/10
