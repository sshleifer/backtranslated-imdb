What happened to Peter Bogdanovich? Once a brilliant instructor is a trail blazer ... now scratching the whole bottom ... Is that the same man who instructed "The Last Picture Show"? Here he takes a somewhat interesting (albeit farfetched) premise and turns it into bubbly gum that loses taste the moment you take the first bite ... Dust is not bad, but Izzard is miscast as Chaplin and all the other actors seem to have been thrown for their "appearance" and not because they were right for that part. Too bad. I will rent "Paper Moon" again.
