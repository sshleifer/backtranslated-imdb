First of all, I thought it was scary to say in the credits that the story and the manuscript were by Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of the better Hollywood writers until his talent fell and he retired. However, it was not Preston Sturges, it was Preston Sturges, Jr. The story was essentially based on Robert Louis Stevenson's short story "The Bottle Imp". A good man comes in possession of an evil object that will give him some desire, but which will ultimately make him hell. It is fine. No one said scriptwriters had to be original. The actors are generally quite competent considering the mediocre writing they might have to translate into the screen. My biggest complaint comes with the end. Completely believe he has discovered a way out of his dilemma, but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person. Initially, it seems to have worked, but true to the code of the modern horror movie, they feel they have to give a last prisoner of horror at the end of the movie. This is a stupid convention. The older horror movies came along well with letting the hero win at the end. There is nothing wrong with good victory over evil, no matter what the current crop of filmmakers seems to think. You can give the audience a good healthy scare and still make them feel happy at the end. In fact, I think it is preferable.
