I mean the word "pedestrian". Seems the producers of the movie forgot to have something interesting happening. Believe Domergue can do better than this. She was supposed to be the mysterious, avenged Cobra goddess struck by love for Marshall Thompson (there's an idea, eh?). Instead, she is a regular home-man from the 50's, and the only flat expression she wears throughout the film makes me think they shot it all in the morning before Faith had her coffee. As for the rest of the cast, they are all so seriously "all-American" that the result is ridiculous. This is the ground more productively covered in Val Lewton in "The Cat People". I think the "Cob of Cobra" should really be the title "Cult of the Contractual Bond". Why else would so many other talented people sleep on the road, even though a slow, predictable, derivative failure like this?
