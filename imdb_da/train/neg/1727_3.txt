We have a lake. We have an animated meteor crash. We have a killer stop-motion dinosaur with flippers. Okay, let's call this movie THE CRATER LAKE MONSTER. What else can we add? Hmm, two idiots are called Arnie & Mitch to define the ultimate definition of "comic relief". We also need a sheriff who doesn't really do a horrible thing in this movie and nobody listens to. Aw shit, we're over half way through the movie and we forgot to insert a bad guy! No worries, let's introduce a guy with a mustache, get him to steal a store to show that he is a bad guy, so get him dipping near the lake, get him hunted through the woods and All this for the sole purpose of ending up as a dinosaur snack food. It must work. <br /> <br /> A complete clumsy mess, this movie. Its logic will twist your mind to force laughter out of you. The first movie with Dave Allen as "stop motion supervisor". After that, he joined the Charles Band for several years until the mid-nineties when Band ran out of money to pay him, I assume. The dinosaur effects are charming and the whole movie is pretty damn unintentional fun. Unfortunately, it is about the only good thing that can be said for it. <br /> <br /> Good badness? Yes. The mind-bending logic of the story should be enough reason to put it on the list. If not, Arnie & Mitch will do the trick. 3/10 and 8/10
