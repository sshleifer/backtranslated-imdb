I saw this back in '94 when it was finally released. Apparently because Orion images were bankrupt, I think the film had not been released a few years earlier. I have trouble remembering details, partly because I haven't seen it for a long time, but I remember it as a very boring movie. I kept discussing if I should go out of it. The store was not at all interesting or engaging. Was a 3-degree American graffiti imitation. <br /> <br /> Neither show makes it worth seeing either. One of the biggest disappointments since a local newspaper reviewer gave it a high rating.
