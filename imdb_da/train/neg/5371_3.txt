This movie was rather a disappointment. After the very slow, very intense (and pretty gory) movie begins to lose it. Too much plot leaves too little time for explanation, and out of the theater I wondered what it was all about. The characters remain superficial, the story is convincing at all, most are d√©ja vu things without hints of parody, and there are some very cheesy parts ... Just like the young policeman has to dig up a body. Of course it is night and it is raining and he has to do it alone ... gab! Or The Evil Manifestation is "Nazi" plus "genetic manipulation" ... Wow, it's really original. There are, however, some good pieces, such as the fistfight scene, mountain views and some (running) gags, but (although Reno and Vincent Cassel do what they can), it's certainly not worth it. (3 out of 10)
