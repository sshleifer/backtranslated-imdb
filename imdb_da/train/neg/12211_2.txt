George P. Cosmatos' "Rambo: First Blood Part II" is pure desire fulfillment. The United States clearly does not win the war in Vietnam. They caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable, and this film continues the fairy tale story of the so innocent soldiers. The only bad guys were the country's leaders who made this war present. The character of Rambo is perfect to notice this. He is extremely patriotic, regrets that American Americans do not appreciate and celebrate the performance of one's soldiers, but have nothing but distrust of senior officers and politicians. Like any film defending the war (eg "We were soldiers"), one also avoids the need to provide an understandable reason for the engagement in South Asia. And for that matter also the cause of every American-American soldier there was. Instead, Rambo gets revenge for the wounds of a whole nation. It would have been better to work on how to handle the memories, rather than suppressing them. "Should we win this time?" Yes you do.
