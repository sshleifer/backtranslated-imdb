I think I've seen all the Grisham movies now and generally they are all very poor except for The Rainmaker, but this one is so bad it's incredible. <br /> <br /> WARNING SPOILERISH <br /> <br /> It is one of those films where the character does the stupid irrational things that no one would ever do. He is a lawyer for Christ's sake. Why, when his children go away, he doesn't call the police. Oh yes that is because all police hate lawyers so they just ignore him and let him be attacked. <br /> <br /> When he is arrested for murder, he just lets him go free, he will be locked up in a cell pending a civil hearing. <br /> <br /> Why would you drag your kids halfway across the country when you could easily protect them at home. <br /> <br /> Police don't bother trying to find a escaped mental patient, they don't like to interview their daughter. <br /> <br /> As for the ridiculous end ?. In short, silly, very unrealistic and completely waste of time. /> <br /> 0/10 ?? One of the worst movies ever made.
