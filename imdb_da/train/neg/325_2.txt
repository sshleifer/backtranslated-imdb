Having decided some time ago to collect Billy Bob Thornton's film (due to the class of films such as "Sling Blade", "A Simple Plan," and "The Man Not There" among others), it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there. What I did not do, however, was that there could be one that was so bad. I will give you an idea of ​​how incredibly bad this movie is - the funniest dialogue in it goes like this: "Knock Knock", "Who is there?", "The big stinking man", "The big stinking man who?" "The Great Smelly Man - Are You!" Yes, people, it's really that bad. Billy Bob is only in it for about two minutes (I think he needed the work at the time of his career) and the rest of the movie is painful. For some reason, though unthinkable, I don't hate it. That's probably because I save my eagle for any high budget, special effects laden junk like "The Fast and the Furious" and not a "no-budget" flick like this. 2/10 at a push.
