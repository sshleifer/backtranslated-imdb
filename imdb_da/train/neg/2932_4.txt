Not what he wanted to care about, but I'm not one of Simon Pegg's friends. If I were there, there is a good chance that we would fall if he continued to do so. The problem is, he found a successful formula like the bumbling, regular guy-next door type in Shawn of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run, etc., but it starts to bear thin. Here his character has no unreasonable qualities, he is rude and unpleasant, and thinks he is fun when he is honestly not. When transferring to New York from London (and I assume that this link should appeal to viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), he is just as well showing off his new colleagues. Still, it is weird when he rents among his jolly japs ​​a transvestite stripper to appear at an editorial meeting of a revenge act for his boss. Once again, Kirsten Dunst begins to warm himself to him, even though he has done nothing good. Oh, and because he is a superficial man, he falls to Megan Fox at first glance, possibly because her character is as low as his. It all allows for a predictable movie conclusion, although I cannot see any viewer expressing how this reflected their lives. Shame is that on paper is a throw that is supposedly worth seeing. Pegg plays himself though, Kirsten Dunst just seems to go about the movements, creating no one on screen chemistry, and Megan Fox is not stretched at all. One big plus is Miriam Margolyes, as Pegg's New York hostess - now if she had been on the screen anymore .....
