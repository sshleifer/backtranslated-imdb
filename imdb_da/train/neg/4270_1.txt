This is another typical incredible and non-sensible piece of Hollywood drunk. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell, like Snake Pliskin in a dress, convinces me that he was a better 2nd baseman. Ray Liotta as a psychotic policeman is completely predictable and absurd. Madeline Stowe is her usual carton herself and doesn't do much to be a convincing victim. <br /> <br /> Every scene in this character is completely predictable until the end when Kurt dresses Ray with a vase or something, knocks him down and out Kurt and Madeline then make their mandatory end-of-the-movie embrace , and WORLDWIDE --- except Russell and Stowe, KNOWS Liotta must come up and threaten the couple again. <br /> <br /> He does, of course, and Russell exercises him 10 times with his 9mm, which was completely unnecessary. This movie could just as well end up with the bludgeoning scene --- Except Hollywood dotes on unnecessary violence, and the more they can add, or "improve," the more slobbery they get.
