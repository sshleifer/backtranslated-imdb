The prerequisite for the movie has been explained, and if you've got it so far, you can't let me do as if I'm a film critic. Having said that, my own opinion about the film is quite low. I'm a fan of Takashi Miike, but it goes down in the category of his not so great work with DOA 2 and 3, and some others (many). The movie seems to be free to pass because it's a Takashi movie and nothing Takashi does can be wrong. This is a high school's access to cinema. For the rest of us, we find, and one and a half seconds of a child screaming without any real reason, quite annoying (and yes it takes away from the movie), the movie's pace reaches almost levels of rigomortis and acts ... well ... hmmm. <br /> <br /> If you are a Takashi fan, you can see it regardless of whether you jump your interests. It lacks any originality (see Neverending Story) or any character development from the protagonist in relation to conflict other than a rather superficial. <br /> <br /> As has been pointed out, this is the first movie Miike has been credited with co-authoring, but that doesn't mean much as not what we would hope would be Miike's personality would spill over into the screen. All we get is some of the token Miike shots show director of photography. <br /> <br /> The movie had the potential to be good. The premise is not a difficult one to run wild. But this seemed to have run into the ground. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is that if you just enter Miike, some of the standards such as Gozu, Ichi and Audition have passed. Then film in his works as Blue Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, Bird People of China.
