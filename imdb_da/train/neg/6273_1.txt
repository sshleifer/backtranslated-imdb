This was a sweet movie until the end. The conclusion was just a more despicable effort to emasculate men and strengthen the women at their expense. The girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive / aggressive nature to control and impose her will upon the guy who ultimately gave his power and control over her relationship with her. It is no coincidence that she was sitting behind the driver's wheels in the car as they drove off at the end after he had to ask her and ask to take him back. This movie is a victory for all women who think they should be responsible for all men and in control of their relationship with them. It was a despicable movie for that reason.
