Here is an interesting little movie that strictly gives the term "low budget" a terrible name. Our physics teacher, who has about nine children, creates a strange serum that causes "molecular rearrangement". Students are hopelessly killed from fake joints of submarine sandwiches and flying school supplies. Sounds like a resurrection of classic B-movies from the 50s, right? Nix! It is not an example of high camp fun, which is the way, the way of the mark. A glamorous showcase of breasts and buds produces our desire for joy and opposes the horror that should have had 99.44% more in the first place. Bottom-of-the-bar entertainment at best, aided by red blood and dead student bodies. Atrocious films like this would make the ultimately disastrous GURU THE MAD MONK (1970) work on an intelligent genius that has a master's degree in film production! It's an automatic "F" so quiet easy!
