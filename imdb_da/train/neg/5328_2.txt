Susan Seidelman seems to have had a decent career with a few top notch credits under her belt. I'm certainly glad she came back from this movie, which seems to have its admirers. I'm not one of them. <br /> <br /> I've seen better high school performances than I did in Smithereens. The plot involved young Susan Berman, who is ambitious to do so in the music world and is willing to do almost anything to get there. She even rejects the sincere progress of a young artist living out of her van from the East River game by Brad Rijn. <br /> <br /> Young Mr. Rijn contributes with the worst performance in the film, actually one of the worst plays I've seen for a long time. No wonder he's not gone anywhere. <br /> <br /> I would say that Seidelmans eye for the camera is a good thing to capture the well-known East Village places where the movie was mostly shot. But her work with her live artists did not meet. I'm not sure she had so much raw material to work with. Look quickly and you will see a very young Christopher Noth before law and order and sex in the city as a street hawker. <br /> <br /> If you like punk rock, you can sit through this to the soundtrack. I'm sticking to Bing Crosby.
