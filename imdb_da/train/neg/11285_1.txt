I read James Hawes book. It was pretty nice, not big, but entertaining enough. Without reading the book, I would not have had the slightest idea of ​​what was going on and it was still a stretch of that knowledge. Literally, every element of this movie is abysmal in ways I do not have the ability to describe. Half digested fish could have made a better movie with matchsticks and dayglo lipstick. <br /> <br /> Never before or since as a movie did I feel so sad. The mattress's followers came closest, but even they never reached such depth of utterly eerie nausea as this bilge did. When I struck 90 minutes of my life witnessing this human pestilence, I am now unable to even look at any book by James Hawes without feeling angry. That's the depth of hate I have for this piece of sh * t. No, it's unfair. Let me apologize for any fecal material to compare you to the second world war that is Rancid Aluminum. <br /> <br /> Common and simply a cancer of the cinema world.
