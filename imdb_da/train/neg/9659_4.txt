After watching this movie, I was honestly disappointed - not because of the actors, the story or the direction - I was disappointed with this movie ad. The trailers suggested that the battalion "chose the third way out" except surrender or death (Polish infos were even misleading that they had the choice of being killed by their own artillery or German weapons, they even translated the title incorrectly as "misplaced battalion" ). This has run the right place and I bought the movie. The disappointment started when I realized that the third way is to just sit down and count dead bodies followed by sitting down and counting dead bodies ... Then I started to think "Hey, this story can't be that simple .. "I bet this wise officer will find a clever way to save what's left of his troops". Well, he didn't, they were just waiting for something to happen. And that was me. The story was based on real world war events, so the authors couldn't use their imagination much, but even thought I found this movie really challenging and even a little boring. And as I wrote in the first place - it's not the fault of actors, writers or instructors - their marketers have raised my expectations high above the level this movie could handle.
