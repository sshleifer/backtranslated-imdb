This film is about a group of five friends renting a cabin in the woods. One of the friends catches a terrible meat-eating virus. Suddenly, the friends turn to each other in a desperate attempt to maintain the disease itself. <br /> <br /> "Cabin Fever" is a horrible movie. Because it tries to be many genres at once. Should it be a tribute, a slasher, a black comedy or a scary movie with unintentional comedy? No one can tell it. There is a serious scene first and another altar, it will be fun. When the film tries to be fun, humor is quite gentle, except for the end. I liked the end a lot. <br /> <br /> But apart from the end I was pretty disappointed and disgusted. The violence is frightening, more looking away from the screen than being scared. The tone changes within each scene, sometimes fun, sometimes scary, and sometimes quite random. In fact, you see a girl doing karate in slo-motion. What do we get from it? The same girl would bite one of the characters. Should it be fun? I do not know. <br /> <br /> Some of the performances were decent and many were quite amateurish. I didn't care about most characters. I liked the plot, but the execution was terrible. As a horror movie, I didn't know what it was like to try. I didn't find it fun, excited or scary. At the end, you don't care and think, "What have I just gone through?" Unfortunately, you will never know the answer to that question.
