I found this on the shelf as he housed and bored. How can people possibly give this a 10? It's not just that it should be an emotional redemption movie (I think) because it doesn't work at that level either. Weak plot, poor dialogue, terrible acting; There is just nothing there. Harvey Keitel is decent but has nothing to do with, and Bridget Fonda and especially Johnathon Schaech are just awful. Plot progression (especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley) makes no sense. It seems that the authors wanted the plot to go a certain way and do it without writing the necessary bits to make it flow. It's only an hour and a half, but it's 90 minutes in your life you never come back.
