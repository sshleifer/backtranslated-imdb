"American Nightmare" is officially bound, in my opinion, with "It's Pat!" to the WORST MOVIE OF EVERY TIME. <br /> <br /> Seven friends (strangely similar to the K-Mart version of the "Friends" cast) gather in a coffee shop to listen to American Nightmare, a pirate radio show. It hosts a guy with a beard. It is the most exciting aspect of his show. <br /> <br /> Chandler, Monica, Joey, and ... Oh wait, I mean, Wayne, Jessie, and the rest of the bad one-liner spouting gang all take revealed their greatest fear of the bearded DJ. Unknown to them, a crazy nurse / serial killer is listening ... Crazy Nurse continues to torture Ross and Rachel and ... wait, sorry again ... by having their fears come alive. These fears include such abusers as "voodoo" and are knocked down by old ladies with prostheses. <br /> <br /> No. Really. <br /> <br /> This movie was in one word mess. Crazy nurse is killing spree lacking motivation, there is nothing to get the viewer to "jump", the blowers and - again - voodoo? <br /> <br /> If you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones, hire "American nightmare" with them. <br /> <br /> If you love your loved ones - even a little - contact your local Blockbuster, rent all copies of "American Nightmare" and store them in your freezer.
