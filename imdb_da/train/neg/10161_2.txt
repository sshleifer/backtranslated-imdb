I really didn't expect much from this movie, as it has people from Parkersburg WV who is where I live, acting in it. This city is boring and so is this movie. There were a few decent scenes in the movie, but I was distracted by all the crazy landmarks they made a point to show. This movie might have been good if there was actually action in it, but there wasn't any. Unless you are from Parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see every day, stay away from this movie. The dialogue will put you to sleep, the play will drill you to tears, and Steven Soderberg should lose credibility after doing something as such. It's a predictable movie with no surprises. What you see is what you get and it is a 73 minute trip to Parkersburg West Virginia and Belpre Ohio without telling.
