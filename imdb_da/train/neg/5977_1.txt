Wow. I don't even remember much about this movie, except it stunk. <br /> <br /> The reason is basically; a girl's parents neglect her so that this sick PokeMon pretends to be her father. Am I the only one disturbed by it? Then this innocent PokeMon kidnames asmor to pretend to be the girl. I don't care if he tried to make the girl happy, it's just gross. There was no real plot. The girl was just a whiny brat who wanted things her own way. She played with Unowns, was "daughter" of Entei and apparently could grow and shrink in age on a whim with the help of her "father". It's pretty much everything I can remember, but I think you can take it as a tip and not see it. (Or if you see it, don't expect much.) 1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Seriously. If you want a PokeMon movie, hire "PokeMon; The First Movie".
