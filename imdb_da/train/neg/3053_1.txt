Wow. Who ever said that Edward D. Wood Jr. never influenced anyone? This steaming pile of donkey expression is a perfect case in point; it makes "The Violent Years" look like "Casablanca"! "Santa Claus" also makes Keith Richards' worst flashbacks resemble my first nightly issue. I have had nightmares, you know, wake up and sweaty bullets that never come close to the visceral terror that Santa Claus excavated from the seemingly clean earth in my very being. However, I can think of some parties where this movie might actually go well. Also, if you're looking for the perfect example of a Santa-Satan dichotomy on VHS tape, don't look any more. Do not check this movie when I am notified, the MST3K version is now available. Move over Satan, here is "Santa Claus".
