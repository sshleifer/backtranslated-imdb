Serum is about a crazy doctor who finds a serum to cure all diseases through the power of mind. Instead, it creates a kind of monster to eat human flesh and brains. The evil doctor creates some zombies out of the cadavers and has some problems. There is a very long leadership in all actions with many scenes that make you familiar with the characters. The mad doctor's nephew enters a car accident, and the evil doctor is trying to use his new serum on the boy. The results are not good. This is a class C movie with OK plays, but some issues govern and some continuity errors. There is not much zombie action in this one and the effects, while appropriate, are nothing special. You can fast-forward through the slow parts and get some joy out of the action scenes. Beware of some nudity and bad language.
