Superdome is one of the movies that makes you wonder why it was made. The whole plot relates to a person trying to sabotage the superbowl and any attempt to stop them. How Tom Selleck and Donna Mills' careers managed to survive this is beyond me. But the most frustrating thing about it was there was no football in it at all! Avoid this if possible.
