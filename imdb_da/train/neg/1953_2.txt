The first episode of this new show was on today and it was terrible. Not only has Shaggy got a creaking new voice listening to his lines of torture, but it's so far away from the original concept and animation style that it can hardly be recognized as a Scooby-Doo show. <br /> <br /> Even back in the dark days when Fred and Velma were gone and Scooby's nephew Scrappy was there, the team still solved mysteries. This new show has instead Shaggy and Scooby fighting with a James Bond-type super-villain and his henchmen while living in a mansion. There's not even an item called 'The Mystery Machine' (and teaser for the next episode that promised a transformer type robot car, didn't put me in peace). How can anyone take Scooby Doo and do this? <br /> <br /> The show earns two points for two scenes with the entire Scooby Doo band, all talking to the right voices, except Shaggy, and even then I'm too generous.
