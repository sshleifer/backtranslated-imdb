Ever since the cinema's love the universe became acquainted with a guy named George A. Romero, the word "zombie" is automatically associated with blood-sucked horror images and non-stop sequences. It is safe to say that his "Night of the Living Dead" formed the zombie movie as we know it now. But in the early years of the cinema, the premise of reanimated corpses was only used in slow, almost actionless psychological thrillers. Jacques Tourneurs "I went with a Zombie" is a perfect example and it is also "White Zombie" starring Bela Lugosi. This "Revolt of the Zombies" could have been another example, but unfortunately it is a mistake across the board and easily one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Terrible play, a very poorly written manuscript and a complete lack of atmosphere and excitement! The movie lasts only 65 minutes and yet the first half hour is completely wasted on stupid love story-intrigue and unexciting monologues. The setting in the legendary Cambodian city of Angkor could certainly have resulted in a more convincing story, but all we ever see is internal shots. The leading actress (Dorothy Stone, textbook blonde with curly hair and a nasty nose) annoyed me tremendously, and I continued to hope a ravine's undead would suddenly come out of nothing to devour her. Unfortunate again ??. If you manage to fight yourself through 60 soporific minutes, you will be rewarded with a fairly decent finale. Yet this is too little to give this film a positive assessment, let alone a recommendation. Avoid! This is the type of movie you should only see if you have already seen everything else.
