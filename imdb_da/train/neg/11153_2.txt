Another in a variety of flicks made by people who think knowing how to operate a camera is the same as telling a story. Within 15 minutes, the whole premise is laid out on few lines, so there is absolutely no mystery that eliminates a whole facet of excitement. The only half-way competent actor is killed 10 minutes in the movie, so we are left with stupid characters running around with stupid things. Low budget movies cannot afford expensive special effects, so the CGI portions are surprisingly unimpressive, but at least a valid trial. The creature is terrible as it is seen when it falls to the pavement, and the director is paying attention to the eyes, which is not even the red color shown in the mirrors. The dialogue is clumsy and uninspired, with some lines reminiscent of foreigners or terminators. The last action sequence takes place in a police station, also a rip-off from Terminator, with everyone hiding in one glass-clad office that Darkwolf does not smash into. Ultimately, the girl calls the hero "a good patron", but he gets both his partners, the original patron and at least three other civilians, not to mention a dozen police, all killed without getting a decent shot in spite of an arsenal of silver balls. and a machine gun. But here's the real complaint for bad writing: They could have killed the animal right after the beginning credits, as it kept stripping while blinking its red eyes. Instead, they took it into custody?!?
