Lame, cliched superhero action movie drive. I had great hopes for this movie, and the genre of HK buddy cop actioneers is one that I do not despise, but very rarely do I see a story as tired and ridiculous as this was. This would have been forgivable as it is always in these kinds of movies when the action compensates, unfortunately it did not. The action carries the brand of surreality and of the supreme nature of the HK action, but it is not much involved, indecent gory, and in fact often quite incoherent (perhaps this is due to redesign to American release, it shows signs in many patches). I was very disappointed.
