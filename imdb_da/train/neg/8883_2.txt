Cliff Robertson as a disgraceful husband married to a wealthy wife delivers a raid-worthy performance here if ever there was one; It's as if director Michael Anderson kept shouting "call it down, think zombie, only less lively" through his little bullhorn as he trained Robertson's efforts. The rest of the casting is barely better; Jennifer Agutter of LOGAN'S RUN fame is hardly seen in what should have been fleshly as a crucial role. If the quality of the actor was three times better; if some of the more gaping plot holes were filled; and if the pacing was given a shot of adrenaline, then this slurry can be brought up to a standard acceptable for Hallmark Life Time TV channel. As it is, its assessment is so inexplicably high that one cannot think that chronic insomniacs use DOMINIQUE to capture some snoozing time. Perhaps the late night television telemarketers lack a great opportunity not to shill it as such.
