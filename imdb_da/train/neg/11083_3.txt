This movie was late at night when I saw it. It was interesting at first, but it didn't convince me as a whole. I'm no Tyson fan. In fact, I don't like boxing at all. It is barbaric, obscene and double-faced (by society) that some get money to beat each other up. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, I felt the start of the movie was OK. Actors okay, especially George C. Scott (like Cus D'Amato). I don't know how reliable the girl is. I haven't read books and books on boxing or Tyson. I don't know anything about the man, but it was quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> As the film went, I felt it lost a bit of its charm and I also lost interest. I managed to stay awake, but the last hour was just not good enough.
