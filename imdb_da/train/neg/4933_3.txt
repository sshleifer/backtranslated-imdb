This movie was not so bad compared to the first two successors to the original. It is directed by Martin Kitrosser on Friday the 13th fame. The action is very bad, but doing and special effects help make it interesting. It's a thing I like about Screaming Mad George (make-up effects artist for the movie), his effects are so off-the-wall and bizarre that they will keep you able to see a bad movie just to find out of how crazy they will get. The movie is not really everything, but there is an extremely unpleasant eyeball-munching scene in the middle that involves a toy goth (what!?!) Mickey Rooney makes a guest look that he probably wasn't too enthusiastic about but needed the money on that time, maybe? If you liked the nice fourth installment (my favorite of all 5), you'll probably like this one. I liked it better than the Matrix! Enjoy.
