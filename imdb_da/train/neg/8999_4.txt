Saturday Night Live, National Lampoon and SCTV alumnus are all in a sometimes funny sketch movie. But it is very interesting to see now in early 2005. Twenty years after this movie was supposed to take place, look at how many of their gags have become truly true: There is a mock movie trailer that was probably not even clever at that time, for something called "The Pregnant Man" which became The case of Arnold Schwarzenegger's silly movie "Junior" There is a commercial spoof that was probably not even clever at that time, for something with Sammy Davis Jr. and Jackie Onasis called "Celebrity Wrestling", which is now the case with a popular show called "Celebrity Boxing" There is a mock movie trailer that was probably not even clever at the time containing John Candy in a movie about a cut off head . Watch this trailer and see how similar are shot and plot to Frank Hellenlotters Basket Case !! And finally there is an ad for a late-late show documentary about "a dead dream, the only two left ..." The documentary's name is ... THE LATEST HIPES! LAUGH OUT LOUD. <br /> <br /> Four prophecies become true!
