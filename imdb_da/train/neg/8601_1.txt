Okay, where do we start with this little gem? Mutant snails begin to take over a small New England (?) City. Only one man can stop them ... and that man ... is Mike Brady! Now, if that wasn't ridiculous enough, stay tuned. <br /> <br /> The family footage is the so-called stock footage. No matter who the snail is attacking or where they are, the same shot of piles of snails appears, which oozes everywhere. Remember that this unique shot takes at least half of the movie. <br /> <br /> The action in the movie was knocked down, pulled out, stolen your wallet, beat your boyfriend, killed your dog, BAD. I'm sure there is worse, but you are hard pressed to find it. The only gem was ... you guessed it .... MIKE BRADY! He must have taken a couple of night classes at the YMCA because he was the best in the pile. <br /> <br /> What about horror? This film should not be taken seriously. There is no horror! They are snails to cry aloud. The whole rising action could have been avoided with a salt shaker or two. Just watch this movie in an MST3K-type environment, otherwise I can see some major damage to the brain.
