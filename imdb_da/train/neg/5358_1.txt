Obviously, all the good reviews submitted to this movie so far are from insiders who were either involved in the movie or who know someone who knows someone and thus saw several cuts. Well, I know no one involved, and I've seen the final cut, and it's pure waste. The only thing it has for that is ambition and several cameos from horror legends (no one on the screen for terribly long). It is as if the filmmakers made this film on a weekend during a horror convention and got actors like Tony Todd, Tom Savini, David Hess and Michael Berryman to play scenes during their coffee breaks. This is an ultra-cheap, shot-on-video wannabe X-Files with horrible performance from a cast of non-actors with more mullets than it is acceptable in the 21st century. There is little or no action; It's all for explanatory dialogue trying to explain a meaningless coincidence plot. Ther computer FX is a joke, but not enough of them or enough to make this movie enjoyable in an MST3K way. After approx. 8 straight scenes of nothing but talking, you find yourself reaching the forward button ... and not getting away. Absolutely worthless.
