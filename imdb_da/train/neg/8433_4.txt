Pere is an idiot, but he is aware of it and works as a result. His life is totally boring, and he doesn't know how to change it. When his last friend, Nicco, dies. He feels completely empty and he decides to go out to be full. When he returns home, he goes with a girl who puts advertisements. Although she ignores him, he falls in love and begins to follow her obsessively. Now the start of the movie is a bit slow and can result in boring for most people. But as an action begins, it's a little better (not much! Perhaps the best part is the 5 minute sex (almost 30 different scenes about it) that you can see in the middle of the movie, it's not good for erotism, but for it Funny and Unexpected is the scene, it's probably the best of the movie, neither the actors nor the steering is good, and the results are a boring movie that can result in fun for some people (not for me) All movies are based on absurd situations (The idiot the movie says) has something interesting, I like Ventura Pons, but I have to admit that this is not one of his best movies (maybe his worst!), he knows how to do better.
