This game has the (honor) honor to be the first game I've stopped playing right in the middle of and felt like smashing in bits and then burning. Congratulations. First and last Tomb Raider I will ever play I assure you. <br /> <br /> Plot: Just writing that word made me laugh. There is not one. There is also no sign development. We finally have a girl hero who can take care of herself who is not * beeping * mary-sue, but unfortunately she dresses like a hat and her breast is huge. They had to attract the sexist boys you see. Still, all she does is go to the grave after the grave shoots things she walks together. Why she does, I have no idea. I had subtitles on and t.v. as loud as I could, and I still didn't understand a terrible thing. The development (or lack thereof) of her, her two friends and * crooks * was ridiculous. There will also be levels that you have to go through - do not give you a hint of what to do next and you will literally be in most of the boring as hell graves in HOURS trying to figure out what in hell you have to do. There is one course (out of two) especially with her on a motorcycle (believe me it is not fun at all) that you will be on for an hour without kicking point in sight. This means that you are hit by the other driver and boys in vans that shoot at you, or you hit a tree, you start the hour long walk across. <br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * ck: You know that lets do the levels very long have virtually no saving points, no history, no character development, no variation in games, most of the music has the longest levels bleeding and giving no hints to the player so they can stay even longer in one place instead of getting to the non-existing plot. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck one: They sound like slap ideas. <br /> <br /> Stupid F * ck two: I agree. Who needs character development, plot or unboring game-play. <br /> <br /> Todd: I'm sorry the gentleman, but these ideas seem to be going out of the player extremely. <br /> <br /> Boss Stupid F * ck: Close Todd. You're fired. <br /> <br /> Gameplay: Everything she does is shot. Of course she can flip while shooting, jumping while shooting, or kicking while shooting again. By jumping, jumping and kicking does not erase the fact that everything she ultimately does is shot. BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Music: Intromusic is extremely beautiful. I love listening to it. The one in the game music goes from being acceptable to cutting off your ears. <br /> <br /> Visuals: Considering this game was made in 2006, I expected the visuals to blow me away. Well I was blown, but certainly not in a good way. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: This game is a plot-less, no sign development mess with a barely dressed unmarysuish (THANKFULLY) young women leading through boring tombs for some dull reason (whatever it might be I don't tell you) with imaginative shooting games. STAY AWAY FROM THIS B.S. !!!!!!!! It gets two stars to have a woman who is not a lady of distress (no matter how hard-dressed she might be) and the beautiful in music.
