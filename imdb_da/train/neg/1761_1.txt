First, I realize that a "1" rating must be reserved for the worst of the worst. This movie gets it from me, because as a reviewer points out, it's not bad in a self-conscious, over-the-top kind of way that can allow it to have some comic or cult value. It simply misses its mark on each counter. ** Contains possible spoilers ** The dialogue is completely unfortunate. Continuity is so conscious that it is painful. Daniel just stops talking about his lost love, and with his last word the flamenco dancers begin. Mock-shock of what she's called (see? I don't even remember his character's name, let alone the name of the forgettable actress) when her husband (Baldwin) first tells her her friend is the bad guy. The car and the motorcycle hunter did all the right things. Green wagons gone flying. Cars crash into each other. Motorcycles go down the stairs. People are almost hit, but remarkably no one is. Oh, that's right ... except for one guy who has been stacked several times, stumbled naturally along the curb with knife wound, and a nearby car apparently didn't notice him there. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> It is becoming more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can be made. There is so much pressure in the movie industry to make money, you think someone in Hollywood would think of making good movies worth seeing. Now there is a new idea. <br /> <br /> My suggestion: Can't watch this movie. Do not rent the DVD. Don't look at cable. There are lots of other things you could do that will make you feel more satisfied.
