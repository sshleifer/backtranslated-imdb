The original show was so much better. They should have left a good note. This movie killed the whole idea. It was boring, over-dramatic, and the fun parts were too long to compensate for the blur. This movie really seemed like it was too hard to be serious, and that certainly wasn't what I wanted from this sequel. Not to mention that for a long time it was just depressing about the same thing over and over again. So sorry, Tyler Perry, but try harder next time. This movie is just a bit boring, and not so much fun. Pardon. 4/10 stars is it. <br /> <br /> Jay Addison
