It was hard to believe that director Barbet Schroeder once made the majestic and very fun Maitresse (1976), and now seems to be only "the numbers" Hollywood thrillers. This is very easy John Grisham material, crossed with the plot of a TV movie. Bullock is Cass Mayweather, a feisty and independent crime researcher specializing in serial killers. Ben Chaplin is her reserved police officer Sam Kennedy, and together they create an unpleasant duo. Not good when two unbalanced college maladriots (Gosling and Pitt) decide to send them on a wild goose hunt - by planting very wise and misleading forensic evidence of a crime scene. Just right, but while Bullock and Chaplin fail to create sparks, we also have to endure a series of boring too melodramatic flashbacks that illustrate an important event in Cass's history. Then there are, of course, the frequent shots of a log cabin where there is no doubt that the OTT end will be canceled. Oooh ... the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> See an episode of CSI instead. It is to the point and far more exciting.
