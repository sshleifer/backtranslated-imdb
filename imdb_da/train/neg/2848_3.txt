... so I thought I'd throw a few words about William McNamara. Not a bad way to spend a few hours if you want to see him in his tighty-whities - it's obvious he pumped up this role and he looks good in them - or less. There is an extended order in a cave where he has to strip down to his bed. There is a good deal where he has to hunt for Miss Eleniak in the buffet, with only his hands cupped over his groin. William McNamara is of course a bit on the skinny side, but he has a nice, generous handful of boots. There is also a moment when he goes out of bed that if you pause the action at the right moment, you can see the entire enchilada. If you are inclined to do so and move on, half of the people who choose to watch a movie about marine men are on a "road trip". I just want to thank Dennis Hopper for his equal opportunities for freedom. Can William McNamara Act? Heck if I know.
