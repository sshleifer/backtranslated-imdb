Oh man, it's amazing how anyone can claim global warming to be a science, well, I suppose this elitist nonsense now replaces the science of eugenics! Al Gore is trying to make this problem lightly complicated, though it just needs common sense to see that this whole thing is a big hoax of a man with his own moneymaking agenda! How have scientists estimated historical temperatures of this planet? By estimating the sunspot activity. Has no one ever asked if this method has been accurate? No, not even Gore himself! So how would heck not accurately predict future temperature with sun spot activity if it has been so accurate in the past? According to solar radiation activity, the temperature today is completely in line with what it should be. How has the temperature in the whole universe increased (relatively) as much as on earth? Does our SUVs temperature on Jupiter increase? <br /> <br /> Use some common sense! You don't have to be a rocket scientist to find out that this can be other than a HOAX. Please check it yourself. What can Al Gore and his elitist friends like Rothschild (bank family who arranged live earth events) to achieve this? Now, the new world bank will be based on CO2 credits, it's tax on everything that gives CO2 omissions, and it's easier to get away with these taxes if the people are tempted to believe it's saving the world when It is only about money, centralized control and more power for the elitist bankers. Al Gore even has a company that sells carbon credits! Is it not noble to pay voluntary CO2 credits to save the world, especially if it goes into its own company? <br /> <br /> I don't want you to blindly believe in me, so do your own research and use your own common sense, and I'm sure you come to the right conclusion!
