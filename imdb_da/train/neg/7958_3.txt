Protégé runs linearly; Don't expect any quick action, nor will you find yourself breathing breathing because there are simply no seats at the moment. There's not much of a cross, so don't expect one either. I would not fault the play - the show would have been very worst if not for Wu's acting as the only rescue grace of the movie. And also the cute little girl. Humor is at best weak, and the show should as well pass as an anti-drug campaign using the usual punctuality (especially in scenes with Zhang) to tell us things we already know - ie. drugs break up families, heroin drives you crazy, it's not that easy to blow off, you'll fall into a vicious circle. <br /> <br /> I know it may be a bit hard, but I feel that the show is far from seamless and somewhat rude (* SPOILER ALERT *: For example, when Andy Lau was brought to the police station: what? we were just told 'oh we all have ties and evidence against you since 1997' and that's how he got caught. No, no hunt-car action, just a jump-of-scene, which undermined Wu's role as a undercover in the first place.) I suppose the lack of creativity is due to the fact that it is a production of Mediacorp Raintree - a Singaporean production film company.
