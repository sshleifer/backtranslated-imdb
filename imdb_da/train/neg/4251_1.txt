1 out of 10. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie you can't believe you're wasting just 2 hours in your life as you see the credits. I honestly think I could make a better vampire movie .... and I know nothing. The only thing that doesn't just suck (harder than a vampire) is Jason Scott Lee .... his character is at least a little cool, has some mystery and kicks a little ass.
