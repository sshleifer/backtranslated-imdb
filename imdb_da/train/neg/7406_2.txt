Well, how would I know this was "the stupid ass promoter" Lordi Motion Picture "? I mean, I realized when the" dinosaur "costume appeared, and when the leading singer made his appearance, I lobster" Hard Rock Hallelujah "to myself ... even though I hate that song." Dark Floors "is about a young autistic girl who is being thrown out of the hospital by her over protective father when they and the rest of the population in the elevator being caught immediately ... When they arrive at their word it will be a surprise to find out that there are no others nearby, the hospital is empty ... Apart from a series of monsters that seem to stalk them without apparent cause ... They run through corridors and stairs that come across all the band members of the heavy metal band in their outlandish shock-rock costumes ... Nothing really memorable here, except the miserable spectacle, lack of gore / nudity and the completely shameless see the advertising edge, reminds me of much of "KISS Meet the Phantom of the Park". Yes, remember that dud? I don't want to ... I just recommend avoiding all those Ghost House movies as a sponge and not listening to Lordi as they are a Gwar ripoff band!
