I wanted to like this movie, I really did. It has some good actors, but eventually it falls flat. It is fun to be fun in some places (the daughters of zealous cooking attempts), reaching over (the scene where they clean up a person's farm so he agrees to join the team) and has some scenes that while they are slightly interesting, really are just filler (the whole work scene). And I didn't find the "villians" scary or worth the hats as much as I found them to be childish annoying. <br /> <br /> I have met people like them in the movie while playing church balls. And I want to say that the judge is spot on. Finally, I really didn't care about everything so much about the characters, or their quest for ecclesiastical glory. Maybe because they were all so one-dimensional, that I might not have had so well into if the movie was more fun or seemed to flow a little more evenly everywhere. <br /> <br /> Kurt Hale and Halestorm entertainment have made some great movies, but it's not one of them.
