Visually interesting, but falls flat in the originality department. This tedious exercise in technique carries thin after the opening fight. Jude Law has charisma of burnt toast, but in his defense, this movie contains some of the worst dialogues I've ever seen on the big screen. In fact, the script is so poor that it keeps you from getting out of the movie and made me think of work, bills, my dogs, etc. There are many moments that scream bluescreen. Paltrow is like wood that they get. This could have been saved by snappy movie noir dialogue or by the top camp. My only complaint about the technique is that black and white film (sorry, computer) would have helped because it looks like Turner colored black and white. Just a big boring clich√© mess. I'd rather break my thigh than sit through this endurance test again.
