The only scary thing about this movie is the idea that the one who did it could make a sequel. <br /> <br /> From start to finish "The To Fairy" was just scary. It seemed like a badly acted children's movie that was confused, with a "Wizard of Oz" witch melting and happy kiddies ending in combination with some bad gore effects and harsh. Half of the molding seems completely unnecessary except that it is convenient to be there to be murdered in some way. The sister of the two brothers, the Cherise aura reader and Mrs. McDonald are irrelevant in the film - they could have included them in the main plot for some interesting side stories, but apparently could not be bothered. The people who watch the movie know that the characters are there for some bloody death scenes, but come on, at least TRY and get a small plot for them. The story in general is weak with irregular behavior from the characters that make you want them all eaten by the witch. Add the weak plot and the weak ones that work together (the kids are especially wood) and the film ends up completely wrong. If only MST3K could have had a trip on this one ...
