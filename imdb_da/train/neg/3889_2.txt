I always wanted to see this because I love cheesy horror movies and with a title like this, I was sure "The Incredible Melting Man" would be very fun. It really wasn't. I mean, the play was entertainingly bad, the manuscript contained some classic bad lines, and the special effects looked as if someone had been sneezing over the main actor, so I should have loved it. Unfortunately, it is really a draw between these highlights. I decided to watch the last half of the movie while making my tax return. It's so boring that this movie is. <br /> <br /> However, if you love bad movies, you'll enjoy the dramatic exit from Fat Nurse and star actor playing Dr. Ted. To be fair to the poor man, he has to deliver some incredibly scary lines with straight face - like the conversation he has with his wife on IM man tracking: <br /> <br /> "I find him with a geiger counts. "" Is he radioactive? " "Just a little bit." <br /> <br /> Yes, the reason is Dr. Ted walked around trying to find a superstrong zombie killing machine, armed only with what looks like a mini-Dyson. He's a brave man. Unfortunately, his plan fails when he finds a lot of goop on a tree. "Oh God - it's his ear!" says Dr. Ted to the audience. I'm so happy to clean it up. <br /> <br /> I realize I'm making this movie sound funny. It would be if it was only 10 minutes long, but unfortunately it goes over and over again, and the incredible melting dude just cheats to make a sticky mess when eating more people in my opinion. I think if you were really rocky, you would probably love it, just don't have pop tarts during the movie, because the main actor really looks like a close end.
