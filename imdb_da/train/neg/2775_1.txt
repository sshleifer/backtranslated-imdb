This was the worst acted movie I've ever seen in my life. No really. I'm not making fun. All "based on a true story / historical references" aside there is no excuse for such bad action. It's a shame, because as others have written, the sets and costumes were great. The soundtrack was typically "Asian style" music, although I couldn't figure out where the "modern" love song came in when Fernando was lying in his bed thinking of Maria. I don't know who wrote and sang the beautiful song, but it was as if Norah Jones was suddenly transported to the 16th century. The hershey syrup blood in Phycho was more realistic than the ketchup sprinted during the Kwik-n-EZ fighting scenes. <br /> <br /> But the actor. Oh, so painfully sad. Lines delivered as a bad junior high play. If Gary Stretch had donned a potato costume for the County 4H Fair he might have been more credible. Towards the end, he sounded more like a small Italian stacker. At times, I half expected that he screamed out "Adrian!" or even "You want a piece of me?!". <br /> <br /> Favorite Line: When the Queen says to her lover (after barfing on the floor) "I need a baby." He answers "A child?" I was expecting her to retort "No, Jackass, a pole! Duh."
