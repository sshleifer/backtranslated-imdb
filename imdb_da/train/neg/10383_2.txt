This can be one of the most enjoyable movies ever, if you don't take it seriously. It's a little dated and the effects are paralyzed, but it's so much fun. There are giant crabs that attack a girl. Oh, and the crabs are singing Japanese. It's incredibly bad. And the end, which has been telegraphed throughout the film, is hidden wonderfully. Predictable but seeing the final battle will let you roll into your seat. Don't even give this movie a chance and you'll love it. Susan George is fun to see and yes, she seems naked. Her daughter is not really worth putting up with, but she is being attacked by giant crabs. They are the size of big cats. This is a 2, but I love it. As a movie, my God, but for entertainment, I give it a 7. Have I mentioned that there are big crabs?
