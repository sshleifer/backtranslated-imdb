The first 30 minutes of the girl were choppy and hard to know just what was going on (unless you read the book - which I didn't have). <br /> <br /> If you can stick to the first half, the second half is sweet - predictable, yes, but sweet no-less. <br /> <br /> The way it was shot, one would think it was produced in the early 80s, not 2005. <br /> <br /> No stand-out moments, bland, but went on without boring me. <br /> <br /> I would like to know why Keaton chose this role, her part would have been better cast with a player more on par with the other players to keep the balance.
