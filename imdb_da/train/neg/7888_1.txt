didn't know anything about the movie or that it was based on a best-selling book. Tried to guess from the opening scenes, what it was about, best guess, buried treasure and a death list. It lasted about 15 minutes when I got stealthy suspicion that the movie was crap.I'll not drill you with how bad the plot and play was, but anyone who gave it more than two stars must work for the filmmakers. I watched until the hero jumped into his corvette to hurry to the hospital. He had his on his suit, shirt and tie arrived at the hospital in jeans and on / shirt. Can't even get the continuity right. I got the Christian theme, hard to miss.
