OK, I love bad horror. I especially love horror badly enough to make fun of. Demonicus or House of the Dead - they were bad enough to have fun. Severed was not. <br /> <br /> It was worse. <br /> <br /> (spoilers - who cares?) <br /> <br /> My friend and I sat throughout the movie and I have a number of comments, both in "this sucks" style and in the real goal of actual criticisms. Plot (Kind) - There is a guy in this city (who may be Seattle, see comment below) who runs around and cuts heads. He's been doing it for over a year (I'm not going to get accurate numbers - thank you very much), maybe two or three years. A head of the week. And the police just call a "specialist" (which ONCE refers to itself as a psychic, but it never comes up again). <br /> <br /> Schya right! Feds take over after what, three connected murders? After NEARLY A DUNDRED LIKE KILLS, we would be under freaking martial law !!!!! <br /> In any case, this "specialist" consults voodoo chicken that the police have ignored all the time, and the two of them have come to the conclusion that it is Baron Samedi, a voodoo spirit who cut off heads to get enough power to make themselves a body (and then presumably take over the world - or maybe just go to Disneyland). <br /> <br /> About. <br /> <br /> Setting - where does this happen? Well, if you are not from Seattle, you may not realize that in the bar / rave (occupied by about ten movie staff and their family members) is a poster for a local radio station, entertaining, "Pulp Fiction" esqe dialogue (as IF) between the two police (yes, those who get their heads cut off about 15 minutes into the girl) discuss the "new stadium", which may still have been a problem as this movie is made. <br /> <br /> Be from Seattle, I apologize for the movie and hang my head in shame. OK, here's where it gets really critical - being a horror movie writer (not published, don't look for my name in IMDb) I'm investigating. Lots of research. And, unlike the authors of this movie, I know that Baron Samedi - while a Voudon Loa (spirit) guarding the cemetery and traditionally has been associated (by various Christian oppressors) with "Satan" - is actually a "Loki" -like trickster god. <br /> <br /> In other words, he doesn't break his head. <br /> <br /> In addition, much of the Voudoun religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever he wants. Their religious ceremonies are centered around the possession of various members of the ward by loa. <br /> <br /> Not to mention, if he already has someone, why make a new body? <br /> <br /> Also, if Baron Samedi got a body, he wouldn't go round and cut head, he would get some good rooms and cigars and couples-TAY !!! <br /> In summary, the only thing they did get (surprisingly) right is in the completely unnecessary Tarot card reading (used only to show that voodoo chick is "spooky") they didn't turn up in the interpretations of the cards that most movies do. Again, I have done research. (Someone remembers the old late-night ad for phone-in tarot readings - "They loved - you'll soon fall in love with love ..." and all that nonsense?) <br /> <br /> If you've done this far through my comments, I congratulate you. And I'm sorry again. I will be sorry if you feel like watching the movie because of me, please do so.
