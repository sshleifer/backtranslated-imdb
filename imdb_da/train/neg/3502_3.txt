Sarah Silverman is really the "taste of the month" cartoon right now. Is she really worth the only hype? Yes and no. She is fun at times, sometimes hilariously so (her standup routine is actually quite interesting, but not always fun). Other times, you feel cheated by the media to overdo another performer. She is one of the really sweet comedians who men especially flock to and say they dig her intelligence and joke. But if you corner them, most men will admit that they just want to sleep with her, and therefore they look at her. She reminds me why many men flocked to Margaret Cho and Janeane Garofalo, though none of them really are "hot" now in terms of popularity. Sara does not drink or smoke (at least cigs), so she must be warm when she is 60, so her fans (especially the male) can rejoice. <br /> <br /> As for this show, it's a lot like her comedy. When it works, it's fun. When it does not, it is full blown tedium and very, very boring. The AIDS episode here is the best. It is consistently fun, and has some really good satire in it. Brian Poeshn's character has an unhealthy obsession with Tab in an episode, and it's fun to see him in a Tab T-shirt. But they never really go anywhere with it, and it finally welcomes it. Sarah's character in the series is quite annoying, the gay couple (Brian Poeshn and another guy) seems turned on and really does nothing for the show as a whole, and the supporting players (including Sarah's real life sister Laura, who does not see anything like her) is okay. When the jokes are hit, they are brilliant. When they do not, they are terrible and I really think terrible. There is also an obsession with coprophilia here (aka poop jokes), which apparently has replaced actual humor and intelligence in comedy today. Then you should see this show? If you're in love with Sarah, go for it. You can stare at her and pretend she is yours. As for her show, it's from good to absolute zero.
