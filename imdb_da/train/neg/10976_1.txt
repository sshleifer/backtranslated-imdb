A horrible movie that has to be an independent one. It required some dependence on something. This completely miserable film deals with the interactions between Irish people. Were they trying to imitate the wonderful movie "Crash?" If so, this movie crashed completely. <br /> <br /> There is just too much going on here culminating in a little steep running around and throwing rocks into buses and cars that naturally cause chaos. <br /> <br /> The movie is just too choppy to work. A woman loses her husband after 14 years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor. This causes the former sister to become a bitter whisper and walk around in clothes that are not worth believing. The older sister is also embittered, but soon finds romance. <br /> <br /> Then we have 3 losers who buy masks to steal a bank. Obviously, the robbery goes wrong, but there seems to be no punishment for the bad guys. Perhaps the punishment should have been on the authors for not creating a coherent film.
