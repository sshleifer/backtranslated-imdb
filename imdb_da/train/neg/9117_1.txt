... or maybe it's just so bad. The reason is a cheap rehash of the first, which is odd as it should be a prequel, not a successor. Almost the whole movie seems like a cheap remake of the first, with scenes mimicking the things that happened in the first, much more ridiculous and unlikely. Where the first one had a large cast, this one consists of B-list actors and rejects. The play is mostly terribly bad. Half of the good lines in the movie are taken directly from the first, just like almost all major characters, including those not in the first movie. I'm aware that this was made by a television series pilot episode, but that's no excuse. They didn't have to beat the (bad) recording in a movie. Only one thing is marginally good, and it is the erotic sequences. But since these are not nearly as good as those in the first, it does not rise above a rating of 1. If you have a chance to see it for free and you are a straight guy, it might be worth checking out If you want something erotic that is not porn. If not, avoid at all costs. 1.10
