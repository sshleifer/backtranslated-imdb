I am actually surprised at the amount of good ratings this anti-Christian pseudo-documentary got. Now I respect the guy's meaning and belief, even me I am not in this state believer in the learned Christian doctrine. However, the anti-Christian propaganda is something else. <br /> <br /> This movie has valid points but they are very few and represented in a very biased context. I do not recommend seeing it. In fact, I think everyone should see it and decide for themselves whether they believe it or not. And that is actually more of a chance than the director gives to Christian teachings. Instead of a question on the subject, it looks like a personal vendetta at the Christian school that hit his childhood. It also misunderstands Christians most times as either incredibly naive or fundamentalists, no moderation between them. <br /> <br /> The director uses cinema scenes from Christ's passion without permission, creates an interview with the principal of his former school, and presents almost exclusively anti-Christian historians and writers. In fact, I found the principal to be the most down to earth person and believe that his attitude was fully justified. I also strongly doubt that any of the Christian believers who were interviewed were heard sequentially or even told before interviewing the purpose of the study. <br /> <br /> Having said that, there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the issues of Christianity. But the way this whole is thinking is often offensive, very unprofessional and terribly biased.
