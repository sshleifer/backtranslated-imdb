My comment is for the Russian version of Space Race, called Bitva za Kosmos (Battle for Space) shown on Russia's first channel on April 10 - 13. A poor translation could have destroyed some details, but I doubt it is the case. The number of erroneous errors is such that it is impossible to list them, especially in the first episode (the development of first missiles). Even the American half of the movie contains several errors and omissions. The audience is not told about any V-2 / A-4 launches from the US Three different Jupiter C rockets have been launched with the same serial number 'UE' on board. Apollo 1 must be launched to the moon, etc. In the Russian half, each and every person is ridiculous. Korolev is afraid of NKVD, Glushko is saboteur and traitor, Mishin is alcoholic, etc. Men as functions; no motivation, no life at all. Uniform and decorations are awful. Gagarin sings a whimsical song awaiting launch (I think this was added specifically to Russian version).
