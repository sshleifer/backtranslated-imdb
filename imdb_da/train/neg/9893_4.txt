I just hope that no classics / old historians saw "Cleopatra" or if they did, they took it as a laugh. The film is terribly inaccurate, more ridiculously even than "Gladiator" (which is at least a well-written script whose historical error is articulated and responds well to history). Most obviously, Octavius, Caesar's heir, is in the Senate before the emperor's murder: in the mature age of 19! <br /> <br /> In addition, the play is mediocre. Timothy Dalton has more than a hint of James Bond in him when he says, "Caesar. Julius Caesar." Billy Zane is a ridiculously close Marc Antony. And Leonor Varela tries his best to be the seductive pharaoh (who was not really delicious at all), but comes out so incredibly. <br /> <br /> So this is a warning for all historians - this movie is not true to life!
