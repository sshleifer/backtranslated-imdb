Where do you start with a movie as bad as this? <br /> <br /> Do you think they throw unlikely heroes? The over-the-top deal? The horrible script? <br /> <br /> No You just say that anyone who pays money to watch a movie as poor as this needs their head to look at. I know I do. I respect the bad guys who saw it with little or no upfront power as an empire (usually a bad sign if a preview copy is not available for the quality movies). However, cinemas should really start thinking about giving out refunds if the customer is not satisfied with the finished product. <br /> <br /> Three days after opening, I went with two other friends. The only other person in the cinema was alone on one side. <br /> <br /> And it was cheap night. <br /> <br /> Either the ad campaign had failed dismally or words had spread throughout most of the country where only one stink is. <br /> <br /> Not since The Avengers (1998) days have I felt so briefly changed since seeing a movie. If a friend comes around with this video in a couple of months, make sure he pays your electric bill while you see it. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald deserves a prize not to blow up - or get away from the set; Keith Allen retains some dignity in the midst of cinematic carnage; Barry Foster should have been arrested on the set for his performance, Rhys Ifans does not favor his career after the success of Notting Hill, and only Dani Behr is halfway sympathetic as a busy secretary. <br /> <br /> Remember, considering she used to be in the Word, the viewers' expectations of her acting ability had to be pretty low at first. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are not bad considering the apparently limited budget, but that script is terrible. If you want to hear a bunch of odd characters, say "Fak!" For a couple of hours, this should be right up your path. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, bar poles are required. <br /> <br />
