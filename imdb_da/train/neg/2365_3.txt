This movie is just bad. Bath. Bath. Bath. Now that I've got it out of the way, I feel better. This movie is bad from the beginning to the end. The story is paralyzed. The 3-D segment is really bad. Freddy is on his cartoon character worst. Thank goodness they killed him. And who will see Roseanne and Tom Arnold cameos? <br /> <br /> The only good thing in the movie is the little bit of backstory we get at Freddy. We see that he once had a family, and we are going to see his violent, alcoholic father (Alice Cooper). <br /> <br /> Other than that, all bad. There are some quality actors in here (Lisa Zane and Yaphet Kotto) and they do their best, but the result is just as bad. The hour and a half I spent watching this movie is and an hour and a half, I can never come back.
