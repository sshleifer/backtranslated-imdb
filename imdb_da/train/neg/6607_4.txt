Not as bad as some make it even though it is of course pathetic to the original. In my opinion, Amitabh was great as the villain Babban Singh - try not to compare with Gabbar in the original, as they obviously did not go for the same effect. However, aside from some mediocre action scenes, the rest of the movie is lacking. The character development was poor and history's development was hopeless, with many loopholes and lacking information that I would not have known if I hadn't read the back of the DVD case. The worst part of the movie was supporting roles from Nisha Kothari and especially this new guy called Prashant Raj. Nisha is simply annoying from the time her lips are open. As for Prashant Raj - seriously who is this guy? where is he from and why on earth was he present in the film studio for anything other than serving drinks? His ability to function is zero, and he has the same tone, the dialect and the magnificent expression in all scenes, whether it is action, comedy or even a scene when someone is just dead. Ajay Devgan was average, at least his expression changed, which is more than I can say for his fault with a companion. In general, RGV's Aag is worth looking at Amitabh's solid performance, and also a very sexy Urmilla Matondkar in a special look.
