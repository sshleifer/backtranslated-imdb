Apparently, The Mutilation Man is about a guy wandering around the country who is performing suicide as a way of coping with his fierce childhood. I use the word 'apparently' because without listening to a director Andy Copp's comment (which I did not have available to me) or reading the film prior to seeing, viewers will not have a clue as to what it is about. <Gorehounds and fans of extreme movies can be tempted to watch The Mutilation Man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and disturbing moving images, but unless they are also exposed to pretentious, headache-inducing, experimental art-house cinema, they will find this a real task to sit through. 82 minutes of ugly images accompanied by discordant sound, horrible music and incomprehensible dialogue, this insane horrible drive is the perfect way to test one's mind. If you still have all your marble, change this nonsense and see something proper instead (I saw it all, but I am quite aware that I am completely offended!).
