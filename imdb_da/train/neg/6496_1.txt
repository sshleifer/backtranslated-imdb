This movie was a disappointment. I was looking forward to seeing a good movie. I'm the kind of person who starts a movie and doesn't turn it off at the end, but I didn't force myself to shut it down. <br /> <br /> The reason I didn't turn it off was because I'm a big Christian Slater fan and I wanted to see him act in it. I was really speechless when I finished watching the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Thank you Christian Slater for putting some humor into it. If you weren't in this movie, I'd be sorry for myself. <br /> <br /> I also agree that Anthony Hopkins should stick to acting. When the film was over, I didn't even get the plot. I was both confused and annoyed.
