Lethargic direction destroys an otherwise convincing period story that stars the wonderful Zhang Ziyi in an excellent role as a woman joining an extremist group in 1928 China just before the Japanese invasion of Manchuria and reunited with a former lover working now for Japan. Every bit of drama and forward movement of the story is sucked dry by director Ye Lo's somnambulist's directorial style. Characters stand still and stare at each other for long minutes and say nothing, handheld cameras last forever on faces that show endless reactions far beyond what they need, edits repeat the same reaction is triple redundancy. We know nothing about the characters that history begins and get some new information as history progresses, only silence and static shots of lovers who do not speak, who interact through silent dances but share no apparent emotional intimacy. A very sleeping inducing film.
