Umm .. I was totally surprised that someone actually gave this movie high marks. <br /> <br /> We meet it ... Tori Spelling is not a great actress .. and this movie just proves the scale of her talent ". The plot of the movie was weak ... I bet the dormer that followed with this concept, something was perverted peeping empty .. If there is a good thing about this movie, i would say it is Tommy Chong's daughter just because she is his daughter ... and then there is the Soap Opera ish male manager who is decent, sees something, makes him attractive, but ceases to help his dramatic abilities. * Why does IMDb require at least 10 lines? How many more ways can you simply say "This movie sucks"?
