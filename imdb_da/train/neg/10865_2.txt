I love munna bhai MBBS but "Lag raho ..." SUX really SUX. I have never seen such a boring movie throughout my life. And these high ratings really surprised me that what happened to the taste of Indian cinema shooters ?? <br /> <br /> ** MUST BE SPOILER ** <br /> <br /> A trained girl needs a advice from a Bhai, people discuss their personal prob. on phones coming on man from which part of the world you are ??? I agree that movies should be fictitious, but these things are truly indestructible. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10. (2 stars is 15 minutes good start)
