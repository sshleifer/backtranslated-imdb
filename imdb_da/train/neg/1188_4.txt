Kurosawa really blew it on this one. Each genius is allowed a bug. The concept is fine, but the execution is very blurred. <br /> <br /> There's a fantasy in this movie that makes it an art movie. The poverty of the poor deserves a fairer and more realistic depiction. Many of them have interesting stories to tell. A very disappointing movie.
