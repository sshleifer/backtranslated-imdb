It's a bit of a strange movie, as Santa Claus lives on a cloud in outer space and fights against Satan and his minions ... but it's still fun. <br /> <br /> It has some real grin ... If all of them were intentional, it is certainly debatable. This movie is not good, but I can say that I really enjoyed seeing it. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie of "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians", "Santa Claus" with Dudley Moore and John Lithgow, or "The Santa Clause" with Tim Allen.
