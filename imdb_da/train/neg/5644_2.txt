What happened to British television drama? From John Major through Tony Blair, the focus of the genre seems to have shifted from social realism to smugly normative women-focused tales of the lurking domestic problems of cozy middle-class staff. <br /> <br /> (Or maybe TVNZ doesn't buy the good stuff? Let it be what it is ...) The writer's long career in soap probably explains why the dialogue is mainly out of date clich√©s. Niamh Cusack's performance is strong in meaningful looks, each of the directors for at least half a dozen more than they deserve. Baleful appearance, however, is a bad substitute for depth of character if the author has failed to provide such material to actors to work with. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is theoretically a thriller about a murder investigation; but it is not as important as the failing marriage of the central character and its accompanying problems. Is Cusack's character a complete bastard? Will her son be completely traumatized by the marriage break? Doing these key issues is not a sign of insight - it indicates a deeply narcissistic identification of the author and director with a character who must continue his job. <br /> <br /> Lynda La Plante knows how to write these things so it feels like it matters and involves viewers than home-based neurotics; Apparently, Paula Milne is not up to the task.
