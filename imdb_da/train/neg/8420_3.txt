Despite the excellent cast, this is an unrelenting film, especially from the aviation perspective. It can be something better than the real "von Richthofen and Brown" but not much. "Blue Max" is the best of a small market for the past 35 years, while "Darling Lilli" is fun if not taken seriously. It is interesting to speculate what ILM could do with Zeppelins and Gothas in a new, high quality WW I aero film.
