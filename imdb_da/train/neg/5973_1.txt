This movie is another good example of what Jerry Bruckheimer, since about 1997, seems to be best at - hyped up a movie a year before its release and not getting through with a quality movie. I'm not a film critic, but this movie was as predictable as they come. Every attempt at a joke, any attempt at a moment, and the pitiful attempt at a love story was exactly what I predict in my mind. Do yourself a favor and save your money on this.
