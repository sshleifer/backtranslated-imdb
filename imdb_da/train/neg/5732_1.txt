I'm all for a "bad" horror movie, but it was just a pile of dog! How someone can call this movie cool or decent is beyond me. If you like hasty editing to cover special effects, bad acting and a bad script, go to it! There was no excitement at all, and the gore factor was ridiculous because it was so false. I take Hostel or Wolf Creek over this pile any day. My partner gave up after approx. 20 minutes, she knows a stink when she sees one. On the other hand, I sat silly through the whole movie just to wait and see if it got better. No such luck! I don't have her second movie Torched, and I doubt if I will disturb you now.
