Great CGI effects and a true Oscar-worthy performance by Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks is a one-pony pony in this movie, how he became the best actor Oscar that year over Morgan Freeman was a crime. <br /> <br /> This movie is a panting treacly love letter for the baby boom generation, with a barely hidden right-wing that begins from Forrest's service in Vietnam all the way to the "resolution" with Jenny at the end. However, it is very entertaining and an American movie through and through. I found certain parts of this movie very offensive, Zemecki's dumbs down this movie almost to the level of Gump himself. . .Maybe that was the point he was trying to make. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and ask yourself "What is Robert Zemeckis saying about what makes a good American?" <br /> <br /> Forrest seems to have made the "right" choices and been in "the right place at the right time" over the past 45 years. Those who fail according to the director's vision seem to pay a huge price. So does Zemeckis say that idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic, just American quality?
