The DVD version consists of 2 episodes, where the Caesar parice is the time. In addition, the language was Spanish without subtitles. Therefore, it is difficult for me to go through this film profoundly because I did not understand what was said. <br /> <br /> Cleopatra is a historical icon, the part is very difficult and I found it for a newcomer, Leonor Varela just plays fine. She is very willing but also a very supportive, tender soulmate. Thimothy Dalton as Caesar is perfect and their romance is the most important in the first episode. So it's not really a documentary or a peplum, but a great love story. After the paricid comes a new lover (Marc-Antoine), but the taste is gone: we always remember our first love. So I found the second episode boring and their tragic fate is not being told strongly. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the production is luxurious: the sets are large, tastefully decorated; the Moroccan living location exotic and wardrobe screens excellent. The producers probably have a lot of money, but they do not spend anything on the special effects. They are so bad (blue screens, ships, sphinx) that it's fun. Finally, I would like to hear it in French or English to get a final opinion on these two films.
