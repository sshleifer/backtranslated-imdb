This movie is so so awful that it makes angels lose their wings. Shaq had tried to make other crossover bets, such as his work in Shaq-Fu to NES and his abundance of tireless rap albums, and later the epic service of horrible film making, which is Steel. <br /> <br /> There is not a single good thing to say about this movie. I saw it a lot of times when I was very young, but I must have been an idiot then, because this movie takes everything that is funny about movies and tears it apart. It's fun to mock. I saw it at the Disney Channel a while back and spent a few minutes doing it. Although it is the excitement of mocking, if you are done, you will still be overwhelmed by its horror. <br /> <br /> If you watch it on TV, try it: Consider watching the movie, removing all the scenes where Shaq uses his magic genius powers. If you do, it will be like a movie about a pedophile chasing a child and rapping to seduce him. It's a little fun and disturbing. <br /> <br /> A terrible example of film. Do not watch this movie unless you are trying to spot it.
