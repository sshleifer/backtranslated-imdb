This is the most crappiest movie I have ever seen, but in fairness it is cool and fun. I don't think the filmmakers intended to be your typical Hollywood blockbuster quality. It's just a silly movie about a serial killer being doused in a lot of toxic waste that causes a reaction with him and the snow (as it is in the middle of winter). He then becomes a killing snowman who is enough to make you laugh at himself. This movie is really stupid, but it's fun. The killings are hilarious.I would not advise you to go and buy it (as I did - the cover as well!) But if it happens to be on TV one night and you are up for a laugh then keep it on.
