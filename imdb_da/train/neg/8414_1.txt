Yes. Surely I saw this movie many years ago when it came to Supremes. <br /> <br /> Another recycled story shone Hollywood style, borrowing scripts from better movie movies. <br /> <br /> No original here. <br /> <br /> More make-up, glamor costumes and choreography = more money for the dubious "talented" Beyonce drawing. <br /> <br /> If you Like the throwback style, you should appreciate the actual groups that fought (without digitizing voices and a Hollywood empire). Beyonce's involvement involves this hypocritical garbage.
