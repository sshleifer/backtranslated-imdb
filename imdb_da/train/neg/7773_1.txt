This movie had what looked like a good premise: 9 people face their fears of winning a million dollars. Unfortunately, it did not turn out to be a good movie. There are several scenes that are far too long and really meaningless as the dance scene. A few scenes are just an excuse to point the camera at female body parts. The action is bad, but some of the lines are entertaining in their horrible. What is really strange is that at the end of the movie it becomes like a 5 minute western, and at the end, the wires, as they were more, didn't make sense with the rest of the movie. It seemed like the director just added things because he thought it would look cool while conveniently ignoring the movie's plot until then. It just didn't make much sense. The only scary thing was the old people who danced into the hall, but it didn't even come close to the rest of this mess.
