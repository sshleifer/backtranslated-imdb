Probably a "social commentary" on racism and prison conditions in the south of the 1970s is "nightmare" full of bad southern stereotypes, complete with fake accents. Not only would it be offensive to most American South Island sensitivity, but this silly work comes as a thinly disguised "babe in jail" movie - especially in its unknown original version. Nevertheless, the action is generally above average, and the late Chuck Connors makes it especially good to make the viewers hate him - even though he sees something unpleasant in several scenes. There is also a renewed role for the late Robert Reed, who appears as the lecherous warden, and Tina Louise (formerly Ginger of "Gilligan's Island") made a rather credible sadistic prison guard. My character: D. <br /> <br />
