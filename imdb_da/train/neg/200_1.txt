These reviewers liked this movie surprise me. The reason is a confusion. The signs are wood. Michael Bowen spends most of the film spying on the other characters and misjudging them all. No one has any redeeming quality or point of interest. This is not an edgy work. It's not imaginative. It's not ironic. It's not wise. There is nothing straight forward about this dull work. It's been missed the theater release is not surprising. That "This Network" flies it reduces this place. I definitely recommend returning to the Garden Smart Show at PBS or even a good informative if you encountered this mess on sennat tv. If you encounter it during the daytime, take a long walk. Even if you go in smog, you will feel better if you do not suffer from these shambles. Life is short. This movie is long.
