This movie is spoofed in an episode of the Mystery Science Theater 3000. I think MST3K was best when they cracked this movie. <br /> <br /> Awful plays, bad makeup, bad effects, chick in the skimpy (1960s) underwear. I give it a 2. <br/> <br /> The villain is hard to understand because of makeup. The assistant says things like "not you" that look like NACHOO !! (think sneezing). It's just bad oration. The long eyebrows are fun on one of the characters. <br /> <br /> I still don't know what 'The Projected Man' means to the plot. However, I missed some of the start. <br /> <br /> What about this 10-line minimum on posting?
