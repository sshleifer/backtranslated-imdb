While exploring some caves with his wife, a doctor is bitten by a bat that causes some alarming side effects ... <br/> <br /> Occasionally spooky atmosphere and some decent (but used) makeup effects don't hide this B horror flick from being a sub-parameter of human-being-creation. Bat People aka it lives at night suffers from its pointless story that is awkwardly plotted and deficient in pacing. The reason never seems to go anywhere, and the film never gives an explanation of what is happening or even a satisfactory conclusion for it all. The cast is pretty mediocre in their performances. <br /> <br /> I still give the movie some points for its joking theme song and good movie venues. Bedding Stan Winston's make-up work is also pretty good, but it doesn't get much of a showcase here. A missed opportunity for safe. <br /> <br /> Absolutely one of the lesser creatures out there out there. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of ****
