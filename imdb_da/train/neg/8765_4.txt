I watched this movie with some Indian friends on Christmas Eve. The quick summary of this movie must be avoided. JP Dutta wrote, directed, produced and edited this film and did none of these jobs well. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of Pakistan's attempt in 1999 to capture part of the disputed Kashmir region of India. Probably based on facts, you get a tip from this movie about the difficulty the Indian army had in regaining the area from the Pakistani troops - occupying the high ground. But instead of telling what must have been a convincing and heroic story, this whole movie makes the Indian military look ridiculous and stupid, which I don't know is true. I watched this movie with an almost completely Indian audience who was very patriotic and clearly wanted this movie, but also seemed to laugh at scenes that weren't meant to be fun. Scripture was absolutely scary. It gave the impression that Mr Dutta does not know anything about how an army operates and uses bad war movies for reference. The result is a script that is brainless and repetitive. <br /> <br /> The action of most of the protagonists was not amazing, but considering the script they were given, I find it hard to criticize them too much. As for the supportive cast, all I can say is that I hope they were amateurs. Editing was also pretty poor. It was pretty difficult to keep track of what was happening too much of the time, and music would suddenly end up with scene changes. <br /> <br /> Good things: The cinematography was pretty good, although it was slightly hurt the fact that the movie didn't seem to be color-corrected (the color balance often varied considerably within scenes). Also the few songs that were in the movie were quite fun - for the first half a dozen or so verses at least. Unfortunately, they went much further than they should have. <br /> <br /> And the worst crime of all? This mess is FOUR HOURS LONG. There is probably here that a good editor could almost squeeze a good 1.5 - 2 hour movie out of what was shot. Unfortunately, a good editor does not work on this movie.
