Wow and I thought every Steven Segal movie was bad. Every time I thought the movie couldn't get worse, it turned out to be wrong for me. The story was good, but the actors couldn't hold it. Also, they made a lot of mistakes on how correct archaeological graves are done. For example, you do not handle artifacts until they are categorized and accounted for. The biggest crime in casting was the girl of the archeology. She is a weak actress and I felt that her acting really made the movie less realistic when it was already. The whole concept of knights templars to be underground these years seemed pretty silly to me. I like the idea of ​​how they disappeared and things so it seemed almost depressing. I thought the characters were not well explained. You didn't find much background and it made it harder to relate to them.
