I personally hated this movie because it was predictable, the characters were stereotyped, and the whole idea was a rip off of "The Cutting Edge" and "Cadet Kelly". <br /> <br /> The protagonist is a snotty girl who is shipped to a place where she doesn't belong. The whole place hates her, and to make matters worse, there is a hot guy who doesn't seem to like her (well, duh, the hell school can't stand you). Incredibly, she finds a way to fit in and make everyone like her plus, making the guy fall over her heels in love with her. Then comes the election where she has to choose between figure skating and hockey. She chooses hockey, then she goes to the skating citizens and becomes the Olympic team. No real surprise there. <br /> <br /> This whole movie was so amazingly predictable. You knew what would happen before you even saw it. It was so awful that I almost hit me, and when I finished seeing it, I had a horrible headache and urge to shoot myself to see such filth. Don't look at this unless you are under ten, or really like crappy-tween movies.
