Most of what has been said about the negative aspects of the movie is true. <br /> <br /> BUT .... If I have to sit through a movie, <br /> <br /> The director <br /> <br /> Photographer director <br /> <br /> don't just miss the darn microphone boom popping in and out of the movie for almost every chapter in the movie, how can i enjoy and concentrate on the story and believe in darn things when i recall the technical features of making a movie! !!!!!! <br /> <br /> Wait for the DVD or NOT AWAY
