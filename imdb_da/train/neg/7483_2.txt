One would think (as I did) that with Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese, a movie should at least be decent. These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) have produced some of the funniest works of comedy from time to time. I was grossly mistaken - this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It boggles my mind how a joke after another can be so deeply unfunny. It made me have to see these talented actors performing one of the most positive lame scripts I have had the misfortune to cross. Based solely on the big names, I remained hopeful for a long time through the movie's duration, but it consistently failed to provide any entertainment at all. <br /> <br /> Normally, both with film and in life, I try to stay away from biased comments and broad generalizations. But with this movie it is hard not to lose. I can count on one hand, maybe even two or three fingers, big Hollywood productions that left me more bitter than this. This is easily one of the worst comedies ever made. <br /> <br /> I tried to enjoy this --- I really did. But The Out-of-Towners eventually fails unhappy. If you really want a time-efficient entertainment, just take your money and watch it swirl as you flush it down the toilet. Just don't see this movie.
