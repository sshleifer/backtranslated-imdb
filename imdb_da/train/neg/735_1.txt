The five-year-old Michael sees his mother being killed by his serial father "The Highwayman", who later commits suicide. "20 Years Later" Mike (Gordon Currie, from PUPPET MASTER 4 and 5) grew up inviting seven of his friends to his secluded grandparents home to "master their own fears" on a Halloween night costume party. Morty, a lifelong wooden doll, held in the ceiling of the Indian handyman, is obsessed with the dead father's spirit and kills them with their phobias. Characters are thrown into a window, drowned on a toilet, eaten by rats, blasted, etc. Morty morphs to father and a tree, walks around and does stupid wisecracks. After finding a girl carved and filled in a cardboard box, the characters in the house remain, act cheerfully, crack jokes and sex. <br /> <br /> Morty design is good and Betsy Palmer (Mrs. Voorhees from the original Friday the 13th) is surprisingly nice as grandmother, but this thing is even more meaningless and confusing than the original and is full of fake scares, bad actors, brain-dead characters, repeat flashback footage and annoying distorted camera work. Plus the only two minority characters (the Indian and a half-black girl) are the first to die. AMONG OTHER THINGS!
