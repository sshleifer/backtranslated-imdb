My little sister and I are self-proclaimed horror movie buffs. We've seen almost everything, especially zombie flicks. Now we have seen many good zombie films and many bad ones. This far away is the WORST movie I've ever seen in my entire life. Not only was the act horrible, but the special effects, graphics and ever "zombie" make-up were the worst I've seen. If you can even call it makeup (black eye shadow around the eyes) this is for sure you should never judge a book by that cover. Because the film cover is the only sweet thing about. do yourself a favor and don't see this movie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so proud of this movie, I went so far as to put a note on the inside of the movie before I returned it to movies saying "This movie stinks, don't waste your time, return now" hahahhaa i want don't have anyone else waste a good night on this POS movie! I don't even know how it got the reviews it did, t should be negative
