You must love the Osteykia low cost movies. This comes complete with bad effects, props and bad acting (really bad). Plus, every time I see Mercedes McNab (sister), I still think 'Watch! She's a vamp! "- For those who know Buffy / Angel. <br /> <br /> A perfect example of what happens when a person with bad taste and wants to waste money makes a flick, the little one used of course. I do not know if I feel more sorry about the movie's author or producer who has not got any money back. <br /> <br /> I would say it is good for young children in it's simplicity, but I do not know if I want to subordinate a child to it ... <br /> <br /> umm ... 1/10 because it is the lowest it will go.
