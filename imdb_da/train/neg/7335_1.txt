This may be the worst version of the game I've seen - several times on stage except the movie. <br /> <br /> A very good idea for the setup - the US South can provide a credible backdrop to the extreme reaction of the hero's supposed misdemeanor. <br /> <br /> But the execution! Widdoes is a very mild Beatrice that gives a particularly poor performance. Waterston, a fine actor, is not much better than Benedict. <br /> <br /> The poorest performance is in Don John's role - it makes Keanu Reeves look good. Perhaps the desire to make it a caricature like the villain who attaches the girl to the train path will suit Dogberry's and his men's keystone cup capers - but the actor enables you to crawl. <br /> <br /> Successful setups include the scene where they fool Benedict into thinking Beatrice loves him - if they were competent, it would be great. But the use of the river and the visual humor of Benedict moving closer is well-produced. <br /> <br /> I had to force myself to watch, but it certainly wasn't my attention. <br /> Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> Regarding the latter comments above, I'm almost 40. I've seen Shakespeare stage and screen productions for over 2 decades. May I suggest when trying to defend your friends you talk to the play instead of attacking other reviewers when you are so insufficiently armed in reality. However, I can assume that you are of a sufficient age when you have the distinguished act of bygone days, is more to your liking. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite pairing was Rylance and McTeer on the London stage. Unlike Widdoes, McTeer, a skilled and charismatic practitioner, can act.
