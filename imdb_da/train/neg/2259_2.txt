For the life of me, I can't get why they want to make a movie about the "Jerry Springer Show". It's so incredibly trashy. Unfortunately, some ways are a pleasure. We must all admit that we have seen at least one episode. It is part of our pop culture. I saw it recently in the United States. It's pretty bad. I will admit it. Jerry does a terrible job of what I mean he meant to do. Or something like that. Jamie Pressley is in it. She plays in itself basically. All she needed was her boyfriend boy, Kid Rock. It would have been perfect then. So I would recommend skipping "Ringmaster". Just watch the "Jerry Springer Show". It's more enjoyable than this. <br /> <br /> 2/10
