Watching "Speak Easy" is painful for fans of Buster Keaton. Seeing such a phenomenal writer, actor, cartoon, instructor and stunt man exposed to this humiliating play is like seeing a Picasso used as a drop of cloth, or perhaps more like seeing the finest Camembert counterfeit with whey solids and processed into Cheez. Whiz. <br /> <br /> Keaton is poorly cast as Professor Post, whose overwhelmed vocabulary is the only thing that keeps him from saying, "Tell me about the rabbits George." (Post would have said something like, "Please inform me of the status of the small mammals in the Leporidae family of the order Lagomorpha, kind sir, which I think is primarily addressed with the epithet" George ".) When Keaton created his own characters, They could be situationally clueless, but they weren't stupid, they were fast-paced and mastered their worlds, not with Post who never stopped stumbling and bumbling, and who didn't have more control over his fate than one Thigh rat had the Titanic, and while Keaton's original characters had a charming naivety and innocence, Post came as such a profound sexual retardation that if he was ever physically awakened, he would put an ice pack on the swelling and seek medical attention. There are a few small, redeeming moments that Keaton tries to get rid of the vampire theme Todd or his suggestion of appropriate dress for a Greek dance, but it's just not worth keeping whole movies to watch them. <br / > <br /> If you are a fan of bad movies, you become drunk and see "Speak easily" with friends, a "Mystery Science Theater 3000". But apart from that, stick with the herbs. Let them be 100% of what Buster Keaton is remembered for.
