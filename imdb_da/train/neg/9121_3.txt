This is not an all inclusive horrible comedy, but it is VERY DULL. It has hardly any laughs and it wastes its lavish production values. There is a moment in the end when Fu Manchu offers a dose of his elixir to his "nemesis" and tells him that "You have been my worthy opponent and now we can start again". However, this scene along with Burt Kwouk's funny cameo in the beginning is the only memorable part of the movie. (* 1/2)
