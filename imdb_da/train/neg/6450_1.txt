Now this movie is incredibly horrible. I was sorry for the actors involved in this project because I'm sure they didn't write their lines. Which was sometimes delivered with weak sarcasm, which led me to believe that they didn't take this movie seriously, nor did anyone see this unpleasant off beat monster slasher. While I was looking at this "Creature Unknown", I couldn't help but believe there wasn't much of a budget or a competent writer on the crew. But if you go into seeing this for a laugh, you'll be happy, the movie is shameless to fool yourself because I can't see how anyone could look at this and be proud to pump this directly to DVD -clich√©d, you will be action thriller / horror movie fightfest to light.
