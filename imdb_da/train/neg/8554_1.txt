The film was probably made in 1930 and released in 1931. I would convince myself that talking film pictures had great difficulty making the transition from the quiet era. Nevertheless, this Zane Gray plot seems to be very weak. Gary Cooper was probably just learning to act. The result is something that would not be acceptable in today's standards. For 1931, maybe. For 2004, not acceptable. Some of the actors did well. Unfortunately, the Indians always get the short end in these early Western countries. They lived in the country long before the white man came, but according to the rugged story they did not have the right to defend themselves.
