I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed with this horror movie. I didn't get scared yet again while you watched it. It's also not very exciting .... I could guess the end half way through the movie ... So ... what's left? <br /> <br /> "The Ring" is a sad scary movie. .. I want other movies to stop copying from it (eg the brand: long hair). Give me some originality. <br /> <br /> Wouldn't recommend this movie.
