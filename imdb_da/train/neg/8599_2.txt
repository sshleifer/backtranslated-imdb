is seismic activity with small or insignificant results on the surface. So, in that respect, IMDb's average voting result is spot on. <br /> <br /> A Spanish film made in the United States with third or fourth movement actors giving a kind of "Falcon Crest" dimension to the whole thing is a wonderful way to waste your time and waste money from them who supported the project financially. <br /> <br /> The snails involved are originals from Asturias, Northern Spain, but since they were not allowed in the United States, plastic had to be made. Chopping them in a salad used to make dinner meal contrasts quite strangely with Parisienne music as well as a pretty tattooed selection of other American forgotten hits (or misses if you have no idea who was responsible for composing it). The actors involved were also a pretty tattooed event that was only suitable for a low-budget movie that could be categorized as awful, horrible, horrible or just plain awful. The result is therefore negligible on the surface, undiscovered underground and about as attractive as chapter 17,000 of Coronation Street or the latest news from Baghdad.
