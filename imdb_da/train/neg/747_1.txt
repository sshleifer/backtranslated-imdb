Finally, I thought someone would do justice to H.G. Wells classic, not another version set in the wrong location or era, but one based on the book. Well, it certainly follows the book quite closely, and that's the only plus to this mess. <br /> <br /> It is 180 min (yes 3 hours) long, the book is only about 150 pages. <br /> <br /> If Timothy Hines had a nerve to come here and say "if you can do something better ..." I would say "yes I could" and I have never used a camcorder or been in any kind or drama school in my life. <br /> <br /> I paid good money to get this shit over to the UK from the US, not making the same mistake as me.
