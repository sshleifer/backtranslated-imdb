Remember when Harrison Ford was the biggest star in Hollywood because he made amazing movies? These days feel like an increasingly distant memory. <br /> <br /> While "Hollywood Homicide" is in no way terrible, it is a routine and surprisingly boring buddy movie. It's a not-so-fun comedy and an action movie that's not very exciting. An abundance of subplots cannot mask the weakest of the central storyline. Ford seems at least to enjoy himself more than his last few projects, and he is able to carry the film most of the time. Hartnett is appropriate, but he and Ford are not exactly Newman and Redford in terms of chemistry. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Hollywood Homicide" is a reasonably entertaining diversion but just barely. Take out Ford and it's not even that.
