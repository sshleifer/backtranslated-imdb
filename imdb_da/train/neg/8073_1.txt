If the author / instructor reads this (and I imagine you're since you were out of work) then I have to tell you - I've seen some bad movies in my time, but this makes the distinction of having the worst premise I have ever heard. <br /> <br /> SPOILS - Nothing happens! <br /> <br /> A total waste of time. I laughed out loud at the end. <br /> <br /> SIDE NOTE - (If the whole movie was her in a coma, then the scene where she sleeps with that guy means someone raped her while she was knocked out?) <br /> <br /> Full nonsense.
