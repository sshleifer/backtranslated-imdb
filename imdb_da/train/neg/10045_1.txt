The whole world said the movie Tashan would be a great movie with great pleasure, but that is not the case. Vijay Krishna Acharya made a serious mistake as an actress Kareena Kapoor. She was unbearable throughout the film. Her tom-boy look doesn't go very well. Even the film is the story of the movie not at all sensible. Everyone said that Quetin Taratino in India is Vijay, but it is not Quetin at all. Talent Anil Kapoor was involved in this silly movie. Anil is a great actor and this movie is not. Akshay Kumar has also been the victim of this movie as everything is Saif. Style and Phoormola are not really good in this movie, I was disappointed
