This may be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't care what the critics say it's bad. I think the problem is with the customer's novel. It is not that it is infamous; It's just like 99% of its work, it's pretentious and overdone. He seems to be enchanted by himself, his characters come out as umbilical stirring, and his novels as a whole are misogynistic. I've read many of his works (even his socialist realistic poetry. It was really terrible) - I just don't understand what the fuss is about. Characteristics (like self-absorption) in his novels make disturbing reading. In a movie, all the things I didn't like about Kundera were enlarged. Maybe I just missed something, but I don't think so. On a page note I can't believe this is a Criterion Collection DVD. No way is this movie that is crucial.
