Carnosaur 3: Primal Species (1996) D: Jonathan Winfrey. Scott Valentine, Janet Gunn, Rick Dean, Anthony Peck, Rodger Halston, Terri J. Vaughn, Billy Burnette. Why even interfere with reviewing this movie? Another stupid dinosaur movie in which the top secret military guys discover the lethal (and very fake looks) prehistoric monsters that run around and kill humans in good ways. The original was bad enough, the successor was even worse. This falls somewhere, but not related to any of the previous CARNOSAUR movies. RATING: 2 out of 10. Rated graph for graphic violence and making, pigs pictures and profanity.
