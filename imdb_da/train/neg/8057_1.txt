What's wrong with this movie? Many many things. The editing tries too hard to look good, and does nothing but confuse the viewer while getting a strong headache. The reason is muddled and of course extended from what started out as a map (story or movie). The plot provides only less than ten minutes of good history, and it's just stretched out painfully until it reached minimum length for a feature film. We all know what happens to things when we stretch them, right? Exactly. They become thinner. In the end, the plot is as paper-thin as you might even miss if you are not aware, which is hard to do when you watch this movie. The action is not even impressive. The characters are poorly written and boring, uninteresting. One of the worst things wrong with this movie is apparently that the person responsible for the score / soundtrack had no idea what the movie was or what it was about (not that I blame him I couldn't figure it out either). As a result, half of the music in the movie does not fit the scenes at all. What about all the sexual undertones between Eliza Dushku and the protagonist? Of course this was to attract young men, but it was just so cheaply done. And does the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the movie? At every conceivable level? Not at all? The two creepy guys didn't seem to have anything to do with the movie at all, they were just there to get some hunting scenes. I doubt anyone would really enjoy a movie so poorly composed and such a shameless and horrible Hollywood-like attempt at some interesting idea. But I go down. I recommend it to teens with low attention ranges who don't mind a really bad horror as long as there is some gender and do it (though it can only be true for Killer Cut as I saw). 1.10
