I consider Stuart Bliss the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The action was horrible and plagiarized ridiculously. I get the fact that the protagonist's wife leaves him triggered a mental breakdown, but it became so stupid and boring, after a while I could have cared less about any of the characters. <br /> <br /> The movie continued over and over the same ideas without anything new or surprising to add to the plot. The whole thing with the Geiger counter became too much after a while after Stuart opened his wall to see what was behind it after the counter showed something that was. <br /> <br /> Then there were the repeated scenes of the flyer and the confusing ones he met. <br /> <br /> I should have guessed that this movie was a flop when I didn't recognize any of the actors. Do yourself a favor when this movie comes up, read a book! You get better.
