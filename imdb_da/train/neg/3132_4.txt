I didn't see such a fantastic rating on IMDb, but I went to see it anyway, because I'm a big fan of Bible-read material. The first thing that bothered me was a bit too much Indiana Jones wannabe movie, but it also looked like Casper Van Dien didn't watch those Jones movies (but he was supposed to). I think he was trying his best, but the manuscript was just stunned. Music also tried to be good Jones style. Good work, but for such movies it seemed like too much work, just as the video part does not deserve all the good music. Robert Wagner gave his best acting, he did a good job, but somehow the script broke everything down. "Witnesses" are old school, somewhere 20 years old; they only brought cynical smiles to my face. There are some really bad camera angels, SFX looks like homemade and unrealistic. Kevin VanHook probably had a good idea of ​​the story (in my opinion, but I love such stories), but things didn't work in the end. Maybe he should put it on a paper as it was still fresh in the head. When I (for the first few minutes) saw that the film was to be one of the 'low budget films', I hoped I would at least hear a good story, but sometimes the movies just disappoint.
