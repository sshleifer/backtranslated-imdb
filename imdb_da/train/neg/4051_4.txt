Lindsay Anderson was very much a European film producer, while David Lean, Ridley Scott, and Alan Parker are making spectacular visual reach movies. Anderson's film is more about social comments and subtitles, so much so that the message often ends up taking over the entire movie, whose primary function is to entertain the audience. <br /> <br /> What you think of IF comes down to what you think of British filmmakers. I am very much of the opinion that the cinema must be a universal medium (the best Brit movie makes are those trying to imitate Hollywood in my opinion) if you want to send a message, try the pony express and I find the movie dated, pretentious and also set in the 1960s. 1968 was the summer of love and the year of student rebellion in France. You can only imagine that every French leftist worships this movie, especially climax. French New Wave filmmakers will also admire the abstract surrealism of some scenes, but an ordinary international will not like it, and many will not like it intensely
