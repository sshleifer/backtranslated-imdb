Pretty awful but watchable and entertaining. It's the same old story (if you've lived through the 80s). Vietnam vets fight together as friends against injustice back in the states. A-Team meets Death Wish, my favorite! <br /> <br /> Time passes, soldiers go home, and years later a friend is in trouble. No, wait - in fact, the vein is dead, and it's his father who's in trouble. Our first hero, Joey, is killed by an extremely horrific (super-puny) carpenter as he tries to defend his father's small shop from the local "gangster" despite the fact that the wheelchair is tied to the war. Desperate for help, Sarge's father, head of Joey's old unit from Vietnam, tells us when Sarge turns to the funeral. <br /> <br /> Well, the creaking wheel gets the grease and the old gang saddles up the city. You can basically imagine most of the rest of the movie. The only thing that drove me is that Sarge keeps her men on planning and about how they are good at what they do when they plan ahead. But Joey would not have been put in a wheelchair by a shot in Vietnam initially, if the unit had not shaken around! So when things go really well in the city when they beat the gangs, they do it again. At all, they do not at all surpass their plan and try to spike the band without everyone being present. PhH !!!! I raise my hands in disgust. Stupidity! <br /> <br /> There is also a suspicious moment when all current members of the unit try to test the heroines as they slip away from the gang to make sure it is right. Each one of them. Hmm .... What do you do? Keep looking, I think. The movie is not too horrible to see, but it is a tease. There are all these climatic moments when nothing really happens. The most dramatic thing that happens is those at the start of the movie - the explosives in Vietnam, Joey's death toll and the gang brutally kicking an innocent teddy bear aside (poor Teddy!). <br /> <br /> I guess my main beef with this movie is that I feel let down by it. Even the confusing subplots with "mystery helpers" and their bizarre transverse motifs were not enough to save it at the end. But one day maybe everyone will come right and they will make a successor. Ha ha ha ha !!!
