This may have been done for hell of it, but it was probably the worst movie I've seen this year, the best thing about the whole DVD would be the case !!! I am surprised that people took the time to do something so rubbish and still spend money on it too, I'm glad I only rented. I suppose the real fans of this movie probably should be sadistic and gothic to worry about it without taking CGI or other effects in that regard. I hope Alex Chandon taught a lesson on lighting and SFX to make a better movie in the future, that is, if he is still in work. Notes to buyers this is extremely disappointing, DO NOT BUY IT !!!!!
