I saw the MST3K version of "Deathstalker III" and loved the movie so much - even "outdated" - that I decided to watch the whole series of "Deathstalker" movies. I bought myself and II and sat down for a laugh. Nothing about "Deathstalker I" was fun at any level, and when the credits rolled, I was embarrassed and sorry that I had bought it! Too much cruelty and nudity. I think either "DS 3" was a much cleaner production or MST3K really edited a lot because I expected something similar, ie. stupid and carefree and simple. I was mistaken. Even at $ 6.99 it seemed a waste of money. I didn't even open "DS 2" when I want to return it tomorrow. Now I probably just want to throw this DVD, because I can't return it and nobody wants it - including myself! So really, don't bother with this one. Even nudity (lots of it, btw) is uninspiring and icky.
