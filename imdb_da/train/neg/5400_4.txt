This is just short of a full blown gore party based on a Stephen King story. Two tabloid reporters, one spicy (Miguel Ferrer) and one not so done (Julie Entwisle), begin to believe that a serial killer (Michael H. Moss) can actually be a vampire. Stranger than odd, this modern blood sucker is not waving its way naturally, but by a black Cessna he seeks his victims. Gore is actually cruel as the film approaches its stupid final. Remember that Mr. King had nothing to do with this movie. I admit it is a little scary in the bad hours of the night.
