I think they really let the quality of DVD production get away from them. I rented this DVD from 2 movie stores and the second time I finally got it to play on the 3rd DVD player I tried. <br /> <br /> Anyone else has this problem? It's really hard to give the movie an unlimited review after going through such a hassle to play it. For one, I have never seen a Finnish horror movie before, so I was so bummed that the film was made in English. Also, since it has never been clear what is wrong with Sarah, she came just as retarded and therefore I really hoped that someone would shoot her face and make all the terrible happenings go away.
