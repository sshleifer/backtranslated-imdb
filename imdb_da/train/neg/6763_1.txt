God, what a terrible thing! Oliver Stone probably wanted to experiment or something (see the horrible use of music and pictures here), but what for real? The whole thing behind "Natural born killers" seems to be a "smart" look at how media can turn into complete waste, but unfortunately the film becomes the trash itself. Please Mr. Stone, the next time you want to criticize the fascism of TV shows using violence to get high prices, avoid doing the same with your movie! Michael Haneke said quite wisely about this movie that it condemned media fascism with fascist cinematic ways. How true ... Only he forgot to tell us about the massive headache you get after sitting through this overload!
