I found this movie embarrassing to see. I felt it was shooting the story down my throat, as if I couldn't pick up the subtleties I needed for a voice to spell them all out for me all the time. <br /> <br /> Having a father who is still an alcoholic I didn't really feel it was a movie about alcoholism as such. Alcoholics, true alcoholics are very lonely people inside, in my opinion of course. They find it hard to communicate, something that the protagonist had no problem with, unless he had a problem saying that I love you at some point - which was a bit of a weak effort to establish his cold character. He was constantly surrounded by people too! <br /> <br /> I felt cheated that we were by no means entirely alone with the character to really get a sense of his inner loneliness and turmoil. I could not connect with the character and felt no link at all in view of my father. I felt nothing at all when it was finished, just relief, it was over. <br /> <br /> Kevin McKidd is an okay actor, but not a tough guy! The orange thing of the movement was as subtle as a brick. McKidd was too old for the teenager, they should have been given three different characters or avoided the teenage phase and concentrated more on the adult McKidd. <br /> <br /> On a good note I felt that the little boy actress was really good at the start of the film !!
