... you'd rather not see this movie. They completely ruined the premise of the show. In the film, the duke's boys are idiots, Daisy is trampy, Roscoe is vicious, Boss Hogg is capable, Uncle Jessie is criminal ... only Cooter and Flash are true to the original characters. At least Enos is a bit dense. <br /> <br /> At one point, they open the doors to enter General Lee - nuff. <br /> <br /> The original show may not have been amazing TV, but it was entertaining and the characters were sensible. This movie is like Dumb & Dumber meets Simple Life.
