This movie could have been so much better, especially considering the talent. Larenz Tate's portrayal of Frankie Lymon was not good, especially in musical performances. He does not lips well, and his stage manuals are Larenz Tate when he should have been Frankie Lymon. The depiction of the women as a bunch of gold diggers has Hollywood written over it. The forces that naturally push it, but that only made the characters more unrealistic. The positives of the film were Miguel Nunez's depiction of Little Richard and Little Richard's como. Lela Rochon is eye candy, as usual, even in a conservative role. It's too bad that Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox's talents were wasted. The whole Frankie Lymon saga was fascinating in real life. Too bad this movie was a wasted opportunity.
