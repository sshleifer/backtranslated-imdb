Director Fred Schepisi (Roxanne) directs this benevolent but inferior comedy about Albert Einstein (Matthau), who tries to hang his scientific niece (Ryan) up with regular guy Tim Robbins to make her relax and enjoy life in 1950 ' s. To get Ryan to like Robbins, Einstein tries to make Robbins look like a brilliant scientist. The idea is sweet, but the film falls flat with corny situations and stupid dialogue. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, and the amazing support shot are doing their best to keep this stupid comedy afloat but can't save the movie. It is unfortunate that so much talent went into producing such a sharp film. I would not recommend anyone unless they are huge fans of Meg Ryan.
