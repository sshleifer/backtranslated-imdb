The perfect murder falls when a wife (played by Mary Ellen Trainor, once wife of director Robert Zemeckis, who hell this episode) kills her husband with a poker, has the accident of receiving a visitor she is moving The body outside. An escaped insane maniac dressed in a Santa Claus dress (played by an incredibly horrible Larry Drake). She is moving for her life while trying to find a way to save her husband's body. She decides to use an ax as she calls down the Santa killer who misses more chances to cut off the woman's head to hit the killer for her husband's murder. Santa's killer locks her in a closet and pursues the woman's daughter as she desperately tries to free herself to save the baby. <br /> <br /> This episode of TALES FROM CRYPT reuses only tired material involving the old "Santa kills" theme, while adding the often used (add nauseum) women murder - her husband for a man - she has become wild with routine. It is mainly Trainor who tries to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body she kills while keeping a safe distance from a madman. There is nothing refreshing or new about this plot, which largely goes through the movements. Not one of the highlights of the show.
