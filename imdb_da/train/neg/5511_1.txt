I have to agree with the very first comment: this movie sugar very, very hard. Despite having a very large B-list cast, the cover of this movie (for those who don't see it at Comedy Central during an everyday life that is probably the only exposure this movie will ever get) is set blamed on Dangerfield, but in reality it is only a paycheck for all have been comedians from the 80s. Randy Quaid? Check. Ed Begley, Jr. Check. Lisa Simpson's voice? She can now say that Maximum Overdrive was not her only terrible flick: double check. And so many, many others. The scary thing about this flick is that it was so lazy written with already described jokes. Nothing about this movie outside its existence is fun. You are better to see paint dry. This is certainly direct to the video scraping-bottom of the barrel stuff that still believes in the old video adage: Throw an old-fashioned star on the front and you get some money back from the rent. Considering the days when video rental is changing, consider this from the last examples of waste disposal. <br /> <br /> The only use this movie has if you have trouble falling asleep. It'll get you there.
