CQ is incredibly slow, and I am a David Mamet fan. The film follows around a young filmmaker who makes a very Barbarella-esque movie. Then the movie started to lose me. Deep and deep? Not really. The movie "Dragonfly" is made in CQ has the problem of having no end. This is very parallel to CQ, which also lacks an end (in my opinion). <br /> <br /> I was fortunate enough to capture this movie at the SxSW film festival. I had quite high expectations as I was just watching Y Tu Mama Tambien and several other great movies. I was also looking forward to Jason Schwartzman's performance. But it wasn't an easy movie to get into. If you're not in the 60's sci-fi or slow movie that doesn't go, skip it. <br /> <br /> CQ feels like a student movie. If you want a new sci-fi-esque indie movie hire Donnie Darko, it won't put you to sleep.
