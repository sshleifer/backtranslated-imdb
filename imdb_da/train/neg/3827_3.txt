Stereotype, derivative, unoriginal and boring western. The two popular stars (Charlton Heston and James Coburn) give both performances far from their best and rightly so; they both have superficial roles and traits that are mainly indicated by dialogue. Heston is a sheriff who "liked the world better than it used to be before" and Coburn is a crime that "owes something to the man who locked him up and has to pay his debt". In addition, Heston is so old that he has trouble driving on a horse, and Coburn is average and tough, but not so cold-blooded as a murderer like some of the smaller villains. Apparently, the filmmakers could not come up with yet another original idea of ​​how to make this film something prominent. (* 1/2)
