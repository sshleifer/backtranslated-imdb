In 1972, after his wife left her own path, Elvis Presley began dancing Linda Thompson. Miss Thompson, a good-humored, long-haired, lovely statue-like beauty queen, is mapped out to fill a void in Elvis's life. When Elvis's divorce finally came, Linda was already in place as the legendary artist's live-in girlfriend and travel company until 1976. <br /> <br /> This is a peek at their love affair and companion. Linda hangs wholeheartedly on her lover's needs and desires. And even put up with his swallowed medicine at the handful and introduce her to her own love affair with valium. At times, this film is hard and dark of the heart; a very uninteresting look at 'King' and his queen. <br /> <br /> Don Johnson is horrible as Elvis. Over action to hilt is not attractive. Stephanie Zimbalist lacks the class of Linda, but does the job quite well. Supporting casts include: John Crawford, Ruta Lee, and Rick Lenz. Seeing this twice is more than enough for me, but don't let this review stop you from checking it out. For most Elvis fans that I have given, this is not a favored presentation.
