Oh man. If you want to give your internal Crow T. Robot a real workout, it's the movie that comes into the ol 'VCR. The potential for cut-up lines in this film is just endless. <br /> <br /> (Minor spoilers in front. Hello, you really don't care if a movie of this quality is "spoiled?") Traci is a girl with a problem. Psychology has developed names for it when a child develops a sexual infatuation on opposite sex parent. But this girl seems to have one for her same sex one, and I don't think that is an expression of that. It may be because her mother Dana is played by Rosanna Arquette, whose sweet overbite, fresh-flowered sexuality and delicious figure make me forgive her any series of bad movies or unsympathetic characters. Here, Dana is not only clueless to her daughter's behavior; She seems to be competing for the gold medal in the Olympic compliant mother competition. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Dana misses Traci's murderous stripe because truth is told, Traci seems to have a criminal skill in a hamster. It is only because the manuscript dictates so that she manages to withdraw from any form of body counting. A particularly fun note in this movie is the character Carmen, a Mexican girl described by Dana as about as long as she is like one of the family even though she dresses in what the director thought would say, "I just fell from the tomato cart. from Guadalajara. " Carmen is so clever for Traci's scheming, she may also have a sign saying, "Hi, I'm the next victim!" Certainly, Traci confronts Carmen, as Carmen makes her way back from Mass, and barks her with one of the slightly angled wrenches that car makers put next to your spare parts as a bad joke. I am more suspicious than in reality that these things are as useless as a murder weapon as they are to change a tire. <br /> <br /> In another order, Arquette wears a thin dress for a vineyard, under cloudy skies and speaks to the owner. Cut to her in another flimsy dress under sunny skies and talk to the owner's brother. Then cut to her wearing the first dress, in the first location, under cloudy sky - but it must later. You get the picture. We speak really bad conducting. <br /> <br /> Regarding skin, don't expect much, though Traci owns a nice pair of bikinis. <br /> <br /> For those looking for a bin, 8. For anyone else, 1/2.
