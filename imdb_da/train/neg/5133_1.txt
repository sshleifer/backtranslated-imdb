I had no real expectations of going into this movie and I'm happy. Although I was expecting it to be bad, I would have been disappointed. <br /> <br /> Where to start? First, I think that 15% of the film consisted of stock footage of stationary scarecrows in a dark jungle field. I understand it. There are scarecrows. I think the title "Scarecrows" was sufficient. <br /> <br /> Second, it's not a terrible thing ever explained about scarecrow and paranormal events. There are too many times when I was left WTF? <br /> <br /> Third, the film takes seriously. I am all for a B movie with pants of blood, screaming women and sensual violence that is the result of a simple psychopath or old curse. But these movies often know they are B-movies and even flaunt it as Dead Snow (hilarious Scandanavian zombie flick) or Evil Dead 2. But this movie seems ignorant of its crapdom. Finally, there should have been more blood and / or nudity. Yes, I said so. If you want a crap horror movie, do the killing. And if you are going to have a warm and a semi-hot girl, one of them should show some side scoop at a minimum. So, as the summary says, skip "Scarecrows" and just poke yourself in the eye. You want to thank me.
