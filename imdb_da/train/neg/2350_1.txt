This show was ridiculously bad. The script sucked, the dialogue sucked. The guy who played Craig couldn't get out of a paper bag. Being on Thursday night, it was absolutely fantastic to see with some beers. Cold music, bad acting, bad writing, all came together for my entertainment. It was a drama / accidental comedy. I don't care what happened to any of the characters, they were all boring and stupid. The first five episodes were worst, as they could not reveal who the victim was, they had to write the dialogue about it, which was terrible. I mean, eulogy at the funeral was ridiculous. In fact, all the scenes that happened in the present were horrible. <br /> <br /> Let's go through. Everything that is happening at the moment is sucked. Flashback scenes, only writing, dialogue and Craig's performance sucked. However, the music prevails.
