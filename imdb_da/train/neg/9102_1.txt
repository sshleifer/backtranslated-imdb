I was willing to go with the original _Cruel Intentions._ It coincided with the plot and was true to the characters in one of my favorite stories. However, in my opinion, this film was a crummy rehash with virtually the same story line and no clear character choices. I was not honest care what happened to any of them. The strongest part of the original story (Les Liasons, not CI) is the signs and their interactions, not the events themselves. I wasn't ready until I read the IMDB that this movie was supposed to be a prequel, especially since the title contains a number "2", I expected a sequel, but then decided it should be a companion. All in all, I must say that this film is read, for me at least as a soft porn version of Les Liasons. I was not impressed.
