I just finished a marathon in this series and it became painful to see it progressing. From the fictionalization of the historical elements, to O'Herlihy's horrible accent in later episodes, the show goes off the longer it goes. If you are looking for some low-quality production generated WW2 fluff, then I can recommend Season 1, but avoid anything after it degenerates to be a step from a soap opera with ever-worse history lines and sensitivity. <br /> The old B&W movie is by far the best of any kind of entertainment with the Colditz name attached to it, and even that is not what one could hope for.
