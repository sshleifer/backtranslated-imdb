This movie recently appeared on local television here in South Africa recently, and I thought I would warn myself to enjoy watching B grade bad movies (as I do) that this is not even fun. The reason concerns a couple visiting a house in the country. Some strangers appear and .... The problem is that most of the film, which of course was shot in the early seventies, consists of extreme wide shootings of people going in real time and very slowly from A to B. This does the movie boring in the extreme and the expected blood and making payoff never happens. I'm really curious - how many people have actually seen this from start to finish?
