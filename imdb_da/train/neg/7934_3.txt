A family traveling to their daughter's softball league decides to take the 'scenic route' and end up in the middle of the sky. The father is an avid photographer, and when he hears about an old abandoned side arrangement in town, he decides to take another detour to take some pictures. <br /> <br /> Of course, the side view is filled with inbred freaks who instantly kidnap the women and leave the young son and father to cope. <br /> <br /> The only cool thing about this movie is how the family actually fight back against their inbred hunters. Apart from that, there's nothing worth knowing about the movie.
