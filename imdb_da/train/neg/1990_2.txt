This could be a strong candidate for "The Worst Flick Ever". Perhaps without the presence of John Hurt, it could be tolerated as a kid movie. However, TRAGEDY of all this endeavor is that John Hurt, one of the screen's greatest actors, diminishes himself in this .... I gave it two points just because Mr. Hurt turned out ... I take away 8 points because he didn't run fast from it. As for the rest of the cast, they are simply awful. Janine Turner, as beautiful as she may be, cannot act to save her soul. And the main actor is for all intentions horrible. If you can spare yourself this embarrassment then do it. It's so bad it almost hears.
