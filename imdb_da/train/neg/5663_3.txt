This is for the Zatoichi films, as the "Star Trek" films were "Star Trek" - except that in this case each of the originals was more entertaining and interesting than this great, shiny re-entry and also made better if fabric is more important than surface. If I had never seen them, I would have thought this beautiful, but empty; Since I had, I thought its style was inappropriate and its content was inadequate. The idea of ​​reviving the character of a larger slicker production must have sounded good, but nothing in it except the hope of making money; It's just a show that mostly fails to capture the atmosphere of the character's world and completely fails to take the sign anywhere he hasn't already been (also the actor wasn't the best). I was hoping to see Ichi at a late stage in life, in a story that would look him gracefully and draw a conclusion from his overall experience; This just enjoys bits and pieces from the other movies, seasoned with more sex and sfx violence. Not the same experience at all.
