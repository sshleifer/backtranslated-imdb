The one who wrote "Redline" as a great car movie must be paid by Daniel Sadek to promote this ultra crappy fiery, steaming pile of amateur kits. Easily the worst car movie or any movie ever made. This makes Showgirls Citizen Kane. Take all the cheesy cliches out of an 80's action television series, put some real crappy special effects and lame characters irrelevant, and you have vivid evidence that Daniel Sadek shouldn't write screenshots and produce movies, but should remain in the real estate industry . <br /> <br /> This is such a lame movie with such a paralyzing plot and the most constructive action sequences ever. What offends me is not that the decision-makers in this movie are idiots, but they consider the film to be idiots enough to fall for this crap.
