This 30-minute documentary Bu単uel made in the early 1930s about one of Spain's poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. First, we must admit that 70 years later, Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can bring its own problems such as excessive individualism and consumerism, but all in all, wealth is far better than the extreme poverty portrayed here). And if poverty was returned in Spain, it was not quite the kind of socialism that Bu単uel preferred, but with Western European style capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this: In a scene, the narrator tells it in school, the children learn the value of Pi. Teaching mathematics to poor people, horror! Bu単uel shortsightedness is to the greatest extent here, not aware that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology, which helps the poor solve their situation. What does he suggest? That children are taught exactly what in school? Doesn't Bu単uel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor compared to other people?
