I'm totally shocked to see that the average for this movie is 5.2 / 10. What affects me is definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I still wonder why I saw it to the end. First of all, the plot is completely hopeless, and the actor is really awful. I think any completely unknown actress would have been better off than Susan Lucci; regarding Mr. Kamar Del's Reyes, I think it would have been a better choice for him to remain in his "Dollar Valley". In summary, it's a total waste of time (and I'm trying to stay polite ...) to avoid at all costs. My rating is 1, and I still think it's well paid, but since we can't give an O ....
