I watched this movie a few months ago in the city, which appeared as Greendale in the movie, which is the only reason I went to see it. Another local who was there just forwarded me a mail message about a repetition that showed because the first one was sold out and people were turned away. His editorial comment in his submission is a good summary: <br /> <br /> "Yuk." <br /> <br /> Unless you are a Neil Young fan or live in / near "Greendale" (if you know the real name), skip this movie. It is mostly an ego tour for the film maker. It has no traceable plot, the music is just ok, and too much of the lyrics are incomprehensible, making it impossible to follow which small strips of plot may be. <br /> <br /> I don't need to put in a spoiler warning because there are no surprises to give away. <br /> <br /> I would give this a 1.5 / 10 but it's just for the entertainment value to see the sites made for a movie. It was not worth the $ 6. I could rent a camcorder and drive around "Greendale" and make a better movie myself. <br /> <br /> To see a * good * environmental movie without plot, rent Koyaanisqatsi.
