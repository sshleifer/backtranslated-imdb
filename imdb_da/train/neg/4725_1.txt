A great opportunity and Indy director to make an interesting movie about a rock musician on the brink of the star. It could have been a decent movie if it would have treated John Livien's traumatic past and how it tortures his psyche. Instead, it's a ridiculous attempt to identify John Livien's life with John Lennon. John Livien's suicide rod was John Lennon, and she wanted him to be as powerful and productive as Lennon himself. Instead of focusing on John Lennon's musical brilliance and his wonderful ability to carry oneself to others to learn about their own lives, Lennon's legacy proved to be a confused, drug-abused soul that should instead look like a God man. I am a great John Lennon fan and this movie reminded me of another "crazy" person obsessed with Lennon, Lennon's killer, Mark David Chapman. Lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by another who had an identity crisis with Lennon. Should we be reminded of it? John Lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty, and I was dismissed to see another disturbed person, the protagonist of this movie, watched by Lennon, and not show his beautiful contribution to the world. Yoko Ono reverently named John Lennon's memory by making the memorial in Central Park to give his fans a chance to pay their respect and remember John. Instead, the director of this movie chose to use this site to make the killer commit suicide. I found this so disturbing and disrespectful of Lennon's memory. He was a peacemaker who died a brutal meaningless death, and seeing such violence near this site felt like a revision of a terrible wound to any Lennon fan. It completely destroyed the movie for me. It could have been a decent movie, but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. Let John Lennon and his family rest in peace and not be reminded of his evil murders by this irresponsible movie.
