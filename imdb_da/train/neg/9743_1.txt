With that line, a stupid, dull English sci movie starts. The big Vorelli from the movie "Devil Doll" builds only a teleportation machine to get its funding cut off by Blanchard, a bearded man who has a thing for loops and men with big eyebrows. When his attempt fails, the good doctor learns that Lembach, the man who controls all the grants in the world, will stay in London for a few days. He tries to project himself into Blanchardhus with the help of his pleasant lab assistant, Sheila. Needless to say something goes wrong and he wins up like a rat. The rest of the film is devoted to the good orange-haired doctor who walks around London shocking people with his mutated hand and wearing a diaper on his face. There are some more killings, some modest paperwork, and finally the doctor disappears where the wheel is facing doctors. Fortunately, no one decided to make a sequel.
