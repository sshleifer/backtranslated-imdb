"Dahmer" is an interesting movie, although I wouldn't use "horror" or "thriller", describe it. It is more a minor character study that seems oddly sympathetic to the killer. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Renner portrays serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who drove, murdered and smuggled his male victims. The film focuses on the relationship between Dahmer and "Rodney", well played by Artel Kay√†ru. <br /> <br /> Rodney is almost the more interesting character: Enamored by Dahmer and has once failed an attack, he returns to Dahmer for sex and survives another attack. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is uneven, because it is little to portray Dahmer's formative years, how events may have created the human monster we see on the screen and give no insight into Dahmer's belief that he could create sexual zombies of its victims. <br /> <br /> Roles play well, but the story is thin.
