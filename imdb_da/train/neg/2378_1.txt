Why would any legitimate actor who read the script participate in this piece of shit? My god is actually embarrassing to see it for yourself. I can't imagine the shame that these people have to feel part of it. There are also apparently some controversies about whether the Phoenix River had a cameo in the movie. He was uncredited, but his list of roles here (IMDB) gives him credit. BTW ... Rain is his sister for those who have asked before. This movie is proof that no matter how many great "names" you have. The wound's ears do not make soap. I love Lorraine Bracco, but it was just sad, sad, sad ... Maybe someday somebody can explain to me the reason for this kind of movie. It has no endearing, entertaining or even comical features compared to it's bad everything else.
