The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers came out in 1993, allegedly based on the Japanese sentai TV show that started back in the 1970s. Now, as a fan of Japanese action movies and series, you think I would get a kick out of this show. You couldn't be more wrong. What worked in the Japanese version has become a complete abomination of television with mighty morphine power rangers. <br /> <br /> MMPR is based on five teens who have the power to become costumed superheroes with robotic dinosaurs that form an even bigger robot. <br /> <br /> Now, this premise is more distant and more ridiculous than anything in both Transformers movies, but it's often overlooked. This was followed by two really bad ones, and I mean, really bad movie knock offs, and the actors in this series completely disappeared from the stage. <br /> <br /> If you choose, try to see Japan's Zyuranger series instead. <br /> <br /> What about the horrible long 1990s haircuts and all the earrings on the boys? It makes them all look feminine!
