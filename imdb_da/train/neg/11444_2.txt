SNL is pretty funny, but people who say this is like watching a short shit on SNL is a little silly mind. It's nothing like SNL, it's just a stupid piece of shit. <br /> <br /> Andy Samberg tries to act as Jon Heder, but fails. Although Jon Heder is only fun in Napoleon Dynamite, Andy tries his hardest, and people think he's fun. <br /> <br /> Only funny people in the movie were Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The only part that was decent fun with Andy was the pool part. They could have made the "quiet place" much better if they didn't do the falling scene 3 freaking minutes. <Br /> <br /> The part where he pronounces his H is more retarded. They try to go with it for too long and half of the time looks like Andy laughs while acting ... he's a horrible actor and doesn't deserve to be in a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a joke and is for the simple minded people with the brain in a 10 year old comedy level. It's about half of the US.
