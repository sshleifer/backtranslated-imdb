Sometimes you have to watch a bad movie just to appreciate the good ones. Well, that's my opinion anyway. This will always be in the bad movie category, simply because anything but Shu Qi's performance was terrible. Martial Angel tells of Cat (Shu Qi), a professional thief turned right after leaving his lover, Chi Lam (Julian Cheung), two years earlier. But her past is returning to haunt her when Chi Lam is kidnapped for the solution of security software belonging to Cat's work. To save him, she calls on her old friends from her orphanage, six other feisty women, to save the day ... I may have told synopsis, but it's a cheesy story. In fact, the whole script and direction lacked any quality at all. Much of the dialogue was meaningless and combined with a plot that was as thin as rice paper in water. If I could sum it up, take a bad Jackie Chan movie, remove the comedy, remove the choreography, throw the budget, and you have Martial Angels: a formal job without any imagination. <br /> <br /> Remember, I have to give credit where credit is overdue, and Shu Qi was probably the only person who came rude to the terrible act, as it was her performance shining through. Okay, you can't say she was excellent - after all, she had absolutely nothing to work with - but she managed to dig some character out of her role. Aside from that, only Sandra Ng and Kelly Lin made no other impression - although these were mostly glittering and very short. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere, the movie just dropped. Scenes and dialogue were completely unnatural and incredible. Of course, special effects were made on the cheap without attempting to clean up the edges of people and the mask on the blue screen, poor editing with many discontinuities in battle scenes, camera angles that were elemental and plain and direction I have seen better from a lost dog . <br /> <br /> I think this movie was too many cooks affair. Probably the budget was blown away on the over-enthusiasm of having seven babies on the same silver screen. It didn't do much more. <br /> <br /> Frankly, the way this movie was made was like a cheap porn movie without porn. Charlie's Angels, it's not. In fact, while sisters can do it for themselves, it was not at all clear. <br /> <br /> One to forget.
