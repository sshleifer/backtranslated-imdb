Has anyone stopped to realize what kind of movie they produced here? Now we get a former marine officer to turn to a group of children at a cadet school, so this should be a family comedy right? Wrong. This is just a rough comedy aimed at teenagers with many bad tastes. It might have been extremely stupid at this time, but I found Damon Wayan's voice to be annoying without faith. Does he speak like this in real life? If he does, he has my sympathy, but he hasn't got any of my money from watching his movie
