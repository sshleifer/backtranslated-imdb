Anyone who has studied any physics or cognitive science will go out of the game after 40 minutes. As my wife and I did. The ignorant masses can be entertained by the divergent arguments and the absurd "conclusions" drawn (without even a logical reason) from real science. I am offended by such nonsense presented under the cover of "science". I can only conclude that the authors downloaded a quantum physics book, did not understand a word of it, then saw The Matrix about a thousand times and continued to write this movie. For example, the Washington DC crime experiment was performed by The Transcendental Meditation Program. A short search will reveal the science of their methods.
