I've seen the original non-duplicated German version, and I was surprised at how bad this movie is. Thinking I'd seen my share of bad movies like Ghoulies 2, Rabid Grannies, Zombie Lake and such, nothing could have prepared me for this! It was really a pain to sit through this flick, as there is no plot, not good acting, and even the special effects are not convincing, especially the so-called zombies that have nothing but white makeup and their old clothes, so their good kits would not be destroyed by ketchup and jam spots. <br /> <br /> If you really want to waste 90 minutes of your life, watch it for all the others, don't do it because you will regret it!
