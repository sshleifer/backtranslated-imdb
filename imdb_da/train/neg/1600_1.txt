The biggest National Lampoon hit remains "Animal House" and rightly so. It was fun, raucous and good-natured. <br /> <br /> The exact opposite of every other National Lampoon movie. Including "Classroom". <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by including Stephen Furst ("Flounder") from "Animal House". Or by the fact that John Hughes wrote this jumbled mess. This reunion is as fun as the root canal and twice as painful. <br /> <br /> A star and it's generous. Then I always thought that most of my old classmates were also demons, vampires, and serial killers.
