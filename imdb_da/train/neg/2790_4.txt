Julia (Kristina Copeland) travels with her husband Steven Harris (Steven Man) and their baby son Alex to spend a few days with his family in Savage Island, a separate island. The couple expects to solve their problems at the weekend in the remote island. While waiting for the boat, Julia and Steven meet two strange men in the harbor, and when her brother Peter (Brendan Beiser) arrives, he explains that a family of hillbilly squatters live on the island. The innocent Peter smokes his forehead while driving the truck at night and turns off the headlight to show off; however, he unfortunately runs over the young son of Savage's family, but in the dark he thinks he has hit an animal. Later, Savage claims the Alex family as a compensation for their lost son. The young family does not accept trade, and they initiate a fatal war between families. <br /> <br /> "Savage Island" is a very low-budget movie with a stupid script, amateur filmography, but surprisingly benign. The flawed story is completely absurd and there are many incredible situations. How could two men leave two women with the baby alone on the road during the night with the threat of the terrible family? The logical procedure would go straight to the continent and bring the police force to rescue Peter. Then the young family disappears; Julia and Steven leave their car on the continent and their house and friends, and no one is shocking them? Peter calls his sister Julia of Alex when he comes with the boat in the beginning. There are so many mistakes in this flick that I could use many lines to write about this topic. I think this movie was filmed with a home video, so terrible that the pictures are. The good one deserved a better material for work. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ilha de Sangue" ("Blood Island")
