As far as I can tell, this movie is currently available on DVD despite previous comments from other commentators. I found it only a few weeks ago. <br /> <br /> It's on the Value DVD label and I paid the total amount of 98 cents plus tax for it. I found it at a 98 cent store among racks of plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks. Now you do not have people who carved beau coup bucks for super-duper Swedish import limited edition version feel that you were had ??? I thought so. <br /> <br /> This movie was actually worth 98 cents. 99 cents, I can start arguing with you. But clearly worth 98 cents. And remember to say what you pay for. For slasher movie mavens only.
