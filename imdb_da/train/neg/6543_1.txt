The 1990s began to have daytime shows germinate to the left and right. Each network had one, and they all lacked one thing originality. Ricky Lake was just another show to entertain the overweight trailer park mother with a Marlboro cigarette hanging out of her mouth while breastfeeding one of her dozens of toothless, illiterate. The English language and other cornerstones of humanity, how ruined by this shows existence. Named ranges from the Girl to you a Pigeon Head and so on. How could anyone like to see this clean and complete garbage? Is our society really more than a bunch of hill billy's and dead beat fathers? The people shown on this show were trash. The people who saw this show were trash. Anyone who wants to see this show re aired or put on DVD is TRASH. People wonder why Americans become big bunker lard and too fat to even get work, it has to show as this tell them. It is OK to be 500 kg overweight and have 12 year old girls as prostitutes. Having such garbage on TV has destroyed morale.
