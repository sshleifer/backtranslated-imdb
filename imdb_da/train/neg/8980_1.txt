I will never forget the night I watched this movie. We were on a submarine on patrols in the North Atlantic and it was the scheduled movie in the evening. We all gave the other wheel. They didn't even try to show it by midnight. I choose a resume instead ...... This is all I really have to say, but they have this stupid rule that my comment should contain ten lines. I should not brush the comment with random words, so I just want to continue walking until I get my ten lines of BS. I couldn't find George Goble listed in the credits, but I remember him in the movie. Sin was terrible and the songs even worse.
