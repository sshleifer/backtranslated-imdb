Why else would he do it for me? <br /> <br /> Not what I expect Dean Cain to produce hit movies. Or even decent movies. I saw Lois and Clark, I realize how ... "good" Dean Cain is. Of course, this will be a cheesecloth, and each cheesecake has its own special way of making you knit your head. I don't want to call these spoilers because you really can't destroy this movie any more than it already is. <br /> <br /> To begin with ... why is it a fake helicopter? I mean ... why? Where does a Chicago scientist come and the other scientist is from LA, and no one can be more East-Eastern if they tried? How hard would it have been to get either an American actor, or just change the lame state magazine that the movie tells us to say they are not US? Why are there 2 apartments when the movie gives us a slug line? We get helipad day and then reveal the hall-day later. And then it is who cares about the timeline. To be honest, who cared about it even when they mentioned it, but I think it's next to the point. <br /> <br /> Is a movie really better if you can see it through multiple split screens? The answer is no. <br /> <br /> This dragon can surely go down the hall .. over..and over ... and over .... and over ... <br /> <br /> Who on earth was responsible for one of the worst conclusions in movie history? It was just out of Scooby doo. Oh, the dragon is dead now ... say you want supper? Sure, but not in any Chinese place .... with dragon in the name !! AH HA HA HA !! HA HA HA !! HAHA HA! I used to be Superman! AHA HA HA! HA HA! <br /> <br /> fade to black <br /> <br /> my god, it made me scratch it was so stupid. <br /> <br /> But never fear ... even if the whole building exploded ... and no one survived .. for some reason there is another untouched, unmanned laboratory that survived quite well so they can do a successor. Hurray to us all. <br /> <br />
