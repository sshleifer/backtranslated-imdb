Can I do it 'until I need glasses? At least the point shows that everyone can make a movie. Talent is not a consideration. The people who released this miserable pile of spears all over the world lack any kind of talent, taste or intelligence. The target group must consist of the newly labotimized and infants playing with their own stools. Anyone else would be too global to get another snicker out of this movie. It consists of a series of sophmoric sketches, where the stroke line does not even extend to the obvious. It ends with the ridiculous. The jokes told are the types of jokes that primary school children tell (usually potty or sexually related) where they do not know the meaning of all the terms they use. You know like one about the father's car and the VAT garage. Applying any sterner method of criticism would be meaningless, as the usual standards of action, writing, direction, and the like have never been heard by the creative "minds". behind this mess. Not to be judgmental, but anyone who enjoyed this movie should seriously consider their purpose on this earth. <br /> <br />
