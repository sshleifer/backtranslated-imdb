When I saw the screenings of this movie, I thought it might be stupid, but at least it would be fun. Well, I was wrong. Although somewhere deep down, the producers had an interesting message to convey whether the parents were left alone and reassessed their lives, the way they tried to deliver it was terrible. The first fifty times something silly that had happened to the couple was relatively fun. But at the end I could almost predict what a silly accident will happen next time. <br /> <br /> In the whole movie, I like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was mediocre at best, which is still more than I can say to the movie itself.
