Absolutely the most boring movie I've ever spent my money on. This was a wrong choice for all those great stars to waste their reputation on. Boring! boring! boring! Each character was portrayed in a less than inspiring way. No actor talent showed - just reading a part. Alec can play realistic characters normally, and Gwynyth made himself look ugly for an irreversible part. Annette needs to advise on how to choose the movies she chooses to record, as well as all those great stars who have left me disappointed by the way they all allowed their talents to be smeared in a feature that leaves much to be desired. to wish for entertainment. "Running with scissors" leads the public to foresee great action in a movie that suggests experiencing tensions and deep emotions. There was not a moment when the cast was able to portray any interpretation of this on the screen. Maybe it was the director's fault ---- regardless.
