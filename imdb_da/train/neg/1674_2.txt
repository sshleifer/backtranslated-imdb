The principle was exciting, but unfortunately this film just doesn't do justice to it. The casting was quite good and it was shot beautifully - but stylistically, much of the direction was inconsistent (overstylized quick editing was done without effect .... I waited for Steven Bochco to run in credits followed by a commercial), characters were exclusively identified using screen coke (and just about anything else left for Boogie Nights for character development), and no personal signs to draw the viewer in history. A very forgettable movie.
