I actually had great hopes to go into this movie so I took what was given with a grain of salt and hoped for the best. About 1/3 of the way through the movie I simply had to give up, simply the movie is a mish-mash of things happening without apparent reason and it's completely interrupted. I love movies that make you think, but this movie was just a bunch of ideas thrown together and never really connected. <br /> <br /> Do not think it is David Lynch-esquire that some would have you believe it is nowhere near this rich other than some trippy images. To say that it is artistic to pamper the fact that there is no apparent plot or story is just a way or justify why you wasted 1.5 hours in the movie. The action was good, but it can't save the lack of history. I agree with the one comment posted earlier ... "It's like being in someone else's head ... while on drugs", in other words, makes no sense.
