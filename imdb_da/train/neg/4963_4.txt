turned out to be another failed attempt by the ridiculous sci-fi channel. I'm not sure who wrote the script and interprets the poem, but I'm sure it was from a 17-year-old teen who thought it would be great to have a scoped bracelet in the movie. AAAAAAAH! When I saw that part, I lost all hope. Then they set up heorot in what seems to be the ship Christopher Columbus sailed in! when they reach Heorot (who was supposed to be a Nordic meadows), the sci-fi group of idiots decided to make heorot look like a big stone castle. when i saw the part .. i wanted to scream. I really wanted this movie to be good, but sci-fi hasn't yet produced a good movie so I don't know why I got my hope. Oh .. and Grendel and his mother are also stupid. (this comment is off topic about "Grendel") If anyone from the sci-fi channel reads this .. there are some good advice. NOT ALL MOVIES YOU DO, MUST BE ABOUT A LARGE MONSTER THAT CAN RIP PEOPLE IN HALF, IT IS NOT WHAT SCIENCE FICTION IS ABOUT! AND ALSO STOP CASTING LOW GRADE ACTORS, LIKE STEPHEN BALDWIN, TO BE IN YOUR MOVIES! It doesn't help the movie, but do it safely !!!
