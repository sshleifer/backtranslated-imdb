The female leader was a horrible actress who made the whole movie mediocre. She smiled too much when she first walked in front of the cameras to talk about her daughter. This should have made the police suspect her. I would have been incomparable in the same situation. She seemed calm to a mother who couldn't find her daughter. It was as if she wouldn't even be in the movie. Jennifer Aniston would have played it better. And it would have made much more money for such a controversially important issue. Everyone else was excellent. I don't know where the leading actress is, but I hope she has some plays.
