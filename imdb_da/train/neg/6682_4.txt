This comedy is really not fun. It's a romance that plays so much on stereotypes, it doesn't matter. It is a hijacking film that is so derived - yes, even then - it has no snap. <br /> <br /> The cast is sufficient. More than that is hard to say. However, it is great that the players are not confidential. At MGM, this would have star Robert Montgomery. Wife of a businessman without time for anything but work could have been a number of actresses. <br /> <br /> We can be grateful that this little-known movie is popular with artists who are mostly unknown today. And the production values ​​are not terrible. But it gives no impression. <br /> <br /> It's a generic knockoff. And who wants it?
