Here are the good news first. "Spirit" is the most visually amazing animated movie in the current home cinema release. Art and effects are revolutionary, and I recommend that you give this movie a look based on the pictures alone. <br /> <br /> And now for the bad news. I really mean when I say that the animation is the only thing that this movie is about to do. You remember that "Spirit" was threatened much by "Lilo and Stitch" last summer. The first person to claim that it was because Disney is more well-established and had better advertising can write me a four-page essay titled "Why" Lilo and Stitch's Script Not Stinked ". <br /> <br /> For All the incredible new animation techniques on the display in "Spirit" are the story almost * astonishing * boring. There is a lesson here and (it is superfluous to say) it does not only apply to animated movies. there is ever going to characterize the eyes of a mortal, but if your story is boring, and more importantly, we don't care about your characters, it's bad movie making. So simple, the animation is still blowing; I just can't wait to See what someone with more imagination does about it.
