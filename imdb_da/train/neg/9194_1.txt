Okay, I'm first and foremost a big zombie filmmaker. I loved all of Romero's flicks and thoroughly enjoyed the restoration of Dawn of the Dead. So when I had heard every critic rank this movie, I was still optimistic. I think critics hated Resident Evil, and although it may not be a great movie, I enjoyed it if it wasn't for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shoot-em with a half-decent plot. However, this is pure crap. Terrible dialogue, half-plot and video game scenes inserted in the movie. Who in their right mind thought it was a good idea. The only thing about this movie (I use the term loosely), which I enjoyed, was Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk (Ugh). While his name casts originality through the window, you can see in his performance that he knows he's in a god horrible movie and he might as well make the most of it. Everyone else acts as if they were making Shakespeare. And very badly I could add. Basically, the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you are one.) Is a huge zombie buff and must see every zombie flick made or b.) Like playing MST3K, the home team. Watch it with friends and be prepared for tons of unintentional grin. <br /> <br />
