Good movies cannot be based solely on a beautiful garden and hilltop. Surprised to see it has won two awards. Extremely overvalued. I first saw this kind of film from China, visually stunning, but also with really something captivating to say, well, more than 10 years ago, and I'm sure there are still more coming up. This is not one of those I am afraid of.
