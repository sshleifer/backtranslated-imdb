"Ask the Dust" so fascinating from the trailer, and we especially like all the actors. Unfortunately, the movie was not convincing enough to be considered drama, and it was not fun enough to be a comedy. It almost seemed to satirize itself and to no entertaining effect. After seventy minutes of waiting for this thing to get better, my wife and I went out and considered not wasting more time on such nonsense. It was simply not interesting, moving, fun or artistic. It looks like it was written, produced and led by a high school kid; Worse yet, it was so shamefully wasted by otherwise extraordinarily talented actors, not to mention our time and money.
