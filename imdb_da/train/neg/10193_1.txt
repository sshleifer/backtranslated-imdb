With this movie, Bunuel manipulates the viewer with all the film's power, while clearly indicating in the film that his work is one of 'objectivity'. Of course it is not. For one reason, many scenes are "shot by pure chance" obvious layouts (when the poor goat "accidentally" falls out of the rock, you can actually see gun smoke right on the screen!). For another, his hiding on an important piece of information was: The Hurdes people were the way they were of a particular reason, which was just hinted at in the movie. It is, goitre, a disease caused by the lack of iodine (salt). This goitre is the cause of their cretinism, and if Bunuel had only taken the time to do his research (heck, if he controlled "cretinism" in a medical dictionary, he had found "goitre") he could end up telling the truth about these people (still doubtful). Instead, he judges them with his film and talks about them as "cretins" over and over again, dramatizing the action, scenarios to create the play, all this very unacceptable to a documentary claiming to work for a generous objectivity. Bunuel speaks all the time in this movie, not letting a word to the people he films. He speaks for them, and he himself judges them. This piece is deficient in its roots, for it is ideology, and it is a shame it is considered a good movie.
