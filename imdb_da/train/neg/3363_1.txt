The original movie (dated 19 ??) showed no "monster", it just suggested scary "stuff". <br /> <br /> However, this version shows all aspects of a "viscous ghost", including unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> "Mysticism", presented in the original film, was the most frightening part: you didn't know what caused the strange things that happened. By showing the face of the "old man" this gentleman has completely disappeared. Even worse: the special effects (crying wooden children face) are ridiculous. This is a stupid remake, also obviously spectacular to be as scary as the original
