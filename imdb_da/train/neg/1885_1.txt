If you are looking for a movie, depicting the meaningless and boring existence of middle-class life trapped in a web of non-communication and false ideals, then this is the movie for you. If you too, what the movie should be engaging and keeping your interest, then you probably have to look elsewhere. There are many movies that make this much better. For example, try some of the darker films by Bergman. The filmmaker believed that in order to show the middle class's spiritual poverty, he was to submit to the viewer for a painfully dull and vacuum event after another until the movie finally came to its sudden and pathetic end. If you appreciate your time, there are far better ways to spend two hours, such as To clean your house.
