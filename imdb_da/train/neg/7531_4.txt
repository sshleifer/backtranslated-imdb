This is apparently a film of more grief. As such, it should move viewers and make them empathetic with the situation of the protagonists. But the annoying postmodern style makes it almost incomprehensible. The camera continuously switches from one scene to another, from a personal crisis to the next, creating a choppy, uneven effect. Most characters seem to live in unbridled, unstructured life, held together by their professional obligations. (It also extends credibility that a man who has just got what corresponds to a probable death penalty was looking forward to a sex chamber with a woman he just met). The story (if there is a story) is hard to follow. Overall, the overall effect is quite disappointing. In spite of all this, the play is generally good, and some of the scenes are quite powerful.
