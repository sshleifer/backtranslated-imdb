I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old. My mother bought it from our local Kmart because it was for sale for $ 5 on VHS. She thought it would be a nice Christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch. However, this movie scared hell out of me. You may ask yourself how could a movie about Santa Clause scare anyone? The movie's plot is about Satan sending one his minions, Pitch, to the ground in an attempt to kill Santa and ruin Christmas. That's right, Satan sends a demon up from hell to kill Santa Clause. Pitch closes Santa Claus all Christmas Eve in an attempt to trap him on the ground when the sun rises on Christmas day, because if Santa does not return it to his home in the room, he turns to powder. Don't make me wrong, the movie is fun and pretty entertaining, but the image of demons and devils dances in the depths of hell (which happens at the beginning of the movie) is just scary.
