What a complete disappointment! The result of 6.1 here at IMDb built up some mild expectations, but I was disappointed. The first thing that bugs me is the braindead, stereotypical college children. Yes, I know teenagers can be childish, etc. But why are they always portrayed as complete Braindead Morons in movies? There was a sign I thought was okay, but he / she (not revealing this) was killed by the road before the end. The other characters were poorly executed and even the stated hero / heroine just didn't do it for me. On the plus side: The plot is pretty good, and the productions value a cut for these kinds of flicks. The action was generally not very good, Rutger Hauer stands out in a small role. But it all fails with gentle and braindead characters. Just stop with them after 10 minutes. 4/10 (and it's generous).
