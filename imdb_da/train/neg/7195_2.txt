Dises has done it again The company that made "Mr. Magoo" and "George of the Jungle" has made another movie that hardly resembles the cartoon on which it is based, and holds none of the original spirit. <br /> <br /> "Inspector Gadget" was one of my favorite cartoons when I was young and for a movie of it to exist, it may have been a dream come true. Now that that movie exists, I was very disappointed, even horrified. <br /> <br /> First we have drawn. The gadget itself has gadgets that made him a fun character in the original cartoon (with appropriate special effects accompanied by them), and he even has some of the naive from the original gadget, but he is now more competent and expected to solve the crime himself while Penny and Brain just look. /> <br /> Penny has little to do; While she played a major role in the comic, she discovered the crime and stopped it and in the meantime was caught by the MAD agents, she is now simply introduced and forgotten, though at least she sneaks into Claw's base. <br /> <Claw is the movie's version of Dr. Claw, who was a rather outrageous, raspy-voiced man wearing metallic gloves and sitting in his chair, his face was hidden from view as he stroked his cat and watched various crimes. Now he is simply a man with a claw for a hand without mystery behind the character. Brain and Mad Cat are in the movie, but are rather insignificant for it. <br /> <br /> Even small parts of the comic book are not spared in this slaughterhouse. The famous expression "Wowsers!" was mysteriously changed to "Wowser", and Gadget's gadget mobile now looks different and speaks. <br /> <br /> There are even product names everywhere. Why is "Yahoo!" announced on a sign? Why have Gadget mobile buttons for M & M or Skittles? <br /> <br /> Fans of the comic will hate it, others may be likely to find the movie under par, and when all is said and done, this movie is another attempt to make some quick money from another old show.
