Before the release of George Romero's genre-defining Night of the Living Dead, zombies were relatively well-behaved creatures. They certainly had much better table manners in the old days. But social etiquette apart from what tensions offered these early zombies to the cinematic public? Judging by this movie, none at all. The story is about an expedition to Cambodia, whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of zombie fixation. One of the feast discovers the secrets alone and sets out to build his zombie army. <br /> <br /> This movie is basically a love triangle with zombies. But since this is a 30's movie, the mentioned zombies are more like somnambulists than the carnivorous variety we think of today. They seem to respond to mind-control, rather than insatiable appetite. And, frankly, 'the rebellion is somewhat underwater too. The whole thing is really very boring. Apart from the lack of horror, there are no over-the-top melodramatic teatrics to keep us entertained. It seems unlikely that this could have given much entertainment even 70 years ago. See it if you have to see everything with 'zombie' in the title, but otherwise I would recommend skipping this one.
