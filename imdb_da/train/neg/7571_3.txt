Woman (Miriam Hopkins as Virginia) chases man (Joel McCrea as Kenneth) to father (Charles Winninger as B.J.). The woman wants to get a man to invest part of the deceased mother's money in the father's venture; But Dad is notorious for losing money on hairy schemes. Something about someone, but real evil schemers make up as Man's best friends to steal their fortune ... Production seems to be engaging, but history fails to engage. The players do not play well. Remarkable as Broderick Crawford's first appearance - like gopher "Hunk"; Other than running errands, Mr. Crawford is attached to the floor by Mr. McCrea. <br /> <br /> *** Women Chases Man (4/28/37) John G. Blystone ~ Miriam Hopkins, Joel McCrea, Charles Winninger, Broderick Crawford
