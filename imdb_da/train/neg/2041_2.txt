Now I start with the good points. The movie was only 86 minutes long and some of it was so bad it was fun. Now for the low points. My first warning sign came with an actual warning on the movie. When it started, the following "warning" was shown: "The movie you are watching contains graphical and disturbing images. Unlike the popular belief that is killed, neither is fun, neat, or romantic." I should have saved myself the 86 minutes and then turned it off. The first words in the film were: "I am with the glue factory." It was a guy talking on his phone, and he referred to a nursing home as a glue factory. I do not know why. So the foundation of the movie is a child is obsessed with the Zodiac Killer and begins to imitate him. The budget for this movie was at least $ 50 and they must have used the cheapest cameras they could find. The action was worse than I read from a script. That's what they did. The script was horrible, and the great "twist" was that this guy who wrote a biography of Zodiac Killer was actually Zodiac Killer. Of course, they tried to show this subtly, but clearly made it within the first 10 minutes. Without more painful details of the plot, here were some horrible highlights in the movie. They are trying to make Zodiac Killer compare to an "army of one" because soldiers really are just murderers. Then they tried to make an attempt at "Satanic Worship" by showing some guys in black caps in a meeting. The big "computer hacker" could get this child's address when someone gave him the child's name and phone number. For some reason he had to hack into the FBI to get any address. I'm not sure why he just didn't look up the phone book or use whitepages.com. There was also a random connection to 9/11 for no reason. I also learned that wherever you are shot, the blood will come out of your mouth within seconds. <br /> <br /> So if you like really bad plays, sub-pairs of scripts, poor camera work and an obvious plot, you'll love Zodiac Killer!
