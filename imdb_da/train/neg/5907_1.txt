Yes, it's about it. This movie was horrible. Two minutes in, I would gouge my eyes out. This has been praised as an "innovative LDS comedy", but it is not even good for members of that church! I do not think that any human should be so victimized to see a film of this low quality. <br /> <br /> First of all, you can tell that nothing was done in this movie. It looks as if the horrible wear, glib, tired plot was thrown together by two crazy tissues somehow permeated with the gift of coherent (at least semi-coherent) thought. Then there is the play that is bleak from * all * involved. Even the comos fail to experience anything. <br /> <br /> And let's not forget that our protagonist is a low-key we'd like to believe can change, but that path is full of embarrassingly poor dialogue, terribly hideous "gags," and many Mormons. fun "that anyone in their real mind, LDS or not, should consider purely * stupid *! This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen!
