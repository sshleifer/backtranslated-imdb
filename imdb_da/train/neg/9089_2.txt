The film has only one error, unfortunately this error destroys the whole credibility of the piece. It begins with the condemnation of the Israeli occupation of disputed territories. It fails to deal with the cause of the Israelis there. Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Jordan attacked Israel. That is why Israel "occupies" their country because these countries lost it in a war they started. <br /> <br /> The film also claims that Israel has tamed the United Nations by failing to comply with Resolution 242. The problem is, 242 was rejected immediately after it was initiated by ..... the Palestinians, making it void. Many movies are collected well and can really show recordings that change minds, but remember when you see something, don't believe anything you hear and only half of what you see. <br /> <br /> All participants in this movie are well-known critics of Israel, and some have made many anti-Semitic public comments, removing any credibility for their words. <br /> <br /> All participants have a great need for real-life lessons learned objectively, not by any Palestinian sympathizers.
