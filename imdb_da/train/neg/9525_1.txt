This totally boring, meaningless, meaningless, breathless and stupid movie is not the ultimate proof that the world can forget Danny Boyle and his post-Trainspotting movie: "The Beach" has already taken care of it. What this low-budget look does is just to secure its place among those who started out very well, but was completely lost in drugs, spirits, ego, self-will, mismanagement or whatever led to this once promising director's rapid death. The pastor is absurd: two losers (Ecclestone and some bimbo Jenna G - a rapper, probably) meet randomly and spontaneously begin to sing with passion more akin to lunatic asylum inventory than a potential hit-making duo - as they become. A friend of theirs - an even greater illiterate loser - becomes their leader by smashing a storage window and stealing a video camera, filming them in "action" and then showing the tape to some musicians who actually show interest in that waste . Now I know that in recent years Britain has posted incredibly unwanted, but it is ridiculous; The music makes the oasis seem like The Beatles. During the study enrollments, the duo - Strumpet - changes lyrics in all times, and Ecclestone tells quite arrogant music beings that they take it or leave it, and quite absurdly they take it. Not only is music total and complete garbage, but its "performers" are anti-social; These NEWCOMERS must call the shots. It's just too stupid. It's terrible. The dialogue is unfunny and goes nowhere, and this rags-to-bitches story has no meaning and makes no sense. It often feels improvised - under the influence of drugs. Danny Boyle is a complete idiot. This little piece of garbage is so bad it is embarrassing to see. Ecclestone is I.Q. There must also be questioned about accepting being part of this nonsense. The one who financed this Â£ 1000 joke should leave the film industry before they end up selling their own underwear on street corners.
