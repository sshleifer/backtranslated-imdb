I will give it a 3 just because it showed history that we need to know about to prevent it again. I agree with the comments of the gentleman from the UK. The movie was pretty awful. All clich√©s, no real plot. There are many historical and technical inaccuracies. Look for the technical specifications of DE 529 or any Evert's class Destroyer Escort and you will see what I mean. I am now the black story month in the United States and I am called a racist just to say this, but this ship's story is not that big. They did some escort work, chasing a "submarine" that turned out to be a hulk they hit. Sorry, but black people did much more in World War II, so this stupid movie gives them the credit. This movie makes them look like whiners. Let the name called begin, I can handle it.
