CQ could have been good, campy fun. But it commits the only unforgivable sin: it is b-o-r-i-n-g! The pace is deadly slow, and the plot is quite confused and so artificial that it is almost impossible to break wherever it goes. The story would have been acceptable in a creative writing class from a thought-provoking and sensitive eighth degree, but this video should have worn a warning label: "CAUTION: Student movie. Suitable for viewing family members only."
