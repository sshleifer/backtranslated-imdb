This movie reminded me so much of "A story of violence" that pretended to be a close investigation of violence and violent behavior, but ended up being nothing short of a cheap action movie that masked as a thinking film of violence. Dustin Hoffman and his new British bride move to a small English town and encounter endless harassment from the local drunks who do nothing but hang out at the pub all day and make trouble. Do these men have no work? Still, Dustin takes everything he can and at the end of the movie he stays in his house and fights for each of the drunken attackers with such cruel means as pouring whiskey over someone, his feet being blown by a shotgun and some head gets caught in a rock trap. Funny that someone would need such a large bear trap in a small British town except perhaps put a man's head in it. <br /> <br /> Sam Peckinpah who made "Wild Bunch" who also covered the subject of blood gives violence where no one was spared. But it was done in style and you believed it. Straw Dogs are not credible. First of all, the location is wrong and does not work. Why place it in England? I think maybe in some inner city or a small town in the American South in the 1930s or something. Secondly, in my opinion, it has never really been clearly explained why these men are so quick to violence, except perhaps they became full and felt a need to kill Hoffman and rape his wife. <br /> <br /> Sam Peckinpah missed the mark on this one.
