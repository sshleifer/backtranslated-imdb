I did not agree with any of the Theology in the Left Bag series, but I found the books poignant and I read 8 out of 12 of them. Undeniably good writing and interesting story. But I didn't have very high expectations for the movie. There was no way mainstream Hollywood would have taken a Christian series and produced a big-budget movie. So it was done independently ... and it just felt like I was watching a really long TV show. It just doesn't feel like a movie; It didn't have the movie "experience" for it if anyone knows what I'm talking about. So the movie suffered because of it, and the low budget, bad special effects were another deterioration for me. <br /> <br /> In addition, I feel that Gordon Currie was greatly mistaken for Nicolie Carpathia. When I read the book, my impression of NC was that he should be this charming, dazzling, incredibly beautiful guy who spoke English with almost zero traces of accent. So I imagined someone like Pierce Brosnan in the role. Instead, they found some Clay Aiken pencil necklace that looks like an employee of the Best Buy month, and gave him a really bad fake accent. Then I lost some stars for me right there. A movie is just not convincing when the big villain doesn't look or sound like he should. <br /> <br /> The play was okay, but nothing to write home about. Some of the scenes - like one of the switching scenes (can't remember which one) - were real seat squirmers for me. And some of the Christian rock music or whatever it was was really out of place for some of the scenes, as in the one with Kirk Cameron praying in the bathroom. In short, it wasn't a bad movie, but it just didn't make me. Stick to the book, people, it's much better.
