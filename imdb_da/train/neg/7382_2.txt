Well, let me say that I've always been a Steven Seagal fan and his movies are usually great, but it's just not measured for the rest. This is, in my opinion, very stupid, I did not like it all. The biggest reason I don't like it is because it is very flawless and it doesn't make much sense to me. The play is very bad, although Steven Seagal does not work well, the rest of the actors can see because they are just targeting video footage. It doesn't follow a straight story everything happens at once, so it doesn't make much sense. Ther is hardly any action at all, and to do an action movie well, you usually need action in it. The special effects are very bad and you can tell is fake. So all in all, seagals have the worst movie of all, so if you want to see a Steven seagal movie don't rent it, just pretend it doesn't exist. So avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall Score: ** out of ********** <br /> <br /> * out of *****
