Vulpine Massacre should have been this movie's current title. And the tagline should have read "Guaranteed to make your kids CRY!" This is a natural drama that tells the story of a family of wild reefs in a remote region. Begin with the meeting and mating of two young foxes and a possible birth of a large family and the attempts to raise them. The only speaker is made in the story of a tree standing over the moor, giving insight into the animals love and living ... Lovely landscape and beautiful movie shooting of the animals. That sounds good, hi? Well from there, things go straight to hell and then start drilling against the core ... <br /> <br /> *** Spoilers below - or they may be a warning! *** <br /> <br /> Almost the first time we learn one of the foxes is born blind. But seems to get along well enough, and there is a beautifully cheerful musical score that accompanies him ... And then he dies ... Next we have one of the siblings adventures. And then he dies ... One of the sisters gets their screen time ... and then she dies ... And then it goes like a scary slasher movie, as a fox after the other is killed by nature, in traps, just up and disappear , and even a lot of snowmobiles! At the end of the movie, almost all foxes have been massacred. Even though it is not merciful, no deaths appear on the screen. (At least not in the version we saw.) Contrary to "Tarka the Otter", the deaths of this film are almost all meaningless and the limit to the sadistic way, hope is built up and sniffed. One or two losses would have been acceptable. It's a natural movie. But not nearly the whole family. <br /> <br /> Don't go to watch this movie stunned by the cheery box to believe it's safe for the kids. See it with some prior knowledge that things are not * going well and that you or your children have to feel very bad depending on how sensitive you or they are. You like it. Or you can't ...
