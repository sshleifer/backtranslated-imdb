I love movies and I want to see some movies all the way, just to give it a try. I can finally say I found a movie, I can't see all the way through. The action is terribly stale and monotonous, CGI looks like a computer geek did it in his mother's basement with minimal software, and ..... the long scenes just ... go !!!! And this movie is three hours long! I didn't even do it 15 minutes until I quickly forwarded the DVD. The scenes with foreigners are very short. Ummm, instead of naming this "World War II", may mention this "War in Long Distance". This cost $ 5 million to make! What they spend the money on, the dramatic opening song? Oh, but in a positive note, a scene you should see when foreigners first start killing people. It's fun, not because people die, but because they turn to skeletons, they still look for 20 seconds afterwards. <br /> <br /> So .... as I said, if you're a fan of boring, outdated, action-less movies, here's one for your DVD collection. But I didn't write this to you, I wrote this for billions of billions of other people who want to HATE this movie. It is not worth your time or money <br /> <br /> I know this is the book, but the book is not that long and I am a complete book mask / nerd / geek / whatever, but why? Just get the Steven Spielberg version, it's not that good, but it's 10 times better than this !! <br /> <br /> I give this a BIG, FET ZERO out of 10.
