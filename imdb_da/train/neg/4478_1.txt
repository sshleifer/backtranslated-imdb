I don't expect much from this movie - a fun little diversion. Wuthering Heights could be transformed into a plausible modern story - beautiful and soap, melodramatic and exciting. But this movie decided to throw the talents from those involved in a simulation version, saw the water from the source material, it was amazing that they had a hard time calling it Wuthering Heights at all. It ignores the fact that it is a story of people who are essentially inappropriate, mostly unsympathetic, and often cruel to each other. It changes the very nature of certain figures. Isabelle, for example in the novel, did not have a tricky leg in her body - they have removed her blind idealism and turned her into a scary whore. Heathcliff is a horrible person who mentally tortures most people in his way, but in this version, Catherine ends up leaving her daughter in her care. The dialogue is trite, and you wonder how the actors managed to deliver some of it with straight faces. Instead of depth or actual emotion, we know they matter when they scream it in someone's face. I have read criticism of the early 90s version, "Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights", which featured Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, and said it became an intense dark Gothic story in a sudsy bodice ripper. Some valid comments, but the MTV version goes a step further, using the basic story structure to deliver chipper beach bums cavorting to really bad music.
