Goodnight, mr. Tom begins in an impossible exquisite village in southern England, where the sun always shines. Before we have a very good idea of ​​the period, we hear a radio announcement about the declaration of World War II. Soon, a train blower brings steam to London refugee children, and when shy little William is filled with restrained, gruff old Tom (who you just know turns out to have a heart of gold), our story begins. <br /> <br /> And what a load of sentimental claptrap it is. In fact, it's just the old odd-pair buddy formula. Are there no new stories written? <br /> <br /> As I suggested, there are hardly any quarters in the village and not much more in London except for the odd old ambulance that is raging around. And certainly no hint of Blitz's fright as London's citizens politely file in airspace. Even when the local teacher's husband is declared missing, he is supposed to be killed, later being restored to life. <br /> <br /> I found "Goodnight, Mister Tom" clumsy and obvious, and John Thaw's accent set a picture of Ronnie Barker of the Two Ronnies with a straw in his mouth making his `country bumpkin 'accent. <br /> <br /> For the rest, my wife has had this movie for all the reasons I didn't like it and look at fellow imdb reviewers. I seem to be in a minority of one. <br /> <br />
