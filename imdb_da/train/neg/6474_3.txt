This was the first sequel I had seen (except for the Return of Jafar) and I honestly thought before I saw it would be close to the original. I was terribly disappointed. Storylinet was basically the first script with a few extra characters, and the situation was reversed. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, Melody, who is not happy with life on land. She wants to become a mermaid. But Ariel has kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her - and when Melody finds out she's sad and upset. And then she chooses to run away, and she becomes a mermaid. Then she loves to swim around, and Ariel goes out to find her as a mermaid. <br /> <br /> The story doesn't sound too badly written, but the clich√©s and repetitions of situations from the first movie are just too obvious. And adds the fact that the tune is generally extremely annoying and the movie becomes almost unbearable. There are also a lot of other new characters - Tip and Dash are two of them. They are not as bad as signs in themselves - just try not to think of Timon or Pumbaa! The songs give a lot to be desired, they just don't have the same magic energy as the songs from the original did. Of course, the animation does not have a whole load of work put into it - in parts it is jumped, and not much imagination is used for the person movements. Another advice - try to forget Ariel's original character while watching this movie. The beautiful, rebellious curious teenager is 'grown up' for a dull, boring wife and mother, and her trademark red hair is completely tied. This is much better if you have never seen the original - you have nothing to compare with. <br /> <br /> All in all, it could have been worse - it's not as bad as probably other successors, such as Cinderella II. But it is not in the same league as the original. But this for your collection, if nothing else, but if Disney continues like this, they will lose all their older fans.
