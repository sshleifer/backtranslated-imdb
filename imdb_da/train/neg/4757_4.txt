Some time ago I have seen Sleuth (1972) with two great actors Michael Caine and Laurence Olivier. Michael Caine is back, but he is now man and Jew law loves his wife. The story is still the same, and it's a great game. <br /> <br /> During the movie I always had the feeling of seeing a game. That's one reason I don't like this remake of a classic. When I watch a movie adapted to a game, I still have to feel watching a movie and not just a game. Director Kenneth Brannigan did some great movies in the past, but this time he missed. Another reason was the film's appearance. The design was modern, stylishly clean, uncomfortable and cold. I never have the feeling that anyone has ever lived in that house. The shooting was not bad, but the lightning was terrible. Sometimes there was blue light, dark green light, to round it not kindly to the eyes. <br /> <br /> The play was really good. Michael Caine's and Jude Laws perform at their best. I really want to see these 2 guys play together on stage. But I must admit that I was never a fan of Jude Law. The weakest part was the middle part. I remember in the original that this part was still very mysterious and just wonderfully directed. I tried to see it twice, and always in the middle party I felt asleep. The end part is better and more interesting. Sleuth (2007) is not horrible, but it seems to be more a film for critics than for the audience. Sleuth (1972) is still a masterpiece and much more entertaining than Sleuth (2007).
