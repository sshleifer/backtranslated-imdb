From the play, the direction, the scriptwriting and the art direction, this movie is just plain sick, and the money would have been better spent on shoes for earthmoving victims. When did we get so sad that they would fill a children's film with sexual induendo to keep the parents aware. <br /> <br /> Dr Suess rolls in his grave right now, what about the "filthy ho" "SHIT" and fake erection scenes etc etc. etc. It is shameful how they act on Suess's name to get the parents to bring their children, throw in the profanities to try the teenager and a few sad parents who do not see a movie with their child if there is no T&A. Greed greed and greed. <br /> <br /> Compare this to the classic children's films, and we can have a disturbing view of the world becoming. These guys have to stick to making MTV videos. How on earth did this movie> 400 voices as a perfect 10 is beyond me. (unless it's the director's family)
