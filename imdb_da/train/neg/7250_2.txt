After reading the other reviews for this movie, I believe that the high markers are probably paid studio lackeys when the movie I watched was utterly gloomy, with wood-like, missing scripts and plodding predictable control being one of the few plus points to be the amazing scenery, as this movie has some amazing scenery with beautiful sweeping views and dramatic skies and wide open prairies. Unfortunately, when the most memorable thing in a movie is the part behind the actors, this must be a warning sign about the quality of the movie, all in all a thorough uninspiring addition to the Western genre, as even at the very reasonable price it Can be achieved on DVD, is best to avoid.
