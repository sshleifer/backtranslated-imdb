A cheesy, compelling horrible (and not in a funny way) C Grade movie. Everything shouts 'amateur', from the crumby script (bizarre premises, limited context and predictable endings, turgid lighting, sound and handheld wobbly camera angles, the coy and fit sexual indeundo and references, the monstrous and incredible dialgoue to Z I saw it on DVD And hoping Edward Wood would jump out, everything is forgiven - your worst movies are works of art and more coherent than this twaddle. <br /> <br /> But still preferred warbling "Every night in my dreams I hear you" - Are you sure that the Titanic crew was not involved in this on the site?
