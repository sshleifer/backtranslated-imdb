I was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this movie but being relatively ignorant of quantum physics except what I recalled from the excellent "Short story of almost everything" and what I was able to choke on down in "A Short Time History," it sounded interesting at times. However, the obvious endurance of the Indians' history, which could not see the ships of explorers, was ridiculous. I really started to question what was about to burst at that time, but then the clincher was the revelation that one of the speakers actually "channeled" some loony named "Ramtha" completely disturbed applecart for me. <br /> <br /> What a waste of two hours.
