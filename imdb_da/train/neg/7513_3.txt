What can I say? I think I should write "Spoiler alert" and then "reveal" the used F-word a lot in this movie - as in all two sentences. I didn't like this movie at all - too many hints about sexual perversions, sidesteps and cheats. And it swears completely out of the window. I gave this movie "3" and two of these points are for Mira Sorvino's sexy movements on the dance floor.
