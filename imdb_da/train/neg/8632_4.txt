I'm a big Charlton Heston fan. He is undoubtedly one of the greatest players at all times, but what did he think when he made this movie. Usually if he made a bad movie, I could blame it on the writer or the director, but in this case it is all him. The disease in this movie is all his fault. It shows that not even Heston can make a Shakespeare story interesting. I wasted 2 and a half hours in my life at this snooze party, and I never get that time back. This is by far the WORST Heston movie I've ever seen. If you're a Shakespeare fan, you might find this movie entertaining, but if you don't waste your time, you'll regret it in the long run.
