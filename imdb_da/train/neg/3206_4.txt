I was thrilled to hear that Cesar Montano had decided to make a movie on the Cebuano language. (Not 'dialect', which most Filipinos will wrongly refer to as. As Cebuano and Tagalog are as mutually incomprehensible as French and Spanish are to each other.) But I was very disappointed when I saw this movie. Being Canadian, by Cebuano's parents, I was optimistic about the revival of the Visayan film industry when I heard about this movie. I was more excited to hear that it wasn't another silly action movie or melodrama as the Filipinos love these types of movies. But unfortunately I was briefly changed. <br /> <br /> Panaghoy serves as an ego trip to Cesar Montano. Of course Montano plays the film completely. And when I say 'totally', I mean in the most stereotypical ways; His function is to win the heart of a girl and lead the bol-anons to victory over Japanese. His character has no depth or complexity. He just fits the hero mold. The rest of the characters are one-dimensional; They all fit into their cookie cutter roles. <br /> <br /> I'm too slow-moving / meditative, but this movie was just slow moving. It wasn't really meditating anything. Just because a movie is a historical theme, a drama and slow motion does not make it a suitable movie. Particularly annoying is the American actor Philip Anthony. His performance was embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If Montano wanted to revive the Visayan movie industry, he should really have thought this through. He said he wanted to make visual films that could compete in Cannes and Toronto, etc. But really, this movie would have been booked and hissed at such festivals. In order to get Visayan movies into the ordinary consciousness, at least he should have made a movie that would have attracted the audience, even though it meant sacrificing quality. Of course, he didn't think about or was informed about what kind of movie garnered prices in Cannes, so an audience's attractive film would have been at least one foot in the door. <br /> <br /> I'm afraid the video of Visayan will not be made again for a long time because of this movie. Of course, if I ever told a Filipino that I would like to see more visual films, I would of course answer: "The Visayan doesn't make good movies. Don't you see Panaghoy Sa Suba?" Of course, it is ridiculous, as it is an example of a Visayan movie and probably the only example that anyone today is likely to see. <br /> <br /> An example of movies that are meditative, not just slow moving, is the Tagalog movie Blackout or David Lynch's The Straight Story. I hate to promote the Tagalog language as it is infinitely and unfairly promoted and pushed into the throat of non-tagalogfilipinos, but to call a spade a spade I say Blackout is a very good movie. These films depend very much on what Hitchcock is called "pure cinema". Images without words are used to convey the story. But I bend the definition a bit for the sake of these two films, because these films use images without words to convey the mood of the movie. And they do it very well. Panaghoy believes that if they just take sweeping shots of the landscape, they have established the mood. <br /> <br /> What about so many Filipino movies with a dying mother or grandmother ???
