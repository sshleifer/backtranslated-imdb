This show is painful to watch ... It is obvious that the creators had no idea what to do with this show, from the ever-changing "jobs", lovers, and cast. It seems they wanted to throw Amanda Bynes into something ... but had no idea what, and came up with this crappy show. They threw her as a teenager, surrounded by twenty and thirty somethings, and put her in mostly adult situations by repeated attempts at comedies. Soon they realize that she needs a "clique" and tossed people in their late 20s to try to pass as teenagers. <br /> <br /> How this show survived 4 seasons is beyond me. Somehow, ABC has now decided that it is a "family" show and threw it into the afternoon lineup at ABC Family.
