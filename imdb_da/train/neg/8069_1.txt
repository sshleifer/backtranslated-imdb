An incoherent mess with a lattice-sounding soundtrack, "Soul Survivors" is the latest entry into "who is dead and who is alive" genre of horror movies. Two teenage couples, Sean and Cassie and Matt and Annabel, are preparing to go out to various colleges, but before sharing for Thanksgiving Break, they participate in a final fling on a rave-type feast in a widespread church on the suggestion of lusciously ending Annabel (Eliza Dushku, aka Faith, the other vampire slayer). Motivational scary guys start paying too much attention to Cassie (the generic Melissa Sagemiller) for reasons never explained, and before long leave the Quartet party. Driving away in their SUVs, they are being persecuted and then passed by the ruthless creepy guys who immediately and inexplicably make a deliberate 180 in the middle of the highway, causing an eerie and deadly accident as the SUV flips over a dam and throws in a river. Sean is killed (or is he?), And Cassie uses the rest of the movie to cope with the loneliness and guilt (she drove) when she is not haunted by Sean's ghost or chased by the motive, scary guys. Very unexplained inconsistency follows as Cassie's mental state degenerates further until we reach the predictable conclusion. So who is dead and who lives? After ninety minutes of this purgatory, who actually cares?
