That song keeps humming in my head. Not the greatest song, but it's the 80s. This film is about a leading singer who "supposebly" is killed while being charged with murder when he stalks his girlfriend who sings back vocals in his band. The lead singer, whose name is Billy "Eye" (yes, right) is dead after two years, and his band comes back to a concert, only the backup vocalist is the leading singer this time. Billy steals her and eventually kills all these people and scares the girl and makes people around her think there is something wrong with her and that shes imagines things. She finally decides to go to a cemetery and dig his grave to see if he is still there. She sees that he is dead, but still sees and hears his voice. At the end of the movie we find the reason behind all this, Billy has a brother named John (right again) and John admits he was jealous of his brother and that he killed all these people to get back to him and put the blame on his brother and then take his girlfriend and terrorize her because she called him crazy. The end is very cheezy and the play is very lamb and wood. But .... I like it anyway. I see it to the song. I wish I had it.
