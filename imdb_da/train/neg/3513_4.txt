Jeremy Northam is battling a "Total Recall" clone script and one-time romantic by-play to bring life to a confused character. Lucy Liu trains her from a tree start to a workman-like finish. You can't fail to look at her interviews on the DVD when she uses the term "Femme Fatal" and "Romance". French film noir actress, she is not and they lack chemistry together. <br /> <br /> This movie fails, not in the plot or action sequences, but in the absence of attention to detail in the films photography and hamfist depicting the technology world around the protagonists. A little attempt has been made to dress the landscape to represent an adjacent cinematic landscape or period. Automobiles are much the 1990s and the architecture is hardly modern with open plans suggesting a limited budget instead of conscious set-set techniques. The technology is positively fun. Massive "2001: A Space Odyssey" mainframes fed with man-portable CD-ROMs with data collected by some inexplicable reason despite the scattering communication network that even the most ignorant technician today would of course be aware of. There is a clear lack of research done here, and given the open source nature of cyber society, research would cost a little more than a bulletin board and personal time. DVD interviews also reveal the original movie name was "Company Man", but it was probably killed to be able to redeem the Matrix hype. The "Cypher" title has only the smallest link to the movie. Terry Gilliam would have done wonders with this concept; and completely rewrite the decal. <br /> <br /> This is Tele-movie quality and extremely disappointing for a movie-length production. It could have made a good sub-point for "Alias".
