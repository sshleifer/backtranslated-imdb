This third Darkman was definitely better than the other, but still far worse than the original movie. What made this better than D2 was that The Bad Guy had been changed and Durant was not brought back again. In addition, there was actually some hint of character development when it came to the evil guy's family and Darkman himself. This made my heart soft and I gave this flick as much as 4/10, ie. ** / *****.
