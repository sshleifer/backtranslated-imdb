I watched this movie some time ago on a Video CD. <br /> <br /> Let me first mention the good points. <br /> <br /> At least, the film begins to show that it is not biased, which does not show a sign like black and the other as white. Both protagonists are friends and exist very well in a country and an economy that does not flourish while not failing. Their families meet and have parties, and they practice their favorite sports, Sport Rifle shooting, as companions, not as competitors. <br /> <br /> But after the first 15 minutes the plot runs into a fork in the road. The audience is expected to believe that these friends, for some unknown, should hate each other. That for some unknown reason, Bosnia is now heading for conflict. Certainly, the script adds in television footage, as the characters appear to watch live news programs in English, but the clips are from 1992 not 1992 when the war began. The story, the election in 1990, the people who caused the war is not mentioned. The film tries to blame Karadzic, who had been the presidential candidate and head of the second largest party (SDP) of the Bosnian parliament. According to Bosnia's constitution, the SDP had to hold the presidency in 1992, but there was a coup in January. The Bosnian Islamic Democratic Action Party seized total control and held a segregated referendum in March, declaring the law in Bosnia and announcing Secession. <br /> <br /> IDAP's story begins with the Bosnian Muslim Alija Izetbegovic, a man suspiciously absent from "STtH". He was a student of Nazism in World War II. He even wrote his own "Mein Kampf", in which he said: "In fact, there is no peace or coexistence between" the Islamic religion "and non-Islamic social and political institutions". <br /> <In 1990, he lost the IDAP election to "pro-Yugoslavia moderately" Figured Abdic, a Bosnian Muslim who worked with Christian Serbs during the Civil War and who treated his followers as brothers. Abdic was prevented from taking power by Izetbegovic, who lost the election, but seized the place for power. The events above are lacking in the movie, but they are the actual events that lead to the war. <br /> <br /> There were also problems with props. Serbian soldiers in the movie were wearing Soviet WW2 helmets that they didn't use. One soldier also held an M-1944 WW2 rifle that was used only by the Soviet Union not Yugoslavia. <br /> <br /> The director and screenwriters had a chance, but they chose to rewrite the story.
