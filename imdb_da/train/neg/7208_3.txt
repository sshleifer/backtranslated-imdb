I grew up seeing the old Inspector Gadget cartoon as a kid. It was like Get Smart for kids. Bumbling boob can't solve any case, and all the work is done by the talking dog, Brain and his niece Penny. I had heard the live action movie was decent so I checked it out at the library. I rented this movie for free and felt I should have been paid to see this. <br /> <br /> Broderick comes nowhere near the caliber of acting Don Adams had the voice of the gadget. His voice was all wrong. The girl who played Penny looked nothing like cartoon Penny. She is a brunette, where the cartoon version was blonde with pigtails. But she does a decent job considering what she should work with. Dabney Coleman performs well as Cheif Quimby. Saldy he never hid in any strange place or had exploding messages thrown at him by accident by the Gadget. <br /> <br /> The gadget mobile was wrong. It never spoke in the series and it was fine. Why did they do this? <br /> <br /> The gadget was too intelligent in this movie. In the show he was a complete idiot. Here he had a half decent intellect. It would have worked better if he was a moron. <br /> <br /> Also the completely slaughtered catch phrase. Borderick says "Wowser". It is and should always be "Wowsers". It sounds lamb with out 's'. I was disturbed as they showed the previews and they didn't have the correct phrase. <br /> <br /> The only decent gags were under the credits. The missing to Claw is in front of a support group to recover henchmen / sidekicks. Sitting in the audience is Mr. T, Richard Keil aka Jaws of Bond movie lady, a Herve Villacheze look, Oddjob, Kato and more. It's about the only part I laughed at. <br /> <br /> The other is at the end where Penny checks out the gadget clock and tells the brain to say something. Don Adams agrees with the dog who says "Brain is not in right now. Please let your name be by the sound of woof. Woof." Of course, it's not laughing much fun, just a good piece of nostalgia to hear Adams in the movie. He should have at least voted the stupid car. <br /> <br /> Kids will like this, all over 13 will not. <br /> <br />
