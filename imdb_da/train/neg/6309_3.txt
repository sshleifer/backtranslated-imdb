This film had good intentions and a good story to work with. The director and screenwriter of this movie failed miserably and created a dull, boring movie strip that made me feel like I was back in Mr. Hartford's 8th Class Social Studies Class - back in 67. <br /> <br /> What a waste, someone will take this story and make a real movie out of it - the story deserves it. <br /> <br /> Every time a scene had potential, all we were left with was a couple of cliches combined with black and white footage, which they probably got from The History Channel to show the action. Shamefully. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis was the only strong light in this boring party. The other play was incredibly boring - it fits well into the movie and who played the captain put a new low standard for line delivery. <br /> <br /> But if you are willing to accept all the many errors in this movie and are not worried about being confused or entertained but want to learn about the USS Mason, it is worth looking at.
