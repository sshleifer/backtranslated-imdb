Tony Scott destroys everything that might have been interesting in Richard Kelly's clich√©d, unnoticed, overwhelmed manuscript. Domino Harvey (Kiera Knightley) was a model that fell out and became a bounty hunter. This is her story ... "kind of". The problem with this nonsense is that there is not much of a story at all, and Scott's extreme graphic stylization of every shot acts as a distancing mechanism that makes us indifferent to everything in Harvey's chaotic life. You just don't care about Harvey. Knightley plays her like an unpleasant, cynical quarrel who has done nothing to justify our respect. She beats people, she doesn't like and throws her clothes and inhibitions when the situation demands it, but she is not least right, and Knightly is also not convincing. <br /> <br /> The movie is boring. It's also loud and shackled with one of the most annoying source music scores I've heard for a long time. The last twenty minutes is a bad revolution of Scott's 'True Romance' climax with Domino's gang, who is coming to meet two sets of feuding bad guys that are - surprise! surprise! - destined to shoot it out at the top of a casino in Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this potentially exciting conflagration is completely hit by Scott and becomes a confusing, pretentious, meaningless exercise in celluloid masturbation. This is not an artistic brave or experimental piece; It is a failure at all levels because it does not give us access to the life and dilemmas of its characters. Mickey Roarke looks good like a grizzled bounty hunter, but he disappears in the background as "story" progresses. Chris Walken turns in another embarrassing como, and Dabney Coleman, who is always solid, is underutilized. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by this movie's multi-layered, gimmick-clearing surface. It's still a turd, no matter how hard you polish it.
