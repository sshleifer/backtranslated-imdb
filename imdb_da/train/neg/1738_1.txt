This miserable movie is a remake of a 1927 movie. They should have left it that way. <br /> <br /> What a tremendous bomb! Douglas Fairbanks shows absolutely no charisma here. Cesar Romero is subject to a real jerk role and Bette Grable sings with a choir. What I want to do for the Hungarian! The ridiculous plot deals with a picture of a woman in a castle in 1561 Rome who saved the day by killing a conqueror. (Fairbanks) Now, quickly 300 years later, when Grable, married to Count Romero, faces a similar situation when she is an invasion of Hungarian soldiers at her wedding night. <br /> <br /> Romero seems wrong and flees before the army arrives. He pamperes himself as a gypsy and is created to remain in the castle when his violinist welcomes Fairbanks. The end is worse than the whole miserable movie when Grable meets Fairbanks to tell him the good news - a furious Romero has canceled the marriage. <br /> <br /> This poor imitation of a movie was made in 1948. Like Harry Davenport, a veteran supporting player in it, died in 1949; It must have been his last movie. What a bomb to go out with after such a distinguishing career. <br /> <br /> Walter Abel co-stars, but he can't do a little with such poor writing. The costumes look more like those who would come out of the Stone Age. I can't understand what Fairbanks was doing.
