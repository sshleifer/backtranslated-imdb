I can't understand why so many people praised this show. Twin peaks are one of the most boring titles I've ever seen in my life. Now I've seen all season 1 episodes and watch season 2 episode 1. I simply can't take this show anymore. <br /> <br /> 1) Where is the correct induction in criminal case? <br /> <br /> In season 1, there was a scene that Agent Cooper throws stones for a bottle. Can you guess why he did it? He just wants to identify the killer by doing this "joke" while mentioning the supernatural ability given by the tibet's dream. Wow !!! <br /> <br /> 2) There are too many unnecessary scenes in this show. <br /> <br /> For example, season 2 started with a "fun" scene, like a stupid old man serving agent Cooper with a cup of milk while Cooper is lying on the floor. (He already has the gunshots in his stomach.) This old man does nothing but say some stupid comments. That's all. <br /> <br /> This scene is really boring and even long (3 min. 30 sec ... It's like hell.) <br /> <br /> I wanted to read some comics instead of seeing this show more.
