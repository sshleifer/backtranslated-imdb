With movies like this, you know you will get the usual jokes about ghosts. Eve as a ghost is quite fun. And the other actors also do a good job. It is the direction and the story that is missing. It could have been overlooked if the jokes worked better. The problem is only that there are not many jokes. Sure, I laughed a couple of times. Apart from the talking parrot, there was not an ounce of creativity noticed in the movie. I blame the director for not using the premise to the full potential. Eva has determined the comic skill to show more, but was unable to do so. Overall, this movie is ideal for a Sunday afternoon. Except that it can be skipped completely.
