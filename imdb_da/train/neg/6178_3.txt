Frank Tashlin's 'The Front' is one of the more lifeless private Snafu shorts, a series of cartoons produced as instructional films for the military. Instead of getting Snafu to take some inappropriate actions that lead to disaster, 'Home Front' instead focuses on loved ones at home and how much they have to offer to war effort. Snafu realizes he was wrong when he thought they were easy. It is a concept with few opportunities for good gags, and instead the Tashlin risqu√© card plays heavier, expanded jokes involving strippers and tailor-made dancing girls instead of very effective comic relief. The result is a well-meaning card that has little relevance or entertainment value today other than as a historical artifact.
