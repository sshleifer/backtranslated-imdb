Unhinged follows the typical plot of the early 80's slasher trend. Beautiful young girls in danger. I have to give it up to the filmmaker who used helicopters for some of the early road trip shots you actually think in a second that will be quality in production. Seeing "Unhinged" was like watching an amateur acting class go through it's warming. Some of the most awkward, ill-lit, long-lasting scenes are played out with an assault on a Valium overdose. I wondered why they did not just put the cue cards on camera, so the actresses didn't have to constantly change their gaze. Of course, the two main girls were chosen for their T&A factor instead of talent. Laurel Munson as the main chicken Terry is as exciting as watching paint dry. Two naked scenes make it a teenager's excitement. Janet Penner and Virginia Settle as the crazy / scary daughter and mother, find the chickens stranded to compete for the worst acts ever. Long breaks, weird expressions, emphasis on the wrong word, it's all there and is a pleasure for those of us out there who love bad movies. The scenes suddenly change with long black outs, you can drive a Mack truck through. Cartoon lightning strikes the shot without bothering to show the sky. The 80s eye shadow attacks the viewer. But you know it grew on me. I was sad. I would hug it, kiss it is boo-boos and do better. The end does not constitute the damage it has caused, but I still laughed. I have my own theories on the whole "forbidden" hype and hope that anyone who chooses to watch this movie does so with a significant drug abuse and a sense of humor. Otherwise pass.
