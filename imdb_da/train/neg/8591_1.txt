I'm trying to determine if it would be more fun than jumping into a wood chopper. It ends the destruction of what was once a classic pair of movies. With Jedi, Menace, Clowns and Sith, we have Lucas's career death. He wants us to swallow Annakin's Father Nonsense? I never thought it was true. This movie claims these feelings. The story hasn't worked since Phantom Moron, and every new movie just put on the crapet until everything left was a toy parade. I need to go. I know where some new stones are throwing. Do you want to destroy? Here they come. Luke and Leia are NOT related. Father is NOT their Father. Duke Countoo should have changed pages while still able to. Yoda has less verbal skills than Yogi Berra. His advice has never been good to anyone. Obi Wan lied to Luke for the first two films. Annakin did not build C3P0. He found him in the desert and lied to his mother to put him together from scratch. Chewbacca has fleas. This whole mess with Vader and the Republic's fall may be due to the stupid b *** h Amma-Lamma-Ding-Dong. If she had brains, she would not have come within an easy year of Annie, but she had told what George Lucas wrote to her. What a dope!
