I managed to show a view of this using MST3K, and oh the boy, even with the riffing, this movie was incredibly poor. Imagine a person whose competence with a camera could be performed by a monkey. The highlights (how small there were) came from the special effects that were "OK". The action for the most part was also "OK"; Although it was nothing special, it was of a higher quality than other B movies I have seen before. The rest of this movie is bad enough, the camera's work often looks like they just put that camera man on skates and pushed him together. The story (if it can be called) is so full of holes, it's almost fun. It never really explains why the hell he survived in the first place, or needs human flesh to survive. The scripture is poorly written, and the dialogue goes out just plain stupid. The climate of film (if any) is absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> If you can't find the MST3K version, avoid this at all costs.
