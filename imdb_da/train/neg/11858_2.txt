I'm a fan of Matthew Modine, but this movie - which I stumble on cable - is quite unclear. I see that the screenwriter and director were alike, so there was no one around to control his worst instincts. There are no surprises, no original lines and no original characters. Goldfish was basically the most sympathetic character. What a waste of all this acting talent. Given how expensive it is to film in New York these days, I have to wonder how this was created in the first place. And if you're wondering why I saw it at all, it came after a movie I like on cable and I left it while working on the computer. It's not a very demanding picture!
