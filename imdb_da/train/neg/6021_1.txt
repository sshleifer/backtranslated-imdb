I can't believe they managed to spend 17 million. USD on this movie. Spectacularly bad acting, egregious scripting and effects that you could do on your average PC, incredible plot contrivances ... a reporter who can get an inexperienced flight attendant a big job at the UN? What? Not only that, but the message of this movie is so creepy that you come out as if they have been trying to smear your head with a full size crucifixion. All this movie will do will preach to the choir and make everyone else laugh at such a ridiculous waste of money. If the decision makers in this movie really wanted to turn people into Christianity and show what it means to truly believe, they would have spent the money helping people really in need. Now / that / may have swayed some people to actually listen to them.
