This is really terrible: painfully annoying stylized artists screech and mug congratulate incoherent dialogues that take place in scenes that seemingly have no meaning, no beginning, middle or end, cut together without any apparent narrative or even cognitive intent, all in service for some totally uninteresting and almost undiscovered "story". What makes it worse is the movie's "style" prediction: Suddenly a remote head sprouts shoots down, and for no apparent reason, there are sudden whips or wobbly-hand-held sections: All this "style" only serves to magnify the almost incredible misunderstanding of the project and the material's almost offensive vacuum. Absolutely a candidate for the worst movie ever made.
