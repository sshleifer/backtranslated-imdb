As usual, IMDb following the majority vote instead of the "weighted average" is much more indicative of the movie's entertainment value. In this case, the majority gives it a "one". How true they are! To start my review, I first admit that I am completely clueless as to why this movie is titled "Alien Intruder". It involves space and even a "stranger" (I assume), but there is no rhyme or reason (at all) for anything in the long run, at least no real plotbase or a resolution that I can do anywhere. /> <br /> There are many scenes that are so awful (in terms of both the lines, the timing and how they are spoken) that it far exceeds the weird feeling you get when you see similar really bad movies. I have no idea the part near the beginning where an electronic Bugs Bunny seems to be ranting about something. "Plot" exclusively involves an area of ​​space known as G-Spot, sorry, does the G sector ... and a virtual reality program infected with some form of foreign (?) Virus. I think it's alien when the picture of the otherwise normal Ariel looks like a photographic negative. <br /> <br /> For most of the movie, we see people being shot with space weapons falling out of the lofts and seemingly endless, meaningless, close-ups of "Where's Ariel?", "Can not find Ariel" (meaningless because they Most of the other images include interaction with Ariel, anyway - anything) on ​​a computer screen. Commander Skyler (Billy Dee) sits and sees every imagination of the prison's VR programs hoping to find this Alien virus and become one with it ... ??? Or maybe I missed something ... Billy Dee Williams took a few courses on "how to act in despair" before recording this. We know it because he spends a lot of time moving his fingers down his face and looking sad. The docking scene with the nose of a ship entering the other side was semi-hilarious at least and made a laugh beyond the early stages where we saw more shots of the ship as it just turned around in a circle and resembles a lego. experiment that has gone wrong. <br /> <br /> It seems that everyone dies in this movie, so why bother? Even the VR women are killed as if it were to mean something (especially since everyone else dies anyway) ... outrageous. Because of the money I save on groceries, I don't want to have my money back for the DVD of this. The dollar that I save on the vanilla plate bag paid for this reviewer's time. <br /> <br /> I just add that the story itself, at least as a novel, and with much more detailed additions, could probably be quite interesting with the right author. <br /> <br /> 1/10
