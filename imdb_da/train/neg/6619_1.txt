This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in the cinema !! Couldn't wait for it to end. To make matters worse, you get a 12A certificate, so you don't see anyone being shot, just bodies that hit the ground, even Babban being killed were cut out !!! Too many scenes were cut to take the younger viewers into consideration, as decision makers knew it would flop catastrophically !! Amitabh's performance was amazing, but that 'Basanti' wannabe and the other idiot playing Devgan's mate can't even act. Devgan was wasted !! <br /> <br /> I didn't want to see this again for free, and I advise anyone else reading this to do the same you have been warned !!
