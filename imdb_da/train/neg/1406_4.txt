This "movie" is more like a music video. Kusturica said in an interview from 2004 that when he makes movies, he feels like making music, and when he makes music, he feels like making movies. The best thing about "Promise me this" is the music, written by Stribor Kusturica. <br /> <br /> In the same interview, Kusturica said that for him, the dialogues in the movies are noise. "Promise me this" has very little "noise". <br /> <br /> I liked "Life is a miracle". It was also like music video in the first 30 minutes and on some points later, but it had a beautiful plot. "Promise me this" has no plot. I was waiting for this movie with great expectations because I read that the script is written by Ranko Bozic - one of my favorite screenwriters who also participated in "Life is a miracle". Ranko Bozic writes good dialogues, but for Kusturica they are "noise", and much to my regret I only saw two dialogues that I could identify as written by Ranko Bozic. The second part of the script was used by the director to make his chaotic music video for his son Stribor's music. <br /> <br /> Gordan Mihic (the man who wrote the "Gypsum Time" and "Black Cat White Cat" scriptures) said in an interview that Kusturica never follows the script. "Black Cat White Cat" was the only script that Kusturica said he would not touch. According to Gordan Mihic, Kusturica comes back to the manuscript, and if he doesn't, he doesn't make a good movie. And I think that's the case with "Promise Me Here". He should have followed the script by Ranko Bozic. <br /> <br /> "Promise me this" is billed as a "comedy" but there are very few moments that made me laugh. The comic moments are in the style of "Black Cat White Cat", but it's not fun at all. I think the difference comes from the fact that "Black Cat White Cat" is written by Gordan Mihic. <br /> <br /> But I know some people who liked "Promise me this", they find it very positive movie.
