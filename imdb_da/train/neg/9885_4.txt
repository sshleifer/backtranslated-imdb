He only gets third billing (behind Arthur Treacher & Virginia Field), but it was really David's first lead, and he is funny stupid as PG Wodehouse's dunderheaded Bertie Wooster, champion (in name only) to Jeeves, who is most fanciful valets. As an adaptation it is more like a water-down the 39 steps than a true Wodehousian excursion. And it's too bad, as the interaction between Treacher & Niven is not too far away from the brand. Unfortunately, 'B' movie mystery tropes & forced comedy tire even in short 57 minutes. Next year's follow-up (STEP LIVELY, JEEVES) was even more out of the mark, without Bertie in sight and Jeeves (of all people!) Forced to play the hesitation.
