This is a real bomb. We would think that Merle Oberon is the sequestered daughter of an ambitious politician to prove to Tom DeLay of the 1930s that he is worth supporting as a presidential candidate. Poor Merle can't go anywhere but is surrounded by politicians and their quacking, quaking wives and is only supported by friendly uncle Harry Davenport. She joins her two girls on a blind date, and Gary Cooper happens to appear. Some shots of rodeo may have had lively things, a la "Misfits", but not such luck with this. Gary later embarks on a formal dinner, where Merle leads and, although invited to sit down and join the group, reads a lecture on their snobbery. Where did this diffuse cowboy suddenly come from? The most eerie scene in the movie is a phantom party that Gary holds in his unfinished house for his absent wife, Merle. Will it never end? One to avoid.
