Holy crap! What a horrible, horrible Spanish thriller! I've had it for about four years and finally it started the second night. I saw an hour or so before I went to bed. I was pretty fascinated by it all. I finished it last night and couldn't believe where I stopped it the night before. I literally stopped the other one before the movie went downhill. As I said, I was pretty fascinated and curious about where this mystery went, but stopped it right when Simon received the package in the bar. I picked up when he opened the package to reveal a laser gun and then played a "threatening" game of laser tag. Whew! So the great revelation is that the whole thing is a terrorist plot of role playing. Whew! You can tell the Spanish industry was certainly behind director Mateo Gil (co-author of Amenabar's two great previous hits). There is an excellent score and good photography. But this scenario series of silliness. How someone sat through the last 40 minutes with a pretty face is past me.
