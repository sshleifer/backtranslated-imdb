This has to be the cheesiest, stupidest and most retarded monster movie all the time. It is a complete joke that this even went to theaters. It's like looking at the Loch Ness monster in rural America. This movie deserves to be thrown on a toilet and completely forgotten. John Carradine, shame on you. The people involved in this moronic pile of waste must be lobotomized. Wait! Maybe I give them too much credit. I'm sure they were lobotomized before the movie. How else can you explain the complete and pure stupidity that this crap forest contains. Don't waste a moment in your life and see it here. Don't even waste your time sending a review.
