This self-proclaimed "very talented artist" has easily managed the worst Spanish film of the 21st century. Lack of emotion, coherence, rhythm, skills, humor ... it repeats the same situation over and over again. It shows no sign development. It doesn't even show any violent and / or sexual content, and it doesn't add anything new to psycho-killer subgenre. So paralyzing it should appear at movie schools as an example of "what not to do" in a first movie. <br /> <br /> BTW where the hell is the talent? there are scenes that are shot almost identical; There are scenes that have two or more championships and it's pretty awful to see the action jumping from one master shot to another without a reason. The camera almost never moves as if the "very talented artist" was afraid to show his lack of visual capabilities. The actors who play the lead act like amateurs, and the support supports are hardly credible. There are more gaps than the plot in the script (if ever there was one) ... A really disappointing movie and any talented director.
