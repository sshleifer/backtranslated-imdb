I own 2 home entertainment stores and I've seen many bad movies in my time, but it was so bad I had to register here and comment on it. How bad was that? Let's just say that Sofia Coppola deserved an Oscar for her performance in the Godfather III compared to Giada Colagrande in this movie. <br /> <br /> It was robotic and uninspired. Her lover just died a month before her arrival at 'Rubber House' he had given her. Once here she discovers that he has cheated her in her relationship, but none of it seems to register with her. Within a day she starts a relationship with Leslie, (Dafoe) caretaker of the house. Although she is married to Dafoe off screen, her scenes with him were cold and unemotional. <br /> <br /> If there was a plot, I missed it. Not even Willem Dafoe could save this movie from the amateur movie, it's a film sign.
