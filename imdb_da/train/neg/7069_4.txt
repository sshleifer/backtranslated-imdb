When the film was released, it was the biggest hit, and it soon became Blockbuster. But frankly, the movie is a ridiculous clock with a plot that exacerbates a loser. The film has a Tag line - "Preeti Madhura, Tyaga Amara", which means the sweet of love, but sacrifice is immortal. In the film, the film (Ganesh) sacrifices his love for the leading lady (Pooja Gandhi), even though the two loved each other! His reasoning is the meaning of the tag line. This film influenced so many young broken hearts that they found this "Loser-like Sacrificial" attitude very thoughtful and thus became the cult movie as they could have moved on with their lives. Ganesh's play in the movie is amateurish, Crass and Childish stupid. He actually looks funny in a song, (Onde Ondu Sari ...), when he was to see all the stylish and cool. His appearance also does not help the leading role. His hair style is poorly done in most of the film. POOJA GANDHI CANT ACT. Her costumes are horrible in the movie and very inconsistent. <br /> <br /> The great part about the movie is the excellent filmography and brilliant music of Mano Murthy, which is actually the true sparring of the movie. Also the lyrics by Jayant Kaikini are very well written. The director Yograj Bhat will be rewarded with the visualization of the songs in a tasteful way. <br /> <br /> Yet all-in-all except the songs, the movie is a very ordinary !!!!!!
