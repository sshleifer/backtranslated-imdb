I don't know what you're talking about, the first time I saw this movie with two of my friends, we couldn't stop crying. This is one of the funniest shits I've ever seen. This comment about the porn is so true, but hahahaha. Yes, this movie is actually worse, but it brings tears to the eyes because of the false signs, poor dialogue and action. Not to mention the expensive cameras they used to film it? It looks like one of those movies out of my drivers ed. grade. The props look as if they came out of a high school drama show. The music sounds like it is from an original Nintendo system game. The only thing that even came close to scaring me about this movie was that it had a killer pussy, who's not scared of fat, lurking clowns? hahaha, if anyone ever should see this, they should take care of the actors' verbal errors as words of words and some of their facial expressions. hahahaha i died. <br /> <br /> SUSAN
