Don't waste your time or money on this one. The half decent cast can trick you into thinking that this teen thriller, while hardly breaking any records, can easily entertain for 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> It won't. <br /> <br /> It won't make you scared, laugh, cry or even challenge your intellect. It will leave you wondering how in the world this film has ever finished production. Yes, it really is the poor.
