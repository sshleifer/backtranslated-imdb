The two things are good about this movie, they are two unknown celebrities. First, Daphne Zuniga, in her first appearance in a movie, young and agile, with looks that still includes her body today, steals in the beginning, which is all she is in and that is it. She has of course just started, because her acting is improved with her next projects. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the well-known composer Christopher (Chris) Young is the one who keeps this stink from getting a star ... well, I know a star is not much, but In the case of this movie, it is a lot. The rest is just the stupid meaningless horror of a couple of college students trying to clear out a college due to being torn down and getting offed one by one by an unsuspecting killer, blah, blah, blah ... we all know wherever it goes. See the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga, then turn it off.
