This movie is similar to the game "Blithe Spirit" written by Noel Coward. A ghost wife and a medium are strongly associated with Coward's writing. I am surprised that movies of this kind do not recognize the original author's concept. I realize that the public may not be aware that this is a knockoff, but it is. <br /> <br /> Sad. These films are so expensive to produce. I reinforce when a manuscript is original. I even expect when it is an innovative way to produce a work that was previously released. There were some examples mentioned (such as Topper, etc.). <br /> <br /> I realize that movies are still a relatively affordable form of entertainment. However, I do not please when the public taste is taken for granted. In this situation, public taste is overlooked. <br /> <br /> I look forward to better-produced movie entertainment. <br /> <br /> In this case. I'd rather watch the game.
