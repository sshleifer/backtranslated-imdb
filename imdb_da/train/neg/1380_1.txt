This was the worst movie I saw on WorldFest, and it also received the smallest amount of applause afterwards! I can only believe it receives such recognition based on the amount of famous actors in the film. It's great to see J.Beals, but she's only in the movie for a few minutes. M.Parker is a much better actress than the part allowed. The rest of the play is hard to judge because the film is so ridiculous and predictable. The protagonist is completely unsympathetic and therefore a drill to watch. There is no real emotional depth to the story. A movie about an actor who can't get a job doesn't feel very original to me. The development of cop. It feels like one of many direct movie films I saw back in the 90s ... and not even a good one in those standards. <br /> <br />
