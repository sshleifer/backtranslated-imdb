The only redemption was the small part of Larry Miller. It seemed that the film was trying too hard to be "Something about Mary", but I couldn't even like that movie and it was still insufficient for these standards. The actor who plays Paul was great, but Selma Blair stuck in her stupid character. James Brolin was great, but Paul's father thought he was trying too hard to be the Randy Quaid character from National Lampoon's Vacation movie.
