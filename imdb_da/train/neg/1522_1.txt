You should know that I am the type of person who sees even the worst movies for goals, often out of pure morbid curiosity. I even saw Leprechaun at the end before I gave the temptation to tear my eyes and stamping on them. You should also know that this movie was in my video recorder for less than half an hour before I made a frightening leap for the stop button and knocked back the rental shop just to put as much distance between me and that as possible.
