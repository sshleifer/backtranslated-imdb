On the surface, "Show me the money" must have at least completed a full season. You had the always entertaining William Shatner as your host, surrounded by a baker's dozen of beautiful leggy models collectively called "Million Dollar Dancers." You had knowledgeable participants who had interesting stories to tell about their lives and who probably knew a lot of pop culture trivia. And you had big money! So what went wrong? <br /> <br /> The format of this game has failed. A good game shows at least two of three things: very simple rules, exciting pacing and the ability of the viewer to play together at home. The best, most durable have all three. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, SMTM had none. <br /> <br /> The rules of this game were among the most complex of any premier gaming show in history. Let me try to explain how the game worked, as briefly as possible. <br /> <br /> A participant started with a single word or short sentence followed by the election letters A, B, C (subtle connectors to the network?). Each letter was associated with a separate question, all of which began with that word or phrase. When a participant chose one of the letters, they could either answer that question or pass on and select another letter. If they passed, they got to see the next question and had the same opportunity. But if they passed the second question, they were required to answer the third option. <br /> <br /> After responding and before finding out if their response was correct, they had to choose one of the 13 dancers on stage, each with a different amount of money in a roll at their side. They revealed their dollar amount (from $ 20,000 to $ 250,000) and, depending on whether the participants responded correctly ... or responded incorrectly ... that amount would be added to or deducted from their pot. <br /> <br /> Stay with me so far? In addition, there was a dancer who had something known as "The Killer Card." If you chose the dancer with the Killer Card and you had your question correct, you were sure and the game continued. However, if you were wrong, you had a last question to answer. If you got the last question wrong, you were out of the game. If you are right, the game continued. <br /> <br /> There was no ending, no time away with the earned money until you either answered six questions correctly or got six questions wrong or you were so far in the hole you couldn't make enough money to come out again. Understood? Okay! <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I saw was a complete lack of excitement due to the design of the game. A participant could pass questions they knew they didn't know and answer many questions they knew, making the pressure even less. Then they could still find a low amount in dollars even after deliberately missing a question, which meant there was still no "drama". And the fact that they could answer five questions incorrectly and still have the chance to win was a big mistake. And the question was pretty slow: often the questions were so clear, it was ridiculous to try to create excitement as if there were any doubts about some of the most common answers. Pacing the lack of any real excitement at any point during the show and the very complicated rules prevented this program from working, despite Shatner's terpsichorean talents.
