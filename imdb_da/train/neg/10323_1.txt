I was excited to see a sitcom that hopefully would represent Native American candians, but I found this show not to be fun at all. The producers and caster are probably happy to get both bad and good food back, as long as they are worried about it being talked about! I was ready for some stereotypes and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason, they are usually true. But there was really no fun about these stereotypical characters. The "fresh of the father of the boat" who does not understand his daughter. The radical feminist Muslim daughter (who, by the way, is a horrible actress) and the young modern Indian man are trying to run his mosque as politically correct as possible (he's a great actor, I just see him better). /> <br /> It's very constructed and the dialogue doesn't flow well. There was so much potential for something like this, but unfortunately I think it failed and really doesn't care about seeing another episode. I still enjoy seeing a great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy again, she is always a treat and a natural on everything she does, because badly she has daughter in the show not the same ability!
