This film was first and foremost confusing. I usually like Gina Phillips, but the one I have to say was a bad choice as she did the movie Ring Around the Rosie, one also not a good movie. The Jeepers Creepers were far better. Anyway, Faye Dunaway was good. She scared me completely and in the end it was crazy. It was about Jennifer Cassi (Phillips) coming to her twin sister funeral. She stays with a house that her sister owns and her grandmother (Dunaway) lives with an aunt named Emma. Mary Ellen (Dunaway) is the victim of sacrificing her relationships to stay alive, and as long as she wants to live, she cannot die. Although Jennifer tries to kill her as she tries. The ravens have a weird part in it. When relationships go to bed, Ravens eats bodies so they can't sleep. But they do. Basically, it's all crazy, and Mary Ellen will never die and her relationships will be buried but not dead, b / c they will suffer forever, so Mary Ellen can stay alive. Yes, I hope it helps. If it doesn't, sorry. Love you.
