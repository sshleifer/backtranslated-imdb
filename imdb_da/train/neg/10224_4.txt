Spoilers <br /> <br /> Well, one line summary says it all. Melville's "Le samurai" is the original and there are elements of "Leon". And they are better - much better! In "Samurai" Alain Delon is a lone warrior / professional killer who keeps a bird in the cage and steals cars for his jobs (with so much excitement in these scenes!). Even the end is exactly the same: Samurai seeks death in dignity and is shot with an empty gun in his hand. The world has changed, he realizes, and there is no room for samurai in it. <br /> <br /> Delon does not kill as many people as the Ghost dog. But I think Jarmusch liked "Leon" much or even "Desperado" by Rodriguez. Then he also added this. And let me guess: The girl becomes professional as a Ghost dog (like Natalie Portman in "Leon")? <br /> <br /> So what did Jarmusch think? Where is the unique, original thought in this movie? <br /> <br /> I can't see the point of making carbon (celluloid) copies. <br /> <br /> A 4/10 rating by Macaulay Connor
