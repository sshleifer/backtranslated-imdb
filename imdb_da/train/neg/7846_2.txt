You know I went to see "The Hills Have Eyes 2" who would like it. I really enjoyed the original and the remake was pretty entertaining. They obviously had more money to throw out than Wes Craven did on special effects the second time. Although I still prefer the original movie, the restoration was done well and it was a kind of guilty pleasure for me. Bloody, intense and great special effects. In short, a great popcorn movie for any horror fan. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to "The Hills have eyes 2". Man, where do I start The reason, or lack of one, is paper thin. We are not exactly breaking new ground here. The military has decided to monitor the area and all these people are missing. So what do we do now? Let's send in to the National Guard to investigate. In true Hollywood fashion, we must make them the stupidest and worst soldiers ever seen. Hi, I've never seen the premise before. To make a long story short, you have the mutants killed the moron soldiers one at a time graphically. Once again, the special effects of Nicotero are great, but the killers no matter how graphic becomes boring and predictable. Honestly, it seemed to me that this flick was done just to grab a quick buck. It was bloody and graphic, but I found it predictable, boring and not at all scary. For me it would have been nice if this movie contained an original mindset. Where Craven and his son shared the writing tasks, and he's been involved in many of my favorite movies, but unfortunately it's not one of them.
