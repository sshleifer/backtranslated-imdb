This is not video nastie, but only because it came out in 1994, as they were probably tired of the whole case in the UK. It is 75% a rehash by The Boogeyman, and would have been banned for the same reason - whatever it was. <br /> <br /> I was initially confused when I thought Annie (Kelly Galindo) might have been different to Lacey, but she was no hassle with psychic visions of a bogeyman resembling that of the first movie. Fans will immediately notice that they are not the same person. <br /> <br /> Having seen a murder in a bathroom and also seeing the address, Annie, his psychiatrist and a parapsychology student who looks like the guy, have a lot of money on the cheap Romanesque novels and butter advertisements, go to the house, it's probably the same bathroom. 24 hours later, a murder happens as she described. Of course, we have no idea who this boobilicious woman is or why she was murdered. <br /> <br /> Then the movie changes to a resume of The Boogeyman story with some extra footage that we didn't see in the original. In particular, the boogeyman appears in contrast to the original. Unfortunately, some of the good scenes were cut, but 90% of it is there. Why bother this movie? Did they find the footage in the trash? What was the purpose? <br /> <br /> We never know, and despite the fact that the psychologist tells Annie that she is cured, we all know that bogeyman will never die.
