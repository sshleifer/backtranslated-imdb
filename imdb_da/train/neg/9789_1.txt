They should have called this movie: "Adopted mouse breaker that is slightly inspired by a person's vague recall of Stuart Little, who just kind of skim the book, but mostly only remembered the tire" If it wasn't so misleading, I would give it is better review. <br /> <br /> But serious people, do your kids a favor and get them to read the book. They can actually learn something instead of having their opinion judged by what we all know as Hollywood movies. The book Stuart little is not about a mouse, it's about someone who happens to be very small and mouse-like. He was born to his parents, not adopted. The book is about his life and his possible departure from home and the journey he begins. There is a cat named Snowball who thinks he's food and wants to eat him, but Snowball can't speak. <br /> <br /> In the film, they all screw up. I think the only things they kept from the book were the boat race and the names.
