In addition to all the technical flaws .... What about a female float who is able to kill 4 out of 7 terrorists herself (including ex marines), 2 of whom are without similarly using a gun So she lands the plane perfectly . We're not talking about Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton; We are talking about a regular, frightened, yet well-composed air force. : D What about the leader in charge of assault / rescue troop, having a complete assurance (according to the logic of the script) the plan to sleep-gassing everyone and having someone from his team fly the plane. Only he decides to immediately change plans and instead lead an attack on the terrorists, firearms, not knowing where the terrorists are or how many and not securing an advantage, so that his entire team is easily wiped out. Yes, it uses the old noggin. Only later to decide to use sleepwalking anyway. And it turns out useless for all intensive purposes. Bad as this movie was, even though I couldn't stop seeing and wondering what next? : D I can't help but imagine all the excellent, unemployed scriptwriters who think of themselves, it's not fair. laugh out loud! : D
