I remember this movie, exhibited in Barcelona (Spain) in 1970, currently in one week. Although it might seem incredible, and I can't offer any explanation for it, this movie was exhibited in a theater dedicated to ... movies of high quality and quality (that is, Bergman, Resnais, Malle, Bu√±uel and ... The projected man). Few people saw it (luckily people undoubtedly) and no reference to this very boring SF movie is found in the Peter Nichols Science Fiction Encyclopedia or about the author of the original novel. Very indicative. I remember, after all these years, a no-story, a lot of special effects that seem ridiculous and actually no more. It seems that time in some countries is 90 mm. and at anothers 77 min. Well, that means just a little more pain.
