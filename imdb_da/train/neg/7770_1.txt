This complete mess of a movie was directed by Bill Rebane, the man responsible for the truly infamous classic-class Monster a-Go Go. As I approach the end of the cold, I came to the incredible conclusion that this movie was actually worse than the 60's choke. The story ?? as it is ?? are about three eccentric millionaires inviting a group of people to their remote mansion to play a series of macabre games. Anyone who manages to keep pace and survive to the end will win $ 1,000,000. It's a very simple plot, but Rebane somehow manages to do things in an incomprehensible way. Things happen. Signs are completely forgotten. Nothing makes too much sense. And then it ends. Different. I mean, what the hell was that ending everything exactly? I think you are back to draw your own conclusions. Production values ​​and plays are undoubtedly a pornographic film standard. In fact, Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) is not even that good. She's so incredibly horrible, she's convincing. Unfortunately, one cannot say the same about this crap party as a whole, it's just a basement cellar rats.
