I was disgusted by this movie. No, it wasn't because of the graphic sex scenes, it was because it destroyed the image of Artemisia Gentileschi. This movie does not hold much truth about her and her art. It shows a work of art she did (Judith Beheading Holofernese), but shows that she was recorded as a testimony in the rape case when she did not paint her first Judith for a year after the trial. <br /> <br /> I don't know if you understood this from the movie, probably not, Tassi wasn't a noble character. He raped Artemisia. It was not love, it was rape. He claimed not to accept false arbitration reports to stop her from suffering while she was being tortured. According to the rapes, he continued to claim that he never knew carnally that Artemisia (aka had sex with) while repeatedly saying "It's true". I encourage all of you to go out and find out about the real Artemisia and see what she really is about. Do not base all your knowledge on this fictional movie. I encourage you to do some research, Artemisia really has an interesting story behind her and some amazing works of art. <br /> <br /> Don't watch the movie, but find the true story of Artemisia.
