I am surprised that anyone involved in the production of this series would actually admit responsibility. The script is so unfunny it must be written by someone who has beaten the entrance to the Canadian Comedy Writers' Union (and that says something!). Get out of your binoculars if you want, but there's nothing like a joke in sight. Ronnie Corbett must have been flat to dampen herself with this nonsense. The rest of the cast is so lacking in any kind of acting or comedic ability I am amazed at, past the first episode - correction, past the auditions. All I can say to those who are entertained by it is that they must be very easily entertained. And it is obvious that the cost of production must have been as much as â‚¤ 100 per. Episode. And just if someone thinks I'm commenting as a foreigner who is not familiar with English humor, I must add that I am actually English.
