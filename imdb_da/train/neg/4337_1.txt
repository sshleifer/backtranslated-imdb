This is just a slaughterhouse of a wonderful story by Edwin Torres. This movie does not follow the story in the book. And there are so many discrepancies with the original movie that you have to wonder if the manuscript itself had seen the first movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino (the original and still the best Carlito) comes out of prison at the start of the original. Here, Carlito goes with her woman in paradise. <br /> <br /> What happened to Gail from Lorain, Ohio? At this rate she is not mentioned, and Carlito joins and presumably will marry another girl. Where is Kleinfeld too? I think he was in the first book. <br /> <br /> I also like how Mr. Guzman plays a completely different character in this movie. He was Pachanga back in Pacino days. Now he is Nacho Reyes, a killer from Cuba. I remember that Nacho Reyes had a much larger role in the book. <br /> <br /> It's been a while since I read the book, but where did Sean Comb's character come from? I also think that this movie really shines over the racist tensions in Harlem that Torres wrote about. And the mob doesn't get the treatment they did in the book. They are also wiped out in this movie. But the cozy Avenue pile is magical for the other movie. <br /> <br /> The book told a great story. This movie could have told a great story. This is just a huge disappointment. Read the book. It's a better use of your time.
