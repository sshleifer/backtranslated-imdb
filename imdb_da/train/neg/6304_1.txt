As a WWII naval story buff and one that is not proud of the country's history of race, I was delighted to see this movie. What a disappointing piece of schlock. I did it about 3/4 of the way through, but I should have turned it off on the sub-attack scene. The idea that a U-boat would burn a torpedo with a DDE as if there was a hope of hitting it and then could "run away" from DDE while it was submerged is terrible. And that's just a little detail. The whole movie was badly written, badly directed and badly acted. I agree with others on this forum that this could have been a good movie. It's as if they decided that when all the crappy WWII propaganda films were made with white-white casts, they had to make one with black people. And just as bad as the old movies were, it's actually worse. And it almost tastes of false advertising for the headline Ossie Davis and Stephen Rea. It turns out that they had much smaller roles. I have to believe that the two fine actors were embarrassed to be associated with this movie. I'm done. I've given too much of my life this crap movie.
