This was one of the scariest movies we've seen in the last couple of months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad acting (mostly from the supporting characters). The interview with Hugh Laurie on the DVD was actually more rewarding than the movie itself ... Hugh Laurie clearly emphasized learning how to dance Samba, but the extent of his character only required him to immerse himself at the end of the pool. The film is based on the appearance of a lovely girl and good music, but these are not enough to make good entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen Rio or the inside of a UK bank, this movie is for you. 2 out of 10
