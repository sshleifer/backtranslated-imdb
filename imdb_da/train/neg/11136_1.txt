This is only the second time I've felt compelled to comment imdb on a movie. The first time was probably the best movie I've ever seen and that was for Memento. Seeing Darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to Memento, as in the worst movie I've had the accident to watch. Apart from the two scenes containing naked women, there is nothing in this movie to lift it from the trash. We are. <br /> <br /> Let's see, averting effects, clipped script, bad acting and about. 90 minutes long. My wife and I laughed mostly in dissatisfaction, how bad. Amazingly, I saw it to the end how I did what I didn't know! AVOID!!!
