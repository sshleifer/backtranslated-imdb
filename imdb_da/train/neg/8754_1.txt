This movie is really awful. After seeing the advertisement for it, I thought it could have its charm ... but it didn't. The girls cannot act, nor can they sing. The soundtrack for this movie is full of their songs, and it's not a beautiful sight, horrible storyline, incredible plot, it's one of Disney's worst movie of FAR! Ally is not a bad actress on "Futures Phil", so I don't know what happened to "Cow Belles". And her sister, AJ, just seems to be throwing a ride on her sister's "fame" and she doesn't show any talent whatsoever. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, the girls finally learn some clich√©s of morality, but it's too late to save this train wreck movie. <br /> <br /> Awful
