I would have given this movie a 1 out of 10 if it wasn't for ms. Claudine Barretto's performance. And I will take this time to overlook that Kris Aquino is here. and ... end. I really avoid seeing Pinoy horror movies because stories lack originality and I really believe that (some) authors do not give enough attention to the characters (and their progression) in their stories (redundant ??). It was as if they were 'pushing' the movie forward, as their narrative story stank. And my goodness, creative exhaustion led them to tear off other movies. Why?? why did this movie get a good review ?? I wouldn't give it that much profit. the movie was a bit scary but the movie seemed more freaky as it is about philippine folklore ... it goes into my list of 'most likely to happen' category. I would just have spent more time improving the narrative lines and making those flashback sequences, never remember if the lighting sucked, it wouldn't have much if the contents would blow you away .. SAYANG.
