Dreyfuss plays a mob boss who has lost his mind, but now he is "stuck". Lane is his girl who has shaken with his number one (Goldblum), who has something to do with Lane's sister (Barkin). <br /> <br /> With what anyone could consider a star-backing Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle MacLachlan and even a look of Richard Pryor) can't help this plot as Dreyfuss proves he's not "firm" and trying to kill almost everyone in sight. <br /> <br /> You know it's not like you didn't know what was coming. The first ten minutes were nothing, but guys are trying to tell Goldblum what was in store for him when Dreyfuss comes out, but I save you all the trouble: skip this movie. The real reason I chose this movie is because I've been on a Diane Lane kick lately and have tried to watch all her movies. The right downfall for me was not just the horrible plot, but also the fact that she didn't appear until the last fifteen minutes of the movie (even though we hear about her the whole movie). Although I'm a fan of over half of the cast, I can't help enjoying this movie. The parts where the voltage was to be mounted made me laugh what actually happened. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 stars.
