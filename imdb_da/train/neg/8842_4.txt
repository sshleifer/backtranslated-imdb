It says a bit that most of the great reviews for the movie at IMDb all come from people who have only gone through a movie throughout their IMDb career and yes you have guessed that the movie is "Parasomnia". I have often suspected suspiciously good reviews on IMDb for what turns out to be other than good movies as underhand marketing, but it seems quite transparent in this case. It's not saying Parasomnia is terrible, but it stops very well for being the good or big movie it had the potential. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, it has a big bad at Patrick Kilpatrick, who does a brilliant job that challenges threatening and evil, I could easily see him having what it takes to play a truly memorable baddie on the straight foot with Hannibal Lecter. There are some beautiful visuals in the dream sequences, in fact, if the film had decided to explore this terrain more, it could have been better. The actual concept of accidental abuse of hypnosis is also great. Although I understand the suspension of disbelief is necessary for immersion in any good story, it is a sign of a good story that succeeds in letting you do. If you find yourself annoyed by what you find illogical or just stupid, then the story tells you, and that's what happened to me with this movie. Other reviewers have mentioned this here and I do not want to enter the spoiler area, but I would say the setup at the end was particularly ridiculous and disappointing, not to mention the varying mental age of a character who should have experienced only a few years of life. All in all, there is a good idea here in diabolically abused hypnotism, but unfortunately this movie is not aware of anything special.
