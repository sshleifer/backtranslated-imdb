I saw Arthur (the TV shows and the books) many years ago and never liked the show much (if you're a fan of this cartoon, sorry if I spoil it for you, but that's actually what I think). Many people liked it, but I didn't. <br /> <br /> The schoolchild's characters seemed to be struggling all the time (especially Arther and DW), they were cozy with each other often, but as I got tired of Arthur's complaining attitude towards everyone and his sister DW (though the name spelled), and DW was an ADHD (or ADD) -like 4-year-old sister of Arthur who sometimes demanded (which could be why Arthur got annoyed with what her routines were like her imaginative friend and her stuffed animal collection, etc.). ), Arthur's friends worked as teenagers instead of what they were in the Arthurian books, and the parents didn't care about it. <br /> <br /> The biggest cartoon was Rocko's Modern Life, not Arthur (no offense).
