Music laughing at the nerves like nails on a tablet that seems so zombie-like, it was a shame to waste the cast by not making another movie; casting everyone in it like true zombies --- with the cast of Sabrina the teenaged witch as heroes ... a movie so downright awful that if "stoners" were still around it can be considered a cult movie --- but oh so amateurish , the scripts may just as well have been embraced by the actors, their lines read as they slowly intermixed through the movie --- banal, illogical sets modeled after LA subdivisions, props right from ToysRus! Was a movie ever made that is so complete and completely inaccurate ??? Logic flies to the wind in this plodding, meaningless, meaningless, and with a "monster" so stupid and uncoordinated that it couldn't catch a turtle in an icebox --- lowcut, leggy --- and amazon! It kept my attention all the way through; the way a horrible, ongoing chain accident in the fog involves in more vehicles keeps one to look at the very end ... as after a ridiculous ray-gun battle in a prison on another planet, a pneumatical-deprived sexy and mentally unbalanced bounty hunter chasing a retarded extra-terrestrial refugee --- FOREVER! Don't let anybody on your popcorn, you actually like to see this. It's so bad!
