This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Everyone involved should be embarrassed. Everybody. Ice-T is pitiful, the dialogue is absolutely horrible, and hokie does not begin to describe the notion of every actor in this movie. The foundation is heavily dependent on Executive Decision, but compared to Air Rage, Executive Decision Academy Award material. I have never been so disappointed when I watch a movie. Air Rage should be burned with its ashes locked in a vault, never to see the light of day. Anyone who has seen it must take a bath and wash the stink of horrible film out of them. The best part of this movie probably comes from the end when the credits rolled. This was easily the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ice-T should stick to law and order and the other people in this movie should retire early or commit suicide. In any case, they should never try to be in a movie again.
