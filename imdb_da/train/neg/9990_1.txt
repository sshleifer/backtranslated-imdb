After watching this movie on the SciFi channel, I can only conclude that this movie is made by a lot of amateurs who have never seen a movie in their lives. The film is an infinite number of bizarre events, or "delights" that friends' reading over my shoulder tells me. The reason is not really worth commenting on as, but basically flying an airplane carrying football players into the Yeti territory. Before the movie is over, we are treated to ripping out hearts, but we are waiting to run before we jump 50 meters, but ride a man's leg and hit him with them. A woman kills a 30-meter rabbit with a spear, a yeti surviving multiple spheres, and is fired without apparent damage, a yeti dangling out of a rock by holding on to a man's shoes, but then jumping off and a whole collection additional, bizarre occurrences. Basically, if you don't stop on a Saturday for the stated purpose of seeing the worst sci-fi channel movies, avoid this movie like the plague. Or as my friend reads over my shoulder says: "It's the best movie I've ever seen." To which vein to the right says: "Only combat techno music could have done better."
