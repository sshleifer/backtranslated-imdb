This is another production in North East Florida that is primarily filmed in and close to Fernandina Beach and Kingsley Plantation. I was a little surprised that the company could take over the main street in Fernandina Beach as long as it was necessary to reach the street scene. The movie is beautiful and pretty bad. Tami Erin is sweet, but overbearing. Eileen Brennan takes over even more. Good for young children or for those who like fluff in large doses. A 4 from Miller-Movies formula.
