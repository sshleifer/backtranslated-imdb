Kind of preoccupied with the erotic scenes, only to realize this was one of the most amateur and incredible pieces of movies I've ever seen. Kind of like a high school movie project. What was Rosanna Arquette thinking ?? And what about all those stock characters in the bizarre supposed Midwest city? Quite difficult to get involved with this one. No lessons to learn from it, no brilliant insights, just quiet and quite ridiculous (but lots of skin if it fascinates you) video recorded nonsense .... What was the bisexual relationship, out of nowhere, after all the heterosexual encounters. And what about the absurd dance where everyone played their stereotypical roles? Give this a pass, it's like a million other miles of bad, waste film, money that could have been spent on starving kids or AIDS in Africa .....
