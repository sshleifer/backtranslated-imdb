Is there nothing else on TV? Are you really bored? Now see Phat Beach. But don't rent it and don't buy it at all. It would be a big mistake. <br /> <br /> I watched this on TV and found myself laughing at certain points. I didn't laugh long and I didn't laugh hard. However, there were subtle jokes and comments I laughed at. If you're looking for an extremely fun "hood" movie then watch Friday. If you are looking for a strong emotional movie (something that this movie is trying to get rid of) watch something like hoop dreams or Jason's Lyric. If you are looking for some good black "booty" then see a Dominique Simone porn girl because the nudity of this movie is almost non-existent. But if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable, go see it. You will be a little amused. <br /> <br /> *** 3 out of 10 ***
