I'm bored around noon. 22, so I watched this movie. And I couldn't stop laughing. Everything was so ridiculous. The way the children appeared to be older than 11 just broke me up. One of the children had a ring that apparently killed people after 3 or so years. It gave me the impression that he would be a gangster. It is quite difficult to take small children seriously, especially when it comes to eating worms. They seem like everything is so big, as if Billy (the protagonist) doesn't eat the worms, so the world will end. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie for young children (except for the fact that a 5 year old says "penis") but not for teenagers or adults who do not want to waste their time.
