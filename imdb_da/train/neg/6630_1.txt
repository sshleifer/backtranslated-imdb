This so-called remake is awful. I went to see this tonight .. on the first day as the expectation and hype were too much for me to handle. But within the first half an hour we knew this was a disaster. It not only fits the hype that is created, but also interferes with the original blockbuster. The script had loopholes, editing was sloppy quite a few times. Mohanlal, an outstanding actor, did an okay job. Amitabh was okay. The director wanted to portray how bad his character is, but he went a bit overboard, resulting in it being heavy. Ajay, who is particularly fond of these kinds of roles, was also a disappointment. Let's not even get started on the new guy Prashant .. one would not be proud to start a career with something like this. Rajpal Yadav, who was cast in for a few laughs, couldn't even get a smile out of anyone because of his powerful humor and the sharp voice. Nisha Kothari turned out to be one of the worst actresses we have today. All in all, RGV, as I thought, was one of the most talented and gifted directors India has had .. miserably failed. He took such a big challenge and responsibility to rebuild what is known as the best Hindi movie ever and made a mess of it.
