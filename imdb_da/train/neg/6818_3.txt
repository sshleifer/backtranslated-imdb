in this movie joe pesci dunks a basketball. joe pesci ... and be consistent, the rest of the script is not as credible. <br /> <br /> pesci is a fun guy who saves this movie from sinking the absolute back of the basement, but the other roles were pretty bad. The father was a greedy businessman who appreciated money more than people, which was not even well played. Instead of the man being an archetypal villain, he seemed more like an amoral android programmed to make money at all costs. then there is the token piece that is assigned to pesci as a girlfriend or something ... i can't even remember ... she was forgettable. <br /> <br /> Anyone who judges this movie over a 5 or 6 is a paid member of a kind of movie studio trying to uproot this sunken movie or at least one of the millions of media that can't criticize effectively (you know the people who feel bad if they give something a mark below 6). <br /> <br /> Stay away ... far away. and shame on the comedy central where I watched this movie. they usually choose better.
