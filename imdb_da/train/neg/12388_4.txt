** WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILS ** <br /> <br /> If you can get out of the extremely unpleasant issue, this movie offers a heaping using monstrous campy melodrama. Surprisingly, this movie has been copied and torn several times over the years, although it is difficult to understand that any film producer is inspired by this trashy drama. None of the Hemingway women can shop here (although Mariel has improved over the years), Anne Bancroft offers the only contact of the class as a prosecutor, and Chris Sarandon is in turn pathetic and unintentional fun as the smirky, smarmy bad guy of the piece. <br /> <br /> Veteran director Lamont Johnson cannot make a silk bag out of this sauce ear of a manuscript stuffed to burst with howling bad dialogues and incredible situations. For example, the last sequence in which Margaux grabs his shotgun and hunts Sarandon down after his latest shocking action, is supposed to be exciting, but provokes cordial chuckles instead. Add a notoriously sharp and spacy musical score by Michel Polnareff, and you have a real guilty pleasure, although you will probably feel unclear and need a hot shower after seeing it. Don't say you weren't warned.
