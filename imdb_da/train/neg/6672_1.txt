I'm 47 years old and I've spent so much of my life as I can remember, a fan of horror and sci-fi movies. Be they quiet, black and white, no budget or big budget, there are very few of them that I can't find anything to like. Having said that, I give this movie credit good effects and creativity, but that's all. This is a case of impact over history. The truth is, we are living in a time when there is very little left that is not seen in a horror movie. Therefore for a movie of any kind to really entertain it must have a good, original story. A good story can overcome bad effects and bad plays, but a bad story with good acting and good effects is still a bad movie. This movie doesn't even have good plays, only good effects. So unless you can only do it, send this one up.
