If you've read the original novel that I did, you'll probably hate this thing. <br /> <br /> The film production of _Absolute Beginners_ is a nightmare conglomerate of the 1980s anachronism that attempts to create a "period piece" set in the late 1950s and fails to recreate or even pay tribute to the period - the American monster of _Dirty Dancing_ corresponds to 1963, except that movies proved to be financially successful despite equally amateur screenwriting. In addition to suffering "looking out for the 1980s, the characters have been changed, rearranged and downgraded to the point that the only characteristics they have in common with the novel are the least superficial appearance and of course their names: Suze is transformed from the narrator's fleeting ex-boyfriend and promiscuous negrophile who intentionally plan to marry a tight old queen for money (by own access on the first few pages) for a rude and naive "Eve" sheet of seduction by fame and glamor, exploited and somehow scammed in a sham marriage by her boss, who surprisingly did not get a Van Dyke and cuddly hairstyle, she and the narrator, the name "Colin" (after the book's author, Colin MacInnes) for the movie, are also in a relationship. <br /> <br /> Big Jill's character, a lesbian seemingly butch, still "fop as" in the mid-20s, seems like a pimp to a cadre of young and bubbly headed lesbians, and one of narrator's closest e friends who give out honest wisdom to the narrator are reduced to a kind of "named extra" with only a few throw-away lines and tons of comical outfits. <br /> <br /> The Fabulous Hoplite, a gay young man and another near narrator's narrator in the novel, is also reduced to being meaningless in the movie, camped-up and anything but ignored. The narrator's father in the novel is a kind of sad lesser character, but in the film he plays to come out as optimistic and strangely spirited in spite of the quirky neighborhood, and the burning of his marriage with the narrator's mother works for all practical purposes ignored. <br /> <br /> For the sake of music (for what it is) is well composed and you need to give the production and writing crew credit to take a line from the book ("some days they will write musicals about 1950" er ... ... as their inspiration for writing a musical, but in the world of bad camped-up musicals, this is among the most poorly executed in the pile. Unlike _Shock Treatment_ or _Starstruck_ crucial plate elements are considered as reflection. Unlike _The Apple_, there is a rude and uneven flow between music tracks and spoken dialogue. You really cannot blame it "for the 1980s" feel it was created in the 1980s. The movie edition of _Annie_ released in 1981 pays a wonderful well-done tribute to the look and feel of New York City in the 1930s, and _Napolean Dynamite_ manages to capture a gritty kind of look and feel of the 1980s, even if made on a low budget in 2003 (although not explicitly set in the 1980s, those who lived through the decade may not deny that the film "feels very 1980s"). It was clear that it was possible to do something good about this, especially considering the iconic status that the source overview has in the UK, but it fails most in apparent appearance and feeling, and also in the treatment of the source material, which is completely unnoticed. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if you have not read and do not intend to read the novel, you can enjoy this anarchy of this campy 1980's, giving a shameful parody of the late 1950s Soho London's modernist jazz set . I can definitely see what the writing team was trying to do, but they could certainly have done better. With Boy George as a household name and mixed race musicians and bands on the cards in 1986 in the UK, they certainly do not have to bowler the characters in the ways they ended up doing. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the authors ran what both the book and the film criticized hard - it ended up having a lot of adults who smashed out the crap and treated the targeted teens audience as two-bit idiots to do a quick buck off of.
