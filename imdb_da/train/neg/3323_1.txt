I have seen many cartoon movies or animated movies because I have a baby girl who likes watching TV. I started watching this movie to see if I want my little one to see it ... and no. In the beginning, I thought it was such a sweet movie as the Bambi movie, but all the way it was like the inquisitor ducky was a gay. The information said they were making fun of him because he was not good at sports, but that was not the case. It just seems like a movie made for kids to learn to be okay to be gay. It was also very sad, as far as ducky father and everyone. I don't know if you are gay, you want it, but I don't think I will see it again with my little one.
