This is one of the most clever, unclear, unoriginal and pointless movies ever made! It almost feels like everyone involved in this project didn't even try to make an appealing movie. This is no more than a continuation of a tiring series of movies trying to deposit the success of Smokey and Bandit, which I think is the best movie of them all. Regarding this waste of movie stores, Burt Reynolds slept his way through the entire movie, Jim Nabors is wasted, the other actors don't get much to do, the car's race is of course stock footage, humor is uninspired and many of the scenes are more boring and lifeless than staring at a wall for two hours. "Stroker Ace" is simply a superfluous movie with nothing unique or distinctive about it.
