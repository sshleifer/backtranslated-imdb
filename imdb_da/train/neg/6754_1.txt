The only reason I bother to comment on this movie is to save you all 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money. I bought it ex-rental for Â£ 3.00, it looked interesting so I took a chance. <br /> <br /> Within minutes of turning it on, I realized I had made a mistake. The entire throw should be stored away for the winter and then thrown to the nearest fireplace where they could meet more of their kind. <br /> <br /> Regarding Devin Hamilton (Writer and Director), he must just be shot, unfortunately it should have been done before he made this nonsense. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you see it in the store run away. <br /> <br /> 1/10
