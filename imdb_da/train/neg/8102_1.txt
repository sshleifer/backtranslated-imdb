Oh, I heard so much about this movie. Went to see it with my best friend (she's a woman I'm a man). Now let me give me a divergent meaning from the ordinary. After the first few dozen "take off clothes," we both felt a very strange combination of stupidity and boredom. We laughed (don't know about it) we died (and would have been better at bed), we were convinced we had spent money in vain. And we had. The plot was incoherent, and the characters were a group of people about whom it was impossible to care for. Waste of money, waste of celluloid. This movie does not deserve one of ten votes, but it is the lowest available. I'm not sure why this movie has the reputation it makes to be excellent; I do not recommend it to anyone who even has taste or intelligence.
