I caught this a few months ago on the Family Channel, and had some memories of the TV show from my youth, decided to watch it with my 4-year-old daughter. I should have got some psychedelic mushrooms to go along with it, because it's just bizarre! Not only is it a musical with annoying forgetful melodies, the necessary cheese objects and cameos of stars far beyond their collective primates, it seems to have been produced as a person's good acid turn. Speaking whistles, British children too old for this kind of shit ... with Krusty Klown's words "uuuuuugggghhhhh! What was I on?" If you are a big fan of all Sid and Marty Krofft oeuvre, go for it; Otherwise, unless you are willing to be looped before you see, remain far, far, far away.
