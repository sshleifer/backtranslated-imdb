Dialogue: stylized, cliché; Acting: hammy, clichéd; Plot: predictable, cliché. <br /> <br /> What does Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski do in this "B" waste? Plummer was well-established decades before this movie was made, Kinski had masterpieces like "Tess" and "Cat People" behind her ... Maybe have been desperate. The bad ones all have a bad guy accents - * bad * bad guy accents! (Plums especially! Where * did he * learn to do "German"?) And most of them also have a bad guy. The innocent onlookers all exaggerate their panic enough to make you laugh. The good guy survives, among other things: * a 5 "throw knife buried hilt deep in his shoulder - just pull it out and seconds later using his arm without any problems without problems * marines machine gun fire (I think someone referred to a .50) in the leg, as he sorts out by tying a bandage around his trouser leg, and then he hardly has a lukewarm; * several fist fights, where he maintains several strokes to the face, and to run skull First in a door frame * A fall backwards from what looks like The third floor on the track, without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other such inconvenience, the script has exactly 3 clever lines, the rest of the time it is so boring and boring, it is not that bad, Plummer brings a certain class off and is undoubtedly the best actor in this flick, it does not say much, but he can make the modest villain without resorting to the hamming techniques. Most of the bad guys use here deliver his "ve haff vays and meance" type lines d some threat, but you are always aware that you see Christopher Plummer acting the villain. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a terrible waste of time. The action, as it is, is a kind of 70's movie from Trine Line 007 in movies that meets Bruce Lee's very obviously fake battle scenes, but it's not even as good as either a Roger Moore 007 or a Bruce Lee movie. Do not want to.
