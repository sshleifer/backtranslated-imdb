The word "1st" in the title has more vicious significance for the viewers of this movie than for its victims of crime. At least, they do not have to stick and see that this interminable movie reaches its own death. First, refer to: 1. draft a script; 1. is used in each performance of the final film; 1. editing in post production; etc etc <br /> <br /> The movie is not thrown too badly, it's just that everything about the movie comes out as worse than the third movement, from the goofy script to wood performances. And while suffering through this cobbled film, at the 2 hour mark, you'll be put out of your misery. In 160 minutes, it is clear that it should have been edited for under 2 hours. <br /> <br /> Entering the details of the lame script and the play serves small purposes. Even in just as awful, Lake Placid, at least the performances Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda built out of an extremely weak script, were nuanced enough to make you laugh in the movie. In the first to the door, one even ends up making sure only the time lost in waiting to see what happens after the opening of the preparation of the women's suicide. Editing is so bad that you are never introduced to one of the main characters, which I think (never really told) is a DA. Of course, the stage where she was introduced to the viewer fell on the editor's floor. And no one understood that a character radiating anywhere was an unusual filmploy. <br /> <br /> In one word, don't waste your time with this one. My wife and I do not want us. But at least we created our own derivations by commenting on different places in the movie as if it were the Mystery Science Theater. "Meanwhile in Cleveland ..." !!!!
