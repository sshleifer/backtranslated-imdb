This is actually weird movie ... First of all, we have a former American gymnast who tries to turn actor (or something) and it seems to be the only role he has ever had (which I still know) for good reason. While pulling that role well enough to hold some interest, it is a rather bland and flat performance. Second, we have the WORST EVER sound effects ever used in a movie !!! I'm not making fun. This alone makes the movie extremely comical, but in the annoying way. hehe And thirdly, while we have a generally decent functioning support casting (including the necessary hot chick!), an actual not so bad story and some cool visual images; The dialogue, battle scenes involving gymnastics (fun!), and the overall performance of the plot are weak. This movie would have been barely better than a network television movie (too bad Fox wasn't around in 1985). It's one of the movies that is simply bad, but you can't resist seeing and even enjoying it when you're used to it, especially now that it has found the perfect eternal home on sennat tv and cable.
