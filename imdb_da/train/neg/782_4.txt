Outside the fact that George Lopez is a pretentious jerk, his show is terrible. Nothing about Lopez has ever been fun. I have seen his stand-up and have never expressed any resemblance to a laugh. His stuff comes across as revenge and his enmity against white people radiates out of every pore in his body. <Br /> <br /> I have laughed at white people jokes from many a comedian and love many of them. <br /> <br /> This guy has a courage that won't end. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for Hispanics who only have this show to represent. <br /> <br /> The series plots are always cookie cutter with a Spanish accent. <br /> <br /> Conserving grin on the stupid comments and scenes. <br /> <br /> May be why this show is always at 2:00 in replay.
