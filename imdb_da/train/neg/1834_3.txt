I can't say much about this movie. I think it speaks for itself (like the current reviews here). I rented this two years ago and I told it completely. I myself / tried / liked it by seeing it twice, but I just couldn't. I can safely say that I definitely do not want to see this waste of time ever, ever again. And I'm not one to separate a movie, but I really think it was terrible. It wasn't even fun at least. The only bits I enjoyed were the few scenes with Christopher Walken in them. I think this movie destroyed both Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me. All I can think of when I see one of their movies one day is this horrible movie and it reminds me not to waste my money. Amy Poehler is also so much annoying. <br /> <br /> All in all, I think you get my point. The stars are for Walken by the way.
