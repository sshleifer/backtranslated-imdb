The distinguished writer Mark Redfield (like Edgar Allen Poe) is trying to conquer ancient dependencies and start a new life for himself as a publisher of Baltimore, Maryland. However, blackouts, delirium and rejection threaten to counteract his efforts. He also wants to revive romance with an old girlfriend, a markedly inadequate view, as things turn out. Mr. Redfield also directed this dramatization of the mysterious last days of Edgar Allen Poe. Redfield employs a lot of black and white, color and trick photography to create mood. Kevin G. Shinnick (as Dr. John Moran) works well, relatively speaking. It is not enough.
