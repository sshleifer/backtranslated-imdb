Primal Species (1996, Dir. Jonathan Winfrey) <br /> <br /> International terrorists get a surprise when their cargo turns out to contain live dinosaurs. The army command line should now think quickly if they want to prevent the extermination of the human species instead of the reptiles. <br /> <br /> You look at the cover and you get your first impression of the movie. That's pretty much it. The action is only acceptable from a few characters. The story is poor, with the whole movie based on the army and the marines trying to kill the dinosaurs. This movie came out three years after 'Jurassic Park'. Instead, this movie seems to have come out 13 years before 'Jurassic Park'. The dinosaurs costumes are so poorly made and I mean costumes. Of course, there are people dressed up and this movie makes no attempt to store this. A scene where a dinosaur runs down a corridor is created in a way that looks like someone is running on the creature. That's a good thing coming out of this movie. The short run time. In just 1 hour and 15 minutes, it doesn't waste too much of your life but still tries to avoid it altogether. <br /> <br /> "It's like a Friday the 13th night." - Officer (Brian Currie)
