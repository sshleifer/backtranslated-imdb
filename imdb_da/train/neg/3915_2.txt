This movie is not only badly written and directed, but is simply uncomfortable. A beautiful novel is terribly wrong in this movie. Many changes have been made to the story, presumably to streamline the time frame. But what results are simply confusing. The action cannot overcome the script, which removes the characters' motives for their behavior. Plus, the conversion to English does not work when everyone refers to the patriarch Esteban as the ESteban. Terrible. Please read the beautiful novel, if possible in Spanish. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. It will ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience.
