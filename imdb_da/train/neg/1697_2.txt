I'm a big fan of David Lynch and have everything he's made on DVD except for the Hotel Room and 2 hour Twin Peaks movie. So when I found out, I immediately took it and ... and ... what is this? It's a bunch of crudely drawn black and white cartoons that are loud and scary and unfunny. Maybe I don't know what's good, but maybe it's just a lot of crap that was foisted on the public by the name of David Lynch to make a few bucks. Let me make it clear that I didn't care about the foul language part, but had to continue adjusting the sound because my neighbors might have. All in all, this is a very disappointing release and may well have been left in the deluxe box as a curiosity. I strongly recommend that you do not spend your money on this. 2 out of 10
