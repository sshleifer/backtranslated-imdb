Curiosity led me to this "masterpiece". Unfortunately, I have not rented it, I bought it! The most disturbing thing about this movie is that it is not so disturbing. For reasons known only to them, the filmmakers represented the human side of Jeffry Dahmer. Are you kidding me? The man gave new meaning to the phrase "finger lickin" well "! And with all the flashbacks and flash-forwards, I had trouble following the story. Overall, Jeremy Renner's performance wasn't that bad. You can catch him in" SWAT "where He plays a disgruntled ex-cop Anyway, I would rate this as a 1/10, it only got a 1 because of Renner's so-so performance, there are plenty of books and TV documentaries out there that make a lot better work to cover Dahmer's crimes.
