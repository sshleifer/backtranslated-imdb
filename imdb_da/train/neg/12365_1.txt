I think this piece of waste is the best proof that good ideas can be destroyed, why all American animators believe the kids these days will have stupid GI JOE versions of good stories ??? Looney Tunes are some of the most beloved characters in history, but they were not created to be Xtreme, I mean, come now !!! Tiny Toons was a good example of how an old idea can be updated without losing its original charm, but this waste is just an example of stupid business decisions that only want to make a cheap idiotic show that children will love because hey! ! ! kids love superheroes right ??? the whole show is just a waste of time, when we see the new versions of Looney Tunes, but this time in superhero form, it doesn't sound that bad, but the problem is that this show is trying too hard to copy series like Batman the animated series, or the new legal league, the result ??? bad copies of flash (road runner) or superman (who else ??? bugs bunny) the problem is that Looney Tunes was not meant to be dramatic, they should be fun !!!! as I said before this series sucks, and many wonder why anime is taking over the world ??? this show is trying to be dramatic and action-packed, but it is something that few series and anime can do if you want to see a good upgrade of an old show from Tiny Toons, this is an example that it is possible to bring back to life old characters, but with a good story and respect for the original roots. Too bad that the show is already dead, another corporate wise decision I suppose.
