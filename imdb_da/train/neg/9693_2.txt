The superheated plot of "Bonjour tristesse" is taken from a juvenile first novel by Francoise Sagan, who became a best seller, even though God knows why. For teenagers who want to get rid of a potential step-parent, it may have some appeal. Don't be caught by the fact that David Niven plays the playboy father and Deborah Kerr step-mother prospect. Unfortunately too much is resting on Jean Seberg's fragile shoulders. She is beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is she can strike, but she can't act. Anyone who saw her as Joan of Arc in Otto Preminger's St. Joan - Seberg's first film - knows she couldn't handle 19 of wearing a movie. This film, also by Preminger, fulfills the "promise" of the first. It was her second movie; she was now 20. What was Preminger's thinking? That Niven and Kerr could compensate for Seberg's lack of action? Not a chance? Seberg's character is in the middle of history, and although she is convincing, although she may be physically 17 years old, she cannot fulfill the emotional demands of the role. I don't know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she didn't influence my consciousness in her later pictures. But anyone who thinks this movie is better than mediocre needs a taste. Despite Niven and Kerr, this is a juvenile story performed in the juvenile fashion by a beautiful young girl who badly needs acting.
