I bought this movie exciting a gloriously free, over-the-top, entertaining carnage. I didn't get any of them. This movie fails at virtually every level, not at least frightening or fun, it's simply horrible movie production and never gives the audience anything worth seeing. What is so bad about is that far from being as cruel, violent and brutal as it had promised to be, there is very little violence at all. Almost no blood shed, and no tension at all. Action, direction and dialogue are absolutely unbearable. Honestly, it's really ridiculous. I could hardly sit through this total garbage once; I will definitely never see it again. Don't waste your time wasting celluloid like this; It really is possibly the worst movie ever made. If I could give it less stars, I would.
