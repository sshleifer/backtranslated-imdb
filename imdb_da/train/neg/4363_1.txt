It's hard to find any positive in this movie. It seems that the manufacturer needs to make a buck without much effort and therefore we are treated to a full view of the Galaxy, which is the lame excuse for a movie in history. Police girls looked extremely sexy in their little uniforms. More action shots of the two police and much less of the galaxy would have been the way to go. Of course, it would add to the budget so they decided to fill the room with the miserable noise. Ms Albright looks good sexy and her acting is first rate. Mrs Stabs, whom I had heard of but not seen on the screen before, also looked very desirable, but seems to lack basic actor talent. Apart from Mrs Albright, this is true garbage.
