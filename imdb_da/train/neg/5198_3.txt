This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but I really can't remember when I've seen a worse one. I thought it would be a plane crash investigation. What it really was was a soap opera and a bad one. They overplayed the "conflict" card to the extreme. The first hour or so seems like a shouting fight, with some unlikely scenes thrown in. <br /> <br /> * Possible spoiler * <br /> <br /> The 40-or-so-minute "memorial" scene (with required black umbrellas and rain) for fictional victims was paralyzed and I thought it never would end. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs unless you enjoy 'conflict'. <br /> <br />
