Let's see, here are the "highlights" of the Brain Machine: 15 creation of shots by a pool and a house; 15 creation of shots of an indefinite office building; 5 countdowns of a gentle technician; 7 close-ups of a threatening guard; and a myriad of technical bubbles to show us that this is a high-tech experiment. <br /> <br /> Various posters have commented on the discrepancy between the 1972 copyright date and the release date given on the DVD box of 1977. It is easy to explain. This dog simply sat on the shelf untouched for five years until someone dusted it and thought it fit perfectly into the post-Watergate mood of mistrust in government. Having seen The Brain Machine now, my only wonder is that it was ever released!
