I remember seeing this movie several times as a very young child and there were parts of it (many actually) that I didn't understand. I think I've seen it once as an adult, and then I understood these parts. The only problem with seeing it as an adult was that it wasn't entertaining for me at all. So what kind of movie is this? Is it a "kids movie"? Not hardly. It contains language and topic that is not suitable for children. Is it a hyperbole of what each parent feels they are going through with their own children? Maybe, but why wouldn't it focus more on John Ritter's character instead of Junior? When a movie has a 7-year-old as a protagonist, in order to cope with the audience, it should be a movie for the seven and spectators, otherwise older than it may have no way to relate (even 8-year-olds would not see one film about a child who is completely younger than them). I'm pretty sure this movie didn't work well in the box office and the reason is that it couldn't find a niche on the market.
