Predictably, a thousand times told the story of the usual drama, a couple of beautiful, raunchy sex scenes mixed with some character paranoia, 70-year-old random violinsky music that is comical at times, I couldn't help chuckle to myself. /> <br /> I usually like Defoe and it has to be said that the play is not so bad that the "plot" develops at a reasonable pace and keeps you guessing from time to time. It's just that it's too predictable, I felt like I was watching a TV drama made instead of a new movie. Maybe it's the style the directors wanted, but it must be said that the review I read here before I saw the movie could only be written by someone involved in its production. Don't expect too much, and if I could win the clock back, I wouldn't have gone to see it at the cinema. I would wait for the Copenhageners in your video store, I'm sure it won't take long.
