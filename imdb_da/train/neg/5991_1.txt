ba ba ba bored ...... this is next to the battlefield ground in science fiction slumberness. genie francis (aka general hospital's laura) has a small role as a reporter and it should in itself tell you that this movie should be bad .... there are ben kingsley (an academically award winning actor) in this stink and a few others decent players. You have to wonder what they had to decide to make this horrible movie. The music goes up and down dramatically, as is a great dramatic story. Although you are aware, the plot is impossible to follow. The effects are also mediocre and seem really dated. All the actors speak in a monotonous voice and have no realism for their dialogue. I could go on with how this is a bad movie. At least with Battlefield Earth, it's so bad it's fun, but it's just gonna be nonsense. Avoid unless you're lulled to sleep.
