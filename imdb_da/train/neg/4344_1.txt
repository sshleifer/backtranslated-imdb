If you hit your head with a shovel, write the script with your feet, you can get close to the intelligence level of this movie. There is nothing in this movie that has not been made a thousand times in other gangster flicks and done much better. Those who think "Scarface" were kind of looking up to or so "Goodfellas", "Menace II Society" or "Dead Presidents" and thought MMM "It's life for me!" will like this movie. I thought I'd give the movie a chance, as the premise was perfect for a prequel. I should have known better after seeing Mario Van Peebles and Sean Combs involved. Anyone over a 4th grade education, see the original with Pacino, a real actor and be happy.
