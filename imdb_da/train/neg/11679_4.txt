First, this movie is not a "thriller". It is also not "gripping, tight". It could have been so based on the manuscript, but the slow pace of the direction makes it difficult to enter. The plot itself is very interesting and brilliant. Unfortunately, we only get a feeling of * how * brilliant after the picture is over. It leaves us with over two hours long sequences of music played over those characterized by some action scenes that do not address the viewer and "cunning vixen" scenes that provide slightly more open intelligence. <br /> <br /> I wish this was the fast thriller that the box promised. It would have been an excellent movie. Instead, Spike Lee made the plod together through the end.
