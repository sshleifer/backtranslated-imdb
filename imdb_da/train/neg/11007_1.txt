Most recently, they have tried to hack this movie late on cable TV commercials. Don't believe the hype. I was one of the unfortunate people to see this stink in theaters. This is, in my opinion, the 3rd worst movie of all time, just behind Mac & Me (# 1 worst) and Jack Frost (# 2 worst), but I have to admit they are all dense and all AWFUL! Really, none of this movie is fun or disturbing, or anything else it claims to be, don't waste your money. The only thing that is good for it is to give to your worst enemy. I'm not lying. Someone who you would love to kill or torture would be a leading candidate for this movie. It is so terrible. If you do not believe in me, you deserve to suffer through the misery of seeing this which I doubt you can end. Two Thumbs Enthusiastic Down.
