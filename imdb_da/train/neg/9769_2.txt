I read this Thornton Wilder game last year in eighth grade. I was also forced to sit through this weak translation on the screen. Let me tell you, it's not a great game, it's easily surpassed, but man it deserves a much better shot. The actor really lacked, the scene - honest to God - looked like it was made of cardboard by a group of three-year-olds. As if it couldn't get any worse, the sound quality is miserable ... there's this insane "buzz" when an actor speaks ... and I couldn't help but notice that chemistry between George and Emily, Well, is not- existing. The actors all seem very uncomfortable to be there. There is no music. It's in black and white, which would be ok, but it brings it more out of cheesiness. In any case, I think that if you want to make a point of seeing this movie that I don't really reccomend, don't aim your hopes to high. The game, as stalwart as it is, is probably better.
