Give me my money back! Give me my life back! Give me some credit. This movie was worthy of vomiting. Unusable and time consuming. What a waste of energy and totally meaningless. Okay, I understand the premise and the idea sounds, but give us a break! Next time just give me the money and let me use it. Lost children, mothers regret, blame man! Clich√© ja ~! Get a life! Sorry, but this movie was a total waste of my time, my money and my being. I'd rather see the egg cook! No real explanation for why this happened. Prison? Why? Loss? obvious but why? Actor deserves a What do I do here Oscar and cinematography a Should I just make it a salary? How much did this movie make? Well, this stupid fool hired a copy. Enough said
