I just blew four dollars to rent this movie! Why Alliance Atlantis would promote such a bad excuse for a movie is beyond me. But even more surprising were the relatively good reviews that a couple of Canadian newspaper critics gave this movie. I'm tired of our media justifying a movie simply because it's Canadian and low budget. It's as if they expect Canadian movies to be miserable, so they give it a good review regardless. <br /> <br /> Now about the movie: The actor was below average (except for the leading male character who was actually pretty good). The film quality was poor, which I would expect from the extremely low budget. The script was absolutely horrible. One example is the story of one of the protagonists, a female drug trafficking flirting with one of her clients so that she can recruit him to repair and steal bikes for her gang whose sole purpose is to Destroy SUVs randomly. Probably many of her gang members' bikes are destroyed in these activities (I don't know how she can't afford just to buy new ones as she is supposed to be this great drug dealing link from Vancouver to Toronto). <Br. In any case, the point of history (which is not revealed until well over halfway through the movie) is that the drug dealer is planning to build firebomb buildings in the Toronto area to try and make houses more affordable - as no one would like to live in the area. <br /> <br /> - Should I say more. <br /> <br /> Shame on the Toronto Film Festival to accept such a film, Telefilm to support it and Globe and Mail and Georgia Straight newspapers to provide such biased reviews. <br /> <br /> A movie shouldn't get special treatment just because it's Canadian !!
