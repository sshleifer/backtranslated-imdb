It is clear to see why the creators of Scary Movie found it so easy to forge these teenage slasher movies. They are so incredibly formal. And if Valentine had been released some year before, I'm sure they would have confused this movie too - if they found some original material to distinguish it from Screams, I know what you did last summer and Urban Legends. <br /> <br /> Valentine offers nothing new to this genre, except a better than usual end, which of course leaves plenty of room for the inevitable successor. As always, a masked psychotic killer closes a bunch of beautiful young women and kills the protagonist's friends, one by one, typically over the top style. Lots of T&A on display, no sign development, bad acting and excessive bloodshed. <br /> <br /> What I can't handle these kind of movies is that they leave themselves as "who did it?" The thing is, they're not because the motive is only revealed when the killer has worn off and tells the protagonist whose friends have now all been murdered. Normally nothing was made clear under the film (eg the protagonist's mother's uncle's fisherman's partner kicked his father's father's dog). "suspect," but they are more "Red Herrings" than suspects. As we all know at this time, the main character manages an inappropriate escape and kills the unopened psychic murderer after the subject is revealed. ************ SPOILER !!!!!! (mini spoiler anyway) *************** In Valentine, the motif was not revealed but more, abandoned to think about, since the film did not fully conclude in the typical 'teen slash' way, the question is only partially solved, and the goal of the main kill Cannot be fulfilled by surviving bloodshed and killing almost everyone. Will the killer want more, or were the demons really overcome? <br /> <br /> This still didn't make Valentine a good movie, but instead it just saved being as bad as normal, which still doesn't count too much. For anyone thinking of making another movie this way, don't do it. Originality is so important and it's hard to see any originality coming out of this genre.
