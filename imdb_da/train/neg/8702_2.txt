This is one of the silliest films I've ever had the accident to see! I should have expected it after I saw the first two, but I continue to be suckered into these types of movies with the idea of ​​"Maybe they did it right this time". Nope - not even close. <br /> <br /> Where do I start? What about the special effects ... To give you an idea of ​​what fits SFX in this movie, a soldier at one point shoots a "Raptor" as it runs down one time. Even with less than a second of the screen time, the viewer can easily see that there is only one man with a tail who apparently is the wallpaper for him who runs around. Bad bad bad. <br /> <br /> What about the actor? If that's what you can call it. There's a sign I'm supposed to be from the south. But having lived in the south for six years now, I have never heard this way of speaking. Perhaps he has some kind of strange disability - inability to speak normally. I find it fascinating that the character does nothing that requires him to have that accent - therefore there was no reason why the actor tried to do one. <br /> <br /> What about the plot? It's pretty basic - Raptor's escape, people with weapons must chase them down. I'm starting to wonder why the dinosaurs in these movies always seem to run into the nearest subway system ... wouldn't they stay out to hunt prey? Oh yes, at least they have the good sense of appearing very little in the film, which apparently is about them. <br /> <br /> Other things - Let's say you're in a building and you know there's a man eating raptors running around it. Would you decide to take the time to have an argument about who is better - Army or Marine? And then decide to have an arm wrestling competition to settle it? What about the idiotic idea that they should track the raptors - Divided into groups of two. Have they never seen any horror movies (or at least an episode of Scooby Doo)? In short, this is one of the stupid movies out there. Don't miss it unless you want to groan your way through a movie.
