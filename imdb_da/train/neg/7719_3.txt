The easiest way to describe this movie is like a satire. Satire's goal is quite large, from the US government to corporate America. Nor is it a stinging satire, but rather a silly. Think of this movie as a mix of Kentucky Fried movies, the Airplane and the Police Squad series, made with a much smaller budget and not as fun. I can see how this movie is a satire of many sci-fi disaster films from the 50s and 60s. I see this movie as a big influence on Tim Burton's Mars Attacks. <br /> <br /> The reason is simple enough. Genetically developed giant tomatoes go "crazy" and begin to attack people and cities. Initially there is a cover up and then it blows up in full blown war. The movie runs the spectrum of characters and characterizations: Lois "Fairchild" (a Lois Lane clone), a very ambitious president Press consultant, Clark Kent, Mason Dixon (FIA agent who has not worked since the Pigs Bay), a useless president (who only thinks being able to sign his name and attacking New York), an equally unfortunate congress, a dizzying marketing manager and Mason's team of an overweight East German "female" swimmer, a diver, a Galician world warrior writer and an African American disguise specialist (disguised as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Hitler and finally as tomato). Did I also forget to mention many and many tomatoes? There are all kinds of tomatoes from small tomatoes to giant plastic tomatoes, smashed tomatoes, tomato juice and finally to people dressed up as tomatoes. <br /> <br /> On top of all this you have a few musical figures as well. They are not so good and seem to be dubbed. The best tune is by far the theme of the movie ("Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"). It's way too prison and you can end up starving or singing it publicly. Be warned. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is quite funny and shows the absurdity of various real-life situations as well as various entertainment genres. I don't think I was induced to laugh, but mostly my head smiled and scratched. I definitely recommend this movie to fans of B and C grade movies, but only as a rental. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
