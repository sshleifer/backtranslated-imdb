During the Civil War, there were many cases of shared loyalty; Of course, many "in the border states" arose where the north met south by the coincidence of geography. From the border, young father Owen Moore goes out to join the Union Army. In short, the Confederate soldier Henry B. Walthall, separate from his regime, wanders over enemy property, desperate for water; He finds a supply where Unionist's young daughter Gladys Egan sits. When the Yankee soldiers track him, Little Gladys innocently helps the Confederate hide. Later, when he returns to kill his father, the little girl's kindness is remembered. A sweet little story from Director D.W. Griffith. Placement images and humanity appear lovingly. <br /> <br /> **** In the border states (6/13/10) D.W. Griffith ~ Henry B. Walthall, Owen Moore, Gladys Egan
