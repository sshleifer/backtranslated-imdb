'Anita and Me' is a drama about growing up in multiethnic Britain, rather as 'Bend it Like Beckham' or closer to 'East is East', as it shares a 1970s attitude. The tone is resolutely chirpy (despite Black Country accents), but the film is missing 'East is the strength of the East, and the result seems to be rather thin and thin. In addition, the depiction of the film's central relationship between an Asian girl and her white friend is insufficiently deep to justify the way the film is structured around it. I also got tired of movies where the hero's year is a writer, it is of course often something that real writers have experienced, but hardly a new element in a fictional story. 'East is East' was fun and sharp; 'Anita and me' seem obvious and boring in comparison.
