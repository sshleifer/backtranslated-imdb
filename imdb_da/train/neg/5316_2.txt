Throw this lame dog a bone. So bad ... you can see anyway. Coal (Ross Hagen) is an intergalactic bad guy who escapes from being vaporized by a supernatural space ship chief (Jan-Michael Vincent). Kol manages to steal a shuttle service crashing down to the ground. An unstoppable android killer is sent to bring the villain back dead or alive. John Phillip Law plays a forest / park ranger who calls for caution to handle these two visitors from afar. Costumes are outrageous, and the manuscript lacks intelligence. Vincent certainly took the money and ran. The law shows the only sign of action. So bad it is almost comical. Also in the cast: Dyana Ortelli, P.J. Soles and Dawn Wildsmith.
