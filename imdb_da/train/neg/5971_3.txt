I was spoken against seeing this movie by a friend who was joking on what a sweet story was here. <br /> <br /> Yuck. <br /> <br /> I want my two hours back as I could have done so many more productive things with my time ... such as twiddling my thumbs. I see nothing at all into this movie at all, afraid of the eye-candy aspect of it ... <br /> <br /> 3/10 (and it's generous)
