As mentioned earlier, the visual effects are stunning. They are breathtaking. I personally use Blender and graphics as it is not easy at all. But that's all this movie is. Not only is the plot confusing, but the general conflict is not clear. For example, Proog and Emo in the first scene try to run away from who knows what. The conflict seems to be between man and nature here. Later, when they enter the bottomless hole space, Proog explains that "one step out of place and (you are dead)". Here there is a more precise conflict between the careless man and nature. As the film progresses, it is clear that there is a conflict between man and nature. But suddenly there is a conflict between man and man when Proog, out of nowhere, kills Emo. Proog immediately changes from being a caring guard who looks for a lost child to be a "sick man". He betrays us. Not only is this depressing, but we do not care because the conflict between the character's thoughts and actions is not developed. It is not a story of anyone through struggle that grows stronger. It is depressing and does not mean because there is no great truth about the human soul or the world generated as a great drama does. In my opinion, the film is hardly underdeveloped in all aspects. However, the graphics are stunning, but a movie is so much more than mere eye-catching. There is no truth, no fight and a bad surprise ending. Finally, an underdeveloped film without a point. ... but the graphics are good.
