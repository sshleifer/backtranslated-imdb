Any movie that has naked scenes by Karen Allen, and I'm still so boring, I'm going out, it's a stink! <br /> <br /> Karen gets stuck in Paris and is friendly with a sissily-handsome French man with whom she will soon have sex. Of course he is married ("But, Cheri, why would that be a problem?") What could be an interesting clash between cultures is (believe it or not) just boring. I went out. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the movie was much better after I left; But it would have had to have got a lot better to make up for a rat's beginning. <br /> <br /> My advice, if you find yourself in this race, don't go for the exit. Save your time and energy. Be sure to save your money. It's a shame, the production company doesn't save its money.
