I guess this movie is based on some sort of true story .... It's about two young girls who melt an adult man for 48 hours. I can't see where terror comes into play here .... There are some "weird" and "surreal" sequences in the movie. And the two girls (Sandra Locke and ... ah ... oh) play the role of two psycho-hates to the hilt ... they do a good job (although some of them are just a little over the top ). The movie is not good, and it's not terrible, it's just really really dated! I think this thing is dripping with the 70's .... It's not really bad if you like that sort of thing ... do you know ... that's it?
