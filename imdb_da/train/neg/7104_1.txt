The producers of this movie offer to pay funeral expenses to anyone who dies of scare while watching this movie. They should have offered intensive psychotherapy to anyone who really enjoyed this stink. A young couple moves into a house where a woman who resembles the woman from the couple lived. Extremely boring and very predictable. Eventually I didn't end up breaking anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this at all costs.
