From the beginning, the film's political theme is so overtly and heavily entrusted that the result is completely predictable. Any good textbook on writing screens will advise the layering of characters that contain character arches and three actions. In this movie you will find nothing of it. The police are poor and are therefore shown to be low, incompetent and figs. It does not seem that the film's decision-makers are that the police can be honorable citizens who look to join the police as a good way to contribute to the well-being of society. The viewer gets no opportunity to make up his or her mind about whether Ned Kelly is a good guy or a ruthless villain. The film opens with him being arrested for stealing a horse, but we get no idea of ​​his guilt or innocence. We see him walking through the door of a slurry, but only know that he has been in for three years when we hear this much later in a dialogue. <br /> <br /> This movie contains many pictures of Ned, looking at camera with a serious expression. I found the movie a real task to look at. It's the direction of modern movies, and one of them put me off watching.
