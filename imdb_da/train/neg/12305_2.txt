I watch this movie right now on the WTN because it was the channel the TV was turned on when I turned it on. It is a not very credible and rather boring story of a ministerial wife (Alexandra Paul) who falls in love with a young stud / driver (with washboard abs) played by Corey Sevier. There may or may not be a plot. Corey whips his shirt off much and Alexandra sleeps. I get the feeling that he should be up to no good, and therefore he cheats with skinny Alexandra Paul. It's not really important because, as I said, he takes his shirt off a lot, and I just got a glimpse of the ass split. There are lots of scissors on the soundtrack, which is just painful.
