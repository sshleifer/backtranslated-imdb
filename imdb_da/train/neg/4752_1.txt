I heard many stories that this movie was amazing ... Now I took my chance when I saw it at a cheap price in Ebay last month. I saw it and I have only a few comments on it: <br /> <br /> 1) Horrible storyline, 2) Horrible acting, 3) Bad fighting situations ... <br /> <br /> I have never seen any worse movie in my life so far !! When the story is bad, then at least the games make something more interesting. But both are ridiculously bad ... <br /> <br /> * The only positive thing about this movie (in my opinion) is Nikki Berwick. God, she looks good in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's about it ...
