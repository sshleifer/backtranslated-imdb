At first, this movie wasn't that bad. It was entertaining ... at least to me for all the wrong reasons. I've never seen the original so I can't compare the two. <br /> <br /> This movie reminded me of the strange Christopher Reeve movie The Damned. The two films have different plots, but the scary disgusted feeling and unwanted comedies are in both. <br /> <br /> The braided man is supposed to be a mystery / thriller / men, please don't anger the woman's movie. I do not know whole heathen things and sacrifice was a little away. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage, his brilliant bad self goes to a secluded island called Summerisle, when he receives a letter in calligraphy from his long-forgotten fianc√© who claims her daughter has been taken and hidden by other islanders . <br /> <br /> Cage is a police officer and he is the tired policeman he is going to the half-carded island that leaves no word of his whereabouts to anyone in the real world. Stupid. <br /> <br /> Things get breathing when the big Amish-esquire women who populate the island are puzzling on him and lying about the missing girl's whereabouts. His fiancee is no help, which seems to be elusive and tired all the time. Cage remains on the island when he learns that the missing girl is his daughter, and he is the lucky man who lured to come to this island as a sacrificial sacrifice during the island's sick harvest festival. <br /> <br /> In this movie cocks do not go as well. A sick angry view of feminism? <br /> <br /> I found the movie ridiculous at times, especially when cages stop some women and run around in a bear outfit. I think there were too many battles in this movie. I find the whole concept of angry women who cut themselves off on an island without the care of men quite entertaining, but the way it was portrayed in this movie was just weird. While most women have got something jerky and make them angry, it is clearly a form of sexism. I would have turned off the film in disgust if the roles were reversed. This movie is something to see maybe just once or twice. It is NOT a thriller, it should be categorized as just odd.
