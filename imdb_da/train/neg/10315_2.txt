I can't believe that people thought that this stinking pile of garbage was fun. Changing attempts at humor among cruelty, disgust and stupidity, "Something about Mary" leaves a little reason to stay to the end. Sure, Cameron Diaz is very pretty, but it never gets enough to save a movie. Ben Stiller tries hard to work within the plot, and is of course very talented, but the film is a loser. Not once were any of the scenes credible. The shots were poorly timed and badly framed. Farreley's brothers should be kept away from making movies at all costs. I check IMDB to see what they are working on so I know what to avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10; The bonus is from the time I smiled. It's not like I'm immune to humor or alone in my opinion. My wife hated it too. The next day we saw 'Rush Hour' and laughed ourselves silly. This movie just stumped.
