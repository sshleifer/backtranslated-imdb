The foundation is plausible but banal, ie. the beautiful and neglected wife of wealthy and strong man has a fling with a psychotic hunk, so tries to cover it as psycho stems and chanting her. But what develops from there is stupefyingly illogical. Despite the resources available to the usual couple who have money and influence, our privileged heroine seems to have only one domestic, their lawyer and the local police (who say they can't do anything) at their disposal while stumbling with excitement and terror. They have no private security staff (only a fancy security system that they abuse), household or basic staff, drivers, etc. Not even the means to hire private 24-hour nurses to take care of the hero when he suffers life-threatening injuries leaving husband and wife alone and vulnerable in their mansion. Our heroine is portrayed as having the brain on a doorknob, and our hero, a tycoon, behaves in the most unlikely and irrational way. The production is an insult to viewers who wasted their time with this drive and a crime for wasting the talents of veteran actors Oliva Hussey and Don Murray (what did they think?). And shame on Lifetime TV to insult its audience's intelligence for this scary offer.
