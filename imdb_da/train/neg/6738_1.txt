There have been so many films based on the same theme. single sweet girl needs a beautiful boy to impress ex, pay him and then (guess what?) she falls in love with him, who is a little fumbling followed by a row before everyone makes up before the happy end .... .. this has been done many times. The thing is, I knew this before I started to see. But despite this, I looked forward to it. In the right hands, with a good throw and a bright script, it can still be a pleasant way to pass a few hours. <br /> <br /> These were none of these. <br /> <br /> was gloomy. <br /> <br /> A female management lacks in charm or who completely failed to ignite even the slightest spark in me. I really didn't care if she "got her husband" or remained single and unhappy. <br /> <br /> A male leader who, after a few of his endless words of wisdom, would want to kill. Just to remove the alley look. I had no idea that living a male whore was the path to all-seeing-knowing enlightenment. <br /> <br /> A completely unrealistic film filled with unrealistic characters. none of them seemed to have jobs, everyone had more money than sense, a groom still moving on with his wedding after learning that his bride slept with his best friend .... plus "I would miss you we had never met "!!!!! I could go on, but I just realized that I was wasting even more time on this dross ..... I could rant to introduce a character just to have a very good laugh at the name "woody" but in truth it was Only distant humorous things that happened in the movie.
