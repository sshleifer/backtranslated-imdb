With Adam Sandler. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly one of the most idiotic movies ever made. It's about the cruise ship serving Shecky (Sandler) who wants to be a comedian on the cruise ship. First, there is no fun or smart line throughout the movie. It's so unfunny it's pathetic. There is surprisingly not very raw or sexual humor, but the f-word is plentiful. The budget is very low and it also destroys the film. It goes on a cruise ship, but it seems that they only had money to rent a small boat and only had money for 10 ship extras, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. The opening credits are animated reeeeeaally cheap, and it's just pathetic. I hate this movie and everyone else who sees this will also hate it. <br /> <br /> 86 minutes. rated R for language.
