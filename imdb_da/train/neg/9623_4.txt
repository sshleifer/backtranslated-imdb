Ben Stiller doesn't seem so much in reaction. And he does it very well. He is very dependent on the comedy that goes on around him. There's something about Mary, the stand-up hair scene only works because of Stiller trying to keep a straight face. When confronting Mary's two other suites, he is the most horrible guy in the room, but the scene is fun. <br /> <br /> In Along Came Polly, the formula breaks off for difficult-to-understand reasons. Stiller is surrounded by a selection of comics. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman get the best lines of which there are too few. That said, Hoffman claims a little too much on bodily humor - you know we are in trouble when they go to the speeding ghosts to make a laugh. A basketball scene where Hoffman foams it is completely overplayed (though it throws up a problem in the form of a shirtless opponent raising a smile - noticeably through Stiller's reaction). But everyone seems to work in a bubble, there is very little reaction. Hoffman and Stiller's characters could have played much more of each other. Aniston again represents his Rachael role, but Stiller is not Ross. It's more of a "Joey with a crush on Rachael" scenario. <br /> <br /> Polly is a by-the-numbers rom-com and it's its failing - it lacks heart. You can't mess with the characters. With a little more work we could have had a deeper history, but ultimately the film's failure comes down to bad writing. Worth to see if it pops up on television on a slow night, but you will regret the calcification of cash to see it.
