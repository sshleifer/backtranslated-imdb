A relentless corny and painfully unfunny attempt to transplant Sheriff Bart's character from Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles into his own weekly sitcom, this is really as bad as some people say it is! <br /> <br /> The laugh-track only serves to remind the inaccessible viewer what everything in this supposed comedy is supposed to be a joke and how desperate it is for laughing it is! <br /> <br /> However, it is somewhat interesting to see Louis Gossett Jr. trying his best to imitate Cleavon Little. His embarrassment appears in all stages. He was much more fun in HBO films El Diablo than he was here in this cheese plate! Really the best and funniest thing about Black Bart is the name of his horse!
