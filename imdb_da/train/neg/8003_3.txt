Don't be fooled as I was by the 'glowing' reviews quoted on the DVD box. "Wildly entertaining.", "A seriously scary freakout". And worst of all, "ON PAR WITH JAWS." This film is none of the above. Normally, I don't like writing bad reviews for movies, but I can't believe this one rests on a comfortable 7 on IMDb. It doesn't deserve it. <br /> <br /> After an uneven open daylight attack by a monster created by what more, chemicals dumped by lazy scientists, this movie goes absolutely nowhere, and that goes on for a long time. Basically and unlikely, a girl is snagged by the monster (I'll give them points for a good creature design, but it's not a WETA closet) and her half comedian family spends an hour and a half tracking her down ... in the sewers around Han- the river. Their search lacks any excitement again, someone called this on an equal footing with jaws? - And when they find her, you realize that everything was pretty pointless. Apart from that, much of the movie is committed to a quarantine in the government that culminates in a fun scene where a guy spits in a gutter in front of a crowded bus stop. <br /> <br /> Bad. This was bad. I'm not making fun. Want to see a rotten monster movie? Rent Deep Rising. In any case, you will save 30 minutes in your life.
