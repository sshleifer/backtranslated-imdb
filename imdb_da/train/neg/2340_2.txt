The story is about the lives of ordinary people from Antwerp living their lives. So I said it and there is nothing more to tell about the story. The movie is fast, like an MTV flick and well photographed, and we feel the director is talented and should make more movies. So let's forget about this and hope for the best with the next Deus-Barman image.
