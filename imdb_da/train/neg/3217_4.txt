A missed train. An incorrect phone number. An extra cup of coffee. What happens to those around you when you make a seemingly innocent decision? Most people do not give it a thought, as they are absorbed in their own thoughts and actions. <br /> <br /> "Happenstance" tells the story of the coherence and cause and effect of the secular as it relates to a group of normal Parisian folk music. It has all the components of what passes for modern theater, with the full cast of the dysfunctional and disillusioned. There is a cheating man, an illegal immigrant, a classic slacker, a pickpocket, a crazy grandmother, an annoying girlfriend, a selfish roommate and a homeless man. Audrey Tautou serves as the former protagonist (in the sense that she is on camera as much as anyone else and opens and closes the movie) and normal girl who just can't seem to find the right rhythm in her life. She learns at the beginning of her day from a stranger on a train what her horoscope holds for her. What happens to her during the day is told through various signs. Predicting the prediction? The concept is good, but the narrative is flimsy. The connections from one event to the next are weak. There is better storytelling in 15 seconds in the Liberty Mutual Insurance ad where a person sees a good deed and passes it on to someone other than there is a two-hour event. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Audrey Tautou then you can certainly sacrifice the time for this movie, but you will end it unhappy and wonder what this same story might be if it was handled by a better producer and director.
