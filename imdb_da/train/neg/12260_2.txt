Sometimes I rest on my head and think of the reasons why movies about killer sharks and / or crocodiles are still being made these days. They have made these paralyzed "Jaws" copies since the 70s, it's not as if they are becoming more well-liked. The idea is still exactly the same. So we have an animal that starts killing people. First, it takes down some secondary characters, then it begins to attack the protagonists, usually played by a few nobody except a person who used to be a little more famous, who usually plays a specialist. One of the main characters usually dies before the others kill the animal somehow, usually with an explosion. Then we usually get a last shot, where we see that the animal is still alive, or has laid eggs, etc. Etc. "Krocodylus" basically uses the same overused ideas and does absolutely nothing to create even a little variation. Unless you count the fact that "specialist" is a captain in this one variation, then your standards are pretty low. It's fun that he's played by Duncan Regehr, but he likes to be Zorro.Hell, I'm giving it a bonus point for that.
