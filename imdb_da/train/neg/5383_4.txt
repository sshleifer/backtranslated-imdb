I think I should start by saying that almost any kind of work can be entertaining in parts. The true test is whether it is good from start to finish, which is why I gave the analogue title to this review. Most of us would agree - even those like me who enjoy reading many blogs - that blogs cannot be compared to good novel writing for a number of reasons. Similarly, FEM cannot compare to good filmmaking for a number of reasons, and I actually think it is a bad example of independent filmography. From start to finish, FEM feels like a pieced together vlog. (Heck, even MySpace gets some pimping.) If I wanted to see an hour lonelygirl15 - I didn't go - I wanted to see it. FEM, while it is much brighter than the bubble room atmosphere of the above media, is so personal that it is without an interesting story. It's like seeing life's foolishness, which I think most agrees with, is very naturally boring. And yet the creators of FEM want to welcome them, their very postmodern film about making a movie. Cue my yawn. <br /> <br /> In the end, I get away and take care of some of it. I am shocked that I am actually interested in taking the time to write this review myself. It is not that the FEM is actually bad because it is not; It has a few moments where I break a smile or think maybe - maybe just - something of interest is about to happen. Rather, it's just downright ... mediocre. I feel so indifferent to the fact that it almost matches an oxymoron: passionate indifference. I hope the creators / actors in the movie come out of debt from their efforts. They will probably need it when one of them moves out and goes on with life. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you have time to waste and not much you want to do; Otherwise, pass it by, and don't worry about missing out on some great, undiscovered talent. You really don't.
