Oh dear, oh dear ... For JM fans, this was the nail in the coffin as far as her A-list Hollywood career is concerned. After solid turn in Girl can't help it, Wayward Bus, Infrastructure and Rock Hunter thought it was Jayne who was well on his way to becoming one of Tinsel Town's hottest stars. But an obsession with healthy publicity and a look in this clunker moved Mansfield to the sidelines, namely cheap euro loans until Fox could lose the contract as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a devilish waste of everyone's time except Suzy Parker, the only one in this movie that is bad enough for the material. Many people owe poor Jayne and her lattice performance to this movie's poor return at the box office, and while she is a pain in this movie, she can only do the best with the material. On the contrary, does Cary not set the screen on fire? After a handful of very good dramatic and comedy swings, Jayne takes 10 steps back in her practice as a serious actress by accepting (simply coming with Grant) to portray this scary, idiotic threat. Her character of Alice is a complete comic book bimbo, and although she looks good to eat in a kettle, her every look in the movie jangles your nerves. We all know that Jayne could do so much better than this dross and yet here she is parading as a premium pudding. A real shame. <br /> <br /> Get rid of this so-called comedy. It's more depressing than fun.
