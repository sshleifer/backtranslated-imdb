I decided to watch this because it has been nominated for Oscar this year. I guess so many people here, I really wanted to like this movie, but ended up bored and disappointed. The first scene was OK, but the whole rest of the movie in "shaking hands" camera mode is really annoying. I assume that the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for Oscar is this: <br /> <br /> American "military machine" (people making money from war) need an excuse or justification of the war in Iraq by bungling up something (kind of) patriotic. Why these "heroic" efforts of the instructor and protagonist to give the audience an idea of ​​"loving-warlike-one-substance"? .. Oh, please, come on! what a bore! <br /> <br /> See this for an idea of ​​how low the film academy can fall ...
