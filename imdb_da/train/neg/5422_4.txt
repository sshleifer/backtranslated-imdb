What "Noise" fails to do is make us understand its character. Tim Robbins plays an obsessive New Yorker who can no longer handle the city's uproar sounds, especially car alarms. It's a strange idea for a movie that has just as much creative credibility as "Death Wish". It is wise for points; especially a scene where our hero is trying to read through Hail: "I'm too stupid to understand this." He reads and reads a piece in confusion, we read it and do not understand it either. Only a car alarm goes off. Throughout the film there is constant interference with alarms and noise. But all in all, it does little to help us understand our hero, which allows it to ruin his marriage and become distracted with side plates rather than digging deeper into his persona. <br /> <br /> Film production is too ignorant to notice its own sound problems, shoddy editing and visible boom mixes. No, "noise" is not all evil. William Hurt is least colorful. At least, the end does not fall flat. Overall, the home runs a logistic point, you probably haven't thought about. At least I didn't. But all in all, ninety minutes long it couldn't be finished before. The story dragged on and seemed to be lost as soon as it started. <br /> <br /> This is another of the movies you can watch at a film festival but will probably not be downloaded for distribution. Check it out on DVD if you are really partial to anyone involved in the project. Otherwise, skip it.
