It's the same old, "If I can't get the funding for my project, I'll inject myself" monster movie. There's nothing new here. It's much like the Jeff Goldblum "Fly" movie. The man manages to keep some shadow of sensuality, but eventually succumb to the effects of his experiments. The action is pretty bad. There are people who act stupid all the way and endanger their lives without apparent reason. The guy stays back to the lab, he has been forbidden to enter. Then there is his relationship with a young woman and her son. Admittedly, he looks good, but he seems like a lot of trouble. It's just a pretty big waste of time. Even his tyrannosaurus dress looks like it came out of the stand on a Star Trek convention.
