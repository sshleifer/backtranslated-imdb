What can I say about this movie besides "don't see it". I waited and waited and waited for someting (or something) to happen and it just didn't come. Look amazing when two people walk around while setting the plate for most filler screen time in a single movie. What are they doing? Do they solve a mystery? Are they collecting tracks? Maybe it's just hard to tell. At the end of the movie, after many radio signals are decoded (disgusting on a kind of PET screen) and this guy gives some lectures, the plot is finally revealed and thrown aside as quickly as possible. Some foreigners would like to come back to their home world utopia and are so happy that they want to burst the ground (I suppose they don't like sharing wealth). My guess is that they have finished filming and then their 35-minute work or art (garbage!) And decided they would let the editing staff make it an 88-minute feature film. Look at your own risk, it's not even fun because it's so bad it's just bad.
