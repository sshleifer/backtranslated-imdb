What begins as a gentle country yarn, unofficial and mildly enjoyable romantic tale changes pace as Edward Norton's initially charming Harlan gradually reveals more about himself, and things take a trip to the creepy, as the film gradually changes from a southern romance to a modern game western. A gracious ranch (Norton) walks into town and charms a young girl (Evan Rachel Wood) who saves her from a dead-dead existence with her bad heavenly father with a whirlwind romance, but it becomes increasingly apparent that there is more to this cowboy than to meet the eye. <br /> <br /> Edward Norton ?? A real chameleon actor (with changing facial hair to match) plays a country hick, accented a little risky, but perhaps because he is just trying to act on that part without worrying about accent. He certainly makes it impossible to make all the nuanced small adjustments that we learn more about Harlan. But with too many small changes, this means that we are never sure where Harlan comes from and what seemed to be a good performance from Norton is gradually becoming confused. Evan Rachel Wood likes, without ever having much to do other than bat her eyelids on Norton. <br /> <br /> Down in the valley beats like a slightly uneven story because of its pace, and never really makes the protagonist's motives motivate the audience's sympathy for the characters remaining insecure. Should we like this drive or not? Even after a dramatic event, it is unclear. This ambiguity is for the film's injury, as if the author couldn't figure out what kind of story they would tell and settle for something from a hotch potch. Had the movie been one or the other, it could have been a solid movie, but as that is what we are left with is some mess. Fans of old-fashioned romance will enjoy part of the movie, but will be turned off at night. Completely complementary fans of Norton (or fans of the lush landscape of the San Fernando Valley) give it a miss.
