First of all, I must admit that both films I have seen by this director, I saw without titles and maybe missed the points. My Czech is not bad, but after sitting through two of his films, I wish I hadn't even tried to learn. Samotari is too cool. Too cool. It's about ten different story lines that weave in and out together. It's not so deeply unusual in a city, the size of Prague (small, really.) The protagonists are between 20 and 30. They have jobs and only one survey. The best character is the young Balkan girl. Her emotions become the echo of immigrants here every terrible day. It's about it. The only great character. Everyone else makes their own life hell all alone. How can I sympathize with such obvious incompetence? Maybe there are interesting bits with Japanese tourists, but do I need another stereotype in movies? If you like good music, watch this movie. If you want to laugh at someone else's stupidity, watch this movie. If you like irony and dry humor, see an original Jarmusch not an imitation. Under no circumstances can you see Ondricek's film, Septej (Whisper.) It is unless you enjoy homophobic stereotypes.
