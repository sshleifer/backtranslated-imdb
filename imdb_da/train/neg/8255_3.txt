At least it's not full of indecent violence or fluff. It is also not very filled with thought or a smooth story. This story had some potential, but the director seems to have lost the place of the green. The story is uneven and goes into strange <br /> <br /> directions, to no conclusion. I also don't think the director spent much time around a golf country club either. Some of the pictures are absurd. Not very engaging.
