I saw the 7.5 IMDb rating on this movie and on the basis of it decided to watch this movie that my roommate had rented. She said she had seen it before. "It's funny and sad! I shouted the first time I saw it," she jumped. Perhaps compared to other Bollywood movies, it deserves a 7.5 out of 10, but compared to all the other movies I've seen in my life, it doesn't deserve more than a 3. Any movie where I can ever guess what to happen next time is not good for me. The characters are amazing how the action is not realistic at all and their motives are constructed. It's over dramatic and the songs aren't that big. My biggest problem with Bollywood movies is the lack of subtlety. All emotions are too exaggerated and thus not at all realistic. Any feeling or band between characters that is the smallest shared must be enlarged with an unnecessary song. I think I understood that the relationship between the father and the son was more like one between friends than one between a parent and a child without having to pass it on through a five minute song. The stupid comic book complete with latterspor was not fun or necessary (we get it, Laxman is not the sharpest tool in the shed). If a movie is trying to induce tears through the most hackneyed it means it is just not meaningful, just a little embarrassing. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> Generally, if someone has terminal stage lung cancer, their son who lives with them will know something was wrong without having to tell it. Too many plot holes to count. In the beginning, the movie was entertaining and sweet in the way Bollywood movies are on people who don't see them so eagerly, but it just got boring. It takes a lot of skill to make a movie that is entertaining and heartbreaking, and the best way to do it is usually not to have all the fun parts in the first half of the movie and all the heartbreaking parts in the end. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER OVER ***** Perhaps it had a very little depth than other Bollywood movies I've seen, but not much at all. I ate more time laughing at the movie's stupidity than the parts that were going to be fun. I did not throw a single tear or felt like it, but I was overwhelmed with a sense of disgust in attempting a dramatic ending. I do not recommend this movie if you want to see something good, I recommend it if you want to see a Bollywood movie that is a little sad.
