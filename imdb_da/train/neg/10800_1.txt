What was the meaning of this movie? What was the plot? I do not know. Shaq can't act, people don't know how to lead, and I'm Kazaam! A genius that rape? Come on. Perhaps Eminem or Linkin Park will be in a movie like this. I remember seeing this just to kill time. It didn't really interest me. I just remember thinking, "Who put Shaq in this movie ???" The whole story also seemed silly. It made no sense at all. I think an unrealized morality of this movie is that you can find something in the ghetto and everything can happen. I can't comment much more because this movie is so awful that there's nothing worth commenting on. I "wish" this movie would go away.
