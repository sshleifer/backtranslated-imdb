HAH! So that's the movie that "Next Action Stars" came in. Now I'm glad I didn't participate and didn't win ... Isn't it funny how you can only see the first 10 seconds (!) And make them comfortable with a movie? I mean, come on! Just look at these titles! I watched this movie (or part of this "teleplay" when it was produced for television, and we couldn't bear to watch it all) one evening while doing my military service and the audience with me was the typical hodge podge of average guys who once look at series like Las Vegas just for the girls in the show. so the bar was not really tall, the most watched movie in my group was Girl Next Door (and that was not because of the big script; D. But this movie's total lack of originality, acting, scripting and almost everything else makes a movie good, it makes it pretty easy to switch channels to Las Vegas (or was it CSI? don't remember ...) without any complaints from the rest of the group. And it's rare (!) For the sake of heaven Don't know this movie ! If it's on TV, then yes, watch it and consider it. My conclusion? Well, since Joel Silver has actually produced some of the best action movies out there (Die Hard, Matrix 1 to name a few) I can only say that The producers do not give the film its quality, they give money to the directors, and to sell this movie just because it is a Joel Silver movie is just a desperate attempt to hide the obvious flaws of the crew that really did.
