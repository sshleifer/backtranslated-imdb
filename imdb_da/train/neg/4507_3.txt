Despite an extremely pleasant plot and expensive production, one wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural errors. Where was the Japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants? Not on pay apparently. <br /> <br /> In fact, a Japanese friend laughed aloud at some of the cultural absurdities she seemed to face. In a later conversation, she said, "Imagine a Finnish director making a film in Fnnish about American Civil War using blonde Swedish actors as trade unions and Frenchmen as Confederates. Worse imagine dressing the scarlet O'Hara female lead in a Period Hope skirts missing the hanger and sports a 1950s hairstyle. Perhaps some people in Finland might not realize that the hooded skirt lacked the hanger or recognize the bizarre Jane Mansfield hair, but in Atlanta they would not believe in their eyes or ears and laugh at The hallways ... excellent history and photography are condemned, so ... Memoirs of a Geisha looks painful to anyone who is familiar with Japanese cultural nuances, actual geisha or Japanese dress, and that was the subject of the movie! Hollywood is amazing in its myopic picture of film making, they often get the big money right, while the details that really polish a film refinement are embarrassingly wrong. amused "The Last Samurai" was the crown achieving how bad an otherwise good movie could be in Japan. Memories of a Geisha are embarrassingly better and worse at the same time.
