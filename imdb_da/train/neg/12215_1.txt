In what I can say was a theft of my time, I was taken to watch this movie and I have to say what a horrible experience. Fay Ann Lee is a horrible actress and is not convincing in this movie. Larryjoe76 is of course a shill reviewer. The reason is thin to say the least, the Cantonese dialogue is not fun. Watch this movie at your peril. <br /> <br /> David Tang from Shanghai Tang should be after the movie for the little or no revenue this movie will generate. The banal plot tries to compete with other rom-coms out there and just fits into nature. It was like watching paint dry. <br /> In short, this movie was a total waste of time and space. I've seen better movies on youtube.
