Cuba Gooding Jr. is a secret service agent who blames the US President's murder. I will immediately point out that this is not the type of role this very talented actor is known for, and this film shows us why. He is standing with a persistent news reporter (Angie Harmon) to uncover the conspiracy about the president's death, and so on, blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> Even with a cast of James Woods, Cuba Gooding Jr., Anne Archer and Angie Harmon 'End Game' fail to grab your attention, clean and simple; some of the action is good, the play is not all bad, and the story, although clich√©d and done before, could have led to an entertaining and fun movie - well it doesn't! The font of the script and the direction make it absolutely certain that it never sucks you into the story or gives you the slightest thought for any of the characters. 4/10 It's boring, predictable and boring.
