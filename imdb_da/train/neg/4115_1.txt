"Power Play" starts interesting, but it goes down the hill quickly. The only good actor is Tobin Bell, and he has a very small role. Beyond Bell has "Power Play" no redeeming value or interest. "Power Play" has several earthquakes in a few days than California has in a year. The earthquake scene in the mall is so constructed and absolutely incredible. And all the action scenes look like a bunch of third graders making a game. It's terrible, simply awful. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, if "Power Play" was made in the 60s or 70s, would be considered a bad "B" class movie. The fact that "Power Play" was made in 2001 is really sad. Is there such a thing as a "D" class movie? In this case, the "Power Play" casts the form.
