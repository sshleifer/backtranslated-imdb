Come on, let's be real. The Knights of Christ, Ordo Templi, or the Templar Knight, as they are commonly called, did not even exist before the beginning of the 12th century. The story is so ridiculous that it is pathetic. Dolph Lundgren looked just as positive. And if you wanted a real Templar, don't just use the knights of Christ, who still exist in Portugal. At least they should have taken the story into account. The only redeeming quality I could find in this movie was that the artifacts were so authentic enough to pass for medieval or gothic periods. The action was bad, the story horrible, the action terrible and the props were okay.
