OK, it's very rare that I complain about something I got FREE. So I suppose this movie shot me over that limit. I saw it at the Hollywood Cemetery for free and went away very very disappointed. An audience's question to the director about using the Native American references as "bookends" rather than being woven into the film better, basically says everything that this movie was fussing on. <br /> <br /> NATIVE US REFERENCES --- The Indian references really felt out of place and constructed. It is obvious that this director and writer tried to tackle an arena they never played before. They should have attached to the old saying of "writing something you know". IF they are actually aware of this, it certainly did not turn out to be the movie, or the beauty of this unique culture was not given proper justice. <br /> <br /> Clichés and ON THE NOSE --- I went in to see this movie because it was an indie. So I kept it to higher expectations. "Little Miss Sunshine" was an indie and saw it before it became so popular. Before it came to broad release, I already shouted how it gets a hit. Unfortunately, I couldn't say the same thing about "Expiration Date". "Sunshine" took us to cliché events, but the filmmakers were so clever in their approach that the result would take us to another direction, avoiding the trap of being a "cliche". This film, on the other hand, had no chance of not falling into the trap because it was already TRAPPED from the start. The psycho-mom's antics, the Hendrix couple, etc. <br /> <br /> I hate to say it, but the best and WORST movie I've seen this year was both Indian. "Little Miss Sunshine" is the best and this movie is the worst. I wish I could say otherwise. <br /> <br /> But I congratulate the filmmakers for having such a good ride from their family members in the cemetery.
