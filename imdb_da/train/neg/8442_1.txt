MUSIC Maria Kraakman plays Anna, a thirties woman who finds out her husband (Fedja van Huet), cheating on her, but she doesn't dare to confront him. She painfully avoids any confrontation with people, her parents, and her sister, so we have a protagonist in a feature film that doesn't do anything at all. We hardly know anything about her background or her motivations. Just a woman who seems to be stuck in a dead end, not only during this difficult episode of her life. She obviously suffers from something, but why should we also suffer in the audience? <br /> <br /> I almost made it to the cinema after seeing this clutter. These were a very dull and painful 90 minutes. Normally I try to avoid wasting energy in poor film making. I have to beat and roll the punches, but in this case there is a fair warning in place. Where on earth did Nanouk Leopold receive funding (largely from publicly funded funds) for this turkey? Of course, there was no script to speak out. It can be compensated by a brilliant filmmaker with cinematic ideas or a cast with just a little more appeal. Nothing at all, just a vaguely defined concept, "I want to do something from a woman's point of view". The result is an insult rather than a tribute to a female perspective on life. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, there is no interesting shot in the whole movie. I can't think of a cast that could have spiced this one up, but Johanna ter Steege is a (small) light in the dark, if possible with this gloomy lack of material. I try to imagine how Leopold tried to lead Maria Kraakman: "Mary, look at the horizon, we will film you for three minutes, just express sadness". A perfect cure for insomnia. Get a copy and see it late at night, guaranteed to put you to bed. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 1/10
