In all low budget history. This movie should be one of the worst. True, there are some humorous sides to the movie, but in general it was just awful. I just can't understand which person couldn't run a lot of snails. I think they should be one of the slower creatures on the planet. Worth the only part in this movie is the seal of a snail's attempt to bite a man's finger. This was pretty entertaining.
