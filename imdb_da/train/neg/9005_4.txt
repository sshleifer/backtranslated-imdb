If Alien, Jurassic Park and countless other sci fi horror movies are your cup of tea, add a lot of sugar and you get it here. The movie begins in jolly old England around 1100ad and then jumps to today's California. Our hero Carver (Dean Cain) is the new security manager and military advisor for a science lab 400 meters underground. He arrives (Carver is also a helicopter pilot) with senior researcher, and we quickly find out that it is a cloning laboratory and they have something new to clone. Is it a dinosaur or what? As with the above movies, hell breaks loose and our characters begin to be picked. The special effects on Monster are pretty good for a "direct to video" movie, and Dean Cain does what he gets paid for. But forget about the rest of the group as we find out why we have never seen them before. Again, don't go in with high expectations and you'll be ok.
