Siskel & Ebert were great at this show whether you agreed with them or not because of the genuine conflict created by their own professional opinions. Roeper took this show down in a notch or two, because he wasn't really a film critic and because he replaced the rogue by meaning. Now, when Ben Lyons comes on, do I feel like I see "Teen News" - you know that children's news show hosted by kids for kids? Manckiewitz is not much better. It is obvious that they have only experienced a stable diet of mainstream movies throughout their lives. The idea that these two rank amateurs have something of interest or consequence to say about movies is ridiculous. If they go through a non-formal movie, they are completely lost. Show them something original and intelligent - they just find it "confusing". Wait - I think I'll get it ... ABC is owned by Disney ... Disney makes movies for kids. While Siskel, Ebert and Roper promote independent films and only suffered from the large budget studio productions - what a surprise: these two guys love the great studio schlock and only tolerate a few Indians. Plus everyone knows that the age group of TV advertisers is intended. The blatant nepotism is the icing on the cake. In which alternative universe do these guys qualify as film critics?
