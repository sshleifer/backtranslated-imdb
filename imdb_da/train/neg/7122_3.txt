"The Screaming Skull" opens with a warning and an offer of free funeral services if you were to die to see it - now there's a hook! The story itself has a relatively interesting premise for a horror-flick: Scheming man marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness, and tries to convince her that she becomes insane with sharp sounds, mysterious paths and skulls that occurs in relentless times. Add to the formula a sufficiently scary gardener who still appreciates the memory of man's first wife to whom he was devoted. Maybe it's just that the 1950s didn't have the technology to pull some of the scary scenes needed to refresh this movie, the techniques used here seem designed and everyday. But then again, when I first saw "House on Haunted Hill" as a nine-year-old, it gave me the heebie jeebies the same way, I'm sure this movie made for young viewers in the same era. Don't make me wrong, the movie isn't horrible, it just seems to be boring at times. But there are some great atmospheric tensions in the generally large but unfurnished Whitlock home, and the gardens and pool are a good touch. For me, the best played scene involved Eric Whitlock (John Hudson), who goes wrong in the pond and tries to retrieve the hidden skull, he just goes straight in clothes and all in a great contrast to the mentally challenged gardener (director Alex Nicol in a dual role). It makes you doubt who the real dimwit was. <br /> <br /> In its own good way, perhaps the most shocking thing about the movie: What about the nice roadster, the Whitlock's have their first look in? 1958! At least it made me jump out of my seat!
