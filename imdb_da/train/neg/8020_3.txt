had some lovely poetic bits, but is really just an artistic wing-together with no direction or resolution. How do these people get through the film school? who gives them money to make this crap? could have been so much more, fine leading actor, and I always like Fairuza Balk, but come on, the all-rock metaphor for just staring without finding something convincing is just so tired, and it probably doesn't make good movie . The director must go away and live life for a long time and not come back to the camera until they really have something to say. This is like the throw-spaghetti-on-wall art-making school, sitting together a lot of serious pictures and hope hope, as hell, that poetry comes forth. It can work if the director actually has some kind of vision or has a brain that knows when it is in the presence of potential, but here it is just space-filled, without consequence. I felt the lazy end of the coming moments before it hit, and shouted "you lazy bastard" on the screen as the credits appeared.
