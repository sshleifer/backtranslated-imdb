I know John Singleton is a smart guy 'coz he made Boyz N The Hood, so how did he write and instructed this? It is like a pilot of a bad "going to college for the first time" teen soap, a parade of boring stereotypes and clich√©s with some gratuitous violence thrown in to make it a commercial proposal, I think. Who would have guessed the date rape would dump sausage for seafood? The angry anger would be pursued by a group of neo-Nazis (and would be engulfed in a variety and a Jew - just for fun!) Even Laurence Fishburne's scary reactionary story Professor just annoyed me and I love the guy, it's like everyone involved in this movie just lost the plot. Except Busta Rhymes, of course. Big ups.
