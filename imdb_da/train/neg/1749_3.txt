I have to say that this was priyadarshan's worst movie (release along with much better kyonki, who was also his direct-oriented venture), it contains no specific story and focuses only on body shown by debut actresses and some stupid comedy sequences. I think that priyadarshan is too much repetitive in his comedy flicks as govinda and David Dhavan had done earlier, after giving some good entertainers, they also went to lose their audience. So it will be good for him to concentrate more on script and try some variations in his direction. Give us more of herapheri and malamal weekly s instead of giving duds like garam masala!
