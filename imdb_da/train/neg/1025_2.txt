That's the only question I'm left with. Why did this movie suck as much as it had such a good draft? Why was the writing so bad, it left the audience completely unconnected with the characters? Why didn't it make any sense at all? Why did the studio take a perfectly good premise and "Hollywood" in hell out of it, as all that was needed was good, smart storytelling? Why? I never understand why movies that start well become a pile of crap when released. I hope, because of Freeman, a Spacey who is Oscar WINNERS that this will never be released to the big screens in America. As one who has a bachelor's degree in journalism, the whole story is just totally ridiculous. I just think the script had potential, but the execution made it a clich√© and a horrible one. Just. None.
