Author / director Peter Greenaway injures his title as Supreme Court of Art House Pretension with his latest exercise in unpleasant complacency, 8½ women. The film follows a wealthy Englishman and his son on their mutual quest for sexual gratification as they lure and extort women (guess how many) to join their personal collection of concubines. <br /> <br /> Think of a possible way this assumption could be offensive and chances are Greenaway is complete. The female characters are a little more than a catalog of fetishes for the two main characters to participate in. There is the Kabuki-occupied Mio, the always pregnant Giaconda and Beryl who have a thing for pets. Giulietta has no legs and uses a wheelchair, she is "half-woman", does it get? Greenaway completely denies all charges of misogyny, but if it is not, what is it? <br /> <br /> The film continues to eroticise everything related to Japan, a continuation of themes from his snoring-capable (but less sexist) 1996 film, The Pillow Book. But where The Pillow Book was erotic and graceful, 8 ½ women just became horny and utilizing. Greenway's work is tasteless and arrogant in his fetishism, and the only person likely to enjoy seeing it is the author himself.
