*** One out of ten stars *** <br /> <br /> Because if it was, it becomes a F. Holy mother Mary of God was so bad. I mean, I gave it any reasonable accommodation considering it was a straight two video movie, but it dropped me off at every turn. Like so many other B movies, the basic story was decent, and the filmmakers seemed to have a reasonable level of resources, but the performance was ridiculous. It's a shame that they attached the good name for Halloween to this failure. The basic premise surrounds some frat douche bags that host their annual Halloween haunted house fund raiser when a satanic spell appears out of nowhere and slips off the boys into a living hell. Well that's the idea anyway, but instead of most of the movie is devoted to showing these frat boy's relations escapades bound by a monstrous lesbian subplot. Very little of the actual story is devoted to Halloween or the mysterious spelling book. It actually makes me angry that the filmmakers thought they could get away with making such dribbles. <br /> <br /> The movie is essentially about frat boy relations. This is NOT what the movie is billed as. I am tempted to track down the producers and at least threaten them with bodily harm. The action is just as bad as it gets, it's awful! The script is unintentionally fun. Kinematics is simply lazy. The whole movie is amateur tonight. This movie actually makes the SyFy channel movie productions look like masterpieces. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the movie felt like the filmmakers realized they didn't produce a soap opera and had to throw in some horror sequences. The evil spell book finally comes into play and gets everyone in the haunted house into the character as they are dressed as. I almost want to cry when writing this review. Wow! I mean wow! This thing was an irreversible choppy disaster.
