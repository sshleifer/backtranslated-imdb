To be honest, I am surprised at the positive voices that this film has received. The movie just draws along its 81-minute lifetime, and the audience must suffer all the way through. In fact, there are some positive moments in this movie; Charlie Spradling gives a decent performance. She gets a beautiful pathetic dialogue, and she handles it quite well. Scott Valentine (Merrideth's boyfriend in Family Ties), on the other hand, is a pretty hard watch. I think the highlight of his performance is witnessing the guy lying on the beach wearing tiger-patterned chummies .... give me a break. Also Valentine gives us a boorish and pathetic depiction of a suffering vampire who misses the day (to see a more convincing rendition of the suffering vampire see Denice Duff in "Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4"). The film moves so slowly and is only positively influenced by, and to be honest, Charlie Spradling's dance scenes. This movie can honestly only be recommended to Charlie Spradling's die-hard fans (as I am, and I still had a hard time watching it!).
