While it contains facts that are not widely reported, it is not just the truth. They took many freedoms to rearrange events, exclusive people, and use sets that do not meet the facts of their lives in the 30s. There was more than just Bonnie, Clyde and W.D. in the gang at different times and they had so much to do with facts like those included. Buck and Blanche went to convince Clyde to go just as much earlier than the one shootout and was actually pulled back into crime. Some of the events depicted in daylight actually took place at night. Bonnie's wounds were much more serious and were never properly cured. It was so bad that she had to be transported by someone until it healed, and even then it stiffened, so she went stiff. Clyde also went with a slack because he in the prison cut off a big year. I know I'm rude and it was a TV movie, but even without these flaws in this "SAND" story, the movie moves too quickly from event to event and crosses several as several separate snapshots of their lives rather than being a coherent flowing story. <br /> <br /> I would recommend reading a book or viewing a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth.
