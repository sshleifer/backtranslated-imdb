This beautifully filmed and scripted episode was knocked down for two reasons. 1) Perhaps it was the morale of the 1950s that spoke, but no one alone on an asteroid for years would react with such a hysterical negativity to a female android gift. 2) It was not an android at all, but a woman, the beautiful Jean Marsh. <br /> <br /> The popularity of the sex doll industry over the next few decades could have traced its origins back to this episode if I did it properly. In fact, the modernization of sex bots in the news is what I'm talking about. Robots were not new to movies or TVs as this episode was made so they could have had her action as one. Her fleshiness would then have added a creepy element. Instead, it becomes a lovely little love story about two people on a distant star. <br /> <br /> Twilight Zone always stretched your imagination and credibility. Normally nobody used it. But this episode seemed hamstrung by a calvinist morality that escaped what would have been masturbating with a machine or even carelessness.
