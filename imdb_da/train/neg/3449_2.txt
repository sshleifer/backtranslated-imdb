Mercifully, there is no video of this wannabe western that is a resident of Big Frank at a time when his career was floundering. The story of a whey living after his great gun brother's reputation and who gets driven out of town, only to return to the rallymen with a new found courage, must be written by a backwriter. All in all, this show stinks. The story is basically boring, incomprehensible and so naive that it can offend your intelligence. I must completely deviate from the other reviewer who found it "... underrated ..." The critics threw it at that time and deserved it. You'll have to catch it on the last show if you're late and have a lot of insomnia. But if you can sit through it, you have greater strength than most of my movie buff friends.
