It was a painful experience. The whole story is actually there, so I don't want to go into it, but the play was terrible. There is this part right from the start, when the researcher goes to work, he actually wears a white coat at home before leaving to work, I thought to work with biohazard material, which means that you should wear sterilized clothing in a controlled environment, and The laboratory itself resembles a school laboratory. There is this screen at the top of a filing cabinet that has nothing to do with the whole scene. to make the site look technically, and a scientist actually has breakfast in the lab and beside him is a biohazard-labeled jar, and his boss approaches him and doesn't even tell him ... not to mention bad plays very bad can't get anything worse than what my advice is not looking at and i thought nothing could be worse than the dead house apparently Uwi Boll's movie looks like classic Shakespeare in regards to this!
