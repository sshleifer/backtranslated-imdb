I was not terribly impressed by Dante's first season offerings in "Homecoming", it was not much of a horror story, but rather a smart political statement with undead. Screwfly's situation is the story of a virus loosening on the world that causes men's sexual drive to replace with murderous tendencies against women. The section begins okay with a short film explaining how the screw flight was killed by scientists. Then there is a short scene where a man is arrested when females are discovered in his home. I suppose this should show the start of the outbreak, but it is unclear because it will never be revised. The section goes on for some time introducing blah blah characters. It seems cool and mysterious, but the episode of the stars gets worse and worse as it lurks to its sad and unsatisfactory end. The worst episode. Well, except chocolate.
