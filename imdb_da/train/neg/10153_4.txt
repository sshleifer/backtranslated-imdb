SLASHERS (2 out of 5 stars) Not really a really good movie ... but I liked the idea behind it ... and the filmmakers made it look good considering the small budget they had to work with. The movie is apparently an "episode" of a live Japanese reality show that sends several contestants into a sealed "danger zone" and has three costumed creeps sent after them to kill them. Survivors, if there is one, wins fame and happiness ... everyone else just gets dead. The biggest drawback of this movie is that the play is pretty bad. None of the "real" people seem real at all. The actors playing the killers are funny ... because they portray cheesy and over-the-top caricatures of popular modern horror movies ... and that's exactly how they would be done if this were a real show. The movie pretends to be done all at once ... there's a camera man following the participants around the "danger zone" and everything is seen from the camera's point of view ... but the lights are flashing and turning off all the time (to hide "cuts" from a go to another one I could imagine).
