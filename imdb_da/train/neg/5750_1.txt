in fact, it was pretty funny ... in a "god how in hell made this movie done" kind of. if you make life fun with movies ... which i just do ... go ahead and see it ... but if you actually think "is it a good movie?" eff off. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, this movie sucked the scene with the worst play I've ever seen in any movie .... usually they get five minutes in it before you realize "this movie can suck" .. but no You know that from bats. this movie talks about edgar allen poe ... never tried to explain it to people who have not remembered poet's life story ... so i don't know if any of that was said is actually. <br /> This film is about a writer "ethan poe" hook up with his cousin "ann" .... they are both descendants of edgar al poe ... or are they?!? apparently people give one what their ancestors did. this guy ethan poe is actually ethan "usher" who should be descendants of the story "House of Usher", written by Edgar Allen Poe. Ann's brother sometimes turns out to try to rape her ... Ann is also stalking at some point in the movie of three different people on the same street (seriously three ... they are just like her mocking at her and she doesn't even understand. The characters being murdered throughout appear at the end to try to save the day .... but they can't. At the end, Ann shoots ethan while trying to kill his best friend. Of course, before she shoots him, she must scream out "never again!" this movie should never be seen again!
