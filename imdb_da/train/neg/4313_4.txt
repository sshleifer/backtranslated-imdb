Like last year, I did not manage to sit through it all. Okay, so Chris Rock as host was a good choice because he was vaguely engaging. Or rather out of all the drilled holes that were packed into the theater, he was at least not in the top 10 most boring. Many of the presenters, on the other hand, were in this coveted top 10. I had not known that it had all been done by autocue (although I knew it was written), but it was really terrible to see these allegedly good actors out of order to insert expressions, look away from the queue and stumble over simple words (Natalie Portman if there is no director she is away). The Night of Fancy Dresses and Drilling Tales were long and dull, Beyonce Knowles slaughtered some good songs and there were very few decent acceptance talks and clips. Adam Sandler wins the worst presentation prize. <br /> <br /> To help me write this review, I would like to thank my mother, father, lawyers and my pedicurist for anyone who believes in me and I would like to point out that I have a high metabolism and of course I have not starved myself for a month. I don't want to cry ... thank you.
