When I borrowed this movie from a friend (luckily I didn't buy it) on the package (which is really so bad and ugly) was printed "The Ultimate Vampire Horror". After seeing it, I thought the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the movie itself. The "story" begins when a teenager (surprise!) Is being hunted by some vampire / zombie creatures. <br /> <br /> Lighting, sound and everything reminded me of my first attempt to make a holiday video of ten-year VHS system, if not worse. I gave the film a 2 out of 10, and only because the promo-T-shirts looked a little cool. I don't want dis-movie students or splatter movies in general, but I've seen Braindead, and I've seen a 20-dollar budget film from students who were ten times better than this crap.
