The film had some similar aspects. Maybe for many to my liking. It felt as if the author / director was desperately trying to make us feel the inner conflict of ALL characters. Not once, a few times ... but all the time. <br /> <br /> This is the job of television, not cinema. <br /> <br /> The location of the train station was well chosen, and I enjoyed Sascha Horler's performance as the pregnant friend. <br /> <br /> I felt as if Justine Clark's performance was wan. Her reactions to things felt compelled as if the director was trying to highlight the film's themes through her protagonist's expression. Nor can I believe that a director can make the wonderful Daniela Farinacci an incredible presence. <br /> <br /> I can't understand the choice of pop music all over the sequences. This is a lazy entity, especially where pop music comes from no place diageically to the movie and / or where the song of the song feels embarrassingly serious. <br /> <br /> It's been said a breezy quality about the movie that evokes the Australian warmth and local attitude with originality. It creates an atmosphere of warmth and sunshine. Especially with the use of wonderful animation sequences that save the movie from complete mediocrity, it infuses with passion and handmade charm. <br /> <br /> I'm curious why the dialogue feels so overtime. "Who knows if there is a god? Like a guy sitting up in the sky telling us what to do" or what the line was. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one of the more embarrassing moments was the friend who came home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to declare his wife "I quit smoking." <br /> <br /> An anti-smoking commercial? A TAC ad with a tasteful animation? I had to leave the cinema for 50 minutes - it was too much.
