The film is about Sir Christopher Strong (MP Member of Parliament - played by Colin Clive) and his affair with Amelia Earhart-like character, which Katherine Hepburn plays. Until they met, he had been a very devoted man, but when he met the odd but fascinating Hepburn, "he couldn't help himself" and they fell in love. You can tell because they stand a lot in space and talk endlessly about how painful their pristine love is. Frankly, this is a terribly dated and practically impossible movie to watch. Part of the problem is that in Pre-Code days, movies that glamorized adultery were very common. And even if you accept this moral suspect topic, the complete sappiness of the dialogue sounds like a Romanesque novel from the 19th century ... and a really bad thing. Sticky and difficult to characterize (Clive's wife is after all a lovely lady and did no harm) making this a great waste of time. About the only interesting aspect of this movie is costume Hepburn wearing in an early stage where she is dressed in a mill suit! You have to believe it - and she looks like one of Bugaloos (a fuzzy but appropriate reference).
