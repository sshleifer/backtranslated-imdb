This could have been a rather entertaining movie, but instead it goes along with other duds like Leeches and Rest In Pieces at the bottom of the cinematic food chain. If they had played this flickering tongue, it could have been a very entertaining movie, like Re-Animator or Dead Alive, but Juan Piquor Simon plays the tongue in the cheek in spots, but more often. <br /> <br /> The prerequisite for this movie is a small community besieged by mutated snails. There is an abandoned toxic waste dump near a sewer line that mutates the snail into aggressive carnivorous monsters - albeit monsters that move slowly and can be slipped under your luggage. Health inspector Michael Garfiled and two accomplices are the only ones who seem willing to fight the snail while the sheriff and mayor believe they are crazy. The Climax is a grin - unintentional - which enables you to scratch your head on how stupid (actors and scriptwriters) the scenario of destroying the slums is. <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (No new reason Simon seems to play the gore elements in the tongue, but the dialogue is equal. If Simon worked with a wise script - one with lots of one-liners and eccentric characters, this could have been a cult movie). <$ / $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $$$ $ $$$ $$$ $$$ $$$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ & & Games accounters & $$$ \ t The $ $ $$$ that many horror movie viewers enjoy is in full swing here. You also get the corpse of people who have been picked clean by the snail and lots of swallowing scenes. <br /> <br /> ENABLE: $ (Wow! Michael Garfield seems to know that this script is a stinker, and he delivers his lines with a facial expression suggesting he knows where preposterous this film production is e ndeavour is. Kim Terry, as his wife, does a decent job even though she does a little beyond the team-your-face-while-you-scream bit. "Teenagers" were all terrible actors - no exceptions. could have used Bruce Dern or Jeffrey Combs!) NUDITY: $$ (Two teenagers get naughty in bed before being shipped - in a badly-made scene - by a horde of snails crawling into the girl's bedroom. Both male and female nudity here).
