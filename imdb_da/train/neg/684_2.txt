Couldn't believe it! Cut sentences? My Goodness! Know what? Everything is true! Real people ever talk like this? Don't think so. Good girl! Stout guy! Stiffening upper lip! Only justification given movie 2 instead of 0 Gary Cooper such a bowl. Movies as a whole ridiculous, unless you like to see endless biplane dogfights. Seemed infinite, anyway. Think of all the Franchot Tones dialogue called. When Crawford and Young make a special effort to sound British, they come across as Irish. Handy tip - we british cut words, not phrases. And somehow we manage to rotaaaaaawl at the same time. But it is only if we have been in a really good public (it is private for you) school.
