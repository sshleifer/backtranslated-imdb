This should be one of the best overrated anime shows ever made. And yes, I was even shown "End of Evangelion" and it still made me even hate it. Not to mention the countless rip-offs of this show! I don't mind psychological and philosophical subtitles, but Evangelion pulls it into the mud like nothing else! Not many of the characters seemed to be very interesting. The only thing that seemed interesting was Asuka, Misato and Pen-Pen. Except it was mostly everyone else a bunch of whiny crybaby losers. They have to go to a psychiatric center, not to lead huge giant robots against foreigners called "Angels". <br /> <br /> Even the mecha and alien fights did not help at all. Do something like this: "Well, there are those robots and they are really cool because they bleed (!), When they get hurt, but they're not really mecha, but caught angels, so sometimes they go insane and don't what the underground pilots want and they need to be better controlled ... blah blah blah! "<br /> <br /> I'm so sorry, but I just can't recommend Evangelion to anyone, anime otakus or not. To those who love this series a lot, you are entitled to the opinion I respect you. But to thoses who have an "out of your mind" obsession with believing that everyone will like this series, you are more an egoist. <br /> <br /> I prefer "Macross", "Mospeada", "Run -Dim" and "Robot Taekwon V" myself.
