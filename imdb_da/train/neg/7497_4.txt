After watching the trailer for this movie and finding out that Spike Lee was director, I was excited to hear about this event. I wasn't alive at the time I didn't live in New York, so I expected more from a story lesson than anything else. What I got was some interesting actors, a lot of sex and about 30 minute movies that actually had something to do with Son of Sam. I suppose the movie was not about Son of Sam, but it was a look into the summer of '77. Feel disappointed. <br /> <br />
