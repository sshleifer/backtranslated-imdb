I do not know why this has the fans, and I do not know why I myself have given it the score I have. This is confusing. There are many a giallo, where one has to suspend unbelievers, let the picture roll and catch it somewhere before it becomes scary, and a bad police officer must finally explain what we have seen. But this has very little for it and has a slow sequence where nothing happens and has no relevance to anything while we are listening to a most repetitive soundtrack, even by Italian standards. Not a giallo, this is a complete mish mash of horror ideas featuring Klaus Kinski in his most obvious "inviting" performances. I expect him to come up, do a day's work and clear up leaving Mr D'Amato to fill others. Ewa is of course beautiful, but no it's not enough, and ultimately we've seen too much of her popping up all the way, long after we've completely lost interest in this thoughtless and pretentious twaddle. Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood!
