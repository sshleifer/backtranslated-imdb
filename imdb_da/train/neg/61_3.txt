There is not a drop of sunshine in "The Sunshine Boys," titling this alleged comedy Neil Simon's only ironic moment. Simon, who customized the script from his game (which is not approved), corresponds to old age with irrational behavior - and worse, clumsy, galumphing, mean-spirited irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is relentless to us playing an aged vaudeville performer who talked about reuniting with former comedy partner George Burns for a television special (it is said that they were a team for 43 years, asking the question "how long did it last vaudeville in the end? "). Burns, who won a Supporting Oscar, has the accident coming to the movie some thirty minutes, after which Matthau has already blown the material to hell and back. The more obedient the movie becomes, the less tolerable and visible it is. Director Herbert Ross did only solid work when he was not connected to one of Neil Simon's screens; Here, Ross creates gags as a drowsy amateur, hammering away into belligerent routines that fail to pay (as semi-disjointed Matthau, appearing on a mechanic's garage for auditioning for a TV commercial). At this time, Matthau was still too young for this role, and he overcompensated by slashing and hollering. It was up to Ross and Simon to tone down the character to recruit his temper to give the Sunshine Boys some sunshine, but Walter continues to project as if we were all deaf. The image looks awful and creeps together at a spiritual pace; one loses hope for it early. * 1/2 from ****
