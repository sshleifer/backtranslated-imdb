With something better to do, I decided to check out "Aztec Rex" (as it was billed) for hell. <br /> <br /> The stupid story could have played better if the dinosaurs were convincing. They actually looked like animations (the hard designs that artists later use to finish the CGI effects, add more detail, smoother movements, etc.) Absolutely terrible looking dinosaurs, which is the only reason you are likely to sit through this Nevertheless . <br /> <br /> The one redeeming factor was the lovely Dichen Lachman like Ayacoatl. She kept my interest; if only the budget had been hit and some convincing dinosaurs could have been used. <br /> <br /> disappointing. At least played and the crew got a free trip to Hawaii, where the film was filmed.
