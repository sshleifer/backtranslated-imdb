as always, this is an inaccurate picture of the homeless. TV told many lies about pan traders in the early 1990s and made everyone look bad, claiming that we all made over $ 100 a day, as $ 20-40 a day was much closer to reality. when someone drove by where i stopped a sign that offered to work and offered me to work, i actually went and took the job if i was physically able.and if i was offered $ 100,000 id condemned safely invested in apt prepaid for at least 2 years and held the most in the bank and left me $ 10-20000 for NL $ 1-2 and $ 2-5 cash games at the casinos. I usually always win and could win decent if I just had a bankroll. Instead, I win about $ 1000 a month, it is all that plays in always minimum purchases due to not risking losing it all. I was just homeless because I wouldn't risk spending all my money and breaking, sometimes I had over $ 1000-2000 in my sock while sleeping outside. anyone who wants to talk, contact sevencard2003 on Yahoo Messenger. I admit that I was different from most homeless, but because I never drank smoke or drugs. I'm no longer homeless, now in govt housing for $ 177 a month and getting SSI and spending most of my time winning at online poker. Mom and sunflower diversified worked hard to get me SSI. happy that my days are hiding under the stage of the casino convention center at night sleeping, worrying about being caught by security is finally over. had this TV employee picked me theyd been much earlier. It is a shame how they do not better choose who they choose.
