Demer Daves, is a wonderful instructor when it comes to westerner and "broken arrow" remains in everyone's heart. As for the melodrama, he must leave it to know people like Vincente Minelli, George Cukor or the amazing Douglas Sirk. The play is so predictable that you will not be surprised once while you see such a lukewarm weepie. Natalie Wood's character was inspired by Fannie Hurst's "imitation of life" (see Stahl and Sirk), but who could think she's a black man's daughter anyway? Susan Kohner was more credible in the "imitation of life") and Sinatra and Curtis get so stereotypical that they can't do anything about them: the bad officer and the wealthy looking and one-Sergeant.Guess who will Natalie fall in love with? France is shown as a tolerance area where interracial trade unions are warmly welcomed. At the time (about 1944) it was doubtful that it is still too narrow for you to find here and everywhere.
