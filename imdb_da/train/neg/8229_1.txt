- Featuring miners - <br /> <br /> I've seen a number of decent indie horror films like The Hamiltons, The Boys Love Mandy Lane and Cabin Fever; unfortunately I felt five over the eye do not fall into this category. From the beginning to the end, the film is plagued with amateurish action that resonates from a very poor script. God only knows why the author thought of dialogue like "No, don't go out there, don't go there, she gets you: if she gets you, she'll kill you, and if she kills you, you're dead" is of movie quality. <br /> <br /> This movie shows very little character development and, to be honest, I couldn't care less about what pain and torture were inflicted on them, as they are just a group of ditsy college girls who hardly have any redeeming qualities. All they do is cry and whing the whole movie and if the girls are not crying their reasoning; When talking about each other, the topics are completely random: about dating boys or how one of the girls' father was recently cremated (appropriate topics when you are chased by a psychotic killer). <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also abysmal showing corny techno music during both start and end credits (though hearing the credit music know that the end was approaching seemed like heaven). <br /> <br /> Camera work is terrible and sometimes the movie is unmatched. I guess because of having little or no budget director was limited to only one digital camera lying in the girls' car almost the entire movie. I think it was an attempt to keep the audience as close to the action as possible: to feel and experience what the girls are going through. But because of a very shaking camera, grainy image and too close to the action, it can be difficult to tell what is happening during action scenes and is simply chaotic. It's a thing to make a movie subjective, but it's another to have action on the screen that an audience can't decipher because of the poor filmography. <br /> <br /> I understand that Five Across The Eyes is a low budget movie, but it doesn't apologize for the very poor quality. There are no redeeming factors for this movie: bad acting, bad scripting, shoddy camera work and no story. In light of all this, I decided to give the movie 1 out of 10, as it left me very disappointed; Want a meteor to hit the ground that brings me sweet relief. Its 94 minutes off stupid college girls crying, arguing, effortlessly running and having random inappropriate conversations. But how many times do you see girls defecating in their hands and throwing crap on the front car of a hunting car.
