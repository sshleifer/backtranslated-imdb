How many centuries will pass until the Japanese / Asian horror movies leave the long-haired ghost shtick? Admittedly, they have managed to tear "Ringu" a million times, and it often worked well - which only shows that originality is not so much of a demand in the horror genre (or that I am very uncritical and easy to please?). But this time I found myself a little restless, a little boring. It's not a bad movie, but it's at least half an hour longer than it should be, with its absurd 110 minute length. Compared to many other Japanese horror films, OMC lacks atmosphere and excitement. Finally, the end is confusing: it makes no sense at all. As for the ringtone: Miike could have got a tune that is more effective than the forgotten little thing. Although it was played a dozen times, I can't even remember it - it was so scary it was. Talking about Miike, for him it is something of a commercial venture, so if anyone thinks they might get perversion of the "Bijita Q" or "Audition" type, they waste their time.
