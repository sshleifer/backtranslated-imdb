I do not like to use the word "terrible" to describe any work in the cinema, how much time, effort, talent and money is spent in its creation, but Zefferelli's attempt to adapt Charlotte Bronte's novel "Jane Eyre" is a total waste of time. The scripture lacks in finesse and power, everything is explained to the viewer in no uncertain terms, leaving little to the imagination. The main players are violently mistaken, clearly employed for their star names, and the musical score is dripless and boring. Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt have absolutely no chemistry with each other at all. She is like a wet noodle, worse than Joan Fontaine, who at least could withstand emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion. And William Hurt shows the whole movie on a tone, and that tone is flat and devoid of energy. Of course, limp and vapid script do not help any of these otherwise fine actors in their efforts to bring some life into this flick. <br /> <br /> Joan Plowrights wife Fairfax is like a Disney creator who keeps popping up sweet scenes where she would be best left out. <br /> <br /> There's no mystery about the story of Rochester's first wife. The role of the worst second wife played as a Barbie Doll by Elle MacPhearson is an empty encryption. <br /> <br /> Fiona Shaw, a very great actress, is wasted as Jane's aunt, Mrs Reed. She would have been better cast as Mrs Fairfax. Only Amanda Root, like Jane's beloved school teacher, evokes any authentic sympathy or credibility. <br /> <br /> I watched this version of 'Jane Eyre' after watching Robert Young's on British television, made in 1997 with lead Ciaran Hinds, Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones. There is no comparison. Young's vital, romantic and in-depth version is like an exploding nova compared to Zefferelli's wet squib. <br /> <br /> I would now like to see the 1970 version with Timothy Dalton, on which I have read some very good things on this site. I'm surprised how many people liked Zefferelli's Yorkshire picture book. <br /> <br /> All I can say good about this movie is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography is vividly colored, except that it is a complete dud.
