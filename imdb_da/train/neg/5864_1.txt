I'm absolutely sure this was the worst movie ever made. If you can't make a 13 year old boy laugh at stupid humor, give up on comedy forever. Unfortunately, Joan Rivers chose differently. The movie is full of predictable gags (some of which are racist) and very unfunny jokes. Particularly memorable is the scene where the doctor tells the protagonist that the rabbit is dead and he's pregnant (when I write this, I can't believe it was actually a movie scene). The man rushes to a dead rabbit on the doctor's desk and tries to give it mouth to mouth. ROTFLMAO! DOES NOT! Punch the line that can tell you how bad things are in this movie is "I knew I should have been at the top." ha ha ha hah ugh ........
