I didn't know anything about this movie until I was convinced to see it by a friend who had heard it was a "non-stop epic battle scene from start to finish". It couldn't have been further from the truth. This was one of the most boring, poorly written, amateurish, horribly acted movies I have ever had the misfortune to put my eyes on. I'd rate it up there with the movie, I consider the worst movie of all time ... Battlefield Earth. There is basically no story, it's hard to believe that the decision makers in this movie thought that this osteopasic soap opera crap would be taken seriously as an actual historical fact. It also has some of the worst dialogues I've ever heard ... like this little gem ... Guy tells girl "You smell like the moon." Girl answers: "What smells the moon?" OMG! It must be your joke! The scene where the guy was pulled and quarted got some good laughs from the audience as it looked so ridiculously cheap and the sound of the guy was torn apart, reminding me that someone was making a fresh sound with their mouth. If this plays at a theater near you, avoid it at all costs. This movie is so bad that I actually took the 45 minute decision that I needed to get to sleep ... and I did. Terrible.
