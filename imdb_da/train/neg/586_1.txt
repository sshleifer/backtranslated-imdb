After what I thought was a masterful achievement of two roles in the Man From Snowy River, why was Kirk Douglas replaced by Brian Dennehy in the sequel? It was just not the same without Spur and Harrison, who portrayed Douglas. Perhaps he recognized how poor the plot was - Jim returns after prolonged absence to find Jessica pursued by another man. He could not expect a girl to wait so long without contact from him and not find competition. For a Disney movie, this foul language includes the very unnecessary part when Jim & Jessica shacked without being married - much LAME. Quite an insult to the viewer intelligence, according to members of my family. I stick to the first one and try to forget that I've ever seen the sequel!
