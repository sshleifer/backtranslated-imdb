Regardless of the film's merits, it has been poorly studied. As others have pointed out, the film shows the locals in Iran, speaking in Arabic, rather than Persian. It is enough to lose credibility for anyone who has the least knowledge of the area or country. The landscape could not be any different from the real. <br /> <br /> Other factual errors: A train turns out to work in Afghanistan while Afghanistan does not have railways. The Turkish ambassador has a Fez (the red hat), while Fez was banned by Turkey much before the time of the film. The Turkish Ambassador's daughter is actually dressed as an Indian, and Indian classical music plays in the background in many scenes. I suppose the filmmakers should show an exotic woman, and sari was what they decided to make her exotic.
