I die to see this when I saw the ridiculous MEATBALLS poster and divined that it should be the best satire ever. What a brilliant idea for a satire genre is flat. Unfortunately, the finished product (which I believe everyone involved has probably realized) is a catalog with missing opportunities, not quite there performances and (fortunately!) A couple of extremely hilarious, inspired bits. Janeane Garafolo, who is very striking, looks really bad here, probably because she is uncomfortably struggling to make her fluttering fun. David Hyde Pierce is just sad to see, trying to be hard to be fun and resembling a Castro geek. Molly Shannon is so funny, just SE, she makes you laugh, but somehow she avoids the snowball segment in something hysterical. Paul Rudd had a great teenager and was sexy as hell, the other guys are also really funny (the nerds). I think the problem is that the director just doesn't move things together at the right pace. He starts very deadpan and it puts it monotonous. But when he does things become really scandalous (the drug sequence is the second funniest moment I've had all year in movies, the first one also comes in a mockery: Andrea Martin in ALL OF THE GUYEN complains about the movie IN & OUT), it's simply fun. I wanted this movie to work so badly, but it just didn't. Clothing and styling for 1981 is 99.9% PERFECT, and the very few songs used are also perfect. This ends up as a medium-poor MAD TV episode, complete with frustrating overlay sketches.
