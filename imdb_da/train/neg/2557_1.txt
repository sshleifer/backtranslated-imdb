I actually like Asylum movies. I have made it a habit to see as many as possible. Even the rip-offs they have done have been cool as EXORCISM AND WHEN A KILLER INVOLVES. This is just plain lama. I can't believe that the same people who did the DEAD WALKING and DRACULA's CURSE actually made this movie too !!! It's not even ridiculously bad as JOLLY ROGER or ALIEN ABDUCTION (which by the way is pretty bad). This is just BAD! I think I can appreciate and / or forgive bad actors or paralyze special effects in an asylum movie, but this movie takes too much of a care. I really hope SNAKES ON A TRAIN is better. Now it's a movie I can't wait to see.
