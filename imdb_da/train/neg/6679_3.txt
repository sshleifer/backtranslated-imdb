Manoj Agrawal after PARDESI BABU (1998) failed back with this movie <br /> <br /> The movie has Govinda in 8-9 roles, since his father, mother, grandfather, sister and later also have disguises <br /> <br /> In short, he is a useless detective sent on a case by his friend for evidence against his wife whose images he loses at the airport while flirting with Rani. He disguises as a Sardarji in the plane and again as a girl The fun part is how easy and short time he does it? <br /> <br /> Then he pamperes like a French singer and enters a television to get proofs lol and then as a maharashtrian (yes inside the TV itself) The rest of the movie has the same wrong identities and ending in a predictable note There are some fun scenes like Govinda being bashed by an African and also many other parts <br /> <br /> Direction from Manoj Agrawal is okay Music is okay <br /> <br /> Among actors shows Govinda again that he is one of the most reliable actors. He is usually a fan tastic, even though he has done such roles before he fits in all the get-ups and roles too well again, although the very hip 6-7 roles do not actually fit in the movie. Rani looks fat, well kept with Govinda thatz it. She is Nothing big and held such a kind of roles Among the rest Nirmal Pandey is as usual Johny Lever is too loud at times and fun in places in 1 role and irritates as the older Tinnu Anand is okay, Satish Kaushik is funny, Paresh is okay Tanaaz is okay
