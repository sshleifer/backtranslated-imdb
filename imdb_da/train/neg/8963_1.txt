The killings in this movie aren't that bad, but it's probably the movie's. It's even worse than that. It is not even the wear it can cause when sliding it into your DVD player. <br /> <br /> Not even the wear and tear it brings on your shoulders carrying it from the DVD store, not talking about the money and the time you spend renting and seeing it. Terrible. <br /> <br /> It is beyond understanding how anyone could say something positive about this movie. It was just a baroque masochistic tendency to me that made me not stop looking at, adding the group press from my co-watchers. The manuscript is terrible, even worse, and the actor is despicable. <br /> <br /> I hope you don't see this as a destruction of your fun, I'd rather see it as a fair warning: Don't waste your time watching this waste!
