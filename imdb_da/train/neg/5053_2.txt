I read another review that expressed the view that Platoon was an infinite cycle of marines killing people, being killed, taking drugs and talking waste. <br /> <br /> I don't agree because the movie actually had more to it, but somehow I can see what that person is trying to say: this had no real plot - which is a point I am agree. It is self-reliant stone at his best. He really wanted to show not only how war leads to death, but also how it is extremely traumatic for survivors. Unfortunately, the film seems to "glorify" this aspect, and the grand finale is just for champagne, grand, Oscar-hunting "let's create a lasting image" to my liking. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with Stone and other filmmakers of his ilk that they do not understand this simple concept: depicts the terribly bloody deadly waste that the war does not prove or even reflect on whether it was an unfair or immoral war. We have seen the same at the moment with Iraq. If you are missing the point, let me say it all to you: If you saw how really bloody the Second World War was, and how devastating it was on the lives of the surviving soldiers, would you believe it was an unfair war? If only this conviction does not convince you that it was an unjust war, why should Vietnam's horror beliefs convince you that it was wrong to go to war in this case. Personally, I do not support the US decision to go to war in Vietnam, but I certainly do not subscribe to "this war is wrong because people died and suffered" the theory. I don't think motivations are always wrong by default, just because the war itself is horrible. <br /> <br /> It doesn't say that the end or the last big "twist" was a little stupid. However, this is not Stone's first oddball departure. Wall Street was a magnificent movie until the last 30 minutes or so, as it made a terrible "wrong trip". JFK is probably one of the few films that Stone did, which actually ended very well. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't matter in this because there was very little plot up to the time the movie was going to twist. And so I gave it so low brand. It was almost history-less and ultimately boring - unless you fell to the produced poignancy.
