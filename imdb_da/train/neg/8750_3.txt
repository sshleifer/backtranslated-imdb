Aldolpho (Steve Buscemi), an aspiring film producer, lives in a battered NYC apartment and trusts his mother to help make the rent. He has a beautiful neighbor named Angelica (Jennifer Beals) who may or may not be married but as Aldolpho would love to star in his movie. When Al unexpectedly gets a financial promise to fund his movie from a strange man named Joe, he thinks he's got it. That is, until Joe takes Al on an adventure to steal a Porsche for part of the financial support. Will the movie be made before Aldolpho is completely without a moral backbone? And will Angelica star in the movie? This is according to this viewer a horrible movie. The scripture is scary, with a plot that wanders will nilly. Beals almost dumps all its lines and Buscemi, though good, is not descriptive. There are a lot of unpleasant material and scary signs to start. Finally, the production values ​​are very poor and the films always look like second rate. If you have time on your hands, it's still a good idea not to take a chance with this movie. But if you are the sincere glutton of punishment, go ahead and see the darn thing. Beals look beautiful.
