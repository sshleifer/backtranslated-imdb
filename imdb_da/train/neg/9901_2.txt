This really should have been a star, but there were so many clich√©s, predictable terms, seen it all before slasher flick parallels that I actually give it an extra star for the fact it made me laugh ... even though It was never the director's intention I am sure. I don't often write comments about movies, they must be either sensational or in this case really bad. To be honest, as soon as I saw Jeff Fahey in it, I knew it would be poor as he has a unique nose to take out the worst movies. Somehow the farce of it all got me to see it all through, maybe to MR T's hilarious voice (not relay Mr T, but you know what I mean if you bother to see this). If you see it, make sure you don't pay to see it. This may have worked if they actually put intention comedy into it, but I'm sure you'll find the odd laugh here and there by the farce of it all ...
