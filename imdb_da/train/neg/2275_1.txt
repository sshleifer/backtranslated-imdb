A remake of Alejandro Amenabar's Abre los Ojos, but this time with a live, respiratory mask that lead. For the dubious advantage of an English soundtrack, we endure Tom Cruise's soulless performance as normal with zero depth. Yes, the character is identified with his persona, but we usually get some signs below it to keep our interest. His empty position rejects any erotic energy that could have been between his character and Cruz or Diaz. <br /> <br /> There is a play involving using masks to free the actor to enrich his presentation of character by verbal and body language means. Cruise masking only accentuates his inadequacy as an actor. See the original Amenabar 1997 Open your eyes!
