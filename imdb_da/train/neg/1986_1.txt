Must agree with the other reviewer. This must be the WORST movie, let alone Western I have ever seen. Horrible actor, dialogue that was imaginative and pathetic (let alone quite inappropriate for apparently in the 19th century), and oh, did I mention a battery pack prominently displayed on the back of one of the characters? I waited for the boom Mike to fall in the middle of a scene. And the end? The least I can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the movie ... absolutely horrible. And yes, it contained all the clich√©s in the book from the slow down the empty dusty path to the ridiculous "let's remember when" shot when the protagonist dies. Luckily I saw this on free tv. Do not waste your time.
