What a horrible movie! For some reason, scientific laboratories and outposts always have staff of grubby, dirty, medieval, misanthropes living inside. These people, who probably work together on complicated scientific projects, may not seem to agree on how to survive death in the hands of a CGI Dragon. Spoilers: An unpleasant scientist whose main skill is "learning" and "the monstrous stare" has cloned a dragon. While the laboratory was working on this kind of thing, the other scientists were shocked because they were apparently out in their trials and got their pants down. The rest of the story is like THE THING or Ten Little Indians where the staff are hunted and killed as they try to formulate a way to escape and / or defeat "Dragon". CGI Dragon Creature is dark gray, which seems to be the popular color for most of the cheap CGI special effects. It hardly looks better than a cartoon, and the dark gray tones make it hard to see some interesting details in the Dragon's body. All it looks like is a gray flower. The action is less than horrible. These scientists act like a bunch of children who don't agree on something, and it makes it easier for the dragon to kill them in various attempts to escape, hide, etc. Dean Cain is hardly better than any of the well-known unknown actors in this movie. He seems to sink to the level of his support. This movie is really, really terrible. The action is bad. The story is stupid. CGI is very very cheap and amateurish. There is nothing praising about this movie, it is not even a good time player to look at while doing chores or other work.
