It was great to see all the known characters again, but the story disturbed me. We loved Ariel in the first movie - so why is the other centered around his daughter? The new characters were annoying and I didn't like the plot of this. Worst of all, Christopher Daniel Barnes did not return as Eric's voice! Disney, you can stop reusing classic movies with these shoddy imitations.
