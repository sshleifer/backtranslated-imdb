See all the negative reviews for this movie, I figured it could be another comic masterpiece that wasn't supposed to be. I saw the first two battle scenes, listened to the generic dialogue that was terribly delivered by the lungs, and all the other inmost oriental actors, and I found the movie so horrible that it was fun. Then Brandon Lee enters the story, and the lines begin to fly, the plot falls apart, the screenwriters begin to drink and the movie is worn out, it is welcome as it becomes the worst action movie, EVER. <br /> <br /> The lungs turn out their past efforts in "The Punisher" and others, as well as all Van Dam's films, Seagal's films and Stallone's non-Rocky films, for this particular honor. This movie has the worst play (see Tia Carrere's face when she's in a scene with Dolph, it's worth laughing), with the worst dialogue ever (Brandon Lee's comment on Little Dolph is the worst line ever in a movie) and the worst outfit in a movie (Dolph in full Japanese dress). Picture "Tango and Cash" with worse plays, meets "Commando", meets "Friday the 13th" (due to the nonsense nudity and Lungren's performance is much Jason Voorhees-like) for an hour and fifteen minutes joke of a movie. <The good (what about not terrible) notions goes to the bad guy (who still looks constipated throughout his performance) and Carrere (who somehow says her 5 lines without breaking out laughing). Brandon Lee is about to be Lungren's sidekick, and does a really terrible job in it. <br /> <br /> A horrible, horrible movie. Fear it and avoid it. If you see it yourself, ask yourself why underwater shoots are twice as clear as most non-underwater images. Talk about the underwater shoots, check out the lame water fight scene with the worst fight-scene end ever. This movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those with short attention tensions and to fill the flash of nudity. <br /> <br /> A bad bad movie !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
