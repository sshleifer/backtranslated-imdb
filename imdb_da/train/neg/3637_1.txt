I am amazed at the positive reviews for this thoroughly uninspiring movie. <br /> <br /> Often with foreign films, I skip reviews that complain of slow pace and seemingly "inaction" as many of the best international movies do not live up to the western Hollywood model of movie story. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the frequent artistry and lack of clich√© in the alien film scene. I enjoy that many foreign films do not tie things up in a nice, cute little bow. <br /> <br /> That said, this movie didn't give a redemption value for the time I wasted watching it. No meaningful character development, no engaging story arc, no way to become emotionally involved with any of the characters on the screen. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: A bunch of emotionally immature, violent colonies murder their slaves, and a little girl gets hurt by her only friend when "house-boy" finally gets tired and takes his abuse out on her. <br /> <br /> While the above paragraphs are exciting and dramatic, this movie will drill you while playing the scenario. I was so effortless that it took three meetings to finish it and I wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for the positive reviews. <br /> <br /> Unless you have an academic interest in the period, I strongly suggest that you steer clear of it.
