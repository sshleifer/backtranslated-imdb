I saw this on cable recently and kinda enjoyed it. I've read the comments here and it seems that everyone likes the second half more than the first half. Personally, I enjoyed the first story (too bad that was not extended.) The other story I thought was clich√©. And that "California Dreaming" if I hear it yet again ... Chungking Express is okay, but it's not something the regular audience will look at, like "Crouching Tiger."
