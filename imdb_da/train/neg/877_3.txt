I was thrilled to see this movie expecting to be the sequel to the cult classy "Private Lessons," depicting the dream of any male teenager. <br /> <br /> "Private Lessons II" has nothing to do with the title I mention. It's just a regular soft-core Cinemax flick that won't change in your life. There is only one hot sex scene in a rooftop, but that's it. I saw this a long time ago, but believe me, it's just a regular boring soft core girl. The women are warm, but it is not enough to rent or buy the movie. My advice is to see this only if it is flying on cable.
