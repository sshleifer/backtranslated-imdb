To check out a good Jason Scott Lee movie, I recommend the following: <br /> <br /> Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story <br /> <br /> Rapa Nui <br /> <br /> "Timecop 2 : Berlin decision "is a horrible movie. Awful production values. Awful play. Terrible script. I would not recommend this movie to be seen by anyone who seriously thinks that tripe like this is quality entertainment or progress Asian American awareness in Hollywood (This movie doesn't.). I would at least like that this movie is a great entertainment on a rainy day if you ever come across it while surfing the channel. If you are curious, maybe a rental from Netflix, but this movie is definitely not going to last. <br /> <br /> If you are one of the few people who saw this movie as a means to increase your Asian movie awareness and came away disappointed, then I recommend the following movies for your personal viewing. These are well-written films with high production values ​​that have a talented cast of Asian American actors: <br /> <br /> Better Luck Tomorrow <br /> <br /> Mulan
