This movie was so bad! It was awful! It was awful! I can't stress it enough! The action, director, story, character and everything about it was bad! It was so corny and clich√©d. Don't be fooled by the cover or tagline "The 'Texas massacre' is nothing to laugh at." Are You Frogging 'Fun Me! It was ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The first 2 minutes of the movie are good until it comes to the main character Brendan, OK now turn it off. What I got from the movie was, A bunch of ugly, annoying and immature people go to a cabin in the middle of the forest, and a clown singing nurseries kills them in unoriginal and fake ways. <br /> <br /> This movie was a waste of my time and money and it would be a waste of your money and time too! I jumped through most of the movie because it was so horrible, I just wanted to see how every bad actor died and it was still not worth it! Just looking at the cover is a waste of time. This is seriously the worst movie ever! Rating: Don't deserve one.
