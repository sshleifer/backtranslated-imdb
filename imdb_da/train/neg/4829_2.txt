As a regular movie guard, I can't say I enjoyed watching it. It's not too emotional for a drama, not too gripping for a thriller, not too fast for an action. Plus, some moments in the movie are hardly credible. OK, I understand, soldiers are getting a little out of their minds out there, but it's hard to believe that a person would risk his life, carjack in the middle of a hostile city and after being shouted at by a professor's wife run away without asking a question (in a proper way). It seems terribly romantic if it was an animation or such, but it must be a serious movie about war. There are several episodes like this, so the whole picture gives the impression that it is just a raw preview of a movie and it needs a lot of work. It feels like the filmmakers wanted to create a picture of an emotionally brave soldier, but all these "curves" in his psychology simply seem unnatural. <br /> <br /> This picture asked a question in my head: why? Why did they give it an Oscar? Why SIX? And IMHO it's the most exciting part of the movie :)
