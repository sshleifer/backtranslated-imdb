Don't let the premise fool you - it was a funny movie. The problem - it shouldn't be a comedy. The story nicely sets you up for an end that never comes. Even worse is the setup never explained. You want to leave the theater, ask "Is that it?" I judge it a 2 simply because there were a few short moments of promise, but the finish leaves you completely flat. Nicholas Cage did as well a job as one might expect in the role, but he had very little to work with. There are odd quirks, and interesting twists everywhere that definitely had nothing to do with the movie. Let this video come out before you waste your money.
