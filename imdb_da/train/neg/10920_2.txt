This must have been one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I have to disagree with another commentary that said the special effects were okay. I found them pretty bad: it just wasn't realistic, and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story. Perhaps the distraction is the reason why I did not fully understand the story. The archaeologists are looking for the "set". They do not want to tell what is stated or what is so special about it. It also makes it unclear why they are looking for it in California while the film's intro takes place in ancient Egypt. <br /> <br /> If you shoot a movie that takes place in the desert, you have to actually go to the desert. The beginning - the old ceremony - looks like it was shot in a studio instead of a desert. The level of action was constant throughout the film, no up and down, no climax. It made the movie short, and it is certainly a pro for this movie.
