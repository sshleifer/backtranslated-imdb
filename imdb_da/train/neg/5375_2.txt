When I just watched this movie, I almost wanted to have wasted 2 hours in my life, but I think there is something good in everything: <br /> <br /> If I were to consider this as any other movie , it can only receive 1 or 2 peaks, but if I rate it as a low budget. movies can get 3 or 4. It is a movie that must be "complete" and without long passages of boredom or waste of time. This movie is not. But I think many independent films are about showing film skills, and given that, this movie has a few highlights. If I have to comment on what the directors should bring with them for their next project, I assume that the distorted sound effects have had some quality. They also manage to build some signs, but it takes me what to do in their next project because the wallet takes too long, as it is mostly irrelevant to the movie plot. Similarly, the long hours dedicated to walking around should be continued in the next project - what is the purpose? I think this movie is trying to be a little bit of everything (building figures, excitement and plot) and ending up being nothing (not much) <br /> <br /> This movie is trying too much and too hard and I think it should have been cut to a short film. I could easily find an hour's walk around or meaningless dialogue to cut the movie. There are too many irrelevant things going on in this movie. The story should have been more streamlined. I know there must be some mystery in this movie, but a little surprise to whom the killer is, does not make a mystery. The story behind the "mystery" receives almost no attention during the film, leaving the final "point" as a quick and unsatisfactory package. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that this film was a good attempt, but I can't. I hope the managers learn from their mistakes and produce a better product next time. <br /> <br /> If you are not interested in bench training from making low cost movies, there is no reason to see this - not even to see why everyone thinks it's bad. As others have said, I am pretty sure that the many 10's given to this movie are from people somehow involved in the movie. This movie could not receive a "10" judge from any remote objective point of view.
