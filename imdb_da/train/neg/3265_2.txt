I have no idea which publication director George Schlatter was hoping to sell this comedy of diseases. With Redd Foxx in the central role and enough pimpy outfits and polyester to carpet throughout the 1970s, "Norman" plays as a blaxploitation image coupled with a number of silly sitcom episodes involving comic misunderstandings, not to mention an elongated cameo by Waylon Flowers ! Based on a game by Sam Bobrick and Ron Clark, this tale of a alien spouse (Foxx and Pearl Bailey) teaches the harsh way that their son is secretly gay - and lives with a hook, white, white gay - has enough lukewarm-wristed jokes to shame any early episode of "Three's Company". Bailey keeps her dignity and Foxx's sheer confusion is good for a few chuckles, but the rest of the artists are humiliated. * from ****
