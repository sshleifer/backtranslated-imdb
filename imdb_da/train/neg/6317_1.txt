I have no idea what dimwit from San Francisco came up with this stupid plot, but apparently they have to get rid of the drugs they take and put their analyst at risk - NOW. Yes, this is a plausible story if you consider the alien abduction sequence in "Life to Brian" as plausible. This movie is a little more than a leftist pipedream. If the US and the Soviet Union give up nuclear weapons, the result would have been to remove the only real obstacle that kept the two from entering a war. Poor as Korea, Vietnam and other wars in the era were, they were "proxy wars" struggling to keep the superpowers from a direct engagement. <br /> <br /> This movie reminds me of how realistic it was when a group of high school kids would go on a hunger strike against nuclear proliferation. As if someone would say "Mr. President, some kids at Drastic High do not eat!" and Ronald Reagan would answer "My God! I would better revise my defense policy!" Right. <br /> <br /> Do you like this movie? Wouldn't it be better if the Soviet Union would have collapsed because they couldn't support their massive armaments ... wait, it happened!
