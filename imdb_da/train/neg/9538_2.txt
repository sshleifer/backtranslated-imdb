When I saw the commercial for this, I was seeing it. Forgive me now, but it has been so long since I have seen that I do not remember how it went. Suffice it to say that the movie I saw had no resemblance to the "movie" they sold me on. <br /> <br /> I was bored, annoyed and incredibly disappointed with this movie. And if it wasn't bad, they had to sink it even more with the terrible reggae music. Not exactly mood-setting music for a horror movie, eh mon? I think if you never saw the commercial (or trailer), I think you might think this is some hot stuff. For my money was commercially much better.
