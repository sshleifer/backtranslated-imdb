I always get frustrated by movies that were apparently written by a sex. Especially when, of course, they do not do enough research to find out when something is not just calling true, but calling blatantly false. The scene I remember is the one in the bathroom, where Jack tells his football teammates that he got Diane pregnant. In no way, form or shape would a guy ever enjoy another guy getting a girl pregnant in high school. They can cheer about the guy who has sex with the hot cheerleader, but I can also guarantee that the first football team heard if it would not be on a urinal. It was obvious that this movie didn't take itself so seriously, and it wasn't terribly bad, but come on!
