There are no words to explain how bad NIGHTMARE WEEKEND is. It simply tolerates the description. Something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victim's mouth that kills them or makes them zombies. The whole thing is so wild that it is fantastic. There is also a girl with a pc in her room and the computer speaks through a hand puppet !!!!!!!! I'm not doing these things. The computer also controls things like cars, even though there is nothing that connects the computer to the vehicle. <br /> <br /> "The movie" is a total garbage. Surreal bad waste. Spectacular, one-of-a-kind poor waste. There are many sex scenes thrown here and there that are not very hot or erotic. There is even a scene where a woman apparently loves or wants French kiss a tarantula that made me roll on the floor. Definitely one of the worst movies ever made. Up there with the equally miserable direct to home video BOARDINGHOUSE, or BOOGEYMAN II (both NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II have scenes with a killing toothbrush!). At least it's fun to watch it and try to make sense of what's happening.
