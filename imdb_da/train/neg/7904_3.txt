Ridiculous little boogues that spawn foam and reproduce themselves. So far for the horror elements this movie has. All the other MUNCHIES play out as a truly retarded comedy that is so stupid you won't find it fun anymore after approx. 15 minutes. I can imagine small children cheering for these little boogers, but adults will only be left with the allegedly "clear" references that translate into screenshots like Capt. Kirk's logbook records from STAR TREK, the most famous scene from ET, a blatant statement from the filmmakers goes "See! We deposit at GREMLIN's success here!" and a cardboard cut by Clint Eastwood tells us ... what about his western movie exactly? The last one was completely lost to me ... Oh yes, and chemical waste management in caves seems to be a bad thing. Don't know where they got that idea from. <br /> <br /> Not to say that MUNCHIES is the most inadequate movie to pass through for that matter. It's just real, really stupid. And if you manage to crack a smile while you see it, you will probably feel so stupid even for doing it after the movie is finished. <br /> <br /> Good badness? Yes, but only if "stupid", "retarded" & "ridiculous" are criteria you are looking for. 3/10 and well, uhm, 6/10.
