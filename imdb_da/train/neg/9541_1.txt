I suppose many people comment / review their first movie on IMDb because the movie was spectacular or awful - I write because of the latter. <br /> <br /> I was thrilled with the sequel to "Wargames" .. I thought the original was quite good considering its time and content, I felt it was worth seeing more than once. This was 2008, I had great hopes for what they would do with this movie. Computers, Gaming, Terror, Military supernatural have all grown so much since the time of the first movie, and "Wargames: The Dead Code" had an opportunity to bring it all to a good flick. <br /> <br /> The movie failed at just about every level, but I especially blame the authors and anyone who had any influence on the reality of game aspects. "The Dead Code" was a 1990 flight simulator with a few people on the ground waving their arms. Meanwhile, the Will Farmer button is barely about 7,000 commands - neither of them affects what is happening on the screen. Until finally he "wins" by clicking on a box on the screen with the mouse releasing gas that instantly kills 20,000 virtual people (no one is close to the gas). Because he beat 5 levels in 15 minutes, this tells RIPLEY (the real life war machine) that he is a high-level terrorist threat. <br /> <br /> Although every 5-16 year old could accomplish this same task - the government thinks he is a deadly threat to humanity. They say things like "He has expert knowledge of biotherapy" ... He showed less knowledge than anyone who read the first 3 sections of the Wiki entry on Bio-Terror. Then follows a movie-long hunting scene with about .01% of the budget and excitement of any of the Bourne titles. They have about 1000 options to catch him and handle the whole thing. Sometimes they are angry, they hardly miss him .. but sometimes they create masterful opportunities, just let him intentionally follow him. <br /> <br /> Ugh ... I wanted to write more .. but I already wasted 1.5 hours watching this, I'd rather see embroidery and Joshua play tic-tac-toe for 1.5 hours.
