This movie will be nominated for a new genre: Complete Mess! Apart from a few chuckles and one or two scenes of gore, this movie is a complete waste of time. Calling it "Campy" doesn't even cut it. "Campy" involves fun as this movie was not. You use the first half of the movie tank "It gets better, isn't it?". In justice, it ultimately does when it is finally explained who the "brother / sister" team is and what they want, but then you no longer worry because you have spent the whole second half of the film wondering exactly. what did Mr. Onorati & Ms Pacula to cross any of this much to get stuck in such a horrible movie. <br /> <br />
