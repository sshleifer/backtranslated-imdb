This film has many problems associated with what makes it come as a low budget class project from someone in the film school. I have to give it credit on its campiness though. Many times throughout the film I found myself laughing hysterically. It was sometimes so funny that made it a fun watch. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a low quality slasher movie with a twist of psychological horror and a touch of campy ridicule, pop a bowl of popcorn, invite some friends over, and have fun. <br /> <br /> I agree with other comments that the sound is very poor. Dialogue is almost impossible to follow much of the time, and the soundtrack is just there.
