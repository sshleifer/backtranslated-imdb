I had a video of the case. And I think it was my fourth attempt to see the whole movie without slipping into sleep. It's slow and the idea of ​​a mid-Atlantic platform that may have been revolutionary at that time is now just a big big yawnaroony. Apart from Conrad Veidt, the rest of the casting is pretty forgettable, and it is only in the end that things get really interesting. When the water began to be wasted in great time, it once awoke to myself. <br /> <br /> But give the man his guilt. No one could hold a cigarette like Conrad Veidt. He doesn't tickle it between his index and middle fingers as the less mortal. He holds it in his fingers as he shows us the old pearl brown. There are a few scenes in this movie where the smoke runs up to the sky against a dark background and looks very artistic. But it doesn't say much about this movie, if all that impresses you is tobacco smoke.
