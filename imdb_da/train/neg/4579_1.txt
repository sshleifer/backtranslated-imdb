"What are we blowing at?" was one of the worst times I've used in the cinema. It was less of a movie and more of an after school special, but at the same time nothing special at all. The attempt at a story where they based their ideas was completely pathetic, as almost everyone will tell you. Marlee Matlin in her underwear should just not happen. I will not dwell on it. What I want to reveal is a criticism that many people are unable to formulate. This movie, while boring, also suffered a huge error in reasoning. It was terribly contradictory because it took such a manipulative, became a creator of your life, manifestation of abundance, shameless propaganda. Interconnection is explained as a large party of our existence. The film, however, encourages us to steer our surroundings with our minds. It completely neglects that there are other people with minds who could control us, which seems to be the case. Or at least the structures where we exist limit us a lot. In this way, the film was insufficiently solipsistic. Solipsism and interconnectivity just don't mix unless you're God Almighty. If you are, you will be impressed (?!?) Of all the fine things this movie will reveal that you can do. If not, you will be very disappointed, a moron or maybe both. Also, the title is so ridiculous, I have trouble warning people not to watch the movie because I feel delayed by mentioning it by name. Shame on everyone involved.
