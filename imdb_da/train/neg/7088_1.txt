I was subjected to this cruelty by my wife, trying to turn it off after 10 minutes, but was forced through it all. This should be, hands down, the most horrible shadow of a movie ever ... There were good script moments, like: <br /> <br /> Sammy - "If she comes over here right away she gets a bonus" Wife - "A Boner?" Sammy - "No, a bonus" <br /> <br /> To sum up: Horrible script, horrible acting and incredibly illogical.
