This is your typical Priyadarshan movie - a bunch of luney characters out on some stupid mission. His signature climax has the whole movie of the movie coming together and fighting each other in some crazy moshpit over hidden money. Whether it's a winning lottery ticket in Malamaal Weekly, black money in Hera Pheri, "kodokoo" in Phir Hera Pheri, etc., the director gets ridiculously predictable. Don't make me wrong; as klich√©d and prehistoric his film may be, i usually end up enjoying the comedy. But in most of his previous films, there has actually been a good sense of humor (Hungama and Hera Pheri are remarkable). Now his film is falling apart as he uses the same formula over and over again. Songs are good. Tanushree Datta looks great. Rajpal Yadav is annoying and Tusshar is not much better. Kunal Khemu is ok and Sharman Joshi is the best.
