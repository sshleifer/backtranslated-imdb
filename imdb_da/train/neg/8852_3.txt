To be honest, I didn't look at all the original "howling", but the scenes I saw made it clear that the first howling was a great movie. so great that seven terrible followers had to be made. they started with "Howling II: Your sister is a werewolf". I got this movie on VHS from my uncle ever since he gave away a bunch of old movies he bought back when Atari was brand new. I just saw it last night and it wasn't really bad, it was just weird. I think that everything with Sybil Danning, who went three-way with two of her werewolf clubs, was just out of the way and completely disturbing (but a little hot), Christopher lee by sticking a dead guy as if she is a vampire etc. , this movie was actually a kind of mish-mash of Dracula and The Lost Boys ... except with werewolves, because everything Christopher Lee (who played Dracula himself) said about werewolves virtually ripped off by any other vampire movie in the heart, garlic, nightshade creature must die of NIGHT, and the ruler of the werewolf lives in TRANSYLVANIA). not much for the actor, but the worst came from Annie McEnroe. I swear, at some point in the movie, I found myself rooting for the werewolves to tear her neck out, for the stupid neck should always say something. Nevertheless, the plot is rather stupid and clich√©d, so there is no real point in telling you, you could just read about it on Wikipedia. By the way, the thing that really makes me miserable in this movie is the fact that it is the only movie out of all the seven successors related in any way to the original (not counting Howling IV (1988) which was a remake of the original, or in other words a successor based on the same novel). so don't watch this movie. there is no real horror, hardly any werewolves, and just terribly special eg. 3.10
