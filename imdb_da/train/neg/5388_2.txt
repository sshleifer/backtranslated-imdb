There's a good movie wondering here, but it's not. The basic idea is good: to explore the moral problems that would come to a group of young survivors in the apocalypse. But the logic is so confused that it is impossible to involve. <br /> <br /> For example, our four heroes (understandably) are paranoid to capture the mysterious airborne infection that has wiped out almost all of humanity. Nevertheless, they sometimes wear surgical masks, not others. Sometimes they are fanatical about wiping with bleach any area affected by an infected person. Other times, they seem completely carefree. <br /> <br /> Worse, after apparently surviving some weeks or months in this new kill-or-killed world, these people always behave as a complete beginner. They do not want to accumulate proper equipment or food. They run out of fuel forever in the middle of the sky. They do not take elementary precautions when they meet strangers. And having wrung through the rotting bodies of all mankind, they are as bad as protected debutants. You have to constantly wonder how they could have survived that long ... and even if they did, why would anyone want to make a movie about them. So when these dweebs stop agonizing over the moral dimensions of their actions, it is impossible to take their soul search seriously. Their actions must first make a kind of minimal sense. <br /> <br /> On top of all this, we must fight with Chris Pine's questionable play. His depiction of an arrogant young James T Kirk could have been sharp when viewed in isolation. But in Carriers, he plays exactly the same note: arrogant and bone-headed. It is impossible not to suspect that this constitutes his entire dramatic area. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the movie * looks good. It has a sharpened, saturated look that really fits the Southwestern US location. But it can't save the really weak font or the paper thin (and annoying) characters. Even if you are a fan of the ultimate genre, you should save yourself where to see Carriers.
