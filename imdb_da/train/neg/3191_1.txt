There are movies that are terrible and there are movies that are so horrible, they are considered far forgotten and unmatched. Also lots of violence and bad things (not just cheesy stuff you know what I mean) also adds the mix. What is the result of bad movies with such content? Why, "Final Justice", of course! <br /> <br /> Remember "Mitchell?" Joe Don Baker was the star of that movie and it was ripped by Joel and Bots at the "Mystery Science Theater 3000." Now this time, with Mike taking Joel's place on Satellite of Love (but with the same bots), that trio had to make fun with MST3K's second Joe Don Baker movie, "Final Justice." Of course, many of the naughty things I mentioned were removed for television broadcasting, but I still want to see that episode (and "Mitchell" too) because what makes Joe Don the "hat" most? Why, no one but the "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" <br /> <br /> P.S. If you have a large mass nearby, check out the store for the unknown tape! LOL It happened to another user!
