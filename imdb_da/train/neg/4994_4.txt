Good movies are original, some leave a message or touch you in a certain way, but sometimes you are not in the mood for it. <br /> <br /> I wanted something simple, no thoughts just plain action when I saw this. It started well and was quite entertaining so why a bad review. Well in the end, the film lost its credibility. The story was not so cheesy at all, the action was not so special, but generally good, the action was OK, so more than enough to satisfy my needs. But everything was destroyed because things happened that were over the top and it gave me a bad feeling. They should have put a little more effort into making everything credible and would have gotten a 7 in the "no thinking just plain action" category. So, if you know you are getting annoyed, then, because things happen that seem completely illogical: don't look! otherwise I would say go ahead ...
