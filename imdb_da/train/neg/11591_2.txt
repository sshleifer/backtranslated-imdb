This movie is so incredibly bad that I almost felt sick to see it. Until that time, the other rates had at least one good thing about it. Part 1 was exciting and gory. Part 2 was off beat and entertaining. Part 3 was interesting with great effects. Part 4 had good music, good special effects and a new entertaining Freddy Krueger. Part 5 is more boring than anything I've ever seen before. Alice, a much more beautiful blonde, from part 4 is back with her boyfriend Dan. On the parts, this supposed Elm Street installment turns into a dayblow. The newer figures seem tough, and even the cute Alice has a chip on her shoulder. Freddy seems to be completely out of this. He looks tired and does not seem to be so cruel. His one-liners seem out of place and different, where as in part 4 they could be quite fun. Leslie Bohem's story never comes out of the ground, and Stephen Hopkins's direction is so bad that it makes my grandmother look good! The whole plot of this movie is ridiculous and unrealistic. It's also confusing and pretty stupid. Avoid Part 5 at all costs!
