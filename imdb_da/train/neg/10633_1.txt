I watched this video on a friend's house. I'm glad I didn't waste money buying this one. The video tape has a scene from the 1975 film Capricorn One. The movie starts with several clips of rocket blasts, most not related to manned flight. Sibrel's smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast. He edits in his own voice-over instead of letting us know what the crew had to say. The video curiously ends with a view of the Zapruder film. His claims of radiation, foreclosure, star photography and others make me believe that he is extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to paint against NASA, astronauts or Americans in general. His science is bad and it is also this video.
