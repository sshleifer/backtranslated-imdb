Oh, dear sir .... They've turned what was a pretty thought-provoking movie to a swaggering testosterone party. <br /> <br /> The original 1971 version of this movie was beautifully vague about our hero Kowalski. He was a man who tried to drive from Denver to San Francisco to win a bet. Why was he willing to risk his life for the price of a handful of uppers? We are not entirely sure. <br /> <br /> We had a couple of flashbacks that gave us the picture that he was an adrenaline junkie and presumably he had led his entire life trying to make it to the vanishing point. It points you to the distance where the left and right shoulders come together and the road itself disappears. He lives only to be free and does not mean sick to anyone. We saw several times when there were accidents, he stopped to make sure the other driver was okay before moving on, even the police officers chasing him. <br /> <br /> When he saw the futility of his quest, he took his life rather than being arrested and living a captive life. He died as if he were living and running wide. <br /> <br /> In remake, Kowalski has an entire story (including a first name himself.) He tries to get to the hospital where his wife suffers from complications to her pregnancy. He is a devoted man and excitedly expecting father. He comes to the decision to take his life after hearing his wife's death in delivery, but they even leave that question when they suggest he might have jumped out of the car before it ran into the bulldozers. They even gave that part of "super soul", the blind DJ (brilliantly depicted by Clevon Little in the original) to JASON PRIESTLY?!?!?!?!?!? Give me a break.
