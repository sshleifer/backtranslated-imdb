That's what my friend Brian said about this movie after about an hour of it. He was unable to keep off. I had ranting on how uncomfortable it was, and eventually I relocated and played it as I ran out of adjectives for "boring". <br /> <br /> Imagine, if you like, the height of hacking. Something so uninspired so impossible that everything you want to do after seeing it is sitting alone in the dark and not talking to anyone. Some people work under the illusion that this movie can be seen. It is not, not under any kind of narcotic or brain injury. I would only recommend this to anyone to help them understand how truly unbearable it is. Don't believe me? Collect the round. <br /> <br /> The proof, as a nation, we in America do not always show Middle Eastern people in a tasteful way. But what about a child in a sackcloth that is bent in a sala mode for a stack of Castrol engine oil bottles? You find it here. GET IT? ARAB SAFETY OIL. I couldn't believe what I saw. Having the baby airplane in a skyscraper would have been more appropriate. Who in their real mind would think it was a fun joke? It's not even close to "wise offensive". It just sucks and makes you want to beat who has been paid to write it a bit on the face. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the movie, a five-man band called the "Landmines" scene on an officer ball. Okay are you ready? The wit is SINGING SPECIAL AND OFF-KEY. Why did I write it in caps too? Because the joke is POINT, POINT, POUNDED IN YOUR HEAD with a marathon of HORRENDOUS sight gags. They start mediocre enough; glasses cracking, punch tumblers crushing ... so there, I'm 100% serious, a two-frame stop-motion sequence of a woman's shoes coming out. You read it correctly - the music was so bad, in a frame the woman's feet have shoes on. Nearly the shoes are off !!! Get it because the music was so bad, her shoes came out! What f ???? <br /> <br /> There is an endless assembly of stock footage to drive home the point that SINGING IS BAD. If any human being actually suffered through this scene in the theater without running like hell, I would be astonished. This movie is honestly a practical joke to see how quickly people would turn out of the doors. Robert Downey Sr. Leads comedies as his son commands respect by remaining drug-free. Bad. Other things to look out for: <br /> <br /> 1. The popular music shoe horn in wherever possible. Every time the licensee appears, a really inappropriate Iggy Pop song plays. Plus all the actors do their best to act as if it was very cool for some reason. <br /> <br /> 2. Barbara Bach's criminally horrible accent. She sounds like she's trying to talk like a baby while rolling a marble around her tongue. There is no nudity, and there are several scenes where the boys all moan and scream from a glimpse of her cleavage as if they are in a community school acting class, and they have been instructed to act as awakening retarded people. <br /> <br /> 3. Liceman feeds his outrageous dog a condom. Remember; when this movie came out to throw in "abortion" and "condom" was seen as "edgy". <br /> <br /> 4. Tom Poston plays a choppy, boy-seeking pedophile, back when Hollywood believed "pedophiles" and "gay" were the same. Flat out embarrassing. <br /> <br /> 5. See the end. Nothing is wrong with your VCR. It's actually the end. Tell me what doesn't make you explode anyone who ever made any movie. <br /> <br /> See this at your own risk. Up Academy has been known for actually making other movies, like The Jerk or Blazing Saddles, less fun just by placing the video tape near them.
