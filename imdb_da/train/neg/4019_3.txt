Dakota (1988) was another early Lou Diamond Phillips starring role. This movie looks like the later released film Harley. There are some differences, but they are both the same. I don't know which one came first. I think it will remain one of life's mysteries. But they both are troubled "kids" trying to turn around, living around. Instead of bicycles, this involves horses. They are pretty much the same movie, and they are both cheesy as hell. If you are a serious L.D.P. fan, I recommend you see them both. You get some extreme mugging and posturing from L.D.P. If you are games then go for it. <br /> <br /> Not recommended, except L.D.P. fans !!!
