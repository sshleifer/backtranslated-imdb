The only thing worse than surfers without waves is a movie about surfers without any waves. For viewers who love to surf this movie, it will be a gigantic disappointment as the total number of surfing movies struggles to reach three. The story is a piece of life about stranded surfers who are not waiting for perfect wave but for any wave at all. J.C. (Sean Pertwee) is an aging super surfer who flirts with an engagement with her boyfriend Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). Just as he is finding adult happiness with the woman he loves, three old surfing friends turn up and convince him to hit the beach and look for monster waves at Bone Yard. The problem is that there are no waves for the whole end of the movie, so most of the story pops out of a meandering sequence of interrupted beach events. The action is mostly mediocre. Sean Pertwee has a couple of comic moments, but for the most part his action was everyday. Ewan McGregor was decent as a drug trafficking of wild men, by far the most interesting and peculiar nature of the pile. Probably the funniest achievement was nominated by Peter Gunn as Terry, who turned his bodily body into a constant synagogue. Catherine Zeta-Jones was sexy as usual, but her character didn't really have enough meat for her to show much play. <br /> <br /> There's really not much here to comment on. I rated it a 3/10. It is a real beach bummer.
