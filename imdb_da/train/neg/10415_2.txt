2 stars out of a possible 10 - and it's too generous. <br /> <br /> I was thinking of a cast by James Woods, Cathy Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gossett, Jr. and Henry Thomas - how could it miss. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I can only wonder what drugs Sam Shepard was on the weekend, he straddled this piece of dribble. I had long suspected Sam S. of being nuts, this movie, based on his play, confirms it. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of artsy b. that the actors love to sink their teeth in, as it gives them a chance to endlessly emote. But for the viewer sitting through this obscene bin, there is absolutely nothing to love about this movie. You have not seen dysfunctional families before you have seen this bunch. Dad's crazy, Ma's crazy, son's crazy and daughter's, oh yes, crazy. They also have mouths on those who say words that would blush a sailor, especially the teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> In addition to the above, as if it wasn't enough, the plot - and it's so thin you could read it thoroughly - has a gap in the size of Alaska. <br /> <br /> Ma is composed to sell their rundown farm. As it turns out, it's also Pa. Now I do not claim to be a property expert, but the last time I checked, property ownership must jointly have both owners' signatures to be sold. If only one of them owned the property, then the other could not legally sell it, so it would make no sense for the person to do so. Mr. Shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact and therefore his plot does not work. <br /> <br /> Not that anything else really worked right. <br /> <br /> The only possible reason anyone could have to see this movie is if they are absolutely desperate to see James Woods in full frontal nudity, and I can't imagine why anyone would.
