When I looked at this movie I thought, OK, it'll be a while ... I was wrong. The real best part of this movie was when it was over. A complete waste of 92 minutes. The side to side the best part was when Wendigo finally showed up, which was at the end and you couldn't really see him as well. And the tail end was also really stupid as well. There were too many sections in the movie where you thought something was going to happen, but was a disappointment. The worse part was there was more talk about Wendigo, so there was Wendigo. For the creature was so bad, you certainly could not tell this movie.
