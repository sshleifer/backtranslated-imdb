1. Looked at 5/26/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Michael Almereyda): Strange story of a druid witch trying to capture eternity by inheriting her grandson's body. At least I think it was the relationship. A kind of eerie quality is held throughout this movie, not unlike Stephen Kings The Shining. The difference is that Nicholson's struggle was not at all in this movie. This is all taken very seriously until almost the end when some lame lines and attempts to encourage the mood do not work at all. The performance is not the problem here, but the story is. Everything does not seem to come together very smoothly and the viewer is left with many pieces of information and no real understanding of what happened in the movie. There is a very small throwaway performance by Christopher Walken as the uncle's uncle, which of course gives him top billing in an attempt to sell the movie. Don't buy this gimmick and avoid this movie. <br /> <br />
