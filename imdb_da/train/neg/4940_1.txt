This show turned out to be a waste of 30 minutes of precious DVR hard drive space. I didn't expect much and I actually got less. Not only do I expect this show to be canceled by the second episode, I can't believe Geico will ever try to use the cavemen ad campaign ever again. I would have preferred to spend a night checking my daughter's hair for head lice than seeing this piece of rejection. I wonder what ABC passed to make this show fit in the '07 fall table, perhaps a hospital / crime / mocumentary reality show with AFLAC duck? In case I failed to express my opinion on this show, let me be clear and say that it is not too good.
