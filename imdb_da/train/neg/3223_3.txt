LAUGH OUT LOUD! Not a bad way to start it. I thought this was original, but then I discovered that it was a clone of KING KONG's 1976 remake. I have never seen KING KONG before I was 15. I watched this movie when I was 9. The movie's funky disco music will get stuck in the head! Not to mention the film's theme song by Yetians. These are the worst creatures I've ever seen. At the same time, this film remains a sacred bar of B-movies. Memorable quotes: "Take a soothing and go to bed." "Put the Yeti in your tank and you have the Yeti power." I remember watching this movie on MOVIE MACRABE hosted by Elvira. There is a scene where it was like KING KONG in reverse! In KING KONG he takes the girl and climbs the building, but in this movie he climbs down the building and grabs the girl (who fell)! Also around that year was another KONG clone MIGHTY PEKING MAN (1977) who came from Hong Kong. There are many travel food scenes and motorized body parts. This movie will let you laugh. It is, as I said, just another king king clone. Rated PG for violence, language, thematic elements and some scary scenes.
