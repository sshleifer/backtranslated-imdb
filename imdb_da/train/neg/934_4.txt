Macy, Ullman and Sutherland were as big as usual. Ritter wasn't bad either. What is her name as beautiful as usual. It could have been a good movie. Too bad the plot was terrible. It was completely predictable, tired and boring. From the first 15 minutes the rest of the movie was laid out as a child's paint with number routine. The signs were store pieces cut out cardboard. There was nothing new or interesting to say, and it was totally offset by the play, which was a pity. <br /> <br /> Finally, the author was not for the victim. Especially with the "precocious" lines from the child, which was absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> Again, only the play that prevented a much lower score.
