The first point that calls attention to "For Ever Mozart" is the lack of a summary in IMDb. The explanation is simple, as there is no story, script, plot or what may remember the minimal structure of a movie. Jean-Luc Godard is one of the most overrated and pretentious instructors in the cinema industry, and this effortless shit is among his most hermetic films. I think neither has understood what this story is about; But there are intellectuals who elucuber to justify or explain this rat movie and it's fun to read their reviews. <br /> <br /> My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Para Semper Mozart" ("Forever Mozart")
