Shecky, is a god damn legend, makes no mistake. Until recently, I was working for a UK HiFi & Video store chain that ran their testing department. We would go through many new starters, they would be expected to fail to find the various detritus that return as non-functional in some way from the stores. Now to torture the solution of these new employees, we would issue them with a copy of the Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this movie because when someone who bought a particular model of Goodman's DVD player who had this movie as a free gift came around to send back their DVD player, they never got to send Shecky back too. Our new employees would be forced to use only Going Overboard to test these machines for errors until they found a disk or two of them to test with. <br /> <br /> Now why this movie is so bad, where do I start? Adam Sandler, who can be so funny as in Happy Gilmore or Wedding Singer, must have had a hell of an off day. The rest of the crew smelled, and what about Billy Zane? His name goes into several of the worst movies from all the time, and he's a decent actor. Crazy. Production quality is absolutely zero. I would have tended to give this a zero if I could, because they didn't even find it difficult to name it with the full name 'The Unzinkable Shecky Moskowitz' on release. Still, it's worth seeing so you can see how far Sandler has come and how low he can go.
