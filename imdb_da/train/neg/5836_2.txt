From Richard Condon's pen (The Manchurian Candidate in 1962), this confused tale of political intrigue and murder comes. The story told in almost cartoon fashion is hard to swallow. All-star cast is considered, this bad bet is not entirely to the cast and crew: the short story was filled with the same short-comings. It seems that the story actually sometimes claims the more sincere effort in "Manchurian Candidate." A disappointment on all counts.
