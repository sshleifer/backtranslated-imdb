This was supposed to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I'm 64 years old and a football fan. I went expecting to see a football movie. About 10 minutes into it, I began to wonder how such a bad movie (especially the actor) could have gotten a theater. Ca. halfway, I whispered to my husband that it was terrible and he explained to me the facts behind the movie. Though I was a little offended (and can see how some could be very offended if they were not Christians) by being preached in a movie theater, it wasn't a big deal. However, it was a great thing to be exposed to such predictability and unrealistic behavior and above all the quality of the actor. It is a suitable movie for a church excursion, but to be shown in a church room and not in a theater. I go to church Yes. Will I go to church when I participate in a movie? No. Would I recommend this movie? Absolutely not!!!
