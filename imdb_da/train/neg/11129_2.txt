See the 1936 version. As a personal annoyance I find Charles Boyer's voice, he is more of a struggle to pay cosmopolitan, depressed Rudolf - I mean Omar Sharif tries, but none - too sweet and alive. Catherine Denueve (sp) besides being too old sees nothing like Marie - nothing! She looks too advanced to think of dying for love for this man in such a way. <br /> <br /> The only actor in the entire movie that conveys the role they play is Ava Gardner, whose appearance as Empress Elisabeth on the screen is briefly brief (and looking at the images of empress is more than a transient Equality) as historically, Empress Elisabeth was not involved so much in Rudolf's life.
