I really liked the ZB1. I really did. I have no problem with extremely low budget movies, and I've had movies with worse production values ​​than ZB3 (if you can imagine such a thing. Check out 'wiseguys vs zombies' if you are interested). In fact, I prefer lower budget zombie movies because I'm suspicious that Hollywood directors don't understand what zombies are 'about'. <br /> <br /> But ZB3 was just as bad. It was retarded. I do not want to be worthy of my criticism. I want my 90 minutes back, etc. Except that it really only took ~ 80 minutes because I participated in 1.4X fast forward. <br /> <br /> Okay, here's some criticism. <br /> 1. Pacing was horrible. Everyone spoke in monologues. Even when a person just had a single line, the camera and editing and insertion of a bunch of F bombs in each sentence worked the line FEEL as a monologue. First, I was excited about 90 minutes of driving time compared to ZB1's 70 minutes, but there were actually fewer "events" in ZB3. It all speaks. <br /> <br /> 2. The gore effects were stupid. Only glop is rubbed around on people's numbers. <br /> <br /> 3. Despite the epic exhibition, there really wasn't a plot. And the exhibition is actually epic! I won't spoil it if you want to see it. (Don't look at it.) But then it's just a bunch of lame characters walking around biting for ~ 80 minutes. or fewer if you choose it.
