Despite the sterile work of the supporting actors, and an intelligent script by Alan Plater, this movie suffers from a fatal error - the central character / actor's lack of charm. One of the characters describes Richard E Grant's character as "a sling little trip" and unfortunately he sums him perfectly. There is nothing about him or his achievements to make it credible that his boyfriend and upper class publisher / friend would spend so much time and emotional effort on him. He is rude, arrogant, selfish, self-destructive and thoroughly annoying. The party called for an actor who can make you love him, even when he's a talk - for example, Ewan McGregor. <br/> <br /> All the witty satire on the class system, etc. Wasted due to this annoying and thoroughly irreplaceable performance. All I wanted to do was shake him and tell him to come over himself.
