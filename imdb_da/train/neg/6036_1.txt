With an unknown casting that seems to remain that way, this "movie" is yet another cheap slasher-flick that surprises me how it was released. I have no problem with especially horror and slasher flicks, they are actually my favorites. But when they are finished THIS BAD, it really takes the monkey and it is no wonder that the genre has such a difficult time. The story is so clich√©d and without imagination as possible with a bunch of people in a cabin in the woods being cut and hacked by this zombie / ghost man. It is not the story that sucks the most, the terrible action and the dialouge, homemade directionality and a terrible soundtrack. Not to mention the ridiculous effects and some incredibly lazy movie performances - these morons are out in the clear daylight, but we have to believe it's night ?? What the hell was the director thinking about this step? What did he only have one day to film all this in? He was afraid of the dark? (Is fun to see a policeman walking around in clean daylight with a flashlight as if its tone white) <br /> <br /> I think the positive side for the actors is that they look like people working in the local supermarket looked in at least they could escape from this movie without ever being noticed. I'm sure one of the "teenagers" plays bingo down in the local pub - but she's 40-45. Anyway, good at a laugh, but just another waste of movie and time.
