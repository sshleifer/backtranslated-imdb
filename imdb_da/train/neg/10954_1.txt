If there was a 0 stars rating I would like to give it to this absolutely horrible pile of waste. The fact that the actual summary is just fine, and that if it had been done differently, could have been brilliant, only making it worse. The basic task of unlocking a group of people in an experiment chamber is fine, but WHERE IS THE EXPERIMENT? All I see is a bunch of relentless surfers and blondes chatting about music and culture, I don't know or want to know about ... The challenges are pathetic and stupid. The whole meaning of reality TV is to show REALITY. If you set a 'challenge', don't make them play with exaggerated props of food and stereotypical cultural elements in the 'Friday night game'. Make them a real challenge. And to 'earn' the prize money, that's fine if they actually earn it! These people are nuts. If they only wanted to make the show better, the real idea would be brilliant. But it won't happen!
