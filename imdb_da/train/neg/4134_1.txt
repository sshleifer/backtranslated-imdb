I must honestly say that I couldn't stop watching this movie from the second it started. Simply for how bad it was !!! It is like watching paint dry only much more confusing. I think you are sitting there just waiting for something to happen, in fact, preferably something that makes the whole movie sensible! At the end of the movie, I was actually wondering if there was any chance I might have missed the first hour explaining everything, or I might have accidentally gone under the film and missed the parts that glued the plot (if actually one) together! The most important thing that really confused me about this movie is almost at the end the maid (if there was a maid) was in some kind of alternative reality, I mean what the hell was going on at this time? Suddenly she woke up and was in a mental institute, chained to a bed that was the drug of doctors or something, so faster than it would have made me split my wrists, it returned and she was eaten out by some random vampires! It made no sodding sense! I am tempted to email decision makers and demand my time back, I think I wasted 2 hours in my life and looked at this nonsense! I'm a little interested in knowing if the filmmakers themselves actually knew what it was all about! just thought someone had edited all the bits that could have made it sensible, even though I think the movie would have been 4 hours long to make it happen! I sit with the other person who wrote the other review completely, I became the royal character with this movie of his title and that alone. I'm just so grateful, I didn't actually buy the movie, no matter how many times I saw it in the local pound shop. You would have thought it would have given me a clue that the movie was a complete pile of steaming film waste, but to be honest, I think Â£ 1 was too much money to spend on this movie !!!! What a sad big waste of time and a good razor blade, I mean, I want me to have it, it is less painful than watching this movie !!!!
