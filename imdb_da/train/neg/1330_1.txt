There is a reason why Jay Leno himself does not recognize this movie. It is consistently one of the worst movies all the time. The action is horrible, the manuscript lacks direction, and the director himself is not sure which way to take this film. "A friend movie", "an action / comedy", "mystery". Seems halfway through, he gives up and is right together for the trip. Jay Leno and Pat Morita are talented and dedicated artists. It's a shame that they wasted their time and gifts that made this mess in a movie. Jay Leno and Pat Morita prior to getting involved with this had spent years pounding their craft on Hollywood circuit. Sir. Morita had already been a star in itself, which worked steadily since the mid-1960s as the star of such cult TVs and movie classics as "Happy Days" and the stupid but gracious "Mr. T and Tina." And won the hearts of America with its roles in the powerful movie "Midway", "The Karate Kid" and a host of others. Mr. Leno can be seen on TV shows from the mid-70s. And was a top performer in America's comedy clubs. He can be seen in countless TV spots and in large films. It's a shame that they agreed to be seen with this nonsense.
