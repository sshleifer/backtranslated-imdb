Can anyone make good CGI movies beyond Pixar? I really mean animation looked outdated by 2006 standards and even by 1995 Toy Story standards. Or maybe they all spent their budget on Hugh Jackman. Regardless of their thinking, the story really sucked. <br /> <br /> Somehow, Hugh Jackman is a rat - a rat rinsed down on a toilet. Yes I know, seems stereotypical. But then the sewer was imitated in London - to some extent. Throw in a promise of jewels (????) and an evil (?) Seed and you get a pathetic attempt at entertainment. <br /> <br /> I want to say something entertained me. Maybe the connection in the movie? Or maybe the happily-ever-after rat relationship. But nothing did. It had the talent, but it sprang up. D
