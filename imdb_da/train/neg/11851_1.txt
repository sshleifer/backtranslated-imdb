This was a disappointment - none of the nuance of the original. The British just seem to be able to make a truly disturbing movie with none of the overall histrionics of the American version. The original series combined both creepy stories and subtlety with performance with great attention to lighting and settings. I've seen the series many times and are still excited. <br /> <br /> Just another bad fit with the terrible adaptation of "Cracker". Get yourself connected with BBC America or BBC Canada and look at such joys as Waking the Dead, Spooks, Silent Witness and Judge John Deed. See the original Touching Evil, look for "Wire in the Blood" for more of Robson Green's undervalued, elegant performance. Hollywood to watch this actor!
