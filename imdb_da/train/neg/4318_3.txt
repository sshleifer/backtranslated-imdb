I thought this was one of the most depressing holiday movies I've ever seen - the others are THE Christmas WIFE and JACK FROST. All three films are about death. If you like to be deeply depressed then watch this movie or any of the others at all. In this movie, the play is good and some of the landscape (apart when people die) is lovely. But I'm worried that a clinically depressed person may accidentally see the movie and make himself into it! Despite a "happy ever" end, most of this movie is a terrible disaster after another. And for some crazy reason I won't be pressured when I see a Christmas movie (I know this sounds crazy people - don't hesitate to look out and feel miserable, what the holidays are all about?). <br /> <br /> For a more uplifting experience, try the forgotten house without a Christmas tree, George C. Scott's Christmas CAROL or a Christmas story instead - unless of course you seem to be miserable.
