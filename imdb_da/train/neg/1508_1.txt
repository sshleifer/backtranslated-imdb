I watched this movie last night (about 102 minutes) and don't know what kept me in my seat. I suppose I just expected a movie with Gere would have some value in it eventually, but nothing of value ever came on display. The story is a silly excuse to pile on shots after shots on slavery and torture. There is no sign in the movie that does anything like real life. The cut "style" relies on cuts, mini flashbacks and overprinting to emphasize this vapid setup of a gang of sadists who seem to be free for years, and surprisingly the leader is the "victim" of a executed killer. I can't see how Gere, a Buddhist, got involved in this violent, sexist garbage can.
