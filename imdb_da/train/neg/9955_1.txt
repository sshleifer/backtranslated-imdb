The whole thing is very beautiful to look at. The European placement shoot was a good idea. The main players are attractive. The result is serviceable. <br /> <br /> BUT THE SPOKE! And the non-plot developed! And it was all the way down from there. Pacino's sleep and Keller keeps talking about how boring she is. Hi, dear, you are not alone. When making a Mae West imitation, you may have to hide your face, it is painful to see. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine how either actor or director Sydney Pollack got involved in this or a better question, why did it end up stinking so badly? <br /> <br /> As death is represented in almost every scene in some way, you may have little pleasure here. Maybe it should feel like empty and cold as death. But I still can't recommend it.
