I read that "There is a girl in my soup" came out during Peter Sellers low period. Watching movies, I'm not surprised. Almost nothing happens in the film. Apparently, the actual seller's and Goldie Hawn's presence should help the movie; It doesn't. The whole movie seems like they just randomly filmed what happened without scripts. Perhaps I haven't seen any films about middle-aged people older people trying to be hippies, but this one gives a really bad name to such movies. <br /> <br /> All in all, both sellers and hawn games have much better movies than this, so don't waste your time on this. Pretty worthless.
