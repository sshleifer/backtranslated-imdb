I just read a review that defended this movie because it had a low budget, now I take things. <br /> <br /> The CGI samples were reasonably well animated, but were implemented in the worst possible manner. The fighting scenes were not even fighting, it was just a shot of an actor and then a shot of monster with much interaction at all. When the monster interacted, it looked like it was done in the paintshop pro. In my opinion, if you have a low budget, use models and dolls. They may not look like fancy, but at least they interact, just look at Peter Jackson's early films. <br /> <br /> With regard to the actress Beowulf did a descent job, but the rest of the casting didn't try or they forgot where they were. <br /> <br /> The scripture seemed to me confused. One minute they would talk as if it were a modern setting next, you get drama club Shakespeare speech. I'm not saying that it should be all 'ye' and 'that it' is, but you need to find a coherent balance so the lines sound like they come from the same person. <br /> <br /> I saw a lot near the start when Beowulf quoted the Old Testament, which would have been found if he hadn't spent the rest of the movies talking about the gods and the porters. In short, this movie is a very little polished turd, but a trip nonetheless.
