This movie was horrible. <br /> <br /> They didn't develop any of the characters at all, and the story was terribly played. It was a particular sleeper. You expect the action scenes on a movie like this to be its strong points, but D-Wars will surprise you with another disappointment in that section. <br /> <br /> Also, the play was just a step above the level of a low budget porn flick. And I mean it seriously. <br /> <br /> I was actually happy to see the final credits on this one because it was just so bad !!! Whatever you do, don't waste your time and money on a crappy movie like D-Wars.
