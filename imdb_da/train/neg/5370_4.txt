Raw zone is a horrible movie! It's so simple. It seems they were trying to make a movie to show the wheel. Like Zappa did many years ago. But unfortunately, Denmark lacks good young players. Leon is by many still the little girl in the "Christmas of the Crumbs", and Laura is simply not good enough to play such an important role. Several times in the movie she plays with soul and it destroys the movie! <br /> <br /> Although I consider it a movie you should see. I do not agree that youth behave like this, but I think it can show how it can end if you drop your child down. It is also important to support Danish films and new companies like "The Film People"! <br /> <br /> All in all, I think people should see Raw Zone. Not because it's a good movie, but because it's a movie that deals with important topics. I also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it, and in fact, in these scenes, Laura works best. - As the end, where she holds the gun!
