No, it's not about this adventure with the pumpkin's trainer, fairy godmother, and glass glitter, but if I had to work out, I'd have to destroy it for you, which I don't want. But don't let curiosity get better for you, as this movie is not great. It is one of the films that start promising before betraying its audience with inexpensive scare tactics and an incoherent story. And it's really scary. Yoon-hee (To Ji-Won) and Hyun-soo (Shin Se-kyeong) are your ideal mother and daughter. One is a successful plastic surgeon, while the other is your dutiful, obedient and beautiful teenage daughter. Their relationship is like hand in glove, so close you would think of them more like siblings rather than parent-child. But it starts to go wrong when Hyun-like friends like Yoon-hee have started to fire. It is perhaps a warning to the public and to those Koreans ladies who do not hit an eyelid when they go under the knife whose news reports are to be believed. The only really scary moments are those scenes in plastic surgery, but somehow I thought Kim Ki-duk's Time actually did more when presenting and describing what was going on during the surgery itself. <br /> <br /> It's a two-half story, the coward is an attempt to shock the audience with standard scare tactics that I admit came to me every now and then. The other half degenerated the film into thoughtless mumbo-jumbo melodramatic, and became quite familiar with forcing his ideas into the throat. Some things don't begin to make sense, and while experiments are always presented to explain, you probably won't buy it, not that horror movies are logical to begin with. <br /> <br /> The wires are all beautiful, and there is a clear lack of male presence beyond the insignificant coprol. But hey, I don't complain, though the story could have been greatly improved. I would recommend seeing this, only if you are a fan of mediocre Korean horror, on VCD. Beware that you are out for moments!
