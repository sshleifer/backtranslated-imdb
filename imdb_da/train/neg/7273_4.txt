This early role of Barbara Shelley (actually her first in the UK after working in Italy) was made when she was 24 years old and it is certainly safe to say that she made a fantastic debut in the 1957 "Cat Girl". While blondes and brunettes get most of the attention (I always want to cherish Yutte Stensgaard), the lovely shorthaired actress with the deep voice always exudes intelligence as well as vulnerability (such an example is the "Village of the Damned" in the 1960s as her screen time was much smaller than her character's husband, George Sanders). She is the only reason to see this killing update of "Cat People" and is greatly benefited throughout (it's hard to say whether her beauty found a smoothly better showcase). is exposed to her deliciously bare back when awakened (also postponed 8 years later in 1965's "Rasputin-The Mad Monk"). The indulgent dress she wears during most of the movie is a fantastic strapless wonder (I can't see what kept it dressed up, but I would certainly like that). All in all, it is positive that Barbara Shelley, in a poorly-written role that would defeat most actresses, rises over her material and makes the film consistently aware of a true test of stellar power that she would soon find at Hammers studios in Bray in 1960.
