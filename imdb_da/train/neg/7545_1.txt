It's unfortunate that you can't go under a star. Before I saw The Wicker Man, I had considered Aliens 3 to be the only movie that would actually deserve negative stars. In all fairness, The Wicker Man does not detract from the enjoyment of a previous movie, but the fact is that my cumulative movie experience has been reduced by seeing it. <br /> <br /> There is also a cheap trick often used in Hollywood when producers are too cunning to hire good writers or too much speed to allow them to bring a plot to a satisfactory conclusion: Relax in a shocking end and hope that the public will confuse it with something artistic or meaningful. It is a gambit that rarely succeeds and in this case only manages to embarrass a fine actor and ridicule the producers. Even more so, that it "carefully crafted" (or rather they set it) did not seem to follow logically from the plot (which of course I cannot deepen without introducing spoilers) and instead rejecting what profit the plot had until then. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that can logically appeal to psychopaths, pedophiles, and possibly dying Nicholas Cage fans, but only to a few of the general public. If you really want something in this direction, I would heartily recommend M. Night Shyamalans Village instead. Missing a form of memory-wiping pill, I suppose I should see something better to force it from my mind, says Attack of the Killer Tomatoes or Pee-Wee's Big Adventure?
