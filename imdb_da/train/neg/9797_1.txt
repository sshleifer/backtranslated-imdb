Today it tends to look at all the shows from the early 90s as classics (people are so easily blinded by nostalgia these days) and while some of these shows were undoubtedly good, it's just plain clean crap. I saw this show a lot back in those days when it got a lot of reruns on the TV side, and even as a kid I didn't like it. Even an 8-year-old can see how much people in the Power Rangers are taking over and how much special-FX even then sucked. When the show does not indicate the painfully bad combat situations, it plagues the viewer with this unnecessary soap opera about a group of teenagers, and they have little social problems every now and then. I don't know about you, but I didn't give a rat ass about any of it at all, and it fills up essentially until they have to "fight" some guy again in a very clich√© alien costume with fireworks or some toy robot. You never feel "involved" in any way with this show, and the fact that most of the actors act like there really has no interest in addition to their wallet only enhances the lack of feeling. <br /> <br /> There is really nothing memorable about this show and it is quite surprising that it has so many spin-offs (Beetleborgs is a good example). All it is is just a quick way to make some money. I challenge any "fan" to tell me what exactly stands out in episodes that must be so good because I couldn't find something that is even a little appealing to children. My guess is that most "fans" of the Power Rangers will tell me that I "just don't understand it" anyway or something like that. I don't care about it; It was bad since then, and it's still crap now.
