When I loved the Inspector Gadget cartoon in the 80s, I went to watch this movie. I wasted my money. The reason was very thin. Also the movie couldn't keep me interested for a long time. I was glad it was over. <br /> <br /> To see the Gadget Inspector, see the comic strip instead. It was much better than the movie.
