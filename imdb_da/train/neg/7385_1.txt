The movie is boring, the characters and scenarios are unrealistic, incredible, the action is fun. This movie is a big mess. It almost seems like the action music kicks in, the most impressive stunt runs. Either voice is dubbed with Mr. McGregor or Steven sang too much and it changed his voice. There is too much dialogue in this movie, and extremely bad acting on everyone's behalf. The movie is good sleep therapy. The fighting is ridiculous. Eye shape shift effect on the evil designer drug addicts women was decent. The biggest villain was a joke, and his character was poorly developed. The biggest villain was used to explain the story through interrogation, he would just throw random plots like (spoiler) "CTX (his designer drug) is going to be in the water supply" which is never dealt with in the conclusion or even mentioned again in the movie. This movie is highly recommended to pass.
