I hope the one who coached these losers on their accents was fired. The only high points are some of the supporting characters, 3 of 5 of my favorites were killed at the end of the season (and one of them was a cat, to put it in perspective). <br /> <br /> The whole storyline is centered around sex, and nothing else. Sex with vampires, gay with gay vampires, gay men with vampires, sex to score vampire blood, sex after drinking vampire blood, sex in front of vampires, vampire, non-vampire, sex because we're afraid of vampires. , sex because we are angry with vampires, sex because we just became vampire etc. Nothing against sex, it would just be good if it was a little more subtle about being whipped into history. Maybe a story and so shoehorn has a gender in it. But they didn't even interfere with doing so ... and Anna Paquin is a staggering dental shirt. Either she sucks or her character sucks, I can't figure out which one. Another part of the story that I find very unlikely is why 150 year old vampire Bill who seems to have his stuff together would be interested in someone like Sookie. She constantly flies out of his handle for things he can't control. He leaves for two days, and she already decides that he "doesn't come back" and suddenly has feelings for a dog man? Give me a break. She was supposed to be a 25 year old woman, not a 14 year old girl. People close to her die all the time, and she has the most beautiful smile on her face because she just gave her V-card to a man because she can't read her mind? As the protagonist of the story, I would have hoped the show would do a little more to make her understandable and someone to invest your interest in, not someone you keep secret, hoping to be knocked out or put in a coma. I can't find anything about her character that I like, and even the fact that she can read mind is impressively uninspiring and not least interesting. <br /> <br /> I won't waste my time watching Season 2 come June.
