I was looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for a while ... what about all the raving reviews, nominations, and media attention. And I must say that the movie's first quarter was good! It really portrayed the black music scene then. But when the film went on, I and my whole family were bored of our wits. The song continued to come, one after another. I mean seriously, just a new song, and it would have inked even with RENT. <br /> <br /> I also hardly noticed any sign development in any of the characters; I just didn't care what happened to them! Even when Eddie Murphy's character died of drug overdose, I knew I should have been sad, but I just couldn't feel any sense of that character. The characters got a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and what not, but there weren't enough personalities to attract me. <br /> <br /> Finally, the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care along with the lack of character development. This movie reminded me of a copy-cat movie based on Ray, Chicago and Rent (Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion). All in all, I think this movie best suits a person who doesn't really care about an overall story, but will still enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing.
