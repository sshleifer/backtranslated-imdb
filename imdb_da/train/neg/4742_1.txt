Wow. This was probably the worst DCOM ever. I saw the first half hour and I laughed. Brenda Song plays Wendy, the popular girl with hot jock boyfriend and stuck friends who are determined to be Homecoming Queen. She must save the world as a warrior, and Shin comes to her to help her with her martial arts. Shin teaches her a snake, tiger, etc., and she must learn certain techniques to save the world. <br /> <br /> This movie is great for kids who want to learn about martial arts and Chinese culture but acting and casting were terrible. Brenda Song is a comic actress, and I can't see her playing a serious role. Seeing her cry over Shin was laughing fun. Shin could not work at all and everything was incredible. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie and tried to think of something similar and what I came with was Power Rangers. This movie is so fake, and the stunts were so Power Ranger-esquire that it was just corny and stupid. The signs were not pleasant, and I just couldn't stand to see it. Disney really needs to take time to make some decent movies. High School Musical is the only movie that deserves to be on the Disney Channel along with other films such as Jumping Ship, Friendship Friendship, Go Figure, Read It and Weep, and stuck in the suburbs. <br /> <br /> If you like action adventure and corny jokes, you like this movie.
