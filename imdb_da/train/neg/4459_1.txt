I do not say that because the production values ​​were so low, but because it was filmed terribly. The shot of the girl washes her hair in the pelvis? Should we really sit there for a long shot and see her do it for 5 minutes in the same place? It was terrible, the lighting was simply poor. You could hardly see anything, and when the characters spoke, you could hardly hear what they were saying. Did I see the whole movie? Of course, I didn't glow through most of it, and I don't want to hear anyone say I have to see the whole thing first to judge it. This movie was so poorly executed and executed that even by independent and low budget standards, it's just awful. Terrible movie ... don't play anything on it unless you want a good laugh, but even then it's not because of the actors' "funny" lines, it's because of how much bad the production is.
