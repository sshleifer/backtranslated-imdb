Nathan Detroit runs illegal craps games for high rollers in NYC, but the heat is on and he can't find a safe location. He asks chronic gambler Sky Masterson that Sky cannot make a prime missionary, Sarah Brown, go to dinner with him. Sky takes up the challenge, but both men have some surprises in the store. <br /> <br /> This is one of the expensive fifties MGM musicals in splashy color, with big sets, loud music, greater role than roles and performances to match Broadway photographed for the big screen if you like it kind of things that i don't do. My main problem with this type of movie is simply the music. I like all kinds of music, from Albinoni to ZZ Top, but Broadway shows tunes in turn with an infinite pah-pah-tah-dah trumpet bloom at the end of every fourth bar is not my cup of tea. This was written by the roof layer of Frank Loesser, Mankiewicz, Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows (based on a couple of Damon Runyon stories), and while the plot is quite gracious, the songs are weak. For example, Blaine's two numbers are identical, unnecessary, do not push the plot and the grille on the ears (and are also flagrantly misogynistic if that kind of thing bothers you). There are only two memorable tunes, Luck Be A Lady (song by Brando, not Sinatra as you might expect) and sit down, You're Rockin 'The Boat (nicely done by Kaye), but you have to sit for two hours to get to them. The film's trump card is a young Brando that gives a thought-provoking, laid-back performance; he also sings well and even dances a bit and matches evenly with the always interesting Simmons. The sequence in which the two fly to Havana for the night is a welcome respite from all the noise, bustle and vocal scheme of Noo Yawk. Fans of musicals can dig this, but in my opinion a musical has to do more than just film the stage show.
