I'm a huge Randolph Scott fan, but this movie is a dud. The whole thing has a can, false sound stand, with a really horrible rear projection. It has a good idea that the scriptwriter is buried successfully in a nitwit script, making it impossible for the audience to be immersed in the action and really worry about any of the characters. The director is pedestrian and only highlights how bad the script is instead of helping to improve it. I've seen lots of thoroughly enjoyable soundstage productions before, but it's not one of them. All that does is that you appreciate the wet Scott / Boetticher movies more. Randolph Scott is tanned, trimming and shining the million dollar smile throughout. He is always a pleasure ... even in the worst of his film. Apart from Scott, the other main reason I wanted to watch this movie was because of how much I enjoyed Ms. Wymore in Errol Flyn's "Rocky Mountian" movie. In "Man Behind the Gun" she is just as beautiful and you can tell that she is a good actress, but she was forced to say some pretty stupid lines, and the blockage she got from the director was really awful. I only watched Phil Carey in "Operation Pacific" and he plays the exact same character here ... an arrogant pain-in-the-butt you want to turn into unconsciousness. I think he turns out to be a good actor ... he made me hate him. There are some lame attempts at comic relief that only detracts from the movie, in my opinion. Although there are many elements to knock on, I have to say that I really enjoyed enjoying the two Spanish songs that were sung in the musical song ... but that's not why we're going to watch Randolph Scott movies , right? <br /> <br /> There are definitely worse Scott movies out there, and that is certainly not unbearable, but neither can it be considered mediocre.
