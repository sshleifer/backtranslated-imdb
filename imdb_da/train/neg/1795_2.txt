I had the opportunity to preview this movie as a member of a test audience, and the only thing that kept me in my seat was the chance to fill out the overhaul. I felt the movie's biggest problem was the lack of a main character. Instead, it was composed of (also) many subplots that compete for screen time. As a result, there is not a single character that has been developed enough for the audience to form any kind of connection. What the director and producer failed to do was show us why we should take care of what happens to the characters. In fact, a single part plot and the characters associated with it could have been completely removed without serious damage to the movie. (The time taken would have allowed for the much needed development of the remaining subplots and signs.) Simply, the Hungry Bachelors Clubs plate is crowded with side dishes and appetizers when an entre is desired.
