I saw the mask in the 80's and it is currently appearing at Fox Kids in the UK (very late at night). I remember thinking that it was a little cold back in the day and also had a few toys, but seeing it now drills me to tears. I have never realized before how boring and bland this cartoon show really was. It's just awful! It is not as close in the same league as The Transformers, He-Man or Thundercats and was very quickly forgotten by almost everyone when it was stopped being made. I only look at Fox Kids because Ulysses 31 comes right after it (that's if the mask doesn't put me to bed first). One of the smaller 80's cartoons, which I hope to completely forget when it's finished flying on Fox Kids!
