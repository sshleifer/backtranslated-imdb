How low can anyone sink while trying to regain an old glory? ST: HF will be happy to show you. <br /> <br /> If you are used to seeing what is made for a good Star Trek show, DO NOT see this. <br /> <br /> The script is hodge-podge, the actors' portrayals of their characters weak, and most of all, the design work is actually doggy. <br /> <br /> Like looking at big captains, don't look here! Like the strong federation state? Forget it here! Starfleet is mocked by ensigns wearing SPIKES in their hair. <br /> <br /> While a seemingly mentally weak captain interferes and within two minutes of the opening show's credits, Ensign Spikey tries to arrange a tryst at an engineer. It just breaks down from there. No, not one's uniforms match for the sake of goodness. They are too small or too large, collar down to their coffins, and TNG Seasons One and Two Uniforms blended in with Season 3 and DS9 uniforms. The strict discipline and tradition of any of the originals lacks in this production down to the steps! The only good thing about this show is its graphics, which seem to improve slightly with each season. OK, I'll take it back. Who uses CG the inexperienced? The designers of this show. <br /> <br /> Don't bother with it, it will offend your Star Trek sense as it did mine. Not even thrown back to previous shows can save this disaster. <br /> <br /> I cried openly when I saw this, probably because my eyes softened and the head almost broke up. So bad.
