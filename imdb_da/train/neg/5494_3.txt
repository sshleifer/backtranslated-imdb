<br /> <br /> Cheap and ugly, this movie didn't even entertain the kids in the audience, except for a rather entertaining toilet joke. Christopher Lloyd is way past his prime and actually quite tiring in this role, though the excuse for jokes from the authors does not help. Elizabeth Hurley is embarrassingly amateurish in a presumably comic role. Jeff Daniels and Darryl Hannah avoid humiliation. There is really no reason to make this movie, especially because it is inevitable that you will compare it with Robin Williams often amazing improvisations in Mork & Mindy. <br /> <br />
