Polyester was the first John Waters movie I saw, and I have to say it was also the "worst" movie I had ever seen up to that time. Water's group of "talent" included several people whom I certainly worked for food, and was willing to say the lines Waters wrote. Everything about the movie is horrible, acting, camera, editing, and the story of a woman played by 300 lb transvestite Divine was purely absurd. <br /> <br /> That being said, I have to recommend this movie because it is very fun and you will not believe in the bush that happens to poor Francine. Her son fixes solutions and stomps unsuspecting women's feet in the grocery store. Her daughter is the dumbest blunt in town. Her husband is an embroidery of a pornographer who does everything to confuse and humble poor Francine. Francine's only friend is played by Edith Massey, possibly the worst actress ever. Edith looks and sounds like she is reading the lines from a cue card and has never seen the script before the movie. <br /> <br /> Despite all Francines travails, Waters boasts a fabulous Hollywood end and everyone (who survives) lives happily ever after.
