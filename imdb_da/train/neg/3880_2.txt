I can see a good movie from time to time. I've seen some pretty sick things. However, this is one of the few films that I thought to be grotesque in a way that was just disgusting and disgusting. I like gore movies when they are funny. I like wen they have a lot of creativity behind them. Gore in this movie is not creative. It's sick. It's contradictory. It's totally uncomfortable. Because of this, this film is certainly not entertaining. The movie is a horror movie, but it lacks scare. So pretty much, the only reason you would like to watch the movie is too good, but it is the most unpleasant and ugly aspect of the whole movie, and it says a lot. The action is horrible, the plot makes no sense and the music is really annoying and way of electronic sound. It took me straight out of the movie. Almost the whole movie is a great, long depressed trial. There is this guy who has a freak accident in a shuttle and wakes up in a hospital to find out that his skin dissolves and melts out. I suppose after that he goes out and eats human flesh to slow down the melting process. There is some weird subplot that involves an old couple being chased by a dog, some crooked head floating down a stream and ending with a man electrolysed. There were times when I tried really hard to enjoy it, but the only scene in the whole movie that I thought was even entertaining was the scene early when a nurse crashed into a hospital corridor in slow motion. If you like ugly, unpleasant, scary horror movies, this is for you.
