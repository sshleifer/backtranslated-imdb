Four Eyed Monsters follow the relationship between a shy, reclusive videographer and a straight-line fighting artist, both living in the Big Apple, developing an unlikely romance using an internet dating site. This in itself is not so unusual, but what is, is their method of communication. The film is based on the creators' (Arin Crumley & Susan Buice) own relationship, which in addition to writing and steering take to act as the main characters. With elements of avant-garde, anti-plot and docudrama, the film spreads to the wind with an indefinite structure nested precisely between narcissism and complacency. <br /> <br /> As the film carries on, a brief separation and deterioration of their once exciting form of communication gets old when the couple faces reality. Focusing solely on internal conflict, or because of the relationship, the film fights through a stagnant narrative that is neither original nor sharp. This could have been easily bypassed with the addition of subplot and external conflict, and a third act that no one found - just a mounting of the melodrama that leads nowhere. What is even more aggravating is the film's descent from history to reality, which suddenly ends with an open and unsatisfactory finish. This would have been fine and dandy, but there is no doubt and no sense to be discovered or contemplated. <br /> <br /> (On a side note, the movie features a beautiful animation and a vibrant and moving soundtrack, one of the more interesting aspects of production.) <br /> <br /> But as always, watch the movie and decide for yourself.
