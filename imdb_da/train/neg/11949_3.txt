This stupid comedy really does a good job of wasting comedic talent. Especially Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are badly abused here. I could have chuckled once or twice during this movie, but generally it is a dull movie, with a bit of stupidity cast on a good scale. The pastor, though routine, was still not bad, but when the plot was set, the film went nowhere. Don't waste your time with this misfire.
