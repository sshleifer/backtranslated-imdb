As the number of Video Nasties I have not yet seen, this little pile of garbage wastes on my "for rent" list when I saw it was available. The principle involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken in the jungle to be ransomed by a modley crew member of idiots. Some other goofs are hired to bring her back and get a banknote to use as a negotiating chip, but if he returns with the girl and all the money, he gets a significant reduction. He has brought a helicopter and pilot with him, and wow, the pilot is one of the worst actors ever! Granted, they are all horrible, and the duplication will make you cry blood. After stealing away in the jungle, we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating terrestrial god walks the forest as a human King Kong seeks tribes to ravage and devour. Now this guy is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever, ping-pong balls for eyes, and that's pretty much it. His ditch and groans are an everpresent element on the soundtrack, and I found myself mumbling many of these scenes. Oh, did I forget to mention the almost constant nudity? It's probably the main reason why this movie was banned, even though there is a certain scene, about a second long, when God attacks a girl and pulls out her gut, but it's not a redeeming factor for gore fans. Also, Jess Franco goes beyond the usual T and A and shows long close-ups of female genitals, and unfortunately also male. So if you want "fair" in terms of exploitation, you have it. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this garbage to anyone. It's not even the good bad movie. It's just terribly padded waste that only a Video Nasty fan will likely see, and even then, if you make your way through the list, leave it to the end. If you see it first, you can get the idea that this is the norm for the list, which is certainly not true.
