Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnnnnn! : = 8O <br /> <br /> ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ........... <= 8. Oh, excuse me, sorry, fell asleep there for a mighty one. Now where was I? Oh yes, "The Projected Man", yes ... ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ........... <= 8. <br /> <br /> Oops, sorry. Yes, "The projected man". Well, it's a British sci-fi yawn party about nothing. Some orange-haired lighthouses project themselves on a laser, get hold of death. Finally he disappears, the end. In fact, the film isn't even that interesting. Boring, droning, starchy, stiff and repulsive boring, "The Projected Man" is 77 fixed minutes of nothing, starring none. Dull as dishwashing liquid. Dull as doorknob dust. Boring like Ethan Hawke - we're really talking DULL here, people! But wait for our stupid cousins ​​from across the pillow, MooCow will now make a proper review of "The Projected Man": ZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ............ <= 8.
