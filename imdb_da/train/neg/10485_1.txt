Dark comic serendipity about a cosmetics saleswoman, with odd ties to Elvis Presley, running into a sea of ​​Elvis impersonators while talking on conventions in Nevada ... and accidentally killing each of them through a small mistake. Kim Basinger, an increasingly attractive actress with great profits, likes to choose nice movies to record, but this terrible manuscript (by Mitchell Ganem and Adam-Michael Garber) doesn't have a good sense of humor. The stereotypes and low-ball gags are not meant to be of classical comedy, but even at a shambling, shameful level, the image is raw and sloppy. If you see, see if you can count how many alien shots there are of Basinger behind the edge of her pink Cadillac, her hands always in the same position and a non-plus look on her face. Hopefully both she and Elvis were well paid. No stars from ****
