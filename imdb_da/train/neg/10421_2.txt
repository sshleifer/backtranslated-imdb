I watched this movie as a very young girl (I'm 27 now) and it scared me faintly for years. I had nightmares on all aspects of this movie from the way it was drawn to the music of (of course) the violence. My parents are still talking about who allowed me to see it, and both say they would never let me see such a movie. I think they only say to know that I have such strong feelings about it; 0) I am currently reading the book (out of morbid curiosity and the fact that it is a classic) and it is truly a fantastic story. But I don't think it should have been done for a cartoon. Ever. Well, maybe kids today will find it quaint, but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks, and I still find it hard to see rabbits drawn in the same way. Gives me a little heartbeat every time. Yah I am a wuss, but I strongly recommend that any parent seek to show this movie to their children, read them instead or see it first to make sure they approve the content. Not everyone finds it disturbing as I did, but we are out there; 0)
