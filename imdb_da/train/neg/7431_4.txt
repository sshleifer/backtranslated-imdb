CARRY ON MATRON was released in 1972, and it becomes clear that the series has reached a natural end with the best entries such as CLEO, UP THE KYBER and SCREAMING from the mid to late 60s. In itself, MATRON is by no means bad it is just that we have seen it all before with a thin plot (A bunch of spirits trying to break into a hospital to steal a supply of contraceptive pills they plan to sell to third country countries) surrounded by gags of a somewhat entertaining though unsophisticated nature. I think that's where the problem lies - Gags aren't all that fun with the unsophisticated nature that begins to show its age. Should we need another movie that uses a man dressed up as a woman to run the plot? Perhaps the worst criticism I can make is that I saw in the afternoon, as little as twelve hours ago, and I have a problem trying to remember a very fun line. It's a serious problem for a comedy
