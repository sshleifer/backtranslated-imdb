This was an impulse gathering for me from the local video store. Don't make the same mistake I made. This movie is boring, convincingly acted and generally boring. The dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is extremely poorly written and delivered; I cringed on every scene they shared. Dennis Hopper does a few sparse looks and is his usual inconsistent self; His role was obviously not a stretch for him. And while the movie is supposedly set in Puerto Rico, it feels much more like a Hollywood movie party; All the protagonists are Caucasian and more tend to speak English with pseudo-Irish accents. Odd. Anyway, when you see this on the shelf of your local video store, continue to walk.
