Okay friends, a serious movie buff is expected to see all sorts of movies, the bad as well as the good, and this movie put me to the test. I don't want to cut words. This movie was bad. The story was bad. The action was poor. The always wonderful Sissy Spacek did nothing to make this movie better. In fact, I asked myself why did I even find it hard to see this rat sweet movie? Why did I waste my time and money on something I thought would be bad? The answer is, of course, that I am a movie film and therefore cannot avoid what would otherwise be avoided. I will not waste your time explaining what was wrong with this amateur movie, except to say that the quality of the play was to say it politely, sub-pair. A serious movie buffer might take responsibility for watching this movie. Or else. Stay home, do not waste your time, read a book, grab a chore or get yourself a good sandwich.
