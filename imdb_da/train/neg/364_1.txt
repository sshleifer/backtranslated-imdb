Larry Buchanan. Yep, the same guy who did "Attack of THE Eye Eye" and two (count them: TWO) conspiracy film about Marilyn Monroe. He must blame here. <br /> <br /> He adds his ever-growing pile of folders back from Oliver Stein's "Conservatory Disappointment", which is "Down On Us" ie. "Beyond the Doors"), which is the work definition for historical inaccuracy. Forget what you thought you knew about Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison, says Big Lar ', cuz this is Yes, the three big names in the 60's rock were killed by the government because they were subversive or counterproductive to truth, justice and the American way or as such. I knew it all at least, three people (Chatman, Meryl, Wolf) who look frankly like their real life shadows (that is, if you close your eyes completely, turn your back and walk five miles away from them) shows that in instead of their recorded death, the good old US of A knocks them out! Yes, that's the truth! Man, I can't believe I saw this movie. These are facts when non-corrosive credibility to snapping points is ridiculous; The play that makes TV commercials looks like a loud drama, and if you honestly see it through to the end, you deserve the "twist" episode. You really, really do it; I swear. Genius. <br /> <br /> But like the man said, "Rock and roll is dead - long live rock and roll." <br /> <br /> Not this flick, though. <br /> <br /> No stars for "Down on Us". And it's the movie's audience that describes the movie, by the way ...
