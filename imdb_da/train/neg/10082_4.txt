I laughed all the way through this rat movie. It's so incredible. A woman leaves her husband after years of marriage, has a collapse in front of a property's office. What's going on? The office manager comes outside and offers her a job !!! Hysterically fun! Next thing you know, the two women are doing it. Yes, they are lesbians! Nothing is right in this "Women's lifetime with something better to do" movie. Clunky dialogue like "I don't want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I had a chance to be happy and not take it" doesn't help. There is a wealthy, distant mother who rejects her daughter's new relationship. A sassy black girl - unbelievable that in the year 2003 a movie is made where there is a cute black girl. Hattie McDaniel will turn in his grave. The woman has a man who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage children. Sheesh! No clich√© remains unchanged.
