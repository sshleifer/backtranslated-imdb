There is not much to say about this. Gammera is a kind of fire-breathing turtle. He is solved by a nuclear explosion. He leads to shore and begins to destroy building and thought and other junk (oh yes, power lines. I almost forgot). At some point, early in the film, he is friendly with a little boy, and instead of just throwing him away or squashing him, he places him on the ground. Safe. From then on, we have to look at this shabby, little check and run away, popping up and running away, popping up and running away. For some reason, Gammera can hear this child from 20,000 feet away. Oh, it's good to try to get Gammera to a place where he can be boarded on a rocket and shot into the room. As usual, the monster is timber and uncoordinated (a guy in a Gammera suit). The Japanese army (with the help of the Americans) uses up enough ammunition and firepower to solve the government debt, and of course it does not do well. They should know it anyway. We have seen many monsters stomp in Tokyo. Not putting them down because they can be fun, but it's really not that good.
