One of the many vigilante epics that flooded the market in the mid-80s. The routine plot has echoes of "The Magnificent Seven" (believe it or not), the action scenes are dealt with long and the special effects are non-existent. You can do worse .... but the movie is still just a waste of time. (* 1/2)
