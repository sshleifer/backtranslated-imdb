Although I haven't yet reviewed the movie in two years, I remember exactly what made my mind as low as it did. Having loved the original little mermaid, and having been obsessed with mermaids as a child, I decided to take the time to sit and watch the sequel. <br /> <br /> Disney, I have a little message for you. If you don't have the original director and actors handy ... you're just looking to get your shame that was running. <br /> <br /> In the sequel, our story begins with a slightly older Ariel and her daughter, Melody. My first major problem was that Eric and the rest of the crew sang. Yes, I understand that Disney is big on sing-and-dance songs, but that was what made Eric my favorite prince. He was calm, collected, and a genuine gentleman who knew how to have fun. And he did it. DOES NOT. SING. <br /> <br /> Then there's the villain. Oh, how could we forget the tremors that drove into our spine when Ursula slipped on the screen and scared both Ariel and the audience around the world? Unfortunately, that gene was not passed on to its seemingly useless sister, Morgana. Nothing was ever ever said about Morgana in the first movie; She just comes out of nowhere, trying to steal the baby. Oh how sweet. The younger sister is crossed off and instead of going after the trident, he decides to kidnap a month-old baby. Gag me. <br /> <br /> Apart from being a flat character without her origin, Morgana was just a lot of unorthodox. The same plane as her sister, the same minions (who didn't scare anyone any more. I had a three year old at my lap when I saw this movie and she laughed hysterically.) She had no purpose to be in there; I would like to see that mother is the villain. I'm sure she would have done a better job than Little Miss Tish over there. <br /> <br /> King Triton had none of the respect he had earned from me in the first movie and didn't even get started on Scuttle, Sebastian and Flounder. Triton was a strict but loving father in the first film, and in the second, it is almost as if he has lost his will to beat fear in his subjects. Scuttle, once a comic relief, made everyone laugh with its 'dingle jumper' (yes, I admit it; I called my fork a dangle-jumper from time to time). In this movie, Scuttle is all forgotten. A supportive character even in the first, he has at least added something to the movie. He was rich in a taste that the others did not have, and in the successor they all fell from him altogether. Sebastian was still the same, but twice as worrying as before. Disney, don't. Don't even try to mess with our favorite crab. Or our favorite little fat fish that becomes a father and has a lot of very annoying kids. He is fat and he is bland and he looks as if he is coming to flat line for a second. <br /> <br /> The walrus and the penguin were unnecessary, and after a while you just start bothering everyone. Especially Melody, who has no depth for her. <br /> <br /> And one of those days, Disney, I'm kicking out of my life. <br /> <br /> If I didn't love your originals so much.
