It was disgusting and painful. What a waste of a throw! I swear, the audience (1/2 full) laughed twice in 90 minutes. This is not a lie. Don't rent it yourself. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones was just to be credible. <br /> <br /> Cusack was ok. Just okay. I was sorry for him (the actor) if people remember this mess. <br /> <br /> Roberts was the same as she always is. Charming and sweet, but without reason. "Romance" with John was absolutely incredible.
