"Drawing Restriction 9" is a kind of movie you either love or hate; fortunately or not I left it with a strong sense of wasted time and being thoroughly filled with "killer whales is bad" propaganda. Aesthetically, the film could have been comfortable, especially its first half, until it is not clear that any action portrayed serves as an allegorium on various aspects of whale watching. Until then, looking at the daily tasks of the Japanese may be a little entertaining, but later it becomes obvious that something displayed on the screen is a propaganda, and no single frame is an exception. I use the word "propaganda" because the film primarily uses the old moral playback device, where "good" and "bad" are not discharged during action but are set in stone. It's probably just me, but I find such an art low and preconceived, even when it comes to the noble (no sarcasm here) that one seeks to protect the environment. In my opinion, it is a cardinal sin when stretching a film material without any justification for stretching. In my opinion, "Draw Restraint 9" could have been easy to fit in for 75 minutes, but has a torture length of 2 and 1/4 hours. Yes, there were interesting shots, but there were not enough of them to leave 15 minutes apart without notice. The film has no standard scenario, and there is no evolution of characters, but it is not a documentary either, it is rather a kind of conceptual installation. It is an unusual form of a movie, but it can still be seen as art, although the concept is as simple and naive as here. OTOH I also think the director should have had some honesty and not pretend it could only be delivered in no less than 135 minutes. And yes, the music scored the most on whale sounds. How surprising. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
