My first attempt to see this ended in 8 minutes, just after the TV report scene, which I couldn't handle. It went about like this: <br /> <br /> Reporter 1: Hmm, there's a pyramid in our sky. Reporter 2: I think it's foreigners. * awkward silence * Reporter 1: In other news ... A few days later I saw it to the end and it wasn't as terrible as I imagined, but there are serious issues with this. About half of the plot can be easily discarded. And the other half must be expanded to explain the background story or something. What is the detective, the eugenics, and the monsters that are immediately disposed of by Horus? More entertaining was the monopoly scene. "We are all powerful" gems "who have lived for aeons, and of all the games in the multiverse we are monopoly." Monopoly? Monopoly?! Even Erich von Dainiken looks coherent in relation to it. <br /> <br /> The other half is terribly missing. What did our protagonist do to get himself cryo-frozen? Why was there no big event when he was released at the end? He had those annoying supporters, remember? What happened to normal people? What's the deal with the masked guy? How did the blue-haired girl think? What about her eyesight? Etcetera etc. Visually it is OK, more or less, if you ignore the Egyptian gods that resemble walking on turds with rotweiller heads.
