After reading the novel before I watched this movie, I was hugely disappointed with the wood business and the producers' arrogance in their obvious disregard for the plot. I feel that this movie in no way reflects Bronte's Bronte's work, and rather gave the impression of a low love story. In the condensation of the film for a short 2 hours, the film lost many of the most important features that make the book understandable and progressive, resulting in a somewhat skipped plot with little ground connection. There is no building of the romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre, so this seems quite abrupt and unfounded, as the two characters have such rare interactions, you cannot help but imagine that their 'love' is shallow. This is such injustice against Bronte's novel, you get no impression of Jane's cheeky cheek and contradiction, which attracts Rochester to her, and his arrogance that attracts Jane to him. <br /> <br /> Despite poor scripting, I think a few of the characters were depicted very sparingly, namely Mrs Fairfax and Grace Poole, but overall production was poor. Given a better scripting, perhaps the movie would have been more successful. See "Jane Eyre" (1970) with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for an outstanding production.
