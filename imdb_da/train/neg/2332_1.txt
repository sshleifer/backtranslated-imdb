What was the purpose of this movie? I suggest it was to make a handful of players and their producers and director a big payday to do nothing. Even my favorite actor, Bruce Dern, couldn't keep my interest in this boring movie. A braindead ex-pugilist falls in with a strange woman and her relatives. He starts as a fix-it man for the woman, and wins out by beating a man and being caught in a kidnapping scheme. It was so confusing I can't even write a decent criticism. If you see this, then my sweet, make sure it's dark so you can go to sleep.
