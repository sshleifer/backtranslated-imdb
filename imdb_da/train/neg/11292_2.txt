Cornel Wilde and three dumbbells are looking for immersed treasure in the South Atlantic. <br /> <br /> The treasure hunters led by Wilde fight a group of territorial sharks with cute little snows on their hungry faces. Wilde and his merry men have to find a way to get out of the menu so they can start excavating an old Spanish galleon filled with gold. <br /> <br /> After the crew engages in a little eternity pushing, arguing and listening to Wilde's annoying health tips, 5 crazy prisoners control the boat and complicate things. Now it's a fight of wits about who gets the treasure, and who gets to see what the inside of the shark's stomach looks like. <br /> <br /> At least Wilde is in shape wearing exactly the same thing he had in 'The Naked Prey' 10 years earlier, and he's been in excellent condition. <br /> <br /> Made on a budget of 75 cents.
