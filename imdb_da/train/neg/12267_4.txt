Speaking alone as a movie, I really didn't like it. not because there was no FX or because we had a single cabin as the scenario for the whole movie, in fact it was keeping me in mind. <br /> <br /> I didn't like it because the play was shady, his "friends" are all happy and then they're crazy, but you have no idea why; then they take different roles, one is the believer, the other is the antagonist, but they never do it right! Also the lighting was awful and I mention only technical issues. <br /> <br /> In a few words, I could only have the movie "ok, I'm out here!" from some characters. as the lady who does not want to hear his version of the Bible. <br /> <br /> The story itself is all free to write about what they want, and history is proof of good writing and imagination. I honor the book author for that, therefore my 4/10. So in the end, the man's story hears it or not, just don't use it all the time as you think he is and is shocked at what he says, while moving around and joking like you don't believe him. <br /> <br /> Consistency. <br /> <br /> Thank you for reading;)
