I knew I should watch a low budget movie, but I expected a lot more from an Alex Cox movie. The act of the two leading men was horrible, especially the white guy. The girl should have won an Oscar compared to the two. This movie was filled with what I think would be within jokes for the film industry's people and a few other jokes that I actually understood and made me laugh aloud, which is rare. Without these ridiculously high moments I would have given this movie 2/10. What happened to Alex Cox who made all 80s classics? <br /> <br /> SPOILER: <br /> <br /> There were a few questions I had after the movie was over. Why did the Mexican guy go to the other guy's house at the beginning? What did his daughter say he got 100 people fired from his last job? Why did she break her own stuff when she was angry with him? I think I should have gone to Q&A after the movie, but I didn't want to get up at 10:00.
