I must admit that I liked the first half of Sleepers. It looked good, the play was even better, the story of childhood, pain and revenge was interesting and moving. A superior Hollywood movie. But ... No one has mentioned it so far (at least in the last 20 comments) when it came to the courtroom scenes and Brat Pitt's character followed his plan to save his two friends who are rightly accused of murder I felt cheated. This movie offended my intelligence. <br /> <br /> Warning spoilers !! Why did anyone accept their false alibi, the priest's witness? If these two guys had been with him, why shouldn't they tell this during the investigation? Amnesia? If you were a judge or a member of the jury, would you believe it? Is it wise to abandon the killer's motive? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but ultimately the story is very weak and it attacks me. This film had great potential. 4.10
