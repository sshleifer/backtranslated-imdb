About the baby: Why wasn't big brother supposed to be hungry for a bottle or nourishment or a diaper change? He should have screamed nonstop after many hours of care. Absolutely stupid to take the child from a safe place when he did not need it. <br /> <br /> And why was the road miraculously clear when someone wanted to drive somewhere? Didn't any torn trees fall on the roads and blocked them? <br /> <br /> I can't imagine the roadside police not immediately following any young person who would collide, especially when they said it was dangerous to go there. <br /> <br /> That said, it was nice to have a movie, kids could probably see for a change.
