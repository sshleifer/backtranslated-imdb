I got the DVD from the library in anticipation of getting a good idea of ​​how things are going in the background of a great opera production. I have to say I was very disappointed. The subject had so much potential. The phrases in a Wagner production must necessarily be elaborate and impressive, and the history of their creation and use could have been an excellent educational experience. Instead of what we get it to be a hodgepodge of clips of people moving around in big scenes, vaginal help along with a comment that has not noticed my attention. I found myself listening primarily to background clips of music from operas. I was impressed by the enormous amount of effort required to put on such a production - it came in quite well, and the next time I'm on opera, I'm sure I will remember that part if this video - but was left to feel somewhat cheated by the lack of detailed comment and explanation.
