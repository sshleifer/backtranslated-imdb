In 2005, George W. Bush started his second term as President of the United States; North Korea announced possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a movie called Into the Blue appears. The presence of this film is not as bad as the other things that happened in that year, but the film itself was pathetic and perhaps the worst of that year. Now in 2009 the US has another president, another pope, new Korean nuclear weapons ... and the movie Into the Blue 2: The Reef, which is better than the original ... but that's the same as saying: " Getting your fingers cut is better than having your head cut. "This sequel is a really bad movie that kept me incredibly boring and uninterested. Cast in Into the Blue 2: The Reef is composed of the actors of the television series, who are completely lacking in credibility and dramatic weight, but who are perfect for showing their bodies. Chris Carmack (The OC), David Anders (Heroes and Alias), Laura Vandervoort (Smallville), Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) provide hollow and boring performances. I've seen some previous films by director Stephen Herek (Critters and Car l and Ted's Excellent Adventure specially), but in this movie he can't generate even the smallest level of tension, emotion or entertainment. The characters from this movie are performed not only badly, but they are also repulsive. I wanted them all to die. The cinematography of this movie is also paralyzed, and it appears to be made by a technical team that makes advertising videos for Hawaiian hotels. In Blue 2: The Reef is a horrible movie that is better than the original movie, but it's the same as nothing I said earlier. Select this crappy movie at all costs.
