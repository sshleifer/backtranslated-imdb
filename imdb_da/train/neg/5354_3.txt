Absence of a good plot, lack of decent ACTING, lack of good CINEMATOGRAPHY, lack of decent appearance SPECIAL IMPACT ... should I continue? Notification may include SPOILERS. The actors seem to be reading their lines, and not very well in it. Most of the "actors" appeared as if they were in another game. The story seemed to be written by one of the aforementioned second degrees ... it's not really all that horrified ... it's just so simple and stupid that a person thinks they're missing something so they think that it coincides. No, it's not, it's as simple as you think it is. I understand "movie", that's how I know it stinks! MOST of the movie just had people sitting around talking (reading their lines) trying to see the sinister. The narrator was ANNOYING. The "special effects" were LAUGHABLE. I love low budget movies. I also like Carolyn Munro, Tom Savini, Jack Scarry and Michael Berrymore ... just not in this movie ... you can tell they weren't paid or were paid a lot because neither their hearts nor their talents were in the. I love Tony Todd ... but he was only sufficient in this movie. In fact, Tony Todd's performance is the only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 ... and Tony was only in it for two minutes (seriously)! I'd suggest speeding up the DVD for the two-minute Tony Todd segment. If I had gone to the theater and paid more than one DOLLAR to watch this "movie" I would have been P.O. and demanded my money back. Hopefully the people who have done this will do better next time.
