This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I looked primarily out of a morbid curiosity since I loved the novel, and I wish I didn't. I turned it off after a little less than an hour, even though I wanted to turn it off after five minutes. I wish I had. It ignores the story a lot and changes all possible factors. Unless the movie managed to redeem itself over the last 50 minutes (which would be impossible), I would in no way recommend it. It is an insult to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. I don't think as many say it is that "The Bell Jar" is necessarily filthy, but this particular replay could have been done without it. I would almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it fairly.
