It's really so bad in a movie. My buddy rented it because he is a good idiot. But then again I must be an idiot, because I saw the whole terrible thing! The actors were on par with high school drama geeks who believe there are places. The only place they have to go back to is the waiting tables at Lubys. All I could think of while I saw this "pearl" was how it was actually made. I think some "screenwriter" actually thought that this premise was fresh, original and lucrative. Then some moron with money on the manuscript believed so much that he decided to throw some money over with the naive misconception that he was entitled to it. Actors were thrown, sites were investigated, makeup artists were hired, computer animators fresh out of Al Collins Graphic Design School were brought in, and this turd began to take shape. Of course, there was a ton of things that I hated about this move, but the only thing that drove me the craziest was overuse of music. Every minute of this flick was scored. There was not a single break in music. And sometimes it was mixed higher than the dialogue, not that it made you miss any important plot point or something. <br /> <br /> After that, we decided to see the Mystic River. It was like driving a 1980 VW Diesel Rabbit and switching to a BMW 740il. You couldn't get two more opposite films in terms of quality.
