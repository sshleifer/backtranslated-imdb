I write this review after seeing it several months ago .... the trailer looked promising enough that I could buy this lama excuse for a movie. It is a complete joke .... and literally a spit in the face of real classics of the early generation of horror like Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), which they even had the gall to compare with the back cover of art. The producer who played Brandon had to start hamburgers and serve greasy hamburgers .... hell, he can't be good at it either! The lighting was badly bad and a big annoyance through the movie, you couldn't even see the actor's faces sometimes. I can't even remember the rest of the cast members who are sad really, bad, they never do anything to impress you to make them memorable. It's all the time I want to waste on this review. NOTE that being as far away as you can from this pile of junk, even if you get it to 25 cents, do not, buy that piece of chewing gum, at least it would keep you entertained! br /> <br /> If you want good quality low budget fun, far better than this ... then check out a Jeff Hayes movie .... because it requires talent to do it in horror and the child has it! </ br /> <br /> I gave this 1 star only for cover art ... it's the only thing worth suffering from this so-called "movie" <br /> <br /> -Rick Blalock
