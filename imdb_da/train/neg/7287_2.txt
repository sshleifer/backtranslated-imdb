<br /> <br /> Back in his youth, the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbid it. Many decades later, the old man has raised three children (two boys and one girl) and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon her sister gets bored with brother # 1 and jumps in her brother's 2 bed. <br /> <br /> One might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island. But no - they are top class Europeans going to college and busy in the social world. <br /> <br /> We never see a flirtatious moment between any unrelated woman and the two brothers. We never see a flirtatious moment between any unrelated man and a sister. All flirting moments are shared between only the brothers and the sister. The weakest part of GLADIATOR was incest. The young emperor command would have hundreds of slave girls and a town full of marital girls over him, but no - he just wanted his sister? If the film mines are your cup of tea, then SUNSHINE (slow) will clamp you to no end.
