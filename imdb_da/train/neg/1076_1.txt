This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Branaugh seemed to have so much trouble remembering his accent that he couldn't deliver his lines. The reason was certainly not worthy of John Grisham's name. No wonder it was never published as a book or published in theaters. I didn't even see it all. I decided that I didn't care who did it so realized there was no "whodunit" to worry about!
