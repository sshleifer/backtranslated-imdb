I work in a Blockbuster store, and every week we have movies that come in with a few copies. It's the kind of movie that the Sci-Fi channel shows. The kind of movie no one ever wants, and only the idiots renting when they take it back, I ask them "was it good?" You say "no, we broke it off after 15 minutes!" Films with terrible computer-generated, super-imposed monsters and the like, very unappealing. <br /> <br /> This is the same type of movie that Grendel is, and definitely a waste of time, if you want a reasonable (and only reasonable) good Beowulf-based movie, try Beowulf & Grendel starring Gerard Butler, who also starring in the eagerly requested 300, like King Leonidas from Sparta. <br /> <br /> Also later this year we have another Beowulf movie, with a star studded cast ranging from Anthony Hopkins and Brendan Gleeson to Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich. <br /> <br /> But don't let your hopes happen as we all did with Eragon, or we're all in for another great disappointment. <br /> <br /> And for rentals, here's my rule of thumb: If there are only one or two copies, don't rent it because it's a lot of crap. (This is true 99.9% of the time, usually not true if the title is foreign or a documentary.)
