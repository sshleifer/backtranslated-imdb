There was some truth in this movie. I remember a story that reported 15 to 20 years ago by 4 fishermen who found a body in the water and they chose not to report it before their trip was finished. I also remember being charged with disturbing a corpse (or something like that). I'm not sure if it was in Australia. Viewers outside Australia must believe that we live in a country full of rapes and serial kills. Wolf Creek and this movie would encourage this view. The movie itself reminded me of a simple plan. But as far as one of the best Australian movies ever, as anyone claimed, I can't be so generous. Put it this way, I wouldn't bother to see it again.
