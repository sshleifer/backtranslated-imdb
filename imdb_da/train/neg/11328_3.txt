Every time I rent an action / adventure movie just as a way to relax and record my heart with nothing important. That's why I own a copy of Charlie's Angels (2000) - not a quality movie, but it makes me laugh and allows me to relax for a while. One of those days I will probably buy copies of The Princess Bride and a couple of Monty Python films for the same reason. <br /> <br /> In any case, I rented this movie because I wanted to be entertained without being challenged. For the most part I got what I wanted. The reason was something like a poorly written Xena episode, and Kathy Long's play was very community theater (not bad for a professional kickboxer and amateur actress). There were a few points on the side of the cyborgs. Somehow they managed to get some really good actors to play the bad - unfortunately most of them kill quite quickly. <br /> <br /> Like most martial arts films, the longer you get into the movie, the more weight is action, and the plot (which wasn't strong at first) deteriorates almost as quickly as the actor. But the more Kathy Long struggles, the more time the director uses for her back. At the end of the film, I seriously considered seeing it another time, just to count the number of times, Kathy Long's tight red shorts were the center screen. Unfortunately, there was not enough meat for this movie to make satisfying curiosity worth seeing the movie another time. If you're a hard core Xena fan who needs something to turn away for a few hours - at least go to the grocery store and spend 50 cents on the rental. There are some strong similarities between the show and this movie. Just don't expect anything more than being mildly entertained for a few hours. Unless of course you are like Kathy Long's derriere. Then you might want to buy a copy.
