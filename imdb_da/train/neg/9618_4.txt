I have to say, though this movie was formal throughout with a plot stolen from movies like Friday the 13th / I know what you did last summer, this movie wasn't that bad. In fact, it wasn't as bad as most of the horror movies Hollywood has released recently. The murders, although sometimes too imaginative, were in most cases just original. The cast was mediocre, as one would expect from low budget functions, but much better than what the much larger studio Artisan / Lions Gate has offered. My only real complaint that was not due to the film's budget, which should have been small, was the intricate twist ending. I'm sorry, but that's what puts this movie in the bad category for me. The finish was just stupid and beaten through. Before that, I was a little bored, but actually enjoying it. 4.10
