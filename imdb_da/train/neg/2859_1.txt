It is made in 2007, and CG is bad for a movie made in 1998. On the one hand, in the film there is a stop motion shot by a dinosaur that actually looks good, but it just makes the extreme amateur work on the CG stuff looks just worse. <br /> <br /> Writing, performing, managing and everything else in this movie is just awful. This is as bad as if not worse than Raptor Island and 100 million BC ... pure crap! Again, as with the other films, the only scary part about this movie is that it was actually made and is now being broadcast on the sci-fi channel. <br /> <br /> I still can't understand how they somehow get people who have some acting skills in these movies and somehow make them act as horrible as everyone others in the movie. Of course, for those of you who are uncertain, the other poster is sarcastic in his review ... or he is one of those people working on this movie.
