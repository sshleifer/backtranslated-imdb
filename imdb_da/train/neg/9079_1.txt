What are people talking about here? I must have seen another movie than you. I was so sorry I went out of the theater. What's up with these things. I laughed only once and not even so hard. The one who greenlit this film should be taken out on the street and beaten. I usually find something I like in a movie, but it is wild. "Slackers" makes "Not Another Teen Movie" like a classic. It's up there with such waste as "Body Shots", "Con Air" and "Conspiracy Theory" as one of the worst of the time. AVOID ALL COSTS! I thought the studio would give out money to people as they left the theater as a sign of their excuses, but to my dismay that didn't happen. It looks like I will never see the money again or the two hours.
