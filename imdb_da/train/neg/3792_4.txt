I've seen many, many productions by The Nutcracker. Now I may have seen this movie from a tattooed point of view of a theater director, but I was disappointed. I'm sure people in the ballet choreography's special business find this production impressive, but from a purely theatrical perspective, I found everything from design to choreography to be lackluster and unbefitting a "movie picture". None of the traditionally "strange" and impressive costumes resembled what they were supposed to be (ie the candy did not resemble candy, the rats did not resemble rats, but rather like chocolate cakes) the action was weak, perhaps toned too much for the screen and the choreography did Just nothing for me. This makes the whole show very satisfactory (at best), as if it were supposed to not separate from any other production. But remember, it is again from the artistic perspective of a theater director, not a dancer or choreographer, but an equally male theater director.
