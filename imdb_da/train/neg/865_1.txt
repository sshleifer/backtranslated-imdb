I had the misfortune of sitting through 102 minutes of what, in my opinion, is this shockingly bad movie. It fails at virtually every level; The cast is terrible, the actor at best, and the plot lacks depth, so I feel violently apathetic about the outcome of any of the coincident stories. <br /> <br /> Plan B has no charm this genre has the ability to convey, and I was physically ringing at the various points where the manuscript makes its regular misjudged meanderings everywhere in the direction of the comedy area. <br /> <br /> A bona fide saccharin coated thin of a film.
