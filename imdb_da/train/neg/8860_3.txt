OK, as everyone has pointed out, this movie is a complete dog. To some extent, this is due to the fact that it was a spawn sexploitation film that had much material cut (or darkened to near invisibility) to escape the censor X rating; but the film also has many other errors. <br /> <br /> First, one seems to have written his werewolves and vampires together. The wicked in this movie are frantic and do not like silver, but in every other way they behave like vampires. Now you just can't do it with a crappy genre flick, you have to stick to the rules of the genre, or the fans are all confused and annoyed by suspending disbelief in the wrong thing. In fact, the whole (confusing and poorly presented) plot is something that has already been done for vampires, but makes no sense in a werewolf movie. Second, the werewolf suits are the lamest you have ever seen. Anyone in the werewolf movie industry should know that werewolf costumes and transformations are something that fans critically consider, but some of these were simply clever. <br /> <br /> There are a few good bits. I actually liked the score. Others have mentioned Sybil Dannings tits. And ... <br /> <br /> (*** SPOILER ***, if such a thing can exist) <br /> <br /> I also liked the plan to attack the werewolf stronghold. There are so many horror movies that rely on characters that behave stupidly, but in this case they first acquire a very sensible and effective anti-werewolf arsenal and hit monsters. I mean, you can kill werewolves with silver balls, and we have some beautiful weapons these days. Shouldn't be too hard to put two and two together, hmm? But in typical style, this film goes over the top and adds some other very zany and entertaining anti-lycanthrope weapons.
