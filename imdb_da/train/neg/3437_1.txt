I saw this movie yesterday. I must admit it wasn't my cup of tea. Although it should be a horror movie of its kind. But when I looked at this, I thought. "This movie has no meaning at all." Where in the world did this guy come in the dark coat? Where were the two guys on their way when they left the girls behind? Where in the world did a shark come out? <br /> <br /> All these elements in this movie somehow didn't do anything. I felt that these filmmakers wasted so much time and money on a movie so bound to be so shabby. <br /> <br /> I've seen many good horror movies in my time, but this is one of the worst horror flicks I've seen. At the end of the movie I told myself that I would not see it again. So much pappy show in this movie, I have decided to give that thumbs down! Count me on this! 0 out of 10!
