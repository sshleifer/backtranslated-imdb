I watched this movie twice through a pine circle, my family attended Nanaimo BC in the 1970s. I was 6 years old, my brother 4, then again when I was 8 my brother 6. This movie scared my brother and I and shaped how we viewed the world with distrust. It was not just the movie, but it was also the philosophy that involved so many "Christians" about the "mark of the beast" and the rapture. This film, the church and a fleeting negligent education lead to serious paranoia towards the future. For years I have lived under the church's delusions and fears of being forgotten by Christ. I am now 40 years old. Went through many years of advice. I once told a psychiatrist this film and the belief system in the church and the family. I was stuck with a mistake. I actually began to believe it, it was my brother who reminded me that this cultic philosophy actually happened. I no longer fear the future, I have been expressed with the fear injected into its members of the church. I have taken this experience to fulfill a purpose I am approaching my license as a psychologist specializing in childhood injuries.
