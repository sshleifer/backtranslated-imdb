Why? Why did they make this movie? If Timothy Olyphant wasn't shirtless in it several times, there would definitely be no reason to see this movie ever. About ... Plot? Nix. Well-defined characters? Nix. The only time I laughed was when my boyfriend had fun with the whole hun-bang. P. S. Andy Dick? Nix.
