R O B O T J O X. <br /> <br /> Burn the champion. <br /> <br /> Grotesque horrible. <br /> <br /> No end; no closure. <br /> <br /> Completely the worst movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Replaces "Pluto Nash's adventure" as the worst movie all the time. <br /> <br /> I hate this completely unedited, unedited, unscripted, unirected, unproduced mess of a thing called "Robot Jox" - and I just found out - they did another!?!? I apologize to Adma Sandler (Zohar the Beauticin) and Eddie Murphy (Pluto Nash) to download their movie. This mess of one thing makes these movies only bad - not horrible terrible and grotesque like this thing. This is the only movie I've ever said this - remove it from the network - now !!! 10,000 out of 10 people found this comment helpful.
