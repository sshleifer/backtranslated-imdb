What makes "Executive producer" in a movie. If I remember correctly, it was the person who raised the financial support to make the movie. You may notice in a large number of films with Sean Connery that he is also the executive producer, which meant that Connery himself raised the money since he is a big player. Unfortunately, it should also be pointed out that a large number of films "starring Sean Connery was made exclusively because he managed to raise money as he is a major Hollywood player, it is usually an indication that when the credits read, it Managing producer and star of the movie is one and the same, the film itself is nothing more than a star car where the story / manuscript is not scratching. reward gets a top diplomat. Probably? When things progress, Ms. Davis (who has trouble cheating two sentences together) has found himself in more outlandish and less likely situations, when I say PROTOCOL stars Goldie Hawn, who also is the film's executive producer, do you understand what i say about the story / manuscript is not on scratches?
