I tried to get through this movie twice, followed by the first time - and it was like pulling teeth - and not the second time despite a big DVD transmission. The problem? It's simply too boring. <br /> <br /> If you can get to the dramatic court scene scene that captures most of the other half of the movie, you've made it, but it's hard to get to that point. There are some interesting conversations of "Abraham Lincoln" (Henry Fonda) during the trial. The end touches when Lincoln goes off, and they overlay his Memoral statue over the screen. It's a lovely story, well acted and such .... but it lacks spark in the first half and discourages the viewer from hanging in there. I suppose the real monkey Lincoln was much more interesting than this movie.
