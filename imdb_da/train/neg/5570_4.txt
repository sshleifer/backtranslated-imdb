Let's appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Entertainment: A trashy script that has been written by unintentional people in front of typewriters a thousand times .. pathetic plays disturbed by history ... OK production value including good set / location and beautiful girl .. - rating 4/10 <br /> <br /> social message: the movie has no social message. it is thoughtless .... but if I do I was 10 and my IQ was 70. I feel the message is: Don't be afraid to love? -rating 0/10 <br /> offensive things: nothing special, only the mild Jewish hedonic and arrogant attitude presented by the author / director. Generally, good, nothing degenerated -8/10 <br /> <br /> overall rating is 4/10
