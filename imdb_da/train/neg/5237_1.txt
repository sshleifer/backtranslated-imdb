One of if not the worst movie coming out of Britain in the 80s. <br /> <br /> This silly tale of a medieval laugh that "seduces" two teenage scrubbers who have babysit for him and his faux-posh wife has nothing to redeem. <br /> <br /> Conversely, it is free, pueril, creepy and unrealistic, this film deepens the depths as it fails unevenly in its attempts to be fun, provocative, intellectual, and controversial. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about this movie is perhaps the way the strong cast George Costigan, Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran are completely stitched by such a lame script. It is not surprising that this was the late Andrea Dunbar's only work to do on the screen. Complete and complete rubbish on each level.
