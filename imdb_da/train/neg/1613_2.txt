Now that Che (2008) has completed its relatively short Australian cinema run (extremely limited release: 1 Sydney screen after 6 weeks), I can no doubt join both hosts of "At The Movies" to take Steven Soderbergh's job . <Br /> <br /> It is usually satisfying to see a film director change his style / subject, but Soderbergh's latest stink, The Girlfriend Experience (2009), also lacked a story so story (and editing?) Suddenly seems to be Soderbergh's biggest challenge. Strange, after 20 eight years in the industry. He was probably never very good at storytelling, just saved it well within "edgy" projects. None of this excuses him for this present, almost diabolical failure. As David Stratton warns, "two parts of Che do not (themselves) a whole". <br /> <br /> Only epic biopic in the name, Che (2008) hardly qualifies as a feature film! It certainly has no legs, inasmuch as Soderbergh's 4.5-hour long dirge just goes beyond its uncharacteristic ultimate resolution that is forced upon it. <br /> <br /> Although Margaret Pomeranz, the more forgiving of Australia's At The Movies duo, noted about Soderbergh's repeated waste of (HD digital storage): "You're in the woods ... you're in the woods ... you is in the woods ... ". I'm also surprised. Soderbergh did not give us another 2.5 hours of it somewhere between his existing two parts, because he still omitted massive clumps of Che's "revolutionary" life! <br /> <br /> For a biopic of an important but notorious historical figure, Soderbergh inexplicably lapses if he does not deliberately offend his audience at <br /> <br /> 1. never give most of Che's story; <br /> <br /> 2. Introduce unreasonable movie lengths with just dullard repetition; <br /> <br /> 3. Disregards both real-time viewing and a story story; <br /> <br /> 4. hardly develop an idea or sign <br /> <br /> 5. Remaining claustrophobic episodic; <br /> <br /> 6. ignores the proper context of scenes --- what we get is mired in disturbing timeshifts; <br /> <br /> 7. Linguistic dislocation of all audiences (even Spanish speakers will be confused by the monstrous exhibitions in English); and <br /> <br /> 8. Laundering his major in one dimension. Why, at this late stage? The T-shirt franchise has been a success! <br /> <br /> Our sense of claustrophobia is certainly due to Peter Buchman and Benjamin VanDer Veen, who base their manuscripts solely on Guevara's memoirs. So, as a poor student who has only read one of his assigned texts for his task, Soderbergh's product is extremely limited in perspective. The audience is held in captivity within the same limited knowledge, nature and circumstances of the "revolutionaries", but it does not evoke our sympathy. Instead, it begins to us that "Ah, Soderbergh is trying to hobble his audience the same as the Latin peasants were at that time". But these are the same illiterates who have sold the good doctor to their enemies. Why does Soderbergh feel the need to equate us with them and keep us as mentally trapped? Such a straitjacketing of the audience must have an intention. Part2 is more chronological than Part1, but it is literally insane with its repeated bush-bashing, misery in outlook and lack of different or character arches. DelToros Che has no opportunity to grow as a person as he struggles to educate his own poorly disciplined troops. The only charge is humor, as Che deals with his sometimes deeply ignorant "revolutionaries", some of whom lack self-control over local farmers or food. We certainly do not get an insight into what caused the conditions or any strategic analysis of their guerrilla revolt, as it were. Part2's monstrous countdown remains terribly episodic: again, nothing is telegraphed or contextualized. Thus, the scenes with Fidel Castro (Demi√°n Bichir) are unexpected and disturbing. Any selected event is minimized and latino-centered, and part 1 interviews are replaced by time-changing meetings between the corrupt Bolivian president (Joaquim de Almeida) and the US government officials who promised the CIA intervention (!). <br /> <br /> The rest of Part2's "woods" and day-to-night blue filters just confuse the audience until they look at the exits. <br /> <br /> Perhaps DelToro felt too much that many non-US latino's frustration of never getting a truthful, unbroken story about Che's exploits in their own countries. When foreign governments will still not deliver a free press to their people - for whatever reason - then you can see how a popular American indie producer can set itself to lure it not so well-read ("I must not be able to read or write, but I are NOT illiterate! "- cf.The Inspector General (1949) out to their own local cinemas. The obvious neglect of the film and gross over-simplification suggest that it is only aimed at understanding the less-informed, who still speak a little English. If they did, they had already read tomes about the subject and criticized the relevant social problems among themselves - learning the experience of history as they should. <br /> <br /> Such insights are precisely what societies still need - and not just the remaining illiterate Latinos in Central and South America - but that's what Che (2008) pleasantly fails to deliver. Soderbergh buries his lead because he is weak in narration. I'm gobsmacked why Benicio DelToro deliberately chose Soderbergh for this project if he knew it. It has been 44 years since Guevara was greatly wanted: that was what I went to see this movie, but the director kills us killed. <br /> <br /> David Stratton writes in Australian (Oct. 03, 2009) noted that while Part1 was "uneven," Part2 "quickly goes downhill" from there, "charts Ches last campaign in Bolivia in scary details "which" ... feel almost unbearably slow and turgid ". <br /> <br /> Che: Guerilla aka Part2 is certainly no travel explanation for Bolivia, which paints it a picture of misery and atavism. The whole other half is only redeemed by the aforementioned humor and the dramatic - but tragic - capturing and performing of the film's subject. The rest of this interminable cinema verite is just confusing, annoying misery - Shockingly for a Soderbergh movie to be avoided at all costs. It is bound to break the hearts of everyone who knows a smattering on the subject. (2/10)
