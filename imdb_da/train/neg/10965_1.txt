I actually see this movie as I write this. . . If the following remarks "prove my lack of development as a true artistic filmmaker", then it is. . . <br /> <br /> But. . . I thought (still thinking as I currently see) that movie. . . To put it mildly, is very, very overstated. Again a lot. It looks like a really, really poor student movie made by someone with in addition to extremely limited resources. . . and who didn't pay much attention to detail. <br /> <br /> I will not continue with all the different ways I find this movie is missing, though. . . well . . . I just don't understand it (rememeber, I fully admit that maybe I am the idiot here - not the filmmaker - not to get this "piece of imaginative genius"). . . I rented this on a whim because the reviews were very, very excellent. . . <br /> <br /> Sheesh. . .
