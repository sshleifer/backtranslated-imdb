Be warned: Neither Zeta-Jones nor McGregor play the main part that the poster wanted you to believe. Their roles are actually smaller. The movie stumbles badly between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama, and is neither really engaging. In particular, I find it impossible to muster much sympathy for the protagonist, not to mention his scruffy friends and sex-engaged fiance. The reason is dreadful, and I turned it off after approx. 2/3 - unusual for me as I like to finish what I start. The good acting and the beautiful setting take it from 1 to 2 stars. <br /> <br /> 2/10
