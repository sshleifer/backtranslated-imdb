What a horrible, horrible movie. The worst collection of clich√©s I've seen for a long time. Not that much. I left the theater screaming for about 40 minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves. Meryl Streep was horrible as usual. How many evil and tortured expressions can one person have? Aidan Quinn's talents were - as so often - completely wasted. And who told Gloria Estefan that she could act? Trying to be politically correct, this movie is still enforced racest stereotypes. (Brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivileged children violin in poor neighborhood school). The kids weren't even cute! Just typed in to fit the shaking script. Aaargh! Wes Craven made me cut me once. real horror this!
