I can't say I liked this movie very much. It has some entertaining moments, but it does not seem to be able to think about whether it is a comedy or a drama. It doesn't seem right like either. It is also light in tone to be a drama, and the entertaining moments are few and far between. Nor does it make much sense. It seems to happen for no reason. And it is also extremely confused. I want them to just do things when they go. If they had just taken some time to explain things, this could have been a better movie. It would say that the end was anti-climatic, but that would mean that the rest of the film had actually been built up for something that it didn't. It only corresponds to ends, and that's it. I didn't find it boring, really, but as I said, there's just no point. I want to give Winter Kills a restraint and weak 3/10
