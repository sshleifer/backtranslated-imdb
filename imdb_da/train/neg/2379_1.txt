I admit. I think Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and has made it a mission to see all the movies she's been in (unfortunately also include the horrible movies Batman and Robin, The Avengers) and this one. <br /> <br /> This should rank as the worst movie I've ever seen. (yes it goes even lower than The Avengers). Everyone sees lost in it, and it is incoherent beyond belief. <br /> <br /> Though you think Uma is a goddess as I do, do not submit to this movie. You hate yourself the following morning for it.
