Quentin Crisp once said that when things are shown too beautiful, you are a romantic. When things show unbearably gloomy, they are realistic. And when something gets the ironic treatment, they are spot on. Unfortunately, he falls for Leon de Aranoa in the second category. This instructor has, of course, tried to make a Spanish "Ken Loach" movie without being able to capture the comedy and the warmth of the characters raising Loach movies from just being "depressing". Los Lunes al Sol is just that, only depressing. Things are unrealistically gloomy. The characters ultimate moments of misery all reach a climax at the same time, and if the glum story is not enough, the Aranoa washes the story with a visually gray and ugly color shell. The movies were ridiculously over-rated on Goyas. A film showing empathy for the weaker citizens of society, in this case unemployed port workers, does not automatically create a good movie, although I will be the first to sympathize with the fate of these people. This movie only manages to make me uninterested in their destiny. In the 21st century Spain, the unemployed do not live as beggars, and the public transport ferries have decent toilets and it is difficult to get over a bar with so few punters and such a little happiness that can arise in it. Leon de Aranoa obviously has no idea of ​​the working class of Spain, and does not benefit it. Pretentious is the only conclusion I can draw. The scene where the men watch for free at a football game has been copied directly from a movie that is much more 'realistic' with the subject of 'poverty trap', namely 'pure belts', which is much more engaging, humorous, and anyway sad.
