This is not one of those reviews about bad special effects or technology or dated, issues that only the dearest people could relate to, but rather a review of the story that most of us are really interested in. <Br /> <br /> The plot is about a combination of WWII allies and German naval members, and two civilians (hero and heroine) clashing on a German U-boat and closing in a missing country with dinosaurs. /> <br /> The manipulations are not so bad at film standards, and we know from the plot that realism will not be high. What movies like this need are credible and sympathetic characters, along with some reason in the actions. <br /> <br /> This movie is missing both. For a full-length movie, only 6 characters are given at any time, and 3 of them are hardly examined. McClure's hero is beyond "routine" and has little meaning for some time. The woman seems to be looking for an answer to a riddle about the countries of dinosaurs they came in, but the riddle It is not much of a riddle and we could fit less. <br /> <br /> A lot of mistakes in a movie that should have been better even for its time.
