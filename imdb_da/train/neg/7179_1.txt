No matter how good it means that his "message" is - this movie is a terribly fractured train - horrible acting, low camera work - I don't know why Carr went in to try to pull a stutter - he's miserable. You see extras on the DVD and the way he has a camera follows him around - he just enjoys it - he loves being the center of attention. He's a bad actor - he reminds me of another arrogant filmmaker - Eric Schaffer. Some how Carr got this movie shown at the city's youth centers and New Age churches - where damaged people looking for reinforcement and attention ask themselves how the movie touched them and maybe did it - but as a movie itself chopped, predictable and sappy.
