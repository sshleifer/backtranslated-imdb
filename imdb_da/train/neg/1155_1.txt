never before has a movie driven me to write a review, but this was just dire.i stuck with it trying to find what it was about this movie that made snoop pick it as its first serious role but honestly it was a bad choice.maybe this made a good book, but it probably didn't work for me as a movie. I found it incredible, lacked atmosphere and I found many of the scenes terribly stilted.a musical maestro he might be, but a serious actor didn't snoop. by Dylan mcdermott and rose Byrne was acceptable, but not enough to carry a weak plot with weak dialogue. maybe I just missed the point, but for me it didn't fit into any genre, it didn't evoke any empathy with the characters, nor created any excitement. In fact, I found myself praying to the end and killing a depth of desire to let go of all three main characters!
