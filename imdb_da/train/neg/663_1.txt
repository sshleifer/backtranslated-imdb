Imagine the scenario - you are only in the cinema because you are in Washington this weekend and it is raining and you are done with the museums. You think you can watch the Sarah Marshall movie as the trailer looks like this and you don't have to engage your brain. It is sold out. Options? - Banking, in Bruges, The Leatherheads or Prom night. You've seen the bank job (surprisingly decent heist film it) and in Bruges (again, pretty good) so you're down to two. You don't want to see Clooney or the beautiful one from the office running around in soccer uniforms in 1930, so you can see Prom Night right? Wrong. You take $ 8.50, go up to a stranger in the street and ask him to face you for $ 8.50. It would be better to spend money. <br /> <br /> It actually plays more like a comedy than a horror / thriller or whatever. If I funded that movie, and they showed me that, as a last cut, I wouldn't know if I should laugh or cry. Probably both. An insult to everyone's intelligence ... my roommate sounded loud on most of the movie. As for the actor, they might as well have thrown robots (or maybe dogs) into the roles, they would have been more realistic. Detective may be the worst actor I've ever seen (Ben Affleck and Hayden Christansan (I hate his acting so much, I don't care how to spell his name) you are relieved of your title / titles) <br /> <br /> In summary, "not good"
