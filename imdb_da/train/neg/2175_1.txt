Carlos Mencia continually shouting "B ** ch!" in women is like screaming "n ** ger!" in black people, except it is worse. Remember that the B-word, unlike the N-word, is the only pejorative term still associated with daily violence. "B ** ch!" The last thing women hear before they are raped, beaten or murdered. This guy continues violence by challenging violent language. It sounds like he can be a gay guy trying to cover by women's bases so he sounds like a straightforward one. And what about all the Nazi white guys in his audience who give the fascist salutes, while their stupid, little bimbo white women whine tee hee hee on their side, clearly fearing to protest against this tidal wave of women's hat. Tee hee hee. Bet Mencia doesn't believe in or support freedom of speech for them! Come on, Carlos? do you want women to have the freedom to b ** ch relax you as loudly and violently as the big dog as you do, or do you think "free speech" is only for men crazy about women ???
