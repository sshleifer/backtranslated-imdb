I fail to recognize Haneke's above average film-making skills. For example, I appreciate his lingering on unremarkable-natural-day-lighted settings as a powerful way of forcing a strong sense of realism. But as far as the content of this film is concerned, I am very sorry to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to pathologize dominance - submission of relationships or emotions (and / or BDSM practices). The problem that the protagonist has with his mother is incredibly topical, as is the alienation and incomprehension that felt by Walter (I don't mean the frustration of a lover who's not loved the same way, which is understandable, I think he sees on her as if she were crazy, or as if he were a monk, come on!). I think D / s is nothing new in the world, and I think it is quite stupid to treat the subject as if it were something "freakish" or pathological; it is not. Generally, movies dealing with this topic are really afterwards. <br /> <br /> For me, I feel that this movie ends up being quite a programmatic movie worried about very outdated psychoanalytic theories (it's not 'is it almost embarrassing?) and it doesn't relate to true to the real life and experiences of those involved in D / s relations (personal experience, forums, irc chatrooms, even recent research studies will show this).
