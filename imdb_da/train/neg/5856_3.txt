T. Rama Rao made some extremely beautiful films in the 1980s, but he seems to be a filmmaker who cannot mature with the changing times, styles and fashion. He is just as stuck in the same old-fashioned film-making style. <br /> <br /> Actors are not bad, nor good. Anil Kapoor is generally convincing about his two roles of a father and his son, but the failed script often makes him look funny and pathetic. Rekha is good, but then - she is always good, and here she is nothing more than that. She makes the best of what she gets, but she always does. In conclusion, nothing is great at all. Raveena is OK, which means plain, not bad, not good, nothing. <br /> <br /> This movie is melodramatic, occasionally silly. Maybe it's a delayed movie? Well, even then it would still be below standard. The script is terrible, the movie is exaggerated, and the story goes nowhere. It feels like a movie made in the early 1990s, but the script makes it look even older, the style is like the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Do not recommend unless you are a big fan of one of the leading actors.
