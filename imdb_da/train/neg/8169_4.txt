The movie starts with a couple of campers, a man and a woman probably together, walking alone in the great desert. Certainly the man hears something, and it catches him so much he goes to investigate it. Our killer welcomes him with a stiffness to his stomach. He then chases the girl and slants her neck. The camera under the opening scene is from the point of view of the killer. <br /> <br /> We now meet our four main characters, two couples, one lying on the rocks. The men laugh at how the woman would never be able to survive alone on a double date, and spark the token blonde's ambition to leave a week early. Unexpectedly, the men leave the same day and their car breaks down. They end up in the evenings. When the men arrive, they are warned that people are disappearing in the woods by a crazy Ralph plunge. They ignore the warning and wake up in the dark night and a eighties song plays in the background with lyrics about being murdered in the dark forest. The men are lost. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, we realize that this is not just another The Burning Clone, but a ghost story! The women, frightened and lonely, flock together at the fire. Two children appear in the shadows and decide to play Tom. Now, of course they are ghosts by the way their voices echo! Their mother is shown with blood dripping from a hole in the forehead and asking the two ladies if they have seen her children before they of course disappear. <br /> <br /> The kids go home to dad and tell him about the two beautiful ladies at the river. It causes some stirring, and he gets up and takes his knife out of the fireplace. "Dad goes hunting," The little girl exclaims with bad acting. It is clear here that Dad is not a ghost like his children. <br /> <br /> Freaked out of something in the woods, split blonde splitter, running blindly in the night, wearing a knife. She meets the father, explaining that he is starving, and it gets fast. This doesn't make sense because of the pledge we heard earlier (Maybe he's allergic! Is panthers honest even in California?) She ends up being hurt a little before being stabbed in the head. Thunderstorms erupt and the men seek shelter that turns out to be where Papa resides. It is clear that someone lives here because there is a fire and something weird about it. The children appear and warn them about papa, which shows moments later. They disappear as soon as he arrives. <br /> <br /> For some reason, our killer goes only for women. He invites the men to have something to eat and tells us the story of his former wife. We get a feedback from his wife who gets caught cheating. However, the old one does not tell them that he kills her and her lover afterwards, but daydream about it. We do not get the reason for the children's death. The men go to bed and become unheard of. The next morning, the men discover the empty campsite for their wives. After a brief discussion, they split up. One is to stay at the campsite while the other goes and gets help. Anyone who goes back to his car breaks his leg. We are then reunited with the children as they explain to the surviving woman that they are ghosts who killed themselves from being sad about their mother. They agree to help the woman reunite with her friends <br /> <br /> The following scene challenges the movie's logic when Papa kills the guy waiting for the campsite. He was also dating or married to the blonde. Somehow, the children realize that he is murdered and tells the woman about it. She decides to see it for herself and of course runs into the killer. Fortunately, the children make him stop by threatening to leave him forever. You know where it goes. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie deserves four stars out of ten, and it's generous. For all its concerns, the musical score is well done. It can still be seen. There are some camera angles that look professional and some of the sets are well done. The reason is incredible. There is such a thing as the willing suspension of infidels but with the toad 6 miles away; I can't imagine that the token blonde would take that out in the middle of the night. I mean, come on! <br /> <br /> - Alan "Skip" Bannacheck
