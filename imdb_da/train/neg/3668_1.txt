This movie is so bad you almost feel polluted. In fact, there is a strong sense of relief when it comes to relief, that you can now put the cassette back in the rewinder and RUSH back it to the video rental store before it pollutes the rest of your video collection. I told fun when we rented it that it looked like the kind of movie where William Hurt would "ring in" his performance. I thought he wouldn't try very hard. But look and see, in a large number of scenes in this movie, Bill Hurt is actually on the phone! Our realization of this irony was the only pleasure we derived from this confusing mess. The kinematics and editing are creepy and full, the story is chaotic, and the soundtrack is hardly audible. There is a very small resemblance to "Falling Down", but that movie had a boldly disturbing history line, good writing and acting and an engaging soundtrack. The "contaminated man" is just a kind of broken down old European tourist trap and sees that it is like driving along an unknown back road in an unknown country where you do not speak the language in a steady rain just after the evening as the windshield keeps fogging up. You get the picture? Don't get this.
