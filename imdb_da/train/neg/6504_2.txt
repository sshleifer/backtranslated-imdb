Why did I waste 1.5 hours in my life and look at this? Why was this movie made for itself? Why do I even comment on this movie? <br /> <br /> One reviewer said this movie took patience to watch and it wasn't for everyone. I can't figure out who this movie is for. Perhaps after hitting a hit of acid, in some places someone could see it here and make sense of it. It's incoherent, it's not experimental, it's plain and simple waste. The film follows no plot line at all, just when you think you have something, yes ..... you don't. <br /> <br /> I think the ending brought some finality to the movie (no saying is calculated), the viewer gets a glimpse of what might have been on. I don't think I put a spoiler here, not what it would matter. This movie is another one that must be missed in the world of cinema.
