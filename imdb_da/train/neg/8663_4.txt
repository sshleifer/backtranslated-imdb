Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water ... Another computer generated mutant croc on prowl for human lunch meat, loosening of another of those facilities that perform crazy science. The Gereco Biotech company is wondering about growth hormone research, which accidentally releases a baby crocodile that develops in an acceleration rate. B film casting adds a lot of fun to this run of the mill "genetic mistake monster film". Costas Mandylor evokes Mick Dundee, Aussie accent, hat, big ass knife, the works of a hook specialist employed by Gereco executive Joanna Pacula (.. wasted in the corrupt role of corrupt executive executive who refuses any involvement in the gigantic beast of her facility let be free of innocent people). Charles Napier is the local sheriff whose city is in danger and Jane Longenecker is his hot daughter working on the animal shelter. Soap opera star Matthew Borlenghi is Longenecker's love interest, a local artist who welds sculptures (.. his brother is the victim of croc). Of course, this skill will come in very handy when our heroes create a created trap for the hook, hoping to poison it with carbon monoxide. The crocodile is never the least convincing as it struggles through a reserve looking for food, the special effects of a low degree of variety. With regard to Roger Corman productions dealing with renegade dino monsters, I stick with Carnosaur. The monster here is essentially a crocodile standing on the hind legs, often erect, as it pursues potential victims. I felt Mandylor and the filmmakers spoofing Crocodile Dundee with her crooks, and this imitation can entertain where the monster itself fails. Borlenghi and Longenecker actually have pretty good chemistry together on the screen. As expected, Pacula gets her commute in a fun way (.. gulp).
