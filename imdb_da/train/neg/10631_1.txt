The Earth's views, claimed in this film, have been falsified by NASA, have recently been compared to the historical weather data for the time of Apollo 11 and show a good match between the cloud patterns of the video sequence and the actual rainfall records of the day. <br /> <br /> This seems to undermine the whole argument in the movie that the "whole earth" image is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft's window. <br /> <br /> I am waiting for Bart Sibrel now to claim that the historical weather data has been forged by NASA, but it would undoubtedly mean that they also replace every filed newspaper copy with a weather map and those in private hands would still be a problem. Ah, an answer: "Trying to discredit this movie by referring to NASA weather data, I would say is a charming but weak and credible argument. What about the rest of the footage and evidence in the movie? Some wise one once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels Are you in any way convinced that it might apply to what you are trying to do here? :-) This film is full of irreversible evidence against the claim once issued by the US Government The moon's missions were a success, and that man is now true gentlemen in the universe, things are almost never quite what they work, just watch the movie and I say you will see things a little differently than before. "<br /> <br /> Firstly, road data does not come from NASA, it is going to meet agencies around the world. Secondly, the weather data undermines a great demand in the movie. Third, the remaining claims in the film are far from being "packaged with irreversible evidence" being thoroughly interrupted. Sibrel thought he had a former secret piece of film so he edited it and added his own interpretation. Unfortunately for him, his source film is public domain, and the bits Sibrel are edited against his claims.
