Although many people praise this movie, I have to warn you. It has no logic at all. I think Basinger is doing a decent job, but you can't make a thriller if there's a real lack of realism. <br /> <br /> This scene paints a good picture for you in the movie: while Basinger is being pursued by murderous thugs, she decides to sit down and look at a picture she finds from her pocket. The picture is from her daughter and it sounds "we love you mommy". Who does something like that? What eff? And believe me when I say it's not nearly as stupid as some other scenes in the movie. Someone said this is a "hidden gem". Well, I strongly disagree, this movie has been hidden for a reason. And it's not a gem. Oh, and thank you, I don't even want to start commenting on the red toolbox. It hurts my brain: D Normally, logic is not missing if it is in small quantities, but this film is basically only possible due to lack of logic. But I still give it a 4, because even though it is embarrassingly lacking in logic, it has a certain mood that kept me in mind for the end. <br /> <br /> So if you choose to see this, you know you've been warned.
