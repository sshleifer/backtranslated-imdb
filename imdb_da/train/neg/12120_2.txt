In what might have been an otherwise run of the mill, mediocre films of adultery in the sixties (the subtle "free-love" period), the filmmakers create the ridiculous scenario of ridiculous scenario and beat it all off with a tired little cherry on top, happily ever after the end. In no time have I ever felt sympathy with Diane Lane or Anna Paquin in their cumbersome middle-class carefree life, nor did I feel the emasculated Liev Shrieber. The story goes along slowly to its predictable, pathetic conclusion, and the only interesting and audible about this movie is the amazing Diane Lane topless. Here's a tip, it's about 30 minutes in the movie. Fast forward to that part and jump the rest over.
