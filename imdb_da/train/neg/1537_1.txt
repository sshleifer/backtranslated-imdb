Really bad shot on video "movie" made by not one, not two, but three amateur video makers. <br /> <br /> If you want to make a bad horror movie at least throw in some blood, gore and nudity. There is some blood provided with latex cut arm props purchased at a Halloween store. There are lesbians and hookers, but no nudity or sex. Lesbians spend a lot of time in bed, but only speak. There seem to be no editing effects - fades, cloth, etc. Once in a while it seems a bit black to separate scenes. <Br /> <br /> Terrible music by bad heavy metal bands whose websites take most of the final credit. The walls are represented by rubber masks attached to just the "actors" face. They did not even disturb brown makeup for their neck, arms or wrists. <br /> <br /> I guarantee a 10 year old with a video camera could put together a better movie. No need to buy, rent or watch this movie except as an example of how not to make a low-budget video.
