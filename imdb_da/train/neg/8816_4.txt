I saw mommy ... yes, she didn't just kiss Christmas Eve; He has his hand on her thighs and evil thoughts in mind. <br /> <br /> This was enough to emotionally be a young boy who would believe. He grew up to be a bitter man who was worried about the quality of the toys that were made and the lack of Christmas songs. <br /> <br /> Expecting a real slasher flick, I was very disappointed that less than a handful of people died and there was no nudity at all. What a bummer. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this flick but it was just too slow and didn't really have a good script. I don't expect great plays, but I would probably have some actions. There just wasn't anyone.
