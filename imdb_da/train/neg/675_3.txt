Bypig Meg Tilly receives a frightening phone call from her mother and reasonably understands returning to her family's nationwide caves, but only faces a mystery: Why do all homespun residents behave in bizarre and disturbing ways? Brilliant thrills, who have almost no eye on ecology, have small town dwellers who go crazy, who (ridiculously) include two women staring at each other in a public place, and Tim Matheson receives oral attention from a girl on an office bench. The picture is too stupid for words, wasting Tilly's wistfulness and silent intensity on the garbage bin, forcing yourself into a corner that can't hope to get out. Some of the Thomas Del Ruth's cinematography is good (especially a fire set in a garage), though he is let down by scrappy editing - and a pretty bathetic finale. Simplistic manuscripts have no surprise or a piece of origin on the sleeves. * 1/2 from ****
