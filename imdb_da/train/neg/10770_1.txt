May contain possible spoilers (Not that something in this movie is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter) Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything they have ever done in oblivion? Sure it is cheaper for them, but after a while you will not think about the overall quality and the way people think of them would fall off. House of Villains is a contemptuous display of comic strips that makes no sense at all. Some signs of the total disregard of previous films in this are: The voices do not even vote externally, and Iago is hurt again (since when!) I know these movies are directly against children, but there was a time when everyone could enjoy disney movie. Even the movie's music track (which had been Disney's specialty for years) stunk. I would not recommend this movie to anyone even the very young. All I can do is, if several of these movies of the same caliber are released, it's just a matter of time before some small animation studies surpass Disney's overall quality.
