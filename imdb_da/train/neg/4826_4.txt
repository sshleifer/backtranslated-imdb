I see what the director was trying to do, but he missed the mark. The main actor was really good, but editing around his moments takes you out of it. The camera's work, ie. lighting and exhibits are kind of amateur that I could forgive if the direction was more fluid, but it was not. The sound was a bit gone and it also takes you out of the movie. I see that this director does a bit better in the future, so not a total right, but don't expect a DVD movie almost as good as 28 days later or something, keep your expectations low and you get more from it . At least it was only an hour and a half. Oh yes and other than the management, the play was pretty bad if you ask me. But I'm a movie snob so take it for what's worth it.
