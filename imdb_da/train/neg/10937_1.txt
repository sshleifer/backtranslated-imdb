Each time for a long time, a movie will come together that will be so terrible that I feel compelled to warn people. If I work all my days and I can save, but a soul from watching this movie, how great will be my joy. Where do I begin my discussion of pain. Initially, there was a musical montage every five minutes. There was no sign development. Each character was a stereotype. We had sworn guy, fat guy eating donuts, greasy foreign guy, etc. The script felt as if it was written when the movie was shot. The production value was so incredibly low that it felt like I was seeing a junior high presentation. Have directors, producers, etc. Ever seen a movie before? Throat storm gets worse and worse with each new entrance. The concept of this movie was so funny. How could you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of some legitimate actors. But believe me when I say this, it went wrong, very wrong.
