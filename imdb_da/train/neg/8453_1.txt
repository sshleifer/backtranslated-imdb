This movie is a muddled mish-mash of clich√©s from recent cinema. There are some promising ideas in there, but while the director was clearly intending to end with an eerie ambiguous movie, it was a confusing mess what he ended up with. Leader actor Daniel Wu does a fair job, but without any central theme it seems like he doesn't have much to work with. In addition, the film is virtually devoid of scares (although in fairness some creepy moments during that drudgery). <br /> <br /> * MILD SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> We have the mysterious death of a foreign twin, devilish librarians, ghostly love interests, identity confusion, assault on death, oedipal conflict, violent stifles, sublimated homosexuality and crimes with banner connections. The only real commonality these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and dissatisfaction. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of this movie is that, despite the brother's death with monkeys, it is strongly highlighted on the DVD cover, the action itself is never directly portrayed. Instead, director Julian Lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys - not so scary. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> Avoid this. For an outstanding psychological, ambiguous horror story, check out the Korean movie A Tale of Two Sisters (2003).
