What is there to like about this movie ??? <br /> <br /> It's in color! <br /> <br /> It has some impressive underwater photography! <br /> <br /> It has a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well at times! <br /> <br /> So 3 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Sometimes the music gets faster! Especially when the shark or evil is about to enter! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's lowered! As if communicating to the public, it is about time for sympathy! <br /> <br /> As another bites the dust! As in a "Spagetti Western" this has very similarity! <br /> <br /> It's not that Italians can't produce quality produce! There was a series of television films with a title like "Octopus" numbered about 1 to 7, screened on SBS TV in Australia in the 1990s on mafia-type conflicts! And they were excellent! But unfortunately you can't find it here !!! <br /> <br /> I assumed it was made around the 1960s! Unfortunately, it was 20 years out of date, as evidenced by a funeral scene near the end! <br /> <br /> Then there was the razor-sharp bite of the fast shark that causes a red dust to repeat itself in the bluish water! <br /> <br /> In the midst of everything, whether in barracks or by observing the latest sea-blooded demolition of the relentlessly hungry shark, the hat's friend sees a little concern about his glasses as if he were also boring in his relentless role in the middle in the absence of much signs of plot or anyone's character development! <br /> <br /> At least, the hero indicates a fleeting concern delayed for his former wife! <br /> <br /> But of course, even if the music does not awaken our realization, we have the monstrous sound of the voices of evil, as if we are joking that another dark action will soon appear! <br /> <br /> And at the end someone thought of a twist! Just as we thought it was completely predictable! But keep tuned, people, for you can find another twist! If you look close! That more or less warm your heart! <br /> <br /> Follow the Council Heroes and get a few beers along the way! It will make your viewing of "Night of the Sharks" easier! <br /> <br /> Then you will be ready for something like a "007" movie to ease your way back to reality when this is over !!!
