I'm amazed at some of the reviews of this movie. The only place that seems to tell the truth is RottenTomatoes.com. This movie is horrible. The foundation is extremely lazy. Nor is it scary. People out there who think that because it originates Sarah Michelle Geller, is somehow that The Grudge should forget it. This movie is more like Dark Water, except that it is even more predictable and slowly moving than it. I was very disappointed with this movie. Nor did it frighten me and did not interest me either. Let's see, this type of plot has been imprisoned to death at this time, eg. the dead are trying to contact live - Dragonfly, What's Under, Ghost Story, Dark Water, Darkness, The Changeling etc.etc. It seems to me that the only ones who write the original horror films today are Japanese and Korean. The movies that come out of Hollywood are, as such, cynical exercises in money that do it without regard to the respect of the viewer. They just get churned out
