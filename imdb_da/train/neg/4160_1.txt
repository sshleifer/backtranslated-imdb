It was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I saw it with a large group of friends, and after it was over, one of us didn't understand the plot. Apart from the lack of plot, the play was terrible, "special effects" were not so special, and the writing was horrible. The film's only redeeming factor is that it is so incredibly bad that it is quite fun. You can't help laughing about a zombie being driven over while the actors spit crazy dialogue. I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good movie, but it is something that a group of friends can get together and have a good laugh about. It is now a regular joke among my friends and I. 1 in 10.
