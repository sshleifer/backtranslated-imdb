"True" story of three girls entering the wilderness of Connecticut and ending up being chased by a lunatic in the forest. This is the kind of movie that would have played in the United States Drive Inspectorate thirty years ago for mixed recognition. Not much of anything, the film works with its low budget for mixed results. The movie can be seen but is not scary at all (blame how some of the attack scenes do). It's the kind of movie you're likely to forget when you're done with it. Odds are that you will never think of seeing this unless it is entrusted to you by someone and told, "Here it is" which is what happened to me. If you are handed a copy, give it back, the movie is not worth trying to see, even though it can be seen.
