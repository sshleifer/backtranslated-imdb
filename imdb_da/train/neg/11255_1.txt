In one word, this movie was boring. It lacked life and spark. One big problem is with the two leaders. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow had no body at all. He was boring and she was annoying. <br /> <br /> The pictures were interesting, but they didn't improve the scenes. If that was something, visuals had a tendency to loosen the audience from what happened on the screen. None of the action sequences felt right, and thus the movie couldn't create any real drama or a sense of danger. The film had potential, but it needed a better script, better acting and a better director. I continued to think about the movie, you know this movie would work if Harrison Ford was Sky Captain, Karen Allen was Polly, and Steven Spielberg was director. <br /> <br /> Ignore the critical acclaim for this movie. The critics think I promise the movie because they * will * like it and want it to succeed, even if it fails at so many different levels.
