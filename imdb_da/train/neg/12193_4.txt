"Look, I know it can suck right now, but the pain is temporary, movies are forever. Whatever you do right now, it is burned in celluloid all the time and for thousands of years to come." ?? Robert De Niro <br /> This was originally a movie for Steven Spielberg, the director using several scriptwriters to adjust the manuscript to fit his themes more. And then we have a dysfunctional family threatened by a fake monster in the form of a newly released prison by Robert De Niro. Like "Jurassic Park", "Poltergeist" and "World of War", the dysfunctional family binds together to defeat the animal, as the animal is the creation of the father, a lawyer who has not defended De Niro during his trial. <br /> <br /> In typical Spielberg fashion, the father kills the monster that undermines the family and then immediately released by his sins. Like, for example, Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam Niel, Tom Cruise and virtually all "father" figures in Spielberg country, the father regains his father's duty in the kind of bittersweet code that Spielberg so enjoys. <br /> <br /> But Spielberg eventually left the picture, and the project was instead turned over to Martin Scorsese, who at that time was trying to try his hand at more commercial fare. The result is undoubtedly the worst movie in Scorsese's filmography, and ironically, his most luminous is. <br /> <br /> Mistakes or misfires of an artist are often very revealing and expose the inner works to their art. When the story does not work, the characters do not connect or the pictures do not cut, we find ourselves back with some kind of inner core. This ?? Now "Cape Fear" is an impersonal movie, so we find no thematic connections to the rest of Scorsese's filmography ("You've Already sacrificed me!" De Niro shouts, but the film's themes of Catholic redemption are cookie cutter). What the film does, however, is to postpone the kind of language his filmography hangs on. See how Scorse's camera desperately whispers back and forth how he zooms deeply on door knobs and windows in an effort to force tension and how his characters are loud and screaming for attention. But more importantly, see how the movie does not contain meaning. A showdown on a boat at the end of the movie takes place at a clear stage of the sound, a street parade is claustrophobic and goes without interconnection, and the family house does not seem to exist anywhere in particular. There is simply no geographical sensation for anything in the picture, Scorsese cannot film space or create any kind of spatial environment. <br /> <br /> The reason for this is that the Scorsese camera must always be tied or closely linked to its central character. For the world around the character makes sense, his camera must be focused on the character. Resnais can take you around a French hotel, Welles and Hitchcock can dance you down a street and up a building Cameron can give you a trip to Titanic, Scott can restore a future cityscape, Lucas can give you a strange desert plan and most other directors can create a sense of space using the textbook "close up-mid shot-wide shot" combinations, but Scorsese can't do this. There is no poetry, no sense of tangible space in his film. He is about the character. You break the tether, you leave the boxing ring, the taxi you see away from De Niro, and everything breaks. He simply cannot break away from this very documentary shooting mode, which is a prerequisite for action filmmaking. Scorsese attempted to correct this problem with "Gangs of New York", where space and sets become the central sign, but even this self-conscious spatial experiment is sabotaged by Daniel Day Lewis magnetism, and the actor draws Scorsese's camera incredibly against him as a moth for a bulb. <br /> <br /> 5/10 ?? Even as a generic B movie, this is a nasty, vulgar-looking movie. Look at the dull paintings, the creepy tensions, the stupid rotorscoped special effects and the hokey fistfight showdown. Yet we have Robert De Niro to pick up the veil. De Niro, who gives his body over to Scorsese as a tattooed Christ, gives the film its only big stage. In an impromptu romantic order with a young Juliette Lewis, he sticks his thumb into his mouth and kisses her. A kind of symbolic rape, the girl runs away, both awakened and rejected by this man's interest. <br /> <br /> But De Niro's performance, so leaking over the top, simply cannot be imitated by Scorsese. You would need operatone and baroque images of someone like De Palma to do this work. But Scorsese? No. <br /> <br /> Worth having a view.
