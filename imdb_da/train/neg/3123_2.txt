Felt mine was while you were watching this ... but it seems that this is the cause of insanity in the family in this movie. It still does, however, as others have mentioned, it was one of Karloff's last films, and it is only his screen presence that gives it any credibility at all. It is sad that all the great legends of horror films in the age of sound were reduced to appear in low-grade waste like this. Marginally, Boris went a little better than poor old Bela Lugosi, but not much. <br /> <br /> Boris does his best and gives him credit for trying to keep this mess together. The tight background music does not help and distract from any clear moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican is called into some strange, clipped, English monotones reminiscent of the type used in the late 1970s porn movies. <br /> <br /> On a guess, I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's "House of Usher" that this has been taken away, but you would be hard pressed to find a lot of Poe in the finished article. <br /> <br /> There are still much better movies out there with Boris Karloff at best, search them out and give it a wide berth unless you also want the curse of the "shrinking brain"!
