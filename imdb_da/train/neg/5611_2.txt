I personally found this movie to be terrible, firstly it was hardly objective and gave one side of the debate. The only people who were presented as the site that said he existed were a lot of people coming from a Billy Grahm Revival. Second, it was different from his supposed subject, Jesus (Yeshua) existed to talk about where violent Christianity is, and show scenes from Mel Gibson's "The Passion." In the end, the director, together with his former head of a conservative private school, interviewed, trying to catch him teaching the children who are faithful. Oh and also Techno Music just made the movie more difficult to see.
