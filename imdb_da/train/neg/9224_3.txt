Style but no fabric. Not as fun as it should be. Not as deep as it will be. <br /> <br /> This is another part of the movie's genre about the difficulty of filmmaking. A young film producer is hired to finish a campy 60's sci-fi movie called Codename: Dragonfly. Think Barbarella or Fare Diabolique. <br /> <br /> But Jeremy Davies is an anxiety movie. He is no hack, he is an artist. The movie he wants to make is a diary in his life. Almost original. <br /> <br /> All the characters outside of Jeremy Davie's filmmaker are as thin as rice paper. Signs that may be interesting, such as the father, his doppelganger or Jason Schwarzmann as the chief executive, will be introduced and displayed without adding anything. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of eye candy but when compared to other movies about filmmakers like Stardust Memories or 8 1/2 pales in comparison. These films are fun, provocative with well-developed characters. These films have lessons that will be used outside <br /> <br /> The movie will be cartoon and campy, but it is just derivative and there is no fun scene. The filmmakers describe it as a send-up, but what is the satirical goal? The actors say it's a tribute, but I think I'd rather have a full-length version of Codename: Dragonfly. <br /> <br /> Coppola is clearly amused by the setting, as evidenced by the visual humor of the sci-fi movie in a movie. But he fails to share why we should be amused. <br /> <br /> Outside of sci-fi movies, it's just a mess. There are continuity errors, the filmmaker chooses a sci-fi weapon after it has already been selected. What? <br /> <br /> Just because he has a scene, the filmmaker was confronted with the critics complaining of lack of history, lack of a point, a scene where he admits empty wisdom, does not mean he has addressed that criticism. <br /> <br /> I guess if your Roman Coppola can get away with making a movie about an anxiety-ridden idealistic filmmaker who doesn't know what he wants to say and then ends up saying nothing. In that sense, it can be considered autobiographical. <br /> <br /> If I had a choice, I'd see it on Circuit City on a wall full of TVs. See 15-minute code name: Dragonfly movie included on the DVD as extra features and then send it back.
