Two years before he wrote and directed "Arthur", Steve Gordon had a smaller hit with his script for this crackpot comedian vehicle for Henry Winkler, so TV's "The Fonz". A 1950's college thespian (and all-around jerk) woos a co-ed and gets married without employment prospects on the horizon; To make ends meet, he turns to the flamboyant world of wrestling and eventually becomes a "Gorgeous George" -like celebrity. Turning like Winkler to an unpleasant goof-off probably sounded like an interesting idea at that time (and a sure way to separate him from his TV-alter ego), but the jokes and situations are often wrong and mean staged a little dull Director Carl Reiner. Particularly raw is a wincing bit involving Herv√© Villechaize (of "Fantasy Island") that sets the movements on Polly Holliday (Flo from "Alice"). As Henry's beloved, Kim Darby looks a bit out of her element - especially when it is surrounded by all those TV hemps - making the romance aspect of the script disjointed. * 1/2 from ****
