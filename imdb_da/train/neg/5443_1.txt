Too bad, I really like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. But the director failed to put this together. There are a lot of actions, many promises, but it all comes out of hokey. The director did not do his job. Promising action comes out of mockery. So much seems to be distinctive in a desperate attempt to save the movie. This version of "The Rage" (DirecTV credits it as 1996) is simply not worth looking at. Another director would have done a better job.
