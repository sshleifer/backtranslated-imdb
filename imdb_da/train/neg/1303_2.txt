Edward Montagne's Tattooed Stranger must play as a criminal thriller with a small movie noir mixed in to taste. Instead, it is a badly acted, ignorant look at low budget and uninspired filmmaking. The reason is absurd and the play is outrageously stiff and amateurish. John Miles, who had a rather thin resume in the industry, laughs and guffaws all the way through, and everyone else trades in the same enchantment as a sign of a government-run filmstrip on driver safety. The movie expects to show "Let it be to Beaver" and "Far Knows Best" in its unnatural healthy view of New York in 1950. Why does the viewer not even see anyone turning on a cig until some formal women are interviewed in a flophouse halfway through the movie. The only thing that the film has on its way to it (besides its succinctness) is the excellent place-shot coordinated by William Steiner. The low budget of the movie works in favor of the film photographer, as the viewer is treated to well-framed images of New York City's interiors and expansive exterior. Unless you want to enjoy the movie of choice of settings and camera angles, I suggest watching almost any other movie.
