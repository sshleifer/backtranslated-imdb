Because "cruel" would be the only word that existed to describe the intentions of these filmmakers. Where do you start yourself? In a spear of b * tchiness, I start with the awful play of almost everyone in this movie. Scratch it. Almost do not belong in that phrase. I can't even think of a character that was portrayed well. Although in all fairness it would be almost impossible to depict these zero-dimensional characters successfully. Still, the girl who played Katherine (whose name I don't purposefully contain - I pretend she doesn't exist) remained one of the worst actors I've ever seen, only obscured by the guy who played Sebastian. The story was God horrible. It tried to mirror the shine that was the first but failed in so many ways. Almost every part of it was pointless - though I would admit (grudgingly) that the plot twist was quite good it is surprise. And the end was at least a little humorous. But this movie is up there with the worst I've seen. Don't look at it. Just don't. There is absolutely no value in seeing it. None. It only takes pleasure from the first.
