This movie was on the second day, and I didn't enjoy it at all. The first George in the jungle was a good comedy, but the sequel .... absolutely horrible. The new actor and actress to play the lead was not at all good, they should have the original actor (Brendon Fraiser) and the original actress (I forgot her name) so that this movie gets 0 out of 10 rating, not a movie that You can sit down and watch and enjoy, it's a movie you return to another channel, or take it back to the store if you are employed or purchased. It was good to see the monkey monkey back, but was not as fun as the first one they should have gotten the new George as George's son adult, and still had Bredon and (what is her face) in the movie, it would 'I've been a little better when it was.
