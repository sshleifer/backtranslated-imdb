I'm a big fan of Martin Amis, whose book this movie is based on. Unfortunately, the director has not been able to translate the book into the screen. The novel is thoroughly postmodern and very artificial in its wildly blown-out characters and division of traditional plot line and character development. It is a fun study of human greed, excess and emptiness by one of the most moral contemporary British writers. The director of the movie has completely missed the novel's point. In his hands, the film screams at breakneck speed and is linked to all known trick shot and 'odd' camera angles. It's like Ken Russel on acid, and suffers from the fact that older director cranked up to a hundred. Not even the (short) glimpse of the beautiful actor Christian Solimeno's penis was enough to save this miserable movie for me. Miserable!
