Ouch! They do not get much worse than this horrible adaptation of C. S. Lewis' beloved novel. While the adaptation is very true to the novel, the play is simply horrible, and the sets and special effects are on a scale similar to a school game. I've read that the budget for these miniseries was the largest that the BBC has ever given at that time, but they probably could have scraped a little more than $ 2, so it seems this was filmed for. The worst effect of all is Mr. Beaver. I know computer effects were not at the level that was necessary or even cost effective at the time, but the costume shopkeeper in a suit was terrible. Better to have just cut the character from the movie than make it the role! Avoid this at all costs.
