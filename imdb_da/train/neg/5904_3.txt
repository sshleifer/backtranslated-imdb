With the rapid success of "God's Army," all Mormons with a camera seem to be trying to make a movie now. In the case of the recent "The Other Side of Heaven" this was not a bad thing at all. The movie, but not great, was pretty good. However, "Singles Ward" is not. <br /> <br /> Telling the story of a young, divorced Mormon guy back in life, the writing and shooting style of "The Singles Ward" is in many ways, very similar to the 80s comedy "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" . However, the similarities end there. While the "Ferris Bueller" was fun, original and well-functioning (as far as stupid comedies like this ever is), "The Singles Ward" is quite the opposite. It's trying very hard to be fun. But 90% of the gags fall either flat or are clich√©s and jokes, you've probably heard a million times before. The other 10% seems to be thrown in to fill the time. And the play, but not terrible, is at best amature. <br /> <br /> Also, if you are not either a Mormon yourself or very much familiar with the Mormon culture, you hardly get anything at all. While "God's Army" and "The Other Side of Heaven" appealed to a wide variety of viewers, both inside and outside the Mormon Church, this movie is definitely a great inside joke, and even if you get it, it's just not that fun .
