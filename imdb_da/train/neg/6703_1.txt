I have noticed that this film has been sharpened by many insults. It has probably served some of them, but it wasn't that bad. Well, I want to be honest: I will never see this movie again. It was a bad movie. But I don't hate this movie, it was trying to tell a story. As a drama, this movie could work really well indeed. I just think the filmmakers misguged which way to take when they did this (they should have added more fun pieces if they wanted it to be a comedy). With a rewrite it could have been a good movie. But as a satire, it did not work in its present form - many scenes did not fit within the context of the plot: Call meaning in the story. Still, it wasn't the worst independent movie ever made - is it in the top 10 worst? It's debatable.
