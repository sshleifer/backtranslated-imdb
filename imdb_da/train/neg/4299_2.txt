This is one of the horrible, sex-driven B-movies that couldn't have played anywhere near a theater. Women run around dressed in lightly dressed "bunny" outfits, an extremely bold woman is the pile of many tasteless jokes, and they all work at the restaurant of a dirty old man who has an oddball son (Jim Hanks, who is of course Toms brother) the man wants to have "laid." Hanks is actually kind of good, but this movie goes nowhere and has no meaning. One has to wonder why it was done by itself? Nevertheless, due to Hank's performance and a few entertaining moments (but no more than a few), it received a star-clear "2" out of 10. However, I think I was good.
