This movie depicts Ruth as a female, hard-drinking, gambling, over-eating sports figure with a small baseball thrown in. Babe Ruth's early life was quite interesting and it was omitted for all purposes and purposes in this movie. In addition, Lou Gehrig was barely covered, and this was a well-known relationship, well poor or indifferent, it should have been covered better than it was. His life was more than evil. He was an American hero, an icon that many baseball greats mustered their lives after. I feel that I am just in memory of a great baseball player whom this movie completely ignored. Shame on the actors of this movie to exploit his mistakes and not his greatness.
