Although this was a television production, there is absolutely no excuse for the results of the bottom products of the finished product. This movie had a budget and it had a casting department, so if you want to make a movie about a true life story and actually put "the true story" in the title, shouldn't any effort be made to try to capture some realism? First of all, this film is absurd. These actors belong to television soap during the day, or in the ridiculous lifetime channels, and not in a reality gangster / criminal hall. All about them, from their appearance to their mannerisms, just the scream of the 90's shopping mall-all-rock-listening generation. What about the script? Two words describe it - stupid and insulting, and again it's all for the 90's. I don't think the real Clyde Barrow ever said the word "I'm out here." It's as if a bunch of "New Kids on the Block" fans came together and decided to make a real "kewl flick" about Bonnie and Clyde, you know, one that would be completely row and rockin '. Well, this sticker doesn't even stand in line and the rockin scale. Anything that can be wrong with any kind of movie is wrong here, from casting and action to editing and music. Every single thing is grossly wrong .... and it is disturbing that the parties responsible for this terrible turkey had the nerve to put "the true story" in the title. It is certainly NOT the true story, but even worse, it is not even remotely entertaining as a mindless popcorn flick that is accepted on its own terms. As I said in my headline, it is simply horrible beyond words, at all levels imaginable. Trust me in this, or look at your own risk.
