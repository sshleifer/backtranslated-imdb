I don't expect much from this movie, after the horrible "Life is a miracle". It turns out that this movie is ten times worse than "Life ...". I have the impression that the director / writer just speaks to the audience: "Let me see how much emptiness can you (the audience) maintain". Dialogues are empty, scenario is minimal. In a few moments, photography is really nice. Few sarcastic lines are semi-funny, but it's hard to laugh real during this "comedy". I laughed at myself to see the movie at the end. If you can lift yourself over this director's failure, you will find a good play of few legends (Miki Manojlovic, Aleksandar Bercek) and very good performance by Emir's son Stribor Kusturica. <br /> In short: too bad for such a great instructor! Emir Kusturica is still young and should make top-notch films. Instead, he chooses to make this low-budget, straight-to-mine theater film with an arrogant attitude to world trends and negligence towards his old fans.
