I saw one of the stage performances in Denver and have never been less impressed. The word "vagina" says it all. A body part. Nothing shocking here. I could say to my doctor: "My left arm has suffered a little after tennis" or "My vagina hurts after cycling" with equal or more social comments. It could be "Tricep Monologues" for all the entertainment or radical comment I heard. The monologues were boring, but delivered with drama, the subjects were outdated, and I became alternately bored and annoyed. When I think I was laughing, but apparently it wasn't when I was going. It is certainly not a hit. Oh, and spoilers: there were a lesbians! - Oh, wait, maybe not, come to think of it. And Inappropriate Funding! And a Crack Mama! It's about it.
