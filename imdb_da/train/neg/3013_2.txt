Beginning with its long opening of seemingly endless rows of assembly line workers in a Chinese factory, Manufactured Landscapes is trying to show the devastating effect of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional communities. Its droning story assumes that industrial development in China and elsewhere is completely unprecedented, as if there had never been an industrial revolution in Europe and America, and Karl Marx had never visited the British Museum. That there is perhaps a connection between the current Asian impetus for industrialization and wealth and past experiences of hunger and terror is never mentioned. <br /> At the same time, there is an effort to present Edward Burtynsky's photographs of industrial waste as somehow "beautiful". Much of the movie is a slide show of these pictures. They are well-produced, of the museum's size and have apparently appeared in several exhibitions. For me, however, they only show that almost any photograph can be made to look beautiful if it is well presented. Industrial waste is still industrial waste. The relationship between the images and the movie's spoken message remains unclear. <br /> <br /> I don't mean that there are no real and sometimes desperate problems when countries rush to industrialize. However, produced landscapes offer only strange and bitter hopelessness. It's like a two-hour lecture by Noam Chomsky. Perhaps it has some value as a demonstration of what's wrong with the American (and Canadian) left.
