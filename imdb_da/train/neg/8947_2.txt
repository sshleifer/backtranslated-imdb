The book is amazing, this movie is not. There is no reason why this film could not have embraced a futuristic technological vision of the book. Hell, the total recall was released a few years later, and it did a good job on it, even a clockwork orange released in the 70s did a great job of trying to create a futuristic world. The gloomy German expressionist colors, the black and white footage from the vision screen, there is no reason for this approach when the film was made in 1984. The protagonist is in a white collar writing job, but he dresses as if he were working with oil and fat in a garage. This film decides to take a mock communist approach to setting the design, atmosphere and theme, but the novel did not necessarily dictate the theme of a communist, worship-humble work itself. This book must be seriously adapted to a modern context, as this book is more relevant today than ever before. I couldn't see more than 20 minutes of this crap. The soundtrack is annoying, lack of foresight is annoying. This movie seems to have been made to deny a sense of realism or credibility when it is exactly what is required to hammer the novel's messages to the viewer.
