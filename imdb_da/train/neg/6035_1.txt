I really wish I could give this a negative voice because I think I just wasted 83 minutes in my life and watched the worst horror movie ever put on film. The act was just god horrible, I mean really bad, the dialogue was worse, the manuscript sounded like it was written off .... I can't think of anything terrible enough to say. And the day "outside" and the night "inner" shots make you think that the events took over several days. Terribly acted, directed, written, etc. All the way down to the gofer how to get lunch for everyone. Stay away from this one at all costs. If my only saving grace to be out of hell is doing a good job, telling the world not to see this shot. This movie is the exact reason why horror movies are never taken seriously.
