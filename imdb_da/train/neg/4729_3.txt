LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE is one of Elvis' oddest movies. Share slapstick, part fluff, share surreal and part strange. Elvis meets with a very off-beat girl with an annoying voice. She looks like Jennifer Aniston. The story doesn't make much sense, as is the case with most Elvis Presley movies, and there are a lot of odd signs galore. Not much music in this, but what I liked, though no one is memorable. Strange continuity. Elvis and Michelle Carey go into her beach house at night, but a few minutes later a delivery boy comes in and it is bright daylight !! What?? It's about the essence of the movie. What?? Oh, two good things about the movie: A) Elvis looks good and B) the dog steals the show.
