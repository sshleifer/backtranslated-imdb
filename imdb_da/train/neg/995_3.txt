Rosario Dawson stars as a girl who is date raped and then begins a decent in the dark until a chance of revenge is given. Although it is clear why Dawson took the role, it is a chance to show his plays and make a small independent, decided non-Hollywood movie, it is also clear that apart from great looks, Dawson seems out of place role. Forgive me, I just couldn't find her. It wasn't a mistake, it was how I felt I didn't know where she was. Yes I know she's on the screen, but even though I spent the better part of her two hours, she left no impression on me, ever. I blame the script for this since other than the end, not a lot of a lot that happened on the screen seemed to make any real sense. People seemed to be more posture than genuine, and what happened did not seem to fit together. Forgive me for being vague, but nothing in this movie, except the end (which I would love to talk about but can't cause it would ruin it), and the picture of Rosario Dawson as nothing but a picture, stayed with me. What can I say, this can click with you, it can't, for me it's time I can't come back. Only Rosario Dawson fans are warned, but there are several reasons why this is NC17. (And thank you Rosario, you're a better actress, choose better scripts)
