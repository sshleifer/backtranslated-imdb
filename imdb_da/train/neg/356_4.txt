The shape of the film is that of a voltage choke. There are surprises, twists, turns and tensions. At times this is really an "edge-of-the-seat" movie. But it seriously disappoints and fails. <br /> <br /> The lead of the piece is not credible; his character does not hold together. I refuse to "destroy" the movie, but will only say that the sign we meet in the beginning just couldn't be the one we see at the end. <br /> <br /> The other big disappointment in the movie is that - finally it gets a bit more like a bloody slasher movie. There is a small qualitative difference between this and one of "Friday the 13th" movie. Not that any movie always needs to be completely tasteful, but this movie does drink occasionally. Although the movie has the magnificent Sean Connery, he doesn't even measure up to his usual standard and often just seems to go through the steps.
