I promised a long time ago to NEVER see a movie that has someone who was ever a regular cast member of "Saturday Night Live". I did not rent "Corky Romano" but I was forced by my incomplete good manners to see it for half an hour. Then my good manners failed. Stupid, not fun. Boring, not fun. Bad, not good. That in a nutshell is all I can say to this video.
