I saw "Paris Je T'Aime" because a friend really wanted to see it so I went with him. Going in, I didn't care about the movie, but left the theater. I really told you to waste 2 hours in my life, through this lukewarm production. The "stories" are almost completely forgettable except that most of them were horrible. What does Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara have to do with Paris? The endless parade of American actors absolutely gave this French film a remarkable non-French feel. The clichés of Paris were endless. Yes, most played with clichés about Paris, but by spending so much time making fun of French clichés, they were immediately and unfortunately promoted again. Yes, Paris is the love city. We'll get it. <br /> <br /> The worst segments were: one directed by Wes Craven (Oscar Wilde); one with Nick Nolte; the mime one (the worst?); hair products one; one with Juliette Binoche (Willem Dafoe as a cowboy in the middle of Paris?); vampire (When I think of Paris I think of Elijah Wood). One with Natalie Portman who really looked like a Mento's commercial and it was stupid (the blind young man should know that Portman just played a role when she called him). On and on it went. It felt endless. <br /> <br /> I also didn't like Coen Bros. It really plays with the Parisien clichés, but I didn't find it fun. Just annoying. Gus Van Sant One was interesting, but it was so small (and the punchline was obvious) that it was almost unregistered. <br /> <br /> There were only two "successful" segments, and they were the one about the immigrant child leaving her baby in a kindergarten just to babysit a baby for a rich woman. Nice irony there. And the segment about the African that is stacked. It's the best segment in the whole movie, but this segment has nothing to do with Paris. The story could have taken place in any city around the world. <br /> <br /> The last segment, the one with the lumpy medieval woman, was also interesting, but the underlying tone was poor. They wanted to celebrate her limited understanding of French, but the segment came out as being disappointing. <br /> <br /> The whole project felt compelled and uninspired. Almost like the French Government, this film sponsored to promote tourism. All in all, with only approx. 10 to 15 minutes of interesting things, "Paris Je T'Aime" was a horrible movie experience.
