This is a review of 'Freddy Mercury The Untold Story', Theatrical Release, Chicago Int. Film Festival, 2007 One of the most audacious, uninspired and most boring biographical documentaries I've seen. If the movie I saw in a movie theater was originally released on television, I would urge its producers and distributors not to fool a paying audience with the false promise of a cinematic worthy documentary feature. Even as a documentary, the sentimental piano solos accompanying interviewees who sat in front of flower arrangements in hotel rooms and the pompous, pseudo-literary narrative, became more credible of a sleep-shaped bed Infomercial. The only redeeming aspects of this "Freddy Mercury 'incredible story" - or, uhm, was "The Untold Story of Princess Diana" is the original concert, video and television recording - unabridged Freddy Mercury and Queen. Testimonial interviews with irrelevant eyewitnesses with insight, such as: "He was a free spirit" (really. I thought Freddy Mercury was a business man ...) belittle the Freddy testimonials, by Brian May or Montserrat Caballe, throwing new and loving light into mercury's complex life and character. And ... what about Harry Potter-like boarding school segments? How did the interview with the first girl greeting ("... now working in a travel agency") and members of Freddy's first school band contributed to what I really want to know about Mercury? Vital milestones in his personal life, his sexuality, his artistic style and growth, queen, remain unexplored. These filmmakers do not ask a single provocative question, nor do they engage in independent or visionary research on their subject, but instead provide a dull montage of polite clean and very empty comments about an enigmatic and brilliant rock legend that does not deserve to be Remembered by this story channel biography your grandparents can turn off on a Sunday night.
