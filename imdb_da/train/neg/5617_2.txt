This documentary is based on incomplete evidence of evidence where Brian Flemming may not intentionally mention important evidence to the contrary. Perhaps his most crucial error is one of the earliest: His allegations of Paul's testimony of Jesus Christ ignore key facts such as: ** The existence of some formulated creeds in Paul's letters. These creeds indicate that most of the central claims of Jesus were already formulated in faiths within a few years of Christ's death and resurrection. ** Early Christian testimonies cannot just be wiped out as mere fantasy. In fact, there were many people who claim to be the Messiah during that period, but only one of them has remained: Jesus. Why? Because it would have been sensible for someone to have believed Christ, the Messiah and continued to die for those beliefs if they knew he had not been resurrected. ** Although the Gospels are dated more liberally, we still talk about Jesus 'accounts written in other eyewitnesses' lives that would have pointed out inaccuracies in these gospels. And there are signs that the Gospels were written much earlier. <br /> <br /> What I say is that Flemm's documentary film is an incredibly prestigious and self-service piece that hodge the various arguments and evidence of podcasts to serve its anti-Christian perception. Don't be fooled by poor investigation.
