I chose this movie by the cover, which was a bad move. It was not fun at all and the protagonists were unpleasant. The girl was beautiful, but the story and the play were terrible. It had absolutely nothing to do with surfing. Horrible movie with a surf theme that had nothing to do with surfing and no real surfers. Catherine Zeta Jones was beautiful and the movie is likely to see a resurgence just because she is in the limelight now, being married to Gordon Gekko and everyone, but if you haven't seen it, don't waste your time. A bad movie with BIG surfing, REAL surfers and AMAZING, BEAUTIFUL cinematography was in God's hand.
