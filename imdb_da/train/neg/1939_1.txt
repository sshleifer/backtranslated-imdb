Come on! Come by with Pakistan bashing guys. Bollywood can not only make brilliant movies - but it can seriously affect a generation of viewers. <br /> <br /> I am a great Bollywood fan but anti-Pakistan movie just makes me too much to enjoy manuscripts, movies, action sequences - everything. I'm really glad to see the viewers on both sides of the border reject propaganda and there are movies like Main Hoon Na out there that have done brilliantly, not only because they deserved because of the quality of their bollywood masala - but Also because it is trying to say: Give peace a chance and show that there are crazies out there on both sides that do not represent the masses.
