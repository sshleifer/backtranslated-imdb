The fourth "Tremors" feature dates back to the year 1889. "The Legend Begins" in the small town "Perfection", which was then "Rejection, Nevada". When the story begins, seventeen miners of the terrible "Graboids" are killed. Some of the characters in the current "Tremors" films have ancestors, both figurative and literal, in the past. Most obvious is the ever-returning Michael Gross (like Hiram Gummer). Unlike his descendant, Mr. Gross unable with firearms; so he hires gunslings Billy Drago (like "Black Hand" Kelly) to shoot them up some "Dirt Dragons". <br /> <br /> This takes some accustomed to getting used to - as it does in the distant past. It is like a western with miniature versions of the original movie's monster "Graboids". These tamer "Dirt Dragons" are not as close as terrorizing as their "Tremors" (1990) colleagues. Consequently, the characters in this movie use a horrible mass of time on the ground, which would not have happened in the original film. And it was strange to get the citizens to give the fight so fast when Gross decides to leave town. Why so helpless? Why did Brent Roam (like Juan Pedilla) immediately burn the people to fight without Gross? Disappointing. <br /> <br /> **** Tremors 4: The Legend Begins (2004) S.S. Wilson ~ Michael Gross, Brent Roam, Billy Drago
