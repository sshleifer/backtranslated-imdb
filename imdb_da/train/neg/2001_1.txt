Why were there so many people penetrating an evening showing Roberto Moreira's "Up Against Them All" at the San Francisco Film Festival? "It's about a hitman," my friend said. "Well ... and it's Brazilian," I added. Beautiful multicolored people, tropical weather, lush rhythms and a hip gangster plot? There is no doubt about anyone. <br /> <br /> Someone forgot to tell us a little detail: This is a very bad movie, really awful and so uncomfortable to see, as it is badly made. <br /> <br /> So how in the world has "Contra Todos" got the rounds of Berlin, Melbourne, London, Manila, Stockholm, Cairo, Chicago, many smaller local festivals, and now San Francisco? Apparently because of the way the advertising process and film festival circuit works. <br /> <br /> First of all, it won the first prize at the Rio Film Festival, where it was called the Best Brazilian Film of the Year. It must have been a bad year; they have had much, much better. Next, you see creeping synopses in catalogs plus imaginary buzz that leads to overcrowded auditoriums and - as the film does not exist anywhere and then avoids close criticism of critics - it continues with the rounds. <br /> <br /> Festival blurbs aimed at promotion sometimes goose it up a lot. A Chicago Festival is called "Contra Todos" "a speedball cocktail shot straight out of Brazil" and referred to Claudia's boyfriend as "stud in slum-like neighborhood." Soninha is "Teodoros nymph-like teenage daughter of budding sexuality." The movie is "shot with a frequent handheld camera" and the director "creates a genuine and reliable sense of frustration worn by domestic desperation and decay." The effect is "unbearably raw and honest", and the film hurt "against a conclusion that dead-ended as the life on the screen." Not the best writing, but it really causes the excitement of a particular kind of potential viewer. <br /> <br /> "Contra Todos" refers to a hit man, two hit men indeed and one wife and daughter and one born-again Christian lover. It's shot - in execrably ugly digital video with no talent behind the camera - mostly in a creepy stack of suburbs rather than in one of the captivating "favelas" or village-like Brazilian lapels, where such amazing movies as "Black Orpheus", " Pixote "and" City of God "were made, and not in Rio this time, but São Paulo. <br /> <br /> The hassle with family problems is Teodoro (Giulio Lopez) and his partner with a drug problem is Waldomiro (Ailtan Graça). Both actors have a small television experience, just like the actor who plays Teodoro's final blonde wife Cláudia (Leona Cavalli) and Silvia Lorenço, who plays her pouting, ready-to-rebel daughter Soninha. These actors can do it through the backward corners of a few telecom vendors. Who knows? - In a better directed movie they can even be good. Except for them, there are some young men who are hit by Teordoro or, when he is busy bashing bullies. The principles do not work much presence, although the camera enlarges their pores. <br /> <br /> A few observers, one at the Berlin Festival and one in London, saw the film's flaws, but unfortunately they are 'buried in the internet. Henry Sheehan noted from Berlin that "movies" (his quotes) were "the worst of the video images" shown. "The filmmaker seems to have chosen video simply because it was a cheap alternative to movies," wrote Sheehan, "and has made no creative use of the new medium" - nor does he add anything else creative. /> <br /> Sheehan pointed out the movie's first big mistake: "Starting as a homely drama to blow up, when half an hour in action, Moreira shows that the father and one of his friends are professional hit men. The thirty minutes adds nothing to the movie, it seems like a perfect arbitrary decision and is at least a waste of time, but ratcheting up is everything Moreira ever does as a small child who has got a tool kit for her birthday and goes around with Turn everything into sight without rhyme, reason or skill. "Destructive, but true. <br /> <br /> Writing about the 2004 London Festival for Kamera.com, Metin Alsanjak tried to look at the positive side, yet gave away the lack of redeeming features by calling the performance "light movie's best feature." Yes, very easy, because everything else is so bad. Alsanjak admitted that "this low-budget, violent and seedy account of the lawless in Sao Paulo is without any similar characters and as a result of hope. Too dark and cynical to be a tale of human condition, the film is not helped by poor subtitles. . "Alsanjaks connects Contra Todos to" Dogme "and Mike Leigh didn't help. <br /> <br /> Except for the pointless first half hour when nothing is upset about waiting for the first acts of violence - which, when they come, is just "banging everything in sight without rhyme, reason or skill" - Moreira samples wise to redeem his sudden finale by adding what seems to be outtakes right after that, followed by an improvisable ironic ending scene where one of the characters gets married No doubt the director wanted to exhibit the "evil of evil" of low-lying hit men in the working class neighborhoods, but he cannot make the characters he sees generic live for us. And the film's structure shows that he also cannot edit his material. <br /> <br /> (Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on April 28, 2005.)
