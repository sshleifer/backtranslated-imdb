This movie is so bad I can't believe it was actually shot. People who voted 10 or 9, 8 and even 7, are you crazy? Did we really see the same movie? Or the same should I say. Everything is bad in this movie. The story (is there a story?) Nowhere, completely incoherent, does the actor (some dialogues are simply ridiculous), the music score (what is **** it?), Editing and especially the artistic direction, a pure disaster. Reminds me of the old Macist films ... To give you an example of the production's amateurism, the mermaid's costume is a sleeping bag with buckles on it. I'm not funny, that's exactly it. <br /> <br /> Another example of the huge errors we find here: In a scene we see an extra, a fat woman of about 200 pounds, who talks about her cell phone. The next shot, which is in a completely different location, you can see the same woman, still talking on her mobile phone (!) Yes, it goes so far. <br /> <br /> A big, big waste of money. Useless.
