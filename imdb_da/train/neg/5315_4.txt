Coal, the spacecraft's spacecraft, manages to hijack a space shuttle and flee to the forest in America, along with a new found friend trying to escape from "Alienator" to a female cyborg killer. Made a year after Best movie by Fred Olen Ray's career, "Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers", this can't be done but feels like a bit of dulling. Just as low budget as the previous movie, but not as fun as I had with it. None of the players really stood on me. The film is okay for the discriminating viewer during a rainy Saturday afternoon, but it is pretty much all that is good for. <br /> <br /> My character: D + <br /> Where I saw it: Showtime Thriller
