Envy stars some of the best. Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler and the great Christopher Walken. With such a cast you can only expect the best. But with "Envy" no one could save this disaster. <br /> <br /> Tim Dingman (Stiller) and Nick Vanderpark (Black) are best friends and colleagues at a sandpaper factory. Both make a decent living, but because Tim has better workplace performance, he can afford more than his buddy Nick. Nick is a dreamer who always comes up with new ideas for inventions. One day Nick comes up with the idea of ​​a spray container that makes the dog's poop disappear (yes, I'm serious). To fall in love with the idea, Nick really decides to perceive this product. He offers Tim to invest in his idea and share the profit 50/50. Tim refuses to believe that the idea will never work. <br /> <br /> Nick's invention "va-poo-rize" (again, I'm serious) ends up earning millions. He enjoys spending his money on things like a much larger house, a horse, a personal trainer and fancy deserts. Tim begins to feel the envy of nick Therefore the name of the movie. <br /> <br /> The concept is not bad, but it still shows terrible. This movie contains some of the worst dialogues and very bad performances from all cast. So again, as I mentioned earlier, none of them could save this mess. Not even the great Christoper Walken, who played a homeless character called "J-man", made this movie fun. The film is bad from the start and only gets worse. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie if: * you like crap (no saying is calculated) * you want to see Jack Black in a white tux <br /> <br /> I say avoid this movie for any price but avoid special if: * you are offended by the bathroom humor * you love animals
