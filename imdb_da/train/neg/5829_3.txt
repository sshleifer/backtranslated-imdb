I watched this movie as an example of a Matthew Barney art exhibition. It certainly prepared me. I have almost skipped the exhibition, and in retrospect it must have enough. <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that the score is large (Bjork) and the photography rich and colorful, the content was mostly boring and predictable. Gee, I really needed to see someone wearing pearls to find out what the pearl divers were up to. The film was mostly a silly mix of Japanese cultural references and industrial images of modern whaling technology used in a mock hunting / harvesting. The movie "peaks" with enough gratuitous shock-type to make your stomach. <br /> <br /> What was the meaning of the movie? While others may argue that it is an anti-whaling, one might even argue that it somehow justifies whaling. Personally, I think it was Barney's attempt to "blink" the audience with his anal, fecal, self-motivation and cannibalistic fetishes. Study: Unless you really go out on Barney's art, don't bother to watch this movie. The message is unclear, the pace slow and the cultural references pretentious. If you are after shock-type, you will do better with one of the many "Undead" movies or hunt down an old copy of Hustler and take a fecal cartoon.
