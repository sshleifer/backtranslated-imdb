This is a very bad movie. I laughed once or twice and the story sucks! There might be a fun joke, it's stupid, and it's boring. Throughout the short film, I fell asleep and wondered when it would end. <br /> <br /> No people and everyone seems stupid and ridiculous. Rob Schneider, acting as an animal, is not something I would pay to see. It looked fun, but the bottom line: DO NOT WASTE YOU IN THIS EASY AND STUPID FILE. <br /> <br /> I was wondering when it was going to end, even if it's a short movie. In the beginning, we thought it would be better; But it gets worse. Stupid, all the way to the end. I went out of the theater and I will remember the movie as extremely bad forever. <br /> <br /> The author and co-author of this movie is a Simpsons television writer, but it's not like The Simpsons (this movie sucks !!!)
