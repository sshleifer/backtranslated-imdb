Oh, the infamous "Guinea Pig" series ... I must honestly say that I have been disappointed as a whole by this whole series ("He never dies", "Mermaid in a manhole" and "Flower of flesh and blood" are the exceptions ... and even those are not big in any way ...) but the "devil's experiment" just beats. There is no realistic appearance here, except for the climax (or perhaps anti-climatic, depending on how you look). The victim seems to not really worry about what is going on and hardly whines or falls while being exposed to "hideous" (more often even "hilarious") torture. "Flower of flesh and blood" is a more violent and gymnastic depiction of false "snus" material, but that film also falls flat on the level of realism. I welcome the Japanese to push the boundaries, and they have really come a long way in the last two decades to wear the crown in "extreme" film making, but "Devil's Experiment" just doesn't hold up. Worth to see if you are hard-hitting if you have no reason other than to see what the fuss is about, but I can only give this movie a very generous 3/10 and that's only for the needle's transparency scene ...
