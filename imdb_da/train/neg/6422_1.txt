"I just watched this movie last night, and I don't think I'll ever think of the same thing about any of the actors involved because this movie will keep me behind." <br /> <br /> The aforementioned statement can be considered a good or a bad thing. I think every time I watch Tom Cruise or Demi Moore in a movie, I think of "A few Good Men", which is a good thing. Now, every time I see Ron Perlman or Kristy Swanson, I want to think of "Tinseltown", which is a very bad thing. <br /> <br /> I picked it up and thought it might be something intelligent or at least make me chuckle and with Arye Gross and the aforementioned Swanson and Perlman, I thought at least it wouldn't be bad. You could tell the movie was made on a budget the size of Wheeling, Indiana (Where? Exactly.) But maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie. ERROR. <br /> <br /> This movie is NOT fun or entertaining in any word. It's just there and lasts for 84 uncomfortable slow minutes. The people are paper thin. You are almost worried about the NONE of the characters, and as the leaders are two, Hollywood writers struggle with a dream, all of the two struggling writers with a dream writing this, you need to know about them. Okay, the two real writers know all about there on-screen versions of themselves so they figure out so do the audience. They do not even think of character development, except trying to tie the story back to "Gilligan's Island". <br /> <br /> The reason is unoriginal. Two guys live in a storage center where one of them stores a bed, and there are also about 20 other people there. The rest of the story is constructed and stupid. Have you seen "National Lampoon's Favorite Deadly Sins"? The second story with Joe Mantegna is about a television writer who can't find a good story to make a TV movie so he creates one. Now replace the TV writer for a screenwriter, morph Mantegna into annoying actors half of his age, and take away the comedy and you have this movie. The actors are trying. Kristy Swanson is in the movie for maybe 10 minutes and still offers the best performance in the movie. She is still warm, but it would help if she really wanted STAR in a movie instead of constantly making CAMEOS. As for everyone else, I do not think it was the actors' fault because they have BAD material. <br /> <br /> Go on National Lampoon's movie but stay away from this movie.
