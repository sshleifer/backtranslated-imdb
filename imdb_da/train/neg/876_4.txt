Until the last 20 minutes I thought this might be Jackie Han's worst movie (with the exception of his work before 1978, which I am not familiar with). The final battle sequence changed everything: it is long and good and intense - yes one of the highlights of Han's career. But to get to that, you have to go through a lot of "comedy" that can entertain five-year-olds (oh, see! Someone threw a tomato on the guy's face) and endless "football scenes". Not to mention dubbing (which includes the line "How can I turn it off? It's not a tap" - look to find out what it refers to). "Dragon Lord" is worth renting for the final match alone, but the rest of the movie is only for Jackie collectors, and even then only for those who have already seen at least 15 of his other films.
