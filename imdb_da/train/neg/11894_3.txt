KING KONG VS. GODZILLA (1963, which I remember having judged BOMB) had been my introduction to cult director Honda's work; this is not necessarily better ?? It's just that I've learned to be more tolerant of such a low-cost fare! <br /> <br /> In fact, we get two Kongs for the price of one: An ugly and drowsy giant monkey and a robot variant of what looks even worse! The simian creature lives on the island of Mondo (!) ?? where it is shown to fight with a few other monsters and befriend a trio of people. Of course, it falls to the blonde (and bland) heroine; In fact, more exciting is a femme fatality in cahoots with the movie's crooked crazy genius ?? called Dr. Who and sporting the anemic look and gown usually associated with a vampire! <br /> <br /> He kidnaps King Kong and hypnotizes it to retrieve Element X, which is embedded in the icy North Pole waste; apparently the giant monkey is more opaque to radiation than its mechanical counterpart (and to ensure its full co-operation, which itself captures its three 'companions')! The female agent then has heart change, helps the heroes (one of them is typically an innocent American) and is killed by Who. King finally flies and makes it to Tokyo, where it has a final showdown with the robot. The doctor flies the subsequent chaos in his under ?? who at a request from Kong's dream girl is summed up the waste of the giant monkey.
