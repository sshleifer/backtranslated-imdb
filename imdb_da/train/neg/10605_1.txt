This was a terrible waste of my time. No plot. The play was so far below par, it was to be used as an example in acting classes about what NOT to do. It is only a commercial rip-off of the former Universal Soldier, which also scrapes the bottom of the working barrel. It is sad that the CEO needs to claim his ego every few years, and even more sad that people will pay good money to sit through it. This kind of schlock gives the Martial Arts movie a bad name. For comparison, it makes Segall, Norris, and Arnold look almost talented. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the CEO should take Leslie Nielson's track and send his genres. At least we could laugh at him instead of him.
