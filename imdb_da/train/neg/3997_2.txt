After spotting the high rating on IMDb I decided to watch this movie. In addition to the high rating, I intentionally avoided reading any of the reviews. I wanted to go into the theater with a clean slate without knowing the plot or having predetermined expectations. <br /> <br /> Given my review you can see that I was disappointed. I enjoyed the development of the main character Mike Enslin. I also enjoyed how the hotel manager tried to talk him out of entering the hotel room. When Enslin came into the room, I was ready for some scary things. <br /> <br /> First chocolate appears on the pillow and the toilet paper is folded. Ensl responds in a credible way. He's freaked out. I am encouraged and think of myself, it will be good. The people who made this movie understand that less is more. <br /> <br /> But that's what happens, it was a big disappointment. Subtleness is quickly replaced by the predictable shotgun approach ... Just blast the audience with every Hollywood scary trick in the book and hope something works. Let's see, a watch radio that comes on by itself? Well, it's always scary. Objects moving around the room? Well, you can't complain about it. Blood drips from the walls and the sink? Great. Ghosts Who Commit Suicide? Well. Anything else? What about loud sounds, shakes, fire, more tremors, shaking up in the room, more blood, etc. It's all good. And that has all been done before. Over-stimulate our attention deficit Disordered audience with many different things in quick succession and they cannot ignore. <br /> <br /> It didn't work for me. And you know what else? When I watch a horror movie in a theater, it is typically hearing several groups of girls in the audience shouting in fear of scary moments. But this movie had no scary moments. The audience was silent and uninterested. I felt no chill down on my spine. Nothing. The Shining was 100x what this movie is trying to be. So who are all those people who say it's one of the best horror movies ever? Friends of the instructor? Sorry, I just don't understand.
