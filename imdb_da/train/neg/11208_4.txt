Raymond Burr stars as a lawyer trapped in the murder of his best friend (Dick Foran) thanks to his love for his friend (Angela Lansbury). It was a whole year before he started making Perry Mason, so the movie could be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his casting. There's not much else here, it's interesting though. Lansbury is always good, but her character here is very one-dimensional and the motives for her mystery crime are quite obvious. There is an interesting performance by Lamont Johnson as a painter who is also in love with "femme fatale", but the Burr character is quite straightforward. It is frankly bizarre to see an actor like Burr doing these romantic scenes with Lansbury, and his stopover does not match his character much as it does in most movies I have seen him in. There is no mystery at all. and the whole excitement must be about the film's title and the way Burr's character creates Lansbury character to involve himself (double danger prevents her from being tried again for the original murder, presumably). He does it with a very large tape recorder, which she does not notice when she enters the room I believe. <br /> <br /> A few maybe accidentally funny moments and basically the rest of the matter could have been done for TV.
