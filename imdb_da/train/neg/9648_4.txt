Vipul Shah has done some really impressive work as a film producer in the past. 'Waqt - The Race Against Time' and 'Namaste London' were entertaining and interesting to watch. 'Singh Is Kinng' was fun that he produced. His latest outing as a filmmaker 'London Dreams' comes up as his career's weakest fare. 'London Dreams' has a mediocre story, it's about how success becomes friendship to hate. Approved, it has the potential, but when you see the 'London Dreams' you wonder what happens? This movie may have the worst climax in recent times. The Vipul Shah author puts down the Vipul Shah director. <br /> <br /> The first hour is boring, the second hour is better; but again the climax is terrible. How can someone forgive someone who decided to destroy you? I do not want to. Ajay Devgn suddenly decides to travel to India and ask for his bladder mate, thanks to his uncle Om Puri. When he reaches India, he welcomes Salman with band baja and says he was the cause of the whole failure? Was Vipul Shah's intention to show Salman's character as a GOD? If yes than you have failed completely. The only question I want to ask Vipul Shah is, would you welcome someone who destroyed you with such a great reception? Write what you feel, let's not fool us, we are sensible enough to understand what is good or not. <br /> <br /> This is a musical, but Shankar-Eshaan-Loy's music is horrible. Not a single song remains in your mind. <br /> <br /> Salman is awesome though. He carries the film on his shoulders and does it really well in the emotional scenes. But again, his character is shown as a GOD, which makes him look like a retard in the end. Ajay is just as good, but Salman has overshadowed him completely. Asin is wasted, and what is a great talent like About Puri in this movie? Rannvijay ham, although Aditya Roy Kapoor excels. Brinda Parekh is okay as a vamp. <br /> <br /> Overall, this dream is still a dream!
