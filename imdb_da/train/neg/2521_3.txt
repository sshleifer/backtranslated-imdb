There are a number of issues with this movie, but the bottom line is that it was trying to do too much with too little. The basic story is quite good, but the money just wasn't there to make the story fair. The non-existent budget really killed this movie. Stuart Gordon (author / director) has written credit at 'Honey, In Shrunk the Kids', which was a box office smash. But that movie had some serious cash from Disney. Honestly, this is a good example of when to make a movie. Had he waited a few years, the technology would have made it cheaper to do many of the effects. (Not to mention he could have found a company with money.)
