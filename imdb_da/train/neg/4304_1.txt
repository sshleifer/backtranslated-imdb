This is an anti-Serbian propaganda movie made for television. <br /> <br /> "The Muslims are good, the Orthodox Christian Serbs are bad." <br /> <br /> That's the message. <br /> <br /> Using "entertainment" to cross a propaganda message is nothing new. <br /> <br /> This film puts it thick. </ br /> <br /> Apparently, many viewers and reviewers are running it. <br /> <br /> I know better. Serbs, under General Draza Milhalovitch and his Chetniks, rescued over 500 shot down US refugees from the Germans in World War II. <br /> <br /> Churchill decided to betray Milhalovitch and set British backdrop behind Communist Tito. Roosevelt followed suit and, as a result, Yugoslavia was surrendered after the transition to Communist Tito. <br /> <br /> Since then, the US Allied Milhalovitch has been lubricated by the media. <br /> <br /> This film is part of the anti-Serbian propaganda campaign developed by George Soros and his international crisis group (ICG), culminating in the Kosovo "war", where Serbia was bombed by NATO on the grounds of completely false claims by the ICG of "mass graves" in Kosovo filled with "victims" of the ugly Serbs. The fact that there were no such mass graves and the Albanians (Muslims) had no business in Serbia Kosovo is the fact that most media will not print. <br /> <br /> I chose this movie to watch because a phrase description on the video tape is so interesting. <br /> <br /> Imagine my disgust when I discovered that I was being fooled into hiring another branch of the propaganda machine aimed at Serbia. <br /> <br /> Instead of this propaganda, a film must be made that the Clinton administration's unwillingness is clean with Congress and with the American people about its involvement in the delivery of Iranian weapons to the Muslim government in Sarajevo. <br /> <br /> I don't want to hold my breath and wait for such a movie.
