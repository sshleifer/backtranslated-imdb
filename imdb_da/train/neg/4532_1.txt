My husband and I bought the Old School Sesame Street DVDs for our daughter and I have to say I don't let her see the new episodes on TV because I find ALL characters annoying. Baby Bear And Telly? OMGHOS, How ANNOYING and useless blabber can anyone think of their "sketches"? Elmo? Give it peace, not all children like him again, annoying and do not teach my child anything. Mr. Noodle? what a rejection I think when I hit the new show for her, she and I became stupid than before. The show has certainly taken the wrong turn. I remember Yip Yips, Kermit's Breaking News, 1-2 2 little dolls, Mumford The Magician, Bert and Ernie, Grover the Waiter, all the great educational sketches of the old school SS Sesame Street have some direct boredom and stupidity since Jim Henson's passing in 1990. The view no longer has the educational, fun and interactive sketches it used. I find the new versions simply tirelessly annoying and full of useless non-educational blabber. Way to go S.S. Manufacturers / Writers You have another cartoon-like show for the parents to sit there without creative, non-practiced children in front so they come out of their hair. Per Producers / Authors: I suggest you whip out the old muppets and start losing similar content to the first Sesam Street. Lord, I know for sure that my child should not talk like Baby Bear or Elmo.
