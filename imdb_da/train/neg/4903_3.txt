I'm never a big fan of Taiwan movie production as opposed to Korean, Hong Kong or even China. Strong recording qualities are hardly found in them as clearly shown in this film. I do not regard myself as difficult to please the audience as I am actually a fan of indie movies. But this movie shows a weak plot and slow pace. I found myself lost in the middle, where the plot goes. The actor certainly doesn't make it better. Rainie's plays are subspecies as she 'over-act', trying to be perky and sweet. Although I have to admit, she is a pleasure to watch. Isabella Leong, on the other hand, plays a more appropriate role as a confused, sad, enchanting, extremely reserved character. Overall I find this movie a disappointment.
