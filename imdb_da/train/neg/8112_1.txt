Hanna-Barbera sucks the life out of another famous property. The violence is the water, the stories are formal, the animation is bad, the music is unpleasant and repetitive, and frankly it's just not fun. <br /> <br /> At that time, HB put each of its series through the same clich√© situations, whether or not it fits the comic world. Thus, Popeye and Bluto look back in a recurring segment like the cavemen ("Hey! Popeye is popular, and Flinstones are popular. Put them together and you can't miss!"). Also in a seemingly ripoff of "Private Benjamin", Olive Oyl and Goon have a regular segment that has them as new armed forces. Seriously! Why? <br /> <br /> The addition to the annoyance factor is the publication publications in each episode (standard practice at the time of comics but still annoying). Popeye refines his nephews to cross the street safely, recycle and - are you ready for this? - the dangers of smoking! (I swear I won't make it up.) The only charm left from the original cartoons is that Jack Mercer, Popeye's early days voice, continues the role here. <Br /> <br /> Worth checking once just to get a new understanding of the old Fleischer shorts. Otherwise, avoid at all costs.
