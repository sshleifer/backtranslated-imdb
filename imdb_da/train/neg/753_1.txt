Wow ... I picked this up at the local Wal-Mart after reading online that it had been released early. I've been following this online for a while and just had to buy the movie. <br /> <br /> Wow ... I guess what really hit me was editing, or lacking it. At times, signs (usually the narrator and the one he is with) appear to go ... and go ... and go. I'm not an editor, but I know you can cut between someone who leaves point A to show those arriving at point B. There's no need to show almost the whole journey! Wow ... I actually ended up feeling a little sorry for the actors involved. They seem to have got some direction on what to do during scenes, except to look scared or look happy, depending on what action to add later. <br /> <br /> Wow ... <br /> <br /> Why was it decided to make almost all the effects using CG is beyond me. Even ILM even uses thumbnails sometimes. One of the most distracting uses of green screen in this movie is the constant urgency of (according to final credits) the same group of people representing the citizens of different cities, including London. At times, these crowds come without regard to the angle of the shot or the distance from the camera. In a shot in London there seems to be at least two men over six feet long just behind the narrator's brother (played by star Anthony Piana without his distracting mustache). Not since GETTYSBURG I have seen such a false piece of facial hair. <br /> <br /> Wow ... Why Timothy Hines spoke up on this movie as he did is over me. It's a turkey, clean and simple. On the plus side (at least for me) it has given some of the most real scary bits of hilarity I've seen for a while.
