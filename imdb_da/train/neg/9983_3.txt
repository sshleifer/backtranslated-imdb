This movie is a massive Yawn proving that Americans have not been hung by farce. Even when it's already written for them! The original movie "The Head Over Water" is a witty comedy of error that I would judge 8/10. It's not just about a linguistic translation, but some absurd event chains are skipped completely and reveal the movie of its original clever pharisic nature and make it a cheap "oops that goes my pants" style of farce.
