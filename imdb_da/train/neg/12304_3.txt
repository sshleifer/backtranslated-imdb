I saw this movie last week and had the biggest laugh I've had for a long time. The plot of the movie is rather stupid and convoluted in a poorly designed way. The only plus in the film is Corey Savier's stunning abs. Alexandra Paul (I think it's her name) is horrible as the preacher's wife has a history of depression. Ted McKenzie is gross and his character is a twit on it all. And as if the fact that you think she has sex with her son is not enough, they throw in unnecessary scissors solos at every opportunity! The end and climax of this movie is absolutely abysmal and also ridiculous. I mean, who in the hell will carry the baby by a boy who tried to make you believe he was your son and that you had an incestuous relationship with him!
