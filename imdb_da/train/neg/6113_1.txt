I screamed my head away because watching that movie was my first movie experience ever on some 13 months old. I remember it was incredibly bloody and it made me angry. I saw it again on television some years ago. Big mistake - the play is wood, the plot is not present and the film lacks profit unless 23-year-old T & A is what goes on ... 0 / ****
