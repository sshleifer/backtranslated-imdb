When I first saw this movie, it was termed TERROR ON A TRAIN and was the back half of a dual function. Glenn Ford, a reinforcement expert is encouraged to mitigate a hidden bomb on a train loaded with high syringes. The voltage is slow and stable; and this black-and-white movie runs only in an hour and twelve minutes. All these years later on television; The thrill and drama has lost most of its influence. This is still a good movie as far as the early 50's standards go. <br /> <br /> Along with Ford are Anne Vernon and Maurice Denham. The villain / saboteur is played by Victor Maddern.
