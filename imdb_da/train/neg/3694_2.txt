This is undoubtedly Rajnikanth's worst movie ever. The first part is held in place with solid comedy from Goundamani, but it gradually gets worse and worse and completely illogical. Our hero also takes a grave by saints of the same name (Baba) through a corny and completely paralyzed one-liner. The first half, Rajni has pronounced his usual selection of onliners and style and in the second half becomes a quasi-saint, after a beggar takes him through an interdimensional portal to the Himalayas, where Babaji (not the famous saints he took to former) He special forces without apparent reason (except karma). This really starts to be interesting now isn't it? <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is about him wasting his magic boons and powers and fighting for politicians and related black magic. The usual predictable crap with hilarious implementation. Oh, and the black magic has never worked on our hero because he just happened to have a Param Vir ... there .... Shakti Chakra with him. The evil guys and the usual politician villains are clich√©d, overtime and ultimately totally insignificant to the plot which itself does not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> However, despite all the flaws, killing time with and shouting Baba-related one-liners during public events was fun. It's also fun to see other curses about this movie. AR Rehman is said to have composed the tracks for his movie through the mobile phone. It was so important he considered it. <br /> <br /> Rajni is very popular in Japan and he has included two characters (one of them is called Keiko ... why not Samsung?) Of Japanese origin in this movie just because of it. But the way they are portrayed, dressed and treated is completely pathetic. The Japanese can stop seeing Rajni movies after watching it. This movie was probably promotional material for Rajni who entered the policy, but the results of the film itself would have struck some of his political dreams. Fun if you turn your brain off.
