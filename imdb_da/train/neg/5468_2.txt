I absolutely love the "Toxic Avenger" series, but this weak offer from the Troma people didn't make any sense and it made me yawn all the time. <br /> <br /> A delicious nuclear power plant (and the growing weeds beside it) make the kids of Tromaville High go nuts, causing them to join a gang, have sex, explode and anything. There's also some kind of monster breeding in high school ... my God, this movie is a mess. The players stopped virtually their efforts after this and they were supposed to. The (intentional) overactivation started to get on my nerves in about 5 minutes ... Disappointing. 10.2.
