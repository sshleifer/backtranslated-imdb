On the remote burner this year (so it was reported), this TV reunion of two of the most beloved characters in the sitcom story started badly - and went straight downhill from there. Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and her best friend Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) meet in New York after a long alienation and catch each other's lives. What a new concept! But sad to relate, there is nothing worth talking about (let alone making a movie), happened in any of them in the intervening years. So instead, the script contains throwing a large old plot unit after another (most dealing with older women in the workplace) while completely missing out on the peculiar charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner. The support aids are immediately forgettable, humor is non-existent, and the chemistry that Moore and Harper once had is gone. Moore allegedly claims this project for years and is waiting for "just the right script" before she commits. If this was the one she considered "real", what on earth were those she failed to do? It is not the age of the characters who do this (currently inevitably going forward), but the almost complete lack of imagination combined with a blatant disregard for the elements that did the series work. At one time it was supposed to be a pilot, but it was not possible to create interest among potential sponsors. Or for that matter, among potential audiences. The movie is quickly and mercifully forgotten, and it is a travesty and an insult to a classic.
