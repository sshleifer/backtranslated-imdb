This feature of the new DORIS DAY COLLECTION does not really have to be included as she is only in the movie for less than 30 minutes. However, what she does is shine when she is on the screen. The closest plot of smaller movie is just an excuse to show off some Warner contractors of the day. JANCIE REGEL shows promise and it is a shame that she was not a big star. RUTH ROMAN handles the role of "go-getter" with aplomb. Better if this was in color. Travis Air Force base locations with some rear projection work well. What is best about the movie is some fantastic musical interludes. If you've been thanking your happy stars and Hollywood CANTEEN, you like this one.
