The good soil is perhaps the most boring movie I've seen in my life. The reason is slow and lacking. The play is borderline comic. While I love Paul Muni, I can now say that I have seen a movie that does not do its true ability justice. The only saving grace I found with this movie is its production value. The use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very credible and interesting environment. Also, the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps sell easily and were revolutionary at the time. Besides the production value, I can say something else that is good or entertaining about this movie.
