Of all the movies (and I'm a film student, if it's worth it to you), it's the WORST movie I've ever seen. I know there are probably some worse out there that I just haven't seen yet, but I've seen this and it's the worst. A friend and I rented it one night because Denise Richards was at the front. Talk about being young and retarded. She is unredited! Her role was incredibly small! How did she do it on the front page? IMDb does not even mention it in her filmography. This movie was so bad we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it and threw it into the case. It reads something like "please save your additional customers from having to see this complete and totally bad movie!"
