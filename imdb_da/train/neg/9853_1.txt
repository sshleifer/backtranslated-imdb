I think most people will believe that extraordinary things exist and this movie shows no restraint in trying to fully exploit it. The presentation is very interesting, well presented and the graphics are state of the art, but from a scientific point of view it just doesn't work. Water-filled flying bladders? They should be the size of a Mack truck to be useful. And then there is the ever-present possibility of a catastrophic explosion. I have no problem with imagination, just try not to transfer it as a matter of fact. Some people will always misunderstand. All in all, the movie is entertaining, but I have always found myself saying "Oh brother, what strain ....". If you want a FAKE documentary, see this is spinal loss instead. Or at least turn off the sound.
