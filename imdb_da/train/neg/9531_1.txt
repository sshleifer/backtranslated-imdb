This is a horrible movie. Two demented young women seduce and torture a middle-aged man. There is not much to give away with regard to a plot or a "spoiler". I just want to comment that the end is almost the most prominent part of the girl. Much of the movie uncomfortably involves Locke and Camp cackling, all the while shining psychotically at the camera. Add to this a soundtrack that is repeated over and over, including a vaudevillian song about "dear old father" that suggests an incestuous quality that the viewer never really sees. The music is annoying at first, so end up exposing the viewer to a torture worse than the one depicted on the screen. The theme here is of youth signs amok, understandable as a reaction to the 60s, but done with little imagination or style. Avoid it!
