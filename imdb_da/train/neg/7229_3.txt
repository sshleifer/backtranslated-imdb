This movie seems to start in the middle, introducing peripheral players as if they were significant and presenting protagonists without substance and paper-thin and / or impenetrable back stories. Almost no one has a credible or visible motivation for their actions in this movie. The plot rambles and eventually goes nowhere, the dialogue is clunky and thin and the director has a little concept on how to get the best out of his actors. It almost feels like there is a first half of this movie, but it was never made. <br /> <br /> We are told that a mysterious pyramid has emerged over New York City and that Central Park has inexplicably become an arctic wasteland. Nevertheless, none of this seems to have caused much of the population and is only of minimal concern to the government. <br /> <br /> We are presented with the "evil company" in eugenics, but it's really just a convenient option to fill the universe with a few power-tripping minions. The entire "Eugenics-is-bad" double-entender is heavy-handed and never really brings out here. We must take care of the key characters, but we never learn enough about them to know why. So much about this world is underdeveloped or completely undeveloped that it comes out as a 1-hour, 40-minute fatalistic rationalization for rape. On the "groundbreaking" digital animated world created here, all I can say is that at about the same time this movie was made, several other directors did the same with more seamless and credible results. <br /> <br /> After spending time watching this movie, the most burning issue left in my mind was "So What?"
