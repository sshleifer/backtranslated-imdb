I'm a big fan of Troma, but I can't figure out why they bought the rights to this movie. It's so boring that I felt like I was watching for 3 hours. Some where on the plot it says "but what Satan doesn't know he's stuck with annoying tourists" Now they didn't seem to disturb him in the movie, just me. The only good thing about this movie is the actor who plays Satan, I like bad movies, but it was just boring.
