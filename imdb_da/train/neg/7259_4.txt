This is definitely one of Weirder 70's movies out there, and it's most remarkable for kicking a decade of Bigfoot hysteria. It is also remarkable for the small touches of insanity throughout the film, especially when the dark, moody first half is replaced by a MUSICAL INTERLUDE of all things (as another user pointed out is one of the songs dedicated to a character, Travis Crabtree, paddling in a canoe for a while, then ... leaves, never to be seen again). Even though it is painfully dated now, I'm still a fun scary movie showing to kids, and anyone who enjoys either the Bigfoot Lore or the 70's Hillbilly culture has to get a kick out of it. My favorite part: A guy gets so scared that he jumps first of all through a door (!?) And the narrator explains that he unknowingly went from "shock". Uh, I mean breaking a door with the head is more likely why he went unconscious, but whatever. <br /> <br /> 4/10 stars or 7/10 if you like bad Americana.
