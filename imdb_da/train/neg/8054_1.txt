Oh dear, what a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Production was so cheap and creepy ... Remember the shot of "The Natural" where the lightning strikes the tree (leaving a glowing stub) that Roy Hobbs makes a bat from ?? Now the producers of this movie have used the same scene to prefix a scene where a tree branch slammed into the house. <br /> <br /> I wonder if they were paying to use The Natural's footage, or did they just hope no one would see the movie download it? <br /> <br /> At the end, where they tried to get away in the truck. Such overheads in the cabin. <br /> <br /> A really bad movie, a really bad movie.
