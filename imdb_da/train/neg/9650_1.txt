Maaan, where do I start with this god horrible movie. Bad bad bad story tale. I don't know what the director was thinking when he made this movie. Namaste London was quite an enjoyable movie to be honest ... even though the soundtrack was good. But in this one ..hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh .. a movie that must be a musical one .. the songs are sooo bad. AR Rahman should have been a music director. <br /> <br /> Considering two great actors, a much better work should have been done by the director. Although the first half sucks, the last 30 minutes of the movie is ok. Performances from Salman and Ajay hide the movie from being a total disaster. <br /> <br /> See if you have nothing better to do. The last good movie from Bollywood I watched (and I see a lot of them) is Dev D and Wake Up Sid.
