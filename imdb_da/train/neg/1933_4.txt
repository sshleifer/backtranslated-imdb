Final Score (an average of various classic movie properties - action, visual, creativity, payoff, humor, fun, ect): 4.3 (out of 10) <br /> <br /> Had "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" hit A few years ago, it would have seemed like a bold and serious new direction in Disney animation. But it comes just a year after the innovative and almost ingenious "The Emperor's New Groove" and marks a step back in releasing Disney from the repeating "Disney Formula". I'm a big fan of the feature length Disney animated movie. Must see them all love it or hate it. "Atlantis" is an animated throwback to "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" and similar live action sci-fi adventures from the 50s and 60s. The problem is that this version hardly contains an original idea. It feels like a remake of something even more than the actual Disney remakes (Tarzan, The Hunchback of Notre Dame). The characters are a little more than a horizontal clich√© of the usual suspects who typically unfold these types of movies (the oddball mechanic, the gung ho general, the sassy hard women). In addition to Milo Thatch (Fox) and Rourke (Garner), the support support is flat uncomfortable. The movie also suffers from the brief pace. Instead of throwing it into an epic story, Disney is very sorry about the usually short run time brushing over the possibilities of developing ... suspension, characters, something real. They drag us into this new and wonderful world and hardly let us have our babies. The awkward pace makes it sometimes confusing what is a relatively simple story. The animation is dark and dull and cheap. This thing looks like a merged Saturday morning cartoon. Let's hope they haven't forgotten that 2D traditional animations can still be wonderful. "Iron Giant" among other things showed it. Negatives: Visual, tempo and pure lack of originality. <br /> <br /> Positives: Probably the coolest death scene for a Disney villain for a long time. It's the creative highlight of the movie.
