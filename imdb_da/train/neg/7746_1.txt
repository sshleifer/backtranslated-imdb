Literally, every aspect of this science-fiction low-budget flick falls under the categories classified for its predecessors, contemporaries, and those to be followed. Bad special effects, a faint story, ridiculous amounts of blood and gore, annoying and pointless signs, all you can expect. "Attack of the Sabretooth" is about a new resort where proprietors are genetic engineering Smilodon cats for an attraction. Cats escape and start killing people, the guy running the show will save them and not warn the unsuspecting visitors about them, and there is a band of visitors and some staff who rebel and plan to kill cats. <br /> <br /> Special effects-wise, the movie is about an average achievement given its budget. Sabretooths is portrayed through poor CGI. It's amazing that the cats look more realistic in a tight, detailed shot rather than the longer, more distant images, where CGI is better hidden. Their attacks are ruthlessly bloody and unpleasant. Just as you would expect, they attack, rip off some arms and legs and walk very little back. This is part of the reason why the film falls into poor schlock. <br /> <br /> The reason and the signs are just as terrible. We have some college kids coming to the island and they are planning a scavenger hunt. And take it very, very seriously. Even so much as violating private property, manipulating security systems and stealing. Why do they take a simple game so seriously? Have I missed something? Was there money involved? Or were they sent to do so? I don't know I could hardly follow the movie. But it seemed to me that they just made it fun. Yet they went too far to normal. <br /> <br /> "Attack of the Sabretooth" is a very bad movie. Even for a low budget sci-fi flick, it is a very poor and cheap example. It will drill most viewers into tears, it may be appealing to some and will make you laugh and laugh all the way. And remember, this is not a comedy, this is a cheap horror flick, so it's not likely to be comical.
