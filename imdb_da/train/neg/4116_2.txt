My line map should explain it all, but I get it well. <br /> <br /> From the go, this movie seemed like an excessive soap opera, and it's all about what I can comment on. There were a few interesting scenes, like "the big one" that hit the middle of the movie, but wait, what's that? Earthquake * gasp *, wait a minute! It's Dante's Peak! Well, parts of it hit and hit. I can't believe how bad this movie was made, "borrow" scenes from other much better movies. One wonders what instructor thought the viewers are stupid enough to believe that large wooded mountain scenery can be found in downtown LA, ala Dante's Peak. <br /> <br /> My advisor, forget about Bond Wanna-be, Nash, in this movie and go to the right thing (again, someone from Dante's Peak randomly.) <br /> <br />
