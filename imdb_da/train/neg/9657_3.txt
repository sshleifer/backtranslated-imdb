1) I'm not a weapon expert, but even I can see the difference between US Army rifles in WWI and WWII. In movies we can see private individuals, armed with "M1 Garand" (invented in the year 1932!), Not authentic "1903 Springfield" (also "Silent Death"), which private user until the Second World War. Difference - M1 can load 1.5 times more ammunition and 3 times more fire frequency! M1 was semi-automatic, requiring Springfield recharging after each shot. A little difference?! 2) German army uniforms have also borrowed from 1940 years. Especially - helmets. German helmets until the end of WWI have significant pike on top, we can't see another in film. And if we do a little extra searching in archives - how much true is this "true story"? I am surprised how much "truthful" can be film directors in the pursuit of cheap spread.
