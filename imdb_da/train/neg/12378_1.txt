Creepy and sleazy wolf. The young "Red" has full makeup and extremely short shorts and cape. Got about 20 minutes through and realized it could be a pedophile dream that came true. The "Up-beat" music sounds a lot like something I wanted to hear at a strip club. In fact, I think this movie is a sick joke - it's not a family movie. Gross, glad I saw this with my daughter, I don't want her to think it's normal for families to watch quasi kiddie porn together. Very bad, very sorry it is sold as a family movie, Joey Fatone would probably be embarrassed that he was in it. And how about advertising it as a "special effects spectacular" ??? The effects look low budget, terrible.
