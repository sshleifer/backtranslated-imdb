This movie was exactly what I expected to be when I first read the casting. I might have written a more exciting plot, it's a shame they left it for a pack of Howler Monkeys. Alberto Tomba was definitely a good skier, but he must also thank God (and we too) for not having to rely on his acting skills to earn his living. He can't play, he can't talk, he can't even move very well on the mainland without his skis ... Michelle Hunziker is a beautiful blonde girl and that's all. She was, of course, not chosen for her amazing skills in dramatic roles, but probably for her fine legs. Nevertheless, I must admit that she could be Tomba's acting teacher, for he is even a worse actor than her, and it is fun, especially given that she is not Italian. I laughed all the time and watched this movie. I found it so ridiculous and pointless that it actually made me laugh out loud, very loudly.
