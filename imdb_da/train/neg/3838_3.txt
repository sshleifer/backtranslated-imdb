Terry West had a good idea about this movie. He just didn't meat it through. There are endless images of the creepy look that the school's outdoor sports are continuing forever and probably to dampen the movie's running time. Also in this school there are only 2 students. Misty Mundae is good as usual, but this movie will always belong to Ruby LaRocca (which is the only reason to watch the movie at the beginning). If the script centered on her interesting character, we would have a movie to watch. She is so GORGEOUS !! Good news for DVD buyers, Terry West's former (and better) movie "Blood For The Muse" is a special feature. One thing I would like to say is that this movie feels like someone who is not good at delivering the stroke at the end of a long joke, until the end feels the same way. Then again, just watch this for Ruby LaRocca.
