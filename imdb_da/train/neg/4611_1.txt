I think it is Jack's great empathic ability that makes him the strong performer he is, but empathy comes at a price like all things - when he is surrounded by mediocrity, he instinctively sets the standard and becomes one with it. He is a joke as a mafia-hit man (also because the part doesn't fit him a bit, he's so outgoing) and just grazing avoids fooling himself into this. Kathleen Turner had a very tooooo long career just by being tall and blonde because her training ability is limited to the thing she does with her eyes when she opens them wide, as she is convinced, is sooo amazingly sexy, and Anjelica Huston is the absolute (given interesting) in everything, like Robert loggia. <br /> <br /> The movie is a lame draft (and it will be the only mention of the rag they call script) of a gangster movie, with a throw that was probably only interested in coming to the aftermath faster ( they certainly gathered the partist elite in this). What did they do in one day? Because that would be the only explanation.
