For those who want to watch this movie? I would say go! Without the story it can be a very good movie / documentary. But the music, the narrative and some of the implemented stories make it very difficult to look for a skeptical person like me. After several animals their lives in several seasons get the feeling that it is a deep-sea we see. But the melodramatic point of view just doesn't cut it for me if a predator finally picks up a prey (an exception thereto), zooms the camera out or jumps to another scene. I wonder why this happens if they were to show reality, why cut the scenes that a melodramatic adventure remains? I think that morality is important to the mass of the crowd, cause it all: it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet.
