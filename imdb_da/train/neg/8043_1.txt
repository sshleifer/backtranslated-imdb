I usually have no problem walking away from a bad movie, but it was a unique case. This movie was so bad that I actually sat through it all that almost prayed it would have a minute of good movie time to justify an hour and a half that was wasted. Needless to say, I was brutally disappointed. Viewed at a beach house where a group of fellow friends celebrate holidays, this movie suffers from many problems that make it not worth seeing. First, there are gaping plot holes. Secondly, very few of the C list (I dare not even call them B) Actors can act worthy of horror so all scenes that have potential fail miserably. Third, the movie's speed is very choppy and awkward to see most of the time, making the tension very difficult, leading to very few surprises for the audience. Fourth, and most importantly, the end is completely anti-climatic partly because of how it ends (attitude / whom the killer turns out to be) and partly because the dialogue is just awful. For the film's credit, it's the only movie I will ever say, the worst movie I ever have the scene and I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> So like a bad joke you would have Have all the happier never heard next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret, you will shout no, you really don't do as you run into it opposite direction.
