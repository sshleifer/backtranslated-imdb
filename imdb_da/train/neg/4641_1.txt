I sometimes enjoy really miserable movies .... those who occasionally arise when people (even talented) come along with good intentions to produce a movie and for some reason it turns out to be a disaster. Movies like "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes", "Plan 9 from the outer space", "Manos-Hands of Fate" and "Heavens Gate" etc. So when I heard that this movie, "Rachel's Attic", was considered by Many people to be the only worst movie in the decade, of course I just had to watch it. Boy, I regret this decision. This movie is beyond bad .... it is so bad that it is not even as fun as the usual bad movie. The action, the movie, the script, etc. Is even worse than a low budget porn movie: the sound is horrible, the "plot" is completely incomprehensible, the "acting" is ridiculous .... it is a complete waste of everyone's time and money. At least, porn movie has porn to break up the monotony, while this ridiculous nightmare has a guy hugging a rotten apple and a "mad hatters" party. <br /> <br /> The lighting is not present ... Many "scenes" take place in half or complete darkness, which is probably just as good. The "author-instructor" (I use the terms resolved), David Tybor, tries to become kinky with bondage scenes ... but the results would be ridiculous if they were not so pathetic. There is some nudity, but it is of such high quality that it actually acts as a sexually oppressive. I could continue forever and not do justice to all the shortcomings and flaws of this truly horrible waste of film. <br /> <br /> For God's love, avoid this train wreck. I know that despite (or perhaps because of) my negative comments, you may still be tempted to see if this piece of garbage is really as bad as I claim to be .... but trust me it .... it is even worse than I have said, and you will quite rightly regret the experience (and the cost if you waste your money on a purchase or rental).
