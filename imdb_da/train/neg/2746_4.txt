I feared taking my nephews to this movie, as I didn't think it would be well done. The kids aged 6 and 10 were put on to watch it, so I caved. I have to admit that it was not as bad as I had thought, but was still far from the book. The film seemed just like the 10-year-old understanding and sense of humor. I found out that the 6-year-old understood what was going on and he presented solutions to the problems that took place. In the end, I would explain that in some cases the movies do not show the best solutions to the problems because it is more fun to see what happens if they make the "stupid" or "stupid" choices.
