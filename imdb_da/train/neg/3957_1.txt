The original Boogeyman was a silly but entertaining supernatural slasher flick. It was by no means a good movie, but fun in the right frame. The third part of this series, Boogeyman's Return, on the other hand, is simply terrible. It consists of two things. First, cheap and lifeless new recordings. Second, LOADS of reused bits from the first movie. The new material is incredibly amusing, but not in a fun way, simply incredibly boring. This recording has been clearly merged quickly and effortlessly. It acts as a framing unit for the endless clips of the first (and possibly other) films. And boy do they measure those clips from the previous films; sometimes reuse sequences again and again. The only new addition to these parts is a voice over, which unlimitedly describes exactly what we can see with our own eyes. The whole experience of seeing this is really insane. <br /> <br /> Returning the Boogeyman is an example of the very worst form of flick exploitation; the kind that exploits the audience in a very cynical way. I would like to keep this review short and to the point because this movie deserves no more. There is nothing worth here at all. This is worthless.
