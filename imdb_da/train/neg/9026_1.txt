This must be some of the worst directions I've seen. Close-up can be a very powerful shot, but when each scene consists of nothing but close-ups, it loses all its impact. <br /> <br /> Tony Scott has some very beautiful scenes to work with, the scenes in Mexico, the canteens, the beautiful estate where Anthony Quinn lives, and the dusty cities Costner rolls through on his journey of revenge. Unfortunately, we only get a quick glimpse of these places before the camera cuts to a picture of a large, large head. Even the transition scenes where Costner runs alone across Mexico quickly carved into a close-up. <br /> <br /> The result is excessive and intrusive, dictating all the emotions we need to feel. The story itself should have been handled much better. For example, too many people come up with nothing to help Costner together - it's just bad writing. <br /> <br /> It's a typical thriller story, but many others have taken the same premise and done excellent things with it. Costner's No Way Out had a somewhat similar story, but it was a much better movie. <br /> <br /> The ending was completely anticlimatic and suffered from the film's most melodramatic score. This movie would never be great, but if we saw more of Mexico and less gigantic heads, this movie could be visible.
