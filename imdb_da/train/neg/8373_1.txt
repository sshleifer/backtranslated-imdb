I was not impressed with this movie, especially because I went to the movies with my family in good faith to watch a movie certified 12A here in England. To my dismay, this movie was full of embarrassing sexual jokes. (Which is not a problem for me as an adult, but not good for seeing in children). This movie was sometimes very nice, with jokes, hit the groin etc ... and most of the movie is not very funny. The premise of the movie is that Calvin Sims, a 2-inch midget, comes out of jail and steals a huge diamond, but is then forced to put it in a women's handbag. So the rest of the movie sees him pass as an abandoned baby, get into this woman's house so he can get that diamond back. <br /> <br /> So far, I have enjoyed most of the Wayans Brothers production - but this movie surely takes biscuits. <br /> <br /> A bit of good advice - wait until it comes on TV or cable
