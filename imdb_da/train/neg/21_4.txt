What was with all the Turkish actors? No offense, but I thought it was all for nothing for all those actors. The movie had no script to test any actors acting or skill. It took almost nothing I bought this movie to see Michael Madsen. He is one of my favorite actors, but this movie was another failure for him. The script was so bad. Theirs was just nothing to sink your teeth in and all the characters were two-dimensional. Madsen tried to act like a hard ass, but the manuscript and the direction did not allow him enough to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or three-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Even the sound effects from the gunfight at the beginning of the movie sounded like noise of the milking parlor when fired in a skirmish. It was really weird and they don't sound like real weapons. A video game had better sound effects than this movie. There was also a really annoying block at the beginning of the film, which was a member of the robbery. He had this American mocking voice as a girl shouting lines like "Lets get F # $ k from here" and what should we do man ". He sounded like a girl. As a positive It was fun to watch and it made me laugh too a few seconds, WHY HIGH! DUMMEL film. Poor Madsen. He will jump back ...
