I had not seen the movie trailer when I went to watch the movie, instead I based my judgments on a friend's opinions. Now I like Chris Rock and his comedy, but this movie just falls flat on the face. During the movie Rock delivers a couple of funny jokes, but unfortunately the movie is very poor in comedy. The movie seems to integrate both laughter and love into one, and the one who strives for it fails. The love story in the movie is straightforward (fortunately), but it detracts too much from the movie by making Rock serious and gentle. After all, the film is primarily intended to be a comedy where laughter should be the primary concern. Not much of it in the movie. The plot is also quite uninteresting as a whole. Some parts were discontinuous entirely. If the support support was to be fun, they certainly did not do a good job. The couple of angels from heaven tried to make a few jokes that were dry and boring. Rock's first incarnation is also a few mouthpieces. If there is one thing, they did the right thing, even though they made Rock seem more fun compared.
