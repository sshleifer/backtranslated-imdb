When I rented "Unhinged", I expected a gore movie. The box even claimed that the movie had extreme scenes of violence cut from the theatrical release (I now have serious doubts that this will be released in the theater). After the end of the film, I wondered how it could even receive a video release. The plot is as follows: A group of three young women on a road trip collide their car in a tree. These women somehow manage to find their way to a mansion that contains an extremely sexist woman. In addition to this point, the film is composed mainly of useless scenes designed to make the film long enough for release. <br /> <br /> One of the things that make this movie awful is the actor. Lisa Munson, who plays the protagonist, looks as if she is reading her lines of cue cards. The other plays are bad, but not as bad as her. Another thing that makes this movie bad is the camera's technique. Many shots are taken by cameras attached to the ceiling. It gets very annoying as the film progresses. On top of all that is very little doing, which makes the box very misleading. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this. My rating: 1 out of 10
