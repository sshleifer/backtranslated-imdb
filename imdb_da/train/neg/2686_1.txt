First of all, I am not American or Middle Eastern. Second, I don't have a religion. The closest thing to a religion I have is sports and movies. In the future I think I would best serve to give an opinion on neutrality and free of bias. <br /> <br /> Most of these short films are a complete disgrace. This horrible event should be used to commemorate all the innocent people who were murdered by "some" barbaric and uncivilized morons. Instead, most of what I saw in these short films was trying to score different political points. Examples: <br /> <br /> 1) Ken Loachs segment. Well, we are all sad that this guy had a hard life in his country, but what does that have to do with the innocent victims of 2001? Two mistakes don't make it right? No matter what! This movie should have a subtitle for those who have difficulty listening to a partially disjointed Chilean-English accent. <br /> <br /> 2) The most disruptive is Youssef Chahine's segment. It is obvious that he has problems with the logic. He justified the murders caused by - America is a democracy, and because some Americans voted in power, all Americans are ultimately responsible for actions and decisions taken by their Middle Eastern leaders. Helloooo! Is this guy really? Some Americans don't even vote! Some Americans don't even know where the Middle East is; some do not even know which religion is practiced there; and the majority do not know the real political issues behind the scenes. ### Mr. Chahine, the reason we have all these problems in the world is because there are too many people with your kind of logic. The innocent victims of the Twin Towers came from all over the world. The murdered firefighters, rescuers, office workers, townspeople and airline passengers have nothing to do with politics. And yet, we must not go about our lives because "some" people believe that everyone should choose a page or religion. We are perceived as fair game for extreme politics. <br /> <br /> 3) The Israeli segment showed their own bombed victims. Another filmmaker who uses this event to push their own political agenda. Sometimes it's not about you. Some people always think of "me, me, me". Sometimes it is about other people. <br /> <br /> 4) The Idrissa Ouedraogo segment is a joke and another political score scorer. Of course, they want money from the international community by highlighting their poverty. Blah, blah, blah. <br /> <br /> This movie denies the memory of "Sept. 11, 2001" victims. <br /> <br /> The best thing about it is TRASH CAN.
