I didn't know it was a silent movie with a story. I don't care about silent movies - corny humor, flickering lighting and movies, etc. I'm sure attributes to the low score I assigned it. It was about Chapter 8 before I found any interest in this story, and if I had popcorn, I could have thrown it on the screen. Maybe this appeals to the sci-fi people? The only thing missing was a zombie scene and a brain transplant. I went with two other people on a Friday night and there were a total of 6 people in the whole theater. Isabella Rosselinni told this movie - the one pleasant aspect of the movie. No one left to comment on how much they enjoyed it, or appreciated the unusual approach to telling this story. I can't recommend this movie.
