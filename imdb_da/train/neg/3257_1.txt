After watching the movie, the first question that arose in my mind was that: Should it be ironic or not? After reading a few comments about the character Doc Savage and the comic series, I knew that this movie was not meant to be ironic. Then the story tells us about an American American superdoc who saves a South American republic from evil. It sounds like a typical story. But this comes in such an unrealistic way that it becomes ridiculous. The obligatory end fight shows the worst presentation of martial arts I've ever seen. The film may be interesting for low-cost movie designers as a bad example.
