I'm a big fan of the real crime genre, but I couldn't sit through this modest piece. It was almost as if Dahmer was meant to be erotic, down to the porn movie track. There was no look at what made Dahmer tick, no exploration of who his victims were. Nothing but "Look at how scared this guy is." And I have to give the filmmakers so much - their Dahmer is the fateful thing to ever argue on the screen.
