Okay, the film festival loved the crowd for sure. But your average popcorn munching movie goer who has scraped to-gether the ten or fifteen bucks it costs to watch a movie these days will probably wonder why he or she made that choice. If it is stamped "Copolla" it is automatically good things, right? Wrong! It is a nice scout of the film's prediction. But it's terribly "in". I'm worried when filmmakers are more concerned about entertaining themselves than the public. It's interesting as a cinematic curio, and it has a chuckle or two in it. But when it runs its way in the movies and on TV, the dust gets heavily thick on the film cans and the tape boxes hold it. Hardly either an epic or an epic!
