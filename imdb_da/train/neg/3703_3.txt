I don't expect much from this movie, but boy-o-boy, I didn't expect the movie to be so bad. Chris Rock doesn't show a good action here, you can't get the feeling that his character is real, I think the movie would have been a little better if it was drama or romantic scenes would have been a minor part of the movie and more / better humor was involved. The film is like the filmmakers had a bad hangover who did it. In the "production of" they do not show a single smile. This is a very bad movie! I gave it three out of ten because of the little smile it gave me, but I never laughed!
