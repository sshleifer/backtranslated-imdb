I totally agree with the last comment that this could be the worst movie ever made. I also had to fast forward through most of this movie. Michael Madsen must have made this movie a service to anyone. Image quality is grainy throughout. And what a little plot there is is just stupid. I give this movie a 1 out of 10 if I could give it a lower score I wanted. Don't waste your time on this movie or you will regret it.
