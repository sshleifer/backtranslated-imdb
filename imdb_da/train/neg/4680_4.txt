If I was asked how I would define the word "Shallow", I would answer "Watch a Jerry Bruckheimer production". If I was asked how I would define the phrase "Waste potential", I would answer "Watch a Jerry Bruckheimer production". Bruckheimer productions are almost always sure that brand hits at the cashier's office, but almost always receive critical pannings from the critics. From the top of my head I can only think of an ambassador, and a GENTLEMAN and BLACK HAWK DOWN get very critical recognition. <br /> <br /> CRIMSON TIDE has also received a lot of begrudging recognition from critics, it is certainly one of Bruckheimer's better films, which unfortunately doesn't say much. The problem I had is the scenario that sets the story up: the Russians are fighting for the Chechens, and the conflict spreads throughout Russia, leading to an ultra-nationalist Russian taking over a nuclear missile base and threatening the West if they interfere. Perhaps the end of the Cold War had everything to do with it, but I found this arrangement very convincing. It's not helped by any faults in geography like the French airline Foch is in the media (will Foch not be better placed in the Black Sea?) Or that the exposed news tour consists of family photography with conflicts from the Balkans, first gulf war and even Vietnam. Once again, the adjective "Very convincing" crossed my mind. The story improves when the story is correct - A willpower concerning orders between a nuclear watercraft and his second - is getting under way. Director Tony Scott does his best, but the problem is still in a convincing scenario. The worst thing is that if this had happened in the mid-1980s when WW3 was a real opportunity - no likelihood - this movie would have scared me, but after the Cold War, the dangers of nuclear war ended, which means that CRIMSON TIDE has little impact.
