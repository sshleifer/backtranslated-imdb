Not only was he always annoying to listen to, but he had no jokes. I swear, a fancy Asian guy who tells yo momma jokes would have been more fun than Leary's crap. (Well, maybe for a couple of minutes, but at least I can laugh at least once!) Leary claimed he stopped taking drugs under one of his "jokes" ... apparently he was still tall on something; He was just some flawless inaccurate rants for the most part drug-related. One of his jokes was something like, 'I didn't want to use crack, especially with the same name as between my ass' - Oh man, how did he get up with the one? I swear the only guy to close f ** k up is Denis Leary. Thank God, I didn't have to see him live. This guy sucks completely. <br /> <br /> If you are easily amused by gang and "jokes" where you can come up with yourself, waste your time with this junk.
