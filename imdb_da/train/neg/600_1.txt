...... in a horror movie that is. Okay first, let's start with Kate. Her main goal is to be laid by George Clooney, look good and last but not least screws all over. Maybe love her. She had about 3 incredibly good chances to finish this sicko but ..... instead she ran. I think she wouldn't bring Guy out for 10 minutes and when she did, it was too late. I think the guy was trying to rape her. I can't get into these movies, where the protagonist is a sad idiot. I mean who honestly would have any sympathy for a guy who finishes everyone she's met at night. The movie continued. And as a result, his entire credibility was lost.
