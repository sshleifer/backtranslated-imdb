Just Cause is one of the movies that initially makes you wonder why it was so heavily skewed when it came out - nothing special but competent enough and with an excellent supporting performance from Ed Harris. Then you hit the last third, and everything begins to become increasingly stupid until you have a killer with a flashlight attached to his forehead, threatening filet Sean Connery's wife (a typically hampered and inconsistent Kate Capshaw) and child (a lot of young Scarlet Johannsen) in an alligator rails shack. <br /> <br /> The kind of movie that is probably best seen on an airplane, and even then only once.
