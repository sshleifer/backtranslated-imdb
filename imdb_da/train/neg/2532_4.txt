The cult of personality has elevated status of Roger Corman, Sam Arkoff, Lloyd Kaufman, etc. As kings of the B's. Because the Crown International people were so important, they have not been elevated to the status they really deserve. A movie like THE VAN can now look like a one-time Drive-in esoteria, but it was a big hit when it was released (not to mention subsequent re-releases as a dual function with other Crown hits). <br /> <br /> VAN was a perfect example of Crown's hit strategy to address the mood of filming at the time of film release. Here it was sex, drugs, rock'n'roll and the short "Custom Van" dish. As others have noted, it is ironic that the "hit" song in the movie refers to a Chevy when the title vehicle is a Dodge in the movie itself. I had a city Selectman where I was at the time, even explaining that these vans are "caves on the wheels!" A perfect advertising line for the movie! <br /> <br /> There is the usual assortment of "good" and "bad" girls, muscle heads and low brow haninks (including a piece of support by Danny DeVito). In many ways this is not very different from the old Beach Party movies from the 60s, but now spiced with nudity and drug use. Of course, it is done on a limited budget and a limited schedule, watching the movie together pleasantly enough with a breezy charm that compensates for some, according to today's standards, surely un-PC prospects for women. <br /> <br /> The classic touch is a Bobby's toaster on the wheels. Yes, a toaster! Hi, you need something hot for the munchies! <br /> <br /> Grindhouse Fest.
