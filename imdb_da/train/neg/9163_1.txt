The Leap Years stars some heavy hitters in the local and regional movie and television scene. And yet they can't save this movie. It has so many things against it - over action, too melodramatic, bad script, inconsistent direction; and too few things go for it - decent music, good filmography. This comment is mainly for anyone throwing all local movies in a basket after watching this movie and saying that all local movies are bad. Please judge the rest not based on this one movie. This is a TV soap opera masquerading as a romantic feature film. My hopes were high when I bought my ticket and my hopes were dashed five minutes into the movie.
