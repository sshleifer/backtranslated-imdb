This movie is the worst movie, but it is very high for me. That's how a slasher movie should be. It takes place at a university where there seems to be only a handful of students. The teachers are stupid than a hammer sack. It is filled with good Catholic priest, sexually repressed humor. Bad hair, bad clothes. The dialogue is so clich√© that it's hard to believe I was able to predict lines in quotes. The slashings have a certain amount of creativity and appear to revolve around prickly people in the genitals. Lack of continuity in the soundtrack and signs that deserve to die because they are so bad, I recommend this movie for a fun time. Get a case of cheap beer and some friends, watch it and laugh.
