I am currently discussing whether I should even have finished watching this "poppycock" in a movie. They had a pretty interesting idea with the buried movie set, and that was it. So far, this incomprehensible mess has no real story. There is the buried set, some wolf led monster ran amok, an amulet, and a bunch of bad actors attacked by the wolf masked whatever it is. What I would have missed if I had the good sense of pushing out this nonsense is a dune buggy chase, some really bad C.G.I., some incredibly stupid dialogues, more bad C.G.I. and hero's hero paper cut out. Apart from the original idea, this movie has absolutely no resetting properties. My mistake to continue to see. - NOTE
