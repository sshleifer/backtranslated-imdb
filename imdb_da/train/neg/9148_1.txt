I looked at Imdb's bottom 100 because I thought id never saw anything as bad as plan 9 from the outerspace or roller ball remake, I was wrong. Ben and Arthur have beaten both. <br /> <br /> This out of the many countless movies I've seen is the number one worst movie I've ever seen. Bad Directing, Bad Characters, Horrible Acting, Horrible Story There's no reason, but Sam ever says something positive about this movie. Sam was a horrible annoying actor, but his management was so poor that he might just overthrow Ed Wood. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the director was ashamed of his work, unfortunately I have to give it at least 1 star, but it deserves it - that continuing stars.
