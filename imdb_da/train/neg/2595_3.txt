You cut it was AWFUL !!! <br /> <br /> But despite the fact that I got this movie and 3 others and they were all on DVD. The movie starts almost an OK movie, but goes downhill from around the middle and forward. <br /> <br /> And it ends well, let's just say that it was one of the most anti-climatic endings in the latest movie story. Lots of gore in the end order and if you like a dose of schlock horror then this movie is for you .... <br /> <br /> 3/10
