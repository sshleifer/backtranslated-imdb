Watching this movie, which I just did for the first time at Turner Classic (which mentions it as "Dangerous Woman"), can only multiply your understanding of the 1941 Bogart-Astor version. Ricardo Cortez must have been paid by the smoker. I hope he remembered his dentist and his Brylcreem salesman in his will; they made him the actor he was. The women are all good, but not better than that. Well, Una Merkel is a little better. More interesting is the "original" Joel Cairo and Mr. Gutman, who is capable of supplying many of the individual tics, but almost none of their successors in the roles of Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor somehow exceeded their essential fertility in remake; here Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley (!) cannot. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't stink completely, it's like a big slice of ham. Its main value today is as a reminder that big movies like "41" Falcon "don't just happen. On the scale of 1 to 10, I rate it a 4, mainly for the camera's work and the supporting players.
