Don't waste your time on this movie. It could have been good, but the end was one of the lamest I have ever seen. I must seriously wonder how the people involved in making this movie could have seen the last scene and thought, "Yes! Now there is an end!" and patted at the back of it. For me it seemed more like they just came out of ideas! They built the final scenes to get a cool twist, but instead just let the whole structure fall flat on the face. When the last shot blew to black and I heard the credit music started, I was in shock - I couldn't believe what I saw and that someone could even call it an end. The best thing anyone could do with this movie is to rewrite the end and give it some substance. Seriously, I would really love to get the one who came up with one in a room, see them in the face and say - WTF ?? !!!!
