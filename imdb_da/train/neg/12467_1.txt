This movie was slower than molasses in January ... in Alaska. The man who put the assembly in advance had to get a prize for managing to put each of the 30 seconds in the room. I had to wake up the people I looked at several times. After it was over, I felt bad for waking them up. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is taken up with the hope that something will actually happen, but nothing ever does. It was easy to lose people's motives, and the characters were flat and incomprehensible. At the end of the movie, you just hoped everyone would die. Everyone runs around either contemptuous, petty or pitiful, and usually all three. <br /> <br /> Worse, we saw a moment or two of the extra features, just for kicks and giggles you understand, and all we saw was that people were sneaky about how they were socially aware on them. If they had spent the time on the film, they were patting at the back, it might have been worth seeing. <br /> <br /> I was brought in expecting the excitement of '24 '. I was given a lecture on social consciousness through the sandman's mixing eyes.
