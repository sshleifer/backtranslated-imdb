This movie is a bad attempt to make original fans feel complete. The only thing that people have forgotten is that the reason why the original won such recognition was to do so strictly to make you feel incomplete. <br /> <br /> This movie makes me want to go to the laundry room. I'm not a negative type of guy, but man who trades in this flick is .... no comment. The reason was a poor reflection of Carlito Brigante's life, and I'm sorry to have had two hours of my time and my money wasted on this flick. I still love the original and will do my best not to let this movie ruin my mind about it.
