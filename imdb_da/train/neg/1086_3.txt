Despite its impressive cast and crew pedigree Gingerbread Man crumbles early and often. The reason is unrealistically unnoticed, the actors' sports bad accents and director Robert Altman help to collect a paycheck. Once again, he has assembled an impressive cast (like Woody Allen, everyone wants to work with Altman) that this time the letter is miscast. But that is only part of the problem. Kenneth Branagh is Rick Magruder, a high-powered Georgian lawyer who, in the movie's heavy hands, opens scenes manage to be seductively seduced by a mysterious caterer waitress who convinces him is in serious danger from a former man and a loony father. With red flags everywhere, the wise attorney moves himself to get his children hurt. War and pistol steps come with a demanded car deal, and if that is not enough, there is a hurricane thrown in for the ridiculous finale. Branagh plays MacGruder with a meal and a compelling southern accent. Running in a trench in all kinds of weather, he is blind to the obvious to keep the story going. Hipster Bob Downey Jr. is as bad as a P.I. But with a little more emphasis on the bad accent. Robert Duvall as the old is Boo Radely, who grows up and is more crazy than a bed bow that serves some thick slices of hams, but at least his twang is plausible. The female manager (Embeth Davidtz, Darryl Hannah, Famkhee Jansen) is lean and unemotive. Even the celebrity lawyers who make cameos (Vernon Jordan) are wood with the few throw lines they have. <br /> <br /> In addition to paying attention to his actors, Altman's mise is a scene dribbling with Spanish moss, creepy and formless, his action scenes cartoon. It lacks his offbeat hand and observations (he informs the viewer that stars and bars are still waves in Georgia) that make a well-done Altman so unique. Unfortunately, Gingerbread Man Altman is at his worst, even though the salary is the same.
