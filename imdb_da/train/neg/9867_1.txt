So a screener of this before last year's awards season didn't really know why they released them after the poll was closed, but anything, perhaps for exposure, at least, but the movie was a terrible mess. Sure, some parts were funny in a sort of humor, but none of the characters felt really real. There wasn't a person I could connect with, and I think that's where I succeeded. Sure, the plot is somewhat interesting and very subversive to Scientology, WOW! What a grand idea ... let's see if it hasn't already been mined to the point that is useless. The whole test feels false, from the light, the casting, the manuscript to the horrible visual effects (which is supposed to be intentional, I can tell, and then everyone else, no one can laugh with yourself). Anyways, I hope that it makes it for sale at DVD at least, I don't want a project that many people obviously put a lot into being totally unnoticed. But it's a trip either. Drilling tripe on it.
