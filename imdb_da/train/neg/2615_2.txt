I don't know why, but for some ill reason I think since I have been on the Disney sequel, I decided to just go ahead and see 102 Dalmatians. The first movie to remake the Disney cartoon character with Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil seemed like a safe hit, but it was just a bomb. I think the reason why these movies don't work is because the 101 Dalmations, the original, was a comic book, it just worked better and was more appealing to the kids as well as adults. It wasn't that fun because it's adults who run around trying to act as cartoons instead of just the real people, I understand they're trying to make sure it's appealing to the kids, but it's ridiculous to see how these actors behave in the movie. And the history of Dalmatia is not so good. <br /> <br /> Cruella De Vil has been in prison for some time, but things change when she has proven that she now loves animals and is a pleasant person. But her reputation is now damaged as a puppy-napper, but she buys a man's dog slipper and is suddenly loved by everyone and it seems she's changed. But when she sees the Dalmatians of her provisional officer, she becomes mad and begins to see spots, and she loses it. She is back for revenge on puppies and is still determined to get the Dalmation coat she has always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is such a great actress, much under rated, but her takes Cruella De Vil, she's good, but let's see, this movie made the funny villain just more of a silly need. Also as cute as puppies was, it just seems more to the animation, it sounds stupid, but it's just not as credible without the comic, and their personalities are in the mix. I don't really recommend 102 Dalmations, it's okay, but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time, it's just the same. <br /> <br /> 2/10
