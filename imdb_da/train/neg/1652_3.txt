I'll be blunt and to the point. This movie is not good at all. The movie buff part of me hated the play, script, story, direction and almost all editing. Amanda Peet has proven that she can act as a high point of 'The Whole Nine Yards'. So she should have avoided this movie with a ten foot coil. But the infantile part of me found this movie to be very fun. If you can forget how sub-standard the production quality is, and if you find smut jokes fun, then you should be okay. And for those of you who can't get out of your pedestal, your choice is. My inner child has not died and I laughed a little. Even then, only a 3 out of 10, because as a movie it really stinks.
