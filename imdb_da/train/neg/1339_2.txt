A sad and sad sight is actually Munster's Revenge. The Munsters has been brought back one last time (Fred Gywnne received a huge pay slip to get back to Herman Munster's role) in this TV movie about a couple of adult replicas of grandfather and herman who are "terrorizing" the city in preparation for a robbery of a mummy's stash at an exhibition. With the police on their heels, the two older TV icons are trying to figure out who is actually behind the crimes to clear their names. We'll see them in a row like waitresses (a small highlight in the movie), grandfather turns into a flat wire with attached wire a couple of times (sometime even flying to Transylvania with somehow invoking his frequent flyer miles I guess) a most annoying relative "phantom" sings constantly and breaks glass ad nausium! What is most sad is hard to ascertain: is it that Gywnne (especially) and Al Lewis look so fragile in every scene and then don't care about the material. Is it the hokey costumes of the robots that have the school's production values ​​looking at them. Maybe it's the ridiculous script. Sid Caesar is crazy, mostly unfunny antics. Or maybe it sees something that brought me joy and good memories when a child is treated to a super K-Mart fashion makeover. In any way, the result is decisively disappointing and stupid even for Munster standards. As for the rest of the casting, Yvonne De Carlo is sufficient in a most vacuous role (however, showing more cleavage than usual for a woman in her years and experience). K. C. Martell makes an always so gracious Eddie Munster. Jo McDonell is an attractive Marilyn. Bob Hastings as the aforementioned Phantom looks and works and speaks in the most absurd way. The film has a really cheap feeling about it even for a movie for television.
