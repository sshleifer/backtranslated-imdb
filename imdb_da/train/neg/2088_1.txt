What a terrible show. Science Fiction fans seem to see something more regardless of quality. It shocks me that something extraordinary like Firefly lasts a season, while trash can like Battlestar Galactica remake triggers a spin. This spin off is pitiful in every aspect of the show. The action is young and uninspired. The characters are paper clips of everything that has ever been in a bad Sci-Fi series. The story is bad. The dialogue is worse than a primary time back opera. The direction is shoddy and the sets are awful. Caprica is a waste of film, a waste of time and a waste of effort. This is a spin off that should never have been made.
