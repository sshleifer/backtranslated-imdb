Jason Lee's pecks are back! If that's what you're looking for, look no further. If not, go ahead ... <br /> <br /> But about the movie. Cliches galore, some badly shot, but quite exotic fighting scenes (used JKD) and lots of bad plays and cheap effects. Poor Lee looks as though he has pain throughout the movie, and no wonder. Not a comfortable comeback. The movie does not even change it as a B-movie - there was a German bleached blonde Rutger-wannabe naughty guy, but no free sex scene or even a single booty shot. None. Zip. Nada. Even in Starship Troopers 2, they had the common sense to include the mandatory nudie scenes (as for the rest of my comments on the excellent piece of classical cinema excellence, please see our forthcoming review on the mind-boggling sequel ...). I got the feeling that the author was about to assert someone with this - so I will not get into the "plot" of the movie or just about anything else related. Except that it had some non-heterosexual overtones, nuff said. <br /> <br /> But this movie has one thing to go to it - no Jean-Claude :)
