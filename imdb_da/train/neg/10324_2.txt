The little mosque is one of the most boring CBC comedies I've ever seen. They have a way to produce the easiest comedy programming they can to the oldest most falsified viewers, as for CBC, meaning 85-year-old farmers in Saskatchewan. The witnesses are all predictable, and so deadly, I can't believe it. The performances are very hammy and overwhelmed, but I don't blame the actors as the kind of dimensioned stereotypical characters are probably exactly what CBC requested and required. Very lame show with bad jokes, they tried to present as "controversial" well it's less controversial than the other boring CBC comedies like The Hour have 22 minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer's Report.
