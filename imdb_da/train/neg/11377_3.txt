Okay. For starters, the taxi driver is amazing. This, this is not a taxi driver or fantastic. What it is is bad. But I thought it was bad fun, which means it had some redeeming qualities. as the dialogue ... wow. there was more or less no plot, the characters were all stupid, and the film was sermon. There were some places where I thought the movie would dive into taxi driver type violence, which would have hit the message at the end of the movie a lot harder. I can't even believe there are like 20 other people watching this movie. yes it is worth looking at if you are really sorry and you want to confirm the fact that someone can make a movie or at least try to.
