Considering I wanted to download a new Jet Li movie to see some but kicked and brainless hand to hand combat, I took that title. Unfortunately, this movie contains several gunfights (ala Chow Yun Fat but nowhere near as good) than Jet Li and the company's acrobatic battle. Thus, it was a disappointment. The crane match was interesting and even fun as it was something unexpected in a Jet Li movie for me, more in line with Jackie Chan. <Br /> <br /> But unfortunately I would recommend Games to Play, Tai Chi Master or even Enforcer over this disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating 4 for the martial arts Rating 3 for the overall movie score
