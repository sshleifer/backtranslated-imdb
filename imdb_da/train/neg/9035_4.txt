Born in the 1960s, I grew up watching the TV "Film of the Week" in the early 70s and loved the crazy films that were routinely shown, including "Crowhaven Farm", "Bad Ronald" "Satan's School for Girls", "Kolchak Night Stalker", etc., but this is simply stupid. It is, of course, the author who tries to exploit the terrible Manson murders from a few years earlier. The movie stars Dennis Weaver of "McCloud" and "Duel" praise as a father who takes his family camping on a beach. The family meets some hippies who for some reason decide to terrorize the family. The reason for this has never been explained and Weaver's pacifist attitude is difficult to swallow. For the sake of God, call the police, kill them or something, just don't sit and laugh about it. The action is pretty lame, the story incredible, etc. Susan Dey looks cute in a bikini, but it's about it. Ignore this if ever aired on TV.
