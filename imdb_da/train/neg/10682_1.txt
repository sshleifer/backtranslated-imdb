So I'm looking to rent a DVD and I come across this movie called 'End Game'. It stars James Woods and Cuba Gooding JR and has the synopsis of a taught political thriller. Well worth seeing then. Or I thought. <br /> <br /> Boy, was I wrong. End Game has just about the most ridiculous plot I've ever had dissatisfaction with persistent. Now it's something of a whodunnit, I can't really tear into what I want without destroying it for those who haven't yet experienced this monstrosity. But questions like 'Why did he / she / they do it?', And 'Where on earth did they get the resources to pull it off?' is too abundant after the film's accidental hilarious conclusion. <br /> <br /> With regard to the actor - you know the movies where you can almost feel that an actor realized that they made a terrible mistake logging in for a movie and this shows in their performance? This is one of them. Accompany this with a ridiculous script and seriously flawed, annoying direction, and you have the recipe for cinematic poison. Of course it didn't make it to the cinema, and for the same reason you shouldn't allow it in your living room it's terrible.
