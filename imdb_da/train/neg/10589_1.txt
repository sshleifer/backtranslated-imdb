Universal Soldier: The return is not the worst movie ever made. No, the honor would have to go to a movie that tried to make some kind of statement or perform some artistic feat, but failed in a pathetic or offensive manner. But maybe no movie I've ever seen has tried so little and managed as completely as Universal Soldier: The Return. <br /> <br /> This movie is a sci-fi / action travesty that has almost nothing to recommend it. The action is just as bad as any movie I've ever seen. The ground is awful and predictable. The special effects are pathetic. In short, anyone who even remotely connected to this movie should be ashamed of themselves. USA: The return makes former Van Damme ticket work as groundbreaking cinematic masterpieces. Some movies are so bad they are good. Believe me when I tell you this is not one of them. I'm really not sure what's more to say here. I doubt many people were considering watching this movie if they didn't already, but just in case: not.
