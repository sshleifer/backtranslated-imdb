I can't remember the last time I responded to a performance as emotionally as I did for Justin Timberlake in "Edison". I became so emotional, I wanted to scream in fear, destroy the screen, easily accept the hopeless screams of nihilism. Timberlake is terribly disappointed; in fact, he casts like casting Andy Dick to play the lead in "Patton" or Nathan Lane to play Jesus. But it's almost next to the point. <br /> <br /> Timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be just as horrible in any role. I used to have problems with Ben Affleck's acting talent, but Timberlake makes Affleck look like Sir Ian McKellen or Dame Judi Dench. With his metro sexual lust (read lithp), his boyish gaze and emotional expression emanating from something like "The 25 Cliché Expressions for Actors" rejects the screen he is indulged in, and no matter how you cut it, I don't and will not buy his role as an amateur correspondent journalist. It simply won't fly. <br /> <br /> But Timberlake alone is not the fault of his failure. Director David J. Burke not only puts him in the (essentially) primary role, but also sets him aside Morgan Freeman, Kevin Spacey, John Heard, Dylan McDermott, Cary Elwes and (I'm surprised he was so good) LL Cool J. I can imagine that an almost physical disorder sees some of this cast interact with Timberlake. <br /> <br /> There is one side to this of course: the moment one of these actors interacts without Justin, it feels like a double relief. A pleasure if you want. Freeman and Spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time alone, but the ten minutes are happy as opposed to their scenes with our so-called hero. Dylan McDermott is also a fresh breath. <br /> <br /> But enough of the Timberlake bashing words are not enough in this particular case to make art. "Edison" is a very huge corruption story. It is plot ranging from cliché to simply prehistoric. However, I admire the motivation behind doing what I interpret as a tribute to movies like "Serpico" or "Donnie Brasco" or maybe even "Chinatown". Don't make me wrong - "Edison" is not even in the same ballpark as these movies, but I can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire his reason for existence, perhaps to justify my encounter through it. <br /> <br /> The script, in itself, contains some surprisingly poor writing. Yes, it has some decent exchanges, but any conversation between Piper Perabo (which is wasted here) and Timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a Dawson's Creek episode. It's your typical dialogue that is far too glib-for-reality, easy-to-impress-the-audience-with-how-well-articulate (and fail). This dialogue thinks of you, is underlined by good music at the wrong moments. Sometimes it feels like "Edison" will morph into a music video where the scene's feelings are not communicated through acting, but precisely through the poorly chosen music and variant movie speeds (read slow motion). <br /> <br /> Thinking about it, "Edison" is a curiosity. It's safe, since hell got a throw to kill for, but the show is destroyed by Timberlake, who simply doesn't work. In movies as in most art, if one thing is off, it all feels. The board must make tough choices. David J. Burke missed the mark here. Some of the scenes play well in themselves, but as a whole they do not seem to fit like puzzles from different puzzles that are forced into an incoherent image. And it's not really an exciting puzzle to begin with.
