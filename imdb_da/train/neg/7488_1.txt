Everyone who saw the original 1970's movie knows how an excellent cast, script and instructor can put together a comedy masterpiece. Similarly, it is easy to see how the opposite of it can create another eerie Hollywood drill-a-thon! This movie was pathetic! Had it not been for John Cleese (a comic genius), I would have gone out for 15 minutes in this terrible celluloid waste. <br /> <br /> Neil Simon didn't want to write another manuscript for this version (he said he couldn't improve first), and I'm surprised that after this cinematic failure he wouldn't sue for defamation! <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis did a wonderful job in the original, what did the producers think of throwing it? How could the director and editor look at these scenes and think any of them were funny? I don't know, but one thing I know --- it's no surprise why foreign and independent movies are becoming more and more popular .......
