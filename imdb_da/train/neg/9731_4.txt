Others have already commented on the "decline" of the director Tobe Hooper, but what about Brad Dourif? He was quite able to choose good projects (as he appeared by staring in the same year's "Exorcist III"), why did he agree to appear in this? Yes, he gives an appropriately demented performance, and the film is not bad; It is just uninvolving, uninteresting and unappealing. There are three "un-" s for many. (* 1/2)
