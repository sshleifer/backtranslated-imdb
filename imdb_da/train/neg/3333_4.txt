Like the early horror movie The Boogens, the innocent invisible killer is quite letdown when it is finally seen. Although Animal House's Stephen Furst, of course, had fun in the role of an incest product, his performance is more comedy than horror. The plot is extremely tired and has three sexy women (Bach, Lamm and Lois Young) unable to find a hotel for the evening, so they intentionally accept to stay with a seemingly friendly museum consultant who is exceptionally played by the late Sydney Lassick. If you've ever seen any horror movies, you know that beloved IL 'Sydney is a fake psycho, so you know what will happen to the lovely ladies. The three women are all very attractive, especially Barbara Bach, but Lois Young (a Helen Hunt clone) is the only one to go naked when Sydney sees her take a bath.
