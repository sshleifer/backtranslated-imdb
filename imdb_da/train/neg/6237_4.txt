The statistics in this film were well studied. There is no doubt about that! Al Gore certainly presents his case very well, and it is no wonder that this film got the praise that it got. Al Gore is definitely the right actor. He sounds so worried. But actions speak louder than words! Throughout this movie there are political treats and references to his political career sprinkled throughout the film. Jimmy Carter, unlike Al Gore, is a man of integrity who not only speaks to the speakers but goes on the trip as well. When Carter thought we should save energy, he hit the thermostat in the White House and became warm by wearing a sweater. <br /> <br /> Al Gore tells us that we need to save energy and claim we are creating global warming as he travels in his own private jet. How much energy does his jet use and how much more pollution does his jet create? How much energy does it take to heat Gore's swimming pool behind its mansion? It would be nice if we could save electricity by using smaller appliances and making it a point to turn off something that is not being used. But if we did, the energy company would respond to a 50% reduction in energy by calling it a "50% loss in revenue" and regaining its losses by raising the rate by 50%. So "just turning it off" wouldn't be a really good idea. <br /> <br /> This movie is a blatant appeal to allow Big Goivernment to take control of everything, to save the planet earth, that is.
