Wow. I read about this movie and it sounded so terrible that I had to see it and my treasure I can smell it in St. Louis. Where do I start? National Lampoons tried to follow up 5 years later at Animal House, but they completely missed the mark. I go chronologically with these short flicks. <br /> <br /> Short film # 1 <br /> Poor Peter Riegert (Boon from Animal House). Apparently he didn't work then, so the boys at National Lampoons called safely and said "Hey, we're making a c ** ppy movie, will we be in it?" Peter was like "Well, I'm not doing much these days, why not?" He was a great side character in Animal House, but he couldn't carry this boring short flop for 5 minutes. POSSIBLE SPOILS The pastor is funny enough, with Jason Cooper (Riegert) telling his wife to leave him, she must find herself. It is too strange that they are actually in a good marriage. Then she shocks her where she goes, and Cooper is responsible for the kids. This, of course, causes him to burn the house down, lose more of the kids and sleep with a selection of New York bimbos (including an ever so young Diane Lane). Then comes the wife back, wants the kids, and the film ends with a coin flip that determines the children's fate. The idea was actually something smart, but the director stunk. The signs all look as if they are falling asleep, they MUST be doped up. Sorry Boon, your legacy was tarnished with this flop. <br /> <br /> Short Film # 2 <br /> <br /> MORE SPOILERS <br /> Enter Dominique Corsaire. Beautiful girl, newly completed college, not sure what to do with her life. Then she becomes a lock, starts to sleep with some rich guys, takes their money when they die, and she doesn't stop until she sleeps the most powerful man in the world, Fred Willard (Oops, I mean the president of the United States) . Once again it could have been fun, and although I was glad that Corsaire (Ann Dusenberry in fact) was not afraid to shave everyone, she was scary. What a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Short Film # 3 <br /> I can't believe I've made it so far. Here is the smoke law Brent Falcone (Robby Benson) with veteran Stan Nagurski (Richard Widmark). Falcone is young, naive, thinks he can really help people, even though he gets cynical after being shot thousands of times. Nagurski really just gave up. He sees muggings, assaults, you name it and never goes into each other. He shows that the world is lawless and he will probably be sued if he does anything. Even Christopher Lloyd (at the end of the Taxi's race) gets into the action, police are urged him to commit a crime but has his lawyer there to protect him. God Bless America! <br /> <br /> Once again it could have been fun, the show was deliberately campy, but goodness, no energy at all. Henry Jaglom and Bob Giraldi should be ashamed to have their names on this schlock. I think the writing was not bad, the ideas were there, but the execution was pulled off as well as the rescue attempt in the Iranian hostage crisis. If I had been part of this movie, I'd have my name removed, it's terrible. So again, that's why I saw it. <br /> <br /> The only good thing about this waste is that Dr. John did the movie show (repeating "Going to the Movies" over and over) and the movie isn't much longer than an hour and a half. Show this in movie classes with the headline "what you should never do in film making." This script should have been left on the shelf because yep, it's so bad.
