I looked at Free Money last night and it was the longest 90+ minutes in my life. With such an excitement I really threw that I was for a treat - especially as I am a Brando fan. WRONG! What a waste of talent. It's almost embarrassing to see at times (like the cattle product scene), and there were so many missing opportunities for humorous setups (why didn't they show Charlie Sheen's character to pull Brando's truck?) Ugh. It is trying to be a slapstick comedy, but I just didn't buy it. Skip this one. Only for die-hard Brando fans. <br /> <br /> I give it 2 out of 10 because I still think the worse movie ever made was Skidoo.
