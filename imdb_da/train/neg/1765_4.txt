OK - the helicopter pillow is great and the director has made good use of some of Barcelona's main attractions. Otherwise, the production value was blown for the first few minutes, and the rest of the film felt like a movie this week. Ellen Pompeo was charming and fun to see, Abel People had the most depth and was very effective, and William Baldwin was ... Well, William Baldwin. He had to put his martial arts training into good use and be a running hunting action figure. The rest of the casting was at best wood, but mostly paper. So - if you're nostalgic about Spain - it's a picture card with an action twist and a healthy dose of El Greco. If not, skip it.
