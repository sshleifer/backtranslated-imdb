I watched this movie many years ago and I was impressed ... but then I was only 12 years old. I have recently watched it and will have that time back. This movie is pretty bad. While I love Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace (see My Bodyguard (1980) if you want to watch a good movie he was in ... of Meatball's (also contributing Bill Murray) for some laughs) and Burgess Meredith, this role do / did nothing for their career. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Lee Majors character, Franklyn Hart, is an external car engine that plans to drive its racetrack (which he had stored) across the country to California. One problem: The government has banned all private transport. I thought the concept was OK (not the worse I heard about), but the performance failed terribly.
