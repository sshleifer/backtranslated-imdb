I wonder how much this movie actually has to do with the 1984 movie "Bachelor Party" starring Tom Hanks. Is this movie even an official successor? This movie is lacking in every department and you are, of course, better off seeing it. <br /> <br /> For a comedy, this movie is simply not good or fun enough. It mainly depends on the character's stereotypical assessments, rather than the film, in fact, some good, original and fun moments. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is also very little history present and the movie bare breast than script pages. You continue to wait for things to finally begin. There is a main line in it somewhere, but one is so terribly unoriginal and is done so poorly in the movie that it feels more like something that doesn't exist. I suppose there is even a message and moral story in it somewhere, but again it is so terribly unoriginal and badly done in the movie that it simply doesn't work. It's basically a typical teenage comedy with lots of sex jokes and nudity, just without teenage protagonists, making the story more sad and tasteless. The movie makes some really wrong jokes that are misplaced for any kind of movie. <br /> <br /> I am ever sorry to see this. <br /> <br /> 3/10
