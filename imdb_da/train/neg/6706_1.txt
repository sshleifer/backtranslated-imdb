I saw this step several years ago at the Central Florida Film Festival if I remember. I liked it, it showed great potential. I suppose most people here spread this movie because the movie apparently hobbled together (by the filmmaker's own recording on the official site - the short one was exhibited as a "rough"). <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, it was a light comedy. I think many people are trying to read too much for a comedy. All they have to do is make you laugh - that's all. I did just that at its view, so it succeeded at that level. Just my 2 cents anyway.
