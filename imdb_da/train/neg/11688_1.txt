My wife and I found this movie to be very unsatisfactory. While the plot keeps you interested and busy, you just wonder what happens when you leave the theater, there are just too many loose ends that don't make sense at all. (SPOILERS AHEAD) Christopher Plummer, hugely wealthy leader of a NY bank, has a horrible hidden secret. Profit from World War II deals with the Nazis and hides accidents stolen from Jews. He retains evidence (including diamonds and Nazi swastika documents) in a safe in his bank. Why? If he didn't want to be revealed, why didn't he burn and destroy the documents many years ago? And the diamonds? Of course, he doesn't need them - why keep them instead of disposing of them? How did the bank robbers find their secret? How did they know how to reset on this very safe # 232? Ace Detective Denzel Washington also discovers bank records showing SD Boxes No's 231 and 233, but No. 232. Curious. He took careful time in some way to make a grueling search for bank cards to avert this one curious fact. All the time dealing with a red hot horror situation and bank robbers threatening to start performing them immediately. Wow! Talk about superpowers for a detective. <br /> <br /> Bank robbers leave millions of dollars in loose currency in the vault they have opened. They only take the contents of SD Box # 232, apparently for the purpose of deterring the bank president. This despite any rational attempt with a logical explanation of what the film portrays as a criminal mastermind or for his minions with smaller brains. <br /> <br /> Jodie Foster, who uses his political relations with the mayor of NYC, is allowed to enter the bank, which is under the control of bank robbers, while holding many hostages. She offers the main bank robber an agreement to buy back the documents he now has in his hand, but he is not interested. So what's his point (if any?). My wife was offended by all players, Christopher Plummer (bank president), Denzel Washington (essential) and Jodie Foster shooter for high-powered issues. <br /> <br /> The last Jodie Foster movie I saw, "Flight Plan," was also riddled with holes that had no meaning at all. I thought I liked Jodie Foster, but I would probably avoid her future movies. <br /> <br /> Now, my problem is that I rarely persuade my wife to go to the cinema. I can't disagree with her on this one ... "A WASTE OF PAY, AND A WASTE OF TIME." Be observant. A well-built film, fine actors, lousy script writing.
