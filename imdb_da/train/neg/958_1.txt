How did it become such a blockbuster? Dear God, I don't know where to start, why this movie sucked too much. The movie was predictable & there was no originality. All I can admire is to act some signs. The film was too light, they should have done something about the lighting, for example. makes the environment darker. Makeup on certain dead characters made this movie look like a 1970's horror flick. This is 2006! People don't get scared of other people wearing heavy makeup. Most of the horror scenes we have taken from other Hollywood or Asian horror movies. Overall rip off! That's why I don't see tagalog movies. The only reason so many people "screamed" while watching this movie is because of conformity. How many times do we copy scenes from The Ring and improvise it that instead of the girl coming out of the TV, it now comes from the window next to it? No matter how you put it, I'm still a stop.
