Bad actors, poor filming, choppy dialogue, superficial characters, but again it was a bad premise in the first place. Basically, an 11-year-old who is being bullied because he has very little money has been given an empty check by a moronic criminal. Of course, the 11-year-old happens to have enough technology and intelligence to buy a house, cash a $ 1,000,000 check, and even foil three bumbling idiots reminiscent of the three stooges. <br /> <br /> Preston Blake is an annoying, uncomfortable boy who decides that when he writes a blank check of an entire stranger, he will exploit the situation as well as possible. In other words, he walks into a bank <br /> <br /> hands a counter a check he makes in his printer and miraculously goes out with a million dollars in cash. Preston is also apparently able to reach incredible speeds on his bike, because a man driving a Jaguar after Preston and his 10-speed couldn't catch him, even though Preston jumped a number of cars. <br /> <br /> Of course, every hokey adventure movie has to be hot heroine. In this case, our hot heroine is a child who smuggles the FBI agent, dating the eleven-year-old Preston, and promises another date when he becomes 17. <br /> <br /> The absolute worst aspect of this movie was however, its not the casting, nor the bad dialogue, like "The only other way I could think of rinsing a cat is to keep a snake up, it is ass and then fetch the coat". Rather, it was the whole fact that no one in the entire movie seemed to realize that the FBI didn't give a shame to random people. What I haven't explained is that Preston uses the "Macintosh" alias as a masquerade entrepreneur. Of course, the FBI finds this exciting and sends our young heroine to Preston, who uses his 11-year-old raptor to scream first when lobsters fall on his face, then treat her for hamburgers and end up with a ridiculous drum through a cemented area where water jettison is from the earth. Our heroine fails to realize throughout this adventure that the criminal, the FBI pursues, slides and slides just behind the two, as they make their way to Preston's limousine, complete with a one-dimensional driver who never fails to deliver cheap Third rate laughs that the whole family can choke. <br /> <br /> Overall: 1/10 is incredibly gracious for this movie. I can't see how it only has a 4.4 / 10.
