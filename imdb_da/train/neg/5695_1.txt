This film is described as an action / comedy. The first 15 minutes and James Belush's presence point to being a humorous gangster movie. <br /> <br /> But the introduction of the ridiculous women's leadership begins a series of ridiculous plot phrases that do nothing to hide the distinctive end. The movie moves between comedy (description used loosely) and surreal drama with some out of context adult scenes thrown in. The main woman (the angel of the titles) is badly acted and the actor is not helped by the script, which requires some incredible, extreme characters to be portrayed. James Belushi is the only one who handles his part well, but has also failed the poor script. One to avoid.
