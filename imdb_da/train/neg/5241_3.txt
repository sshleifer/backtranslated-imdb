Tell the truth, I'm a little surprised to see all those positive reviews of so many people, which is also the main reason why I actually decide to watch this movie. And after seeing it, I was really disappointed and it comes from the guy who loves this movie genre. <br /> <br /> I'm amazed at this movie altogether - it's like a child's nudity movie for absolutely no reason and it all involves little kids curse and gang. I'm not fair at all, but it's really gone too far in my account. <br /> <br /> Synopsis: The story of two guys was sent to the big brother program for their ruthless behavior. There they met up with one child with occupation of boobs and the other is a medieval freak. Just the name itself is not really related to the story at all. They are not a role model and or do anything other than earn their time for what they have done. The story is very predictable (but expected), and humor is lame. And haven't we already seen the same characters (playing Mc Lovin ') in so many other movies (like Sasquatch Gang?). I think I laugh three times and almost fell asleep. <br /> <br /> It was good that it was good, he was the one who produced the manuscript. And the play is as big as expected when you see this type of movie. And the direction, what do you expect? This is the same guy who brought us Wet Hot American Summer, and that movie also sucks. But somehow he always managed to make some stars to attract his horrible movie. <br /> <br /> Whatever I felt was not total riff but a waste of time. Only the naked scenes seem to be the best part of the movie. Can't really see why I should recommend it to anyone. Benefits: Elizabeth Bank? Two topless scenes. Disadvantages: Not fun, horrible story, nudity and children don't mix together. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3.5 / 10 (Grade: F)
