I thought my favorite Martian was very boring and pulled out !! It was not fun at all. The audience sat right through the whole movie and didn't laugh at all !!! Not even the kids laughed !! It's a Disney movie !! I thought they might have found someone better playing the martian rather than Christopher Lloyd !! He was really stupid !! And he wasn't fun !! I thought it was really stupid to talk clothes In the original TV series, the suit does not speak and move around !! In my opinion they should not have wasted their time on this movie !! I give it two thumbs down !! Really a waste of time and I would not recommend the movie to anyone !!! Thank you!!
