Not as bad as you've heard. There are actually some fun parts, and Affleck and Applegate have pretty good chemistry. Applegate is especially appealing and sympathetic as Affleck's love interest. James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are accomplished professionals. They are pretty good in almost everything. In the end, "Surviving" is not the worst holiday movie you will ever see. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is unfocused and much of the comedy is forced. The attempts at dark humor come out as dour. Affleck tries hard to be endearingly spastic and overenthusiastic, but comes across as disturbed. His character's cartoon-like character is greatly enhanced when seen next to Gandolfini and O'Hara's more subdued, believable beliefs. Even at the relaxed holiday movie standards, you never fully buy in the Affleck "hire" setup family for X-mas. There are also scenes that border on the surreal in their strangers. The X-mas eve scene filled with incestuous humor (a son was discovered looking at naked, provocative images of her mother), which is not only fun or credible but disturbing. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, the colors of this movie are muddy, almost noirish. The house set, which most of the film takes place, looks scenic and inexpensive. "Surviving" is mostly of interest as the fourth in a number of box office duds (Paycheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl, and this) for Affleck. It is still to see how long the damage will be.
