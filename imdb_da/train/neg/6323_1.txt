This movie is a bad memory from my childhood. This is one of the movies they show kids on a rainy day at school when you can't go to recess and you'd rather see something else. It was at least the way it was when I was in primary school. I just remember HATING this movie. Permitted, I haven't seen it in 15 years or so, and they probably won't use it on rainy days anymore, but I just want to warn everyone: You'd be better off using this to put your kids to sleep than entertaining them. Trust me, choose something else. Though the subject is a bit controversial, the plot is so tame and slow that I can't remember anything about it, except that I didn't like it so much that 15 years later I felt I had to warn you against it.
