Absolute waste, worse fighting scenes than a 20 year old van pond film or American ninja etc. Really bad acting, not a skill in sight throughout the movie is like a cast of wood sculptures. <Br /> <br /> Just look at how badly this movie is, it could have been acceptable in the 80s, but it's a movie in 2006, I don't have much love for this movie as it didn't born in the 80s. <br /> <br /> If you like real fighting movies, check out yes, it is tony jaa in ong behind and the protector, they are real martial arts movies. <br /> <br /> Have a laugh and see it here today you can see the unintentional humor on how grim it is.
