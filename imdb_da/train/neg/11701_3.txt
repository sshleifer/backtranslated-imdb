Just another example of why Stepehn King's books should not be made into movies. (Even Carrie, one of the best, is destroyed in the adaptation from book to screen.) History's performance is about a bold lawyer, always on a diet that "accidentally" kills an old gypsy woman. In court, with the help of the judge and the local police officer, he comes out even though the accident was a kind of guilt when he was not aware when he was driving. The father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse of 3, with our protagonist, Billy (the lawyer) getting thinner and thinner by day. Although the film was kept with the book, for the most part, and has your typical King ending, the play was stolen and felt compelled. We went from one scene to the next without much of anything, such as reading actions in a game. King himself made a como in the movie (kind of like Dave Barry), which reinforces my belief that the authors should remain just that: writers. Leave the actor to the actors. Not that anyone in this movie was so great. I've seen the big characters in movies where they were much better.
