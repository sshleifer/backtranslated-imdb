This movie made me very angry. I desperately wanted to smash the "scientists" and invisible filmmakers during that. Very, very painful to sit through. Sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way. The little good information about brain function / chemistry and quantum theory has been lost in a sea of ​​new agey horse sh * t. The worst offenders were crack pot charlatans Ramtha and Joseph Dispenza. Mr. Dispenza informs us that most people lead the life of the mediocrity and obviously implies that he lives on a higher level. Even the ideas and attitudes that I broadly agree with are presented in such a heavy, handy, clumsy, superior, pretentious, preaching way that I felt like rejecting them. I think that's what made me so angry that they've taken what is really profound aspects of established scientific thought and destroyed them with their new age hump. Much of it is based on the inaccuracy of applying concepts of quantum theory to the macro world. Customize, the dramatized portions of Marlee Matlin are amateurish and cliché. <br /> <br /> Instead, I'd refer people to Bill Bryson's excellent study of science: "A short story of almost everything". There are lots of profound wonders about life and the universe in the actual established science.
