Thanks to the BBC for this show. I used to suffer from an inferiority complex, I hated leaving the house, talking to new people, and I had an overwhelming feeling that people hated me. But after seeing an episode of 4 Non Blondes, my happiness began to change. After episode 2, I started applying for new jobs, wearing fashionable clothes and I actually felt talented. When the series was finished, I drove the sales department to work, beat an abundance of women and often won the karaoke competition in my room. If you ever have a crisis of confidence and don't know where to turn, then take a trip down to Poundland and download the DVD, it is only 99 p.
