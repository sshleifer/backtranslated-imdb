As a big fan of the original movie, it's hard to see this show. The garish set of d√©cor and hardly lit sets deprive any style of this remake. The atmosphere is never there. Instead, it has the look and feel of so many television films from the seventies. Crenna is not a bad choice as Walter Neff, but his snappy wardrobe and "swank" apartment do not match the mood of the original or make him an interesting character. He does his best to make it work, but Samantha Egger is really bad choice. The English accent and California's appearance can't hold a candle for Barbara Stanwick's velvet voice and sex appeal. Lee J. Cobb is trying vigorously to fashion Barton Keyes, but even his performance is just gruff without style. It feels like the TV movie, it reminds me of what a remarkable movie the original is still is.
