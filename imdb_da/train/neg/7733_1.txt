What a disgrace! I checked this out, hoping it would be an undiscovered James Garner gem and what a stink it turned out to be! The production quality was fine, but the plot was undoubtedly lamb and I can honestly say that I am only a few hours older and much stupid now. The film really had no redeeming qualities, and if this kind of thing still comes out, it will give Hallmark a bad name. For those of you who insist on knowing what it was about, it's about nothing, and in this case it's not a good thing. We are exposed to looking at an old ornery woman who is one of the stupid creatures ever to move the earth, which happens to be married to a true girlfriend who is probably the only living in life who could cope with her. She pulls him through a mess to the other, makes him an embarrassing situation after another and is proud of himself all the time. Then the movie ends. What a relief it was! Not worth the time it would take to see it, so do yourself a favor and skip this one, you'll be glad you did if you knew how bad this really is.
