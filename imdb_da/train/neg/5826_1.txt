Slow and beautiful pictures changed each other with sometimes annoying music (you know Bjork) in the background, for the first 75% of the film. If you didn't have enough sleep, it's a good time. <br /> <br /> But in the last 20% of the film director decides to bring the idea of ​​rebirth, revival or otherwise through S&M images: "spiritual lovers" cut each other's bodies with knives. For me it was very disturbing and actually changed the general impression of blending abstract art and images of modern Japanese mystery. <br /> <br /> Operator and director are good but weird. <br /> <br /> Don't enjoy it at all.
