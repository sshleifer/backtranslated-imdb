Trifling romantic drama directed by Clint Eastwood about the loving relationship that grows between a comely hippie (Kay Lenz) and a real estate agent in Los Angeles in his golden year (William Holden, surprisingly gracious within this heavily contracted event). The scripture is small, but not without some thought-provoking passages; Still, the scenario is such a medieval clich√© now that most of the picture comes out as puerile. It may have worked much better with different wires: Holden and Lenz do not fit well (her stature is so small that he seems to be towering over her), making their intimate scenes less moving than simply uncomfortable. Dated, blurry-romantic, and mostly unmemorable. ** from ****
