Was it cautious when Tori complained that her first girlfriend treated her like a robot, and then her new boyfriend (killer) turned out to be an artificial intelligence designer? I think. Scenes that make you thrilled: Montage to a large extent, a stripe tease in a kimono (what do you call it when you seductively put on clothes instead of taking them off?) And a climax of skiing! Fully support the beginning and end, but you can grab a sandwich during the second action when the whole plot happens. Is it better than CO-ED CALL GIRL? Oh. Does Tori make it to paradise or out of the snow itself? Nix.
