Baldwin has really bowed low to make such movies. The writing, the music, almost everything in this movie is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> The sound FX doesn't sound really good, they stick out too much (technical gadgets, etc.) If they try to make a movie about things like this, at least try to get real with it and release them extra beeps and beeps, because these gadgets don't really make loud sounds like that. Naturally sounds like footsteps and it is non-existent, giving it an empty space. <br /> <br /> Management seems to be OK for such a low budget film (I hope it was a low budget production), although it seems rather amateurish at times. <br /> <br /> Most characters seem empty and fake, they simply haven't thrown this movie very well. I could imagine it would have been a better idea to get Baldwin to speak some Spanish than to get Spanish actors to speak English when we all know that theirs is the language that is more vivid and alive; Therefore, if the odd language is used, the performance of the actors is strongly affected. I mean, could anyone finally realize how stupid it is to make international players speak English with a bad accent? It should have been buried a long time ago in film production. Production team ever heard of subtitles? This film again manages to portray the European police as lazy and corrupt, the societies as vulnerable and helpless. I mean, if the plot goes again like "Interpol can't make jack, let's call an American to bring this international syndicate down" or whatever. <br /> <br /> Sony Pictures goes the same way as Columbia before it just produces movies for hell of it. I can imagine that they also have independent respect. Should buyers buy all the dirty titles just because Sony puts something good a couple of times a year? Maybe they should have used the same team as who does Di Que Si - Say I do. It is spoken in Spanish and Paz Vega and Santi Millan does a decent job of keeping the film flowing. Looks and sounds much better! Come on Sony, wake up, produce less, sell more.
