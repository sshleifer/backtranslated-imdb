Think of a non-budget version of Chinese Syndrome controlled by a film student idolizing John Woo and you get 'Power Play'. The idea was good, but the execution, the action and the dialogue completely killed it, not to mention the ridiculous amounts of violence and disaster sequences used to compensate for the lack of substance and the development of the more interesting parts of the film. <Br /> <br /> This is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group, who mysteriously went away after they broke into the offices of a power plant suspected of causing earthquake. The righteous cavalier reporter who goes against what should have been a more ruthless bunch of company cutters has been chased around town (along with someone he speaks to) to "clean" whatever evidence may be in the plant's fault. <br /> Unfortunately, there is no real sense of emergency because the characters interact with much hesitation, coupled with idiotic dialogue and a lot of horrible actions. Not to mention, the viewer, who can only be attracted by the movie to his action genre, is forced to endure an increasing body count and ridiculous amounts of violent shooting em-ups as well as earthquake catastrophe scenes. All the focus was put on the wrong place to apologize for the lack of direction and more interesting sequence of events that should have driven the story. It could have been much better if the filmmakers focused more on a thriller and gained more attention on developing the aspects of corruption in this story. Creepy villains, a naive reporter, and those trying to warn the reporter of the wrong shot. It is formal, but at least it would have been entertaining.
