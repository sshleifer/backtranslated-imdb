I will desperately give this movie a 10 ... I really do. Some movies, especially horror movies are so budget that they are good. A clever cracking ninja scarecrow that can implement corn cabbage as deadly weapons ... surely fits this 'budget for brilliance' system. The depth of the movie is definitely its strong point, and the twists make it implement, keeping the audience at the edge of their seats really running the creepy ... ninja ... puberty-hit ... before thirty-year-old students. .. non-cowboy drawing ... clever-cracking ... son-of-a-bitch scarecrow in the limelight as this year's fateful horror icon. All I can really say is, "Can you dig it" and recommend watching movies like Frankenfish if you enjoy this kind of hilarious horror. <br /> <br /> (WHAT HELLEN IS THE SMOKING!?
