"A treasure of Treasure Hunters is looking in the Caribbean for a hidden fortune. The gold lures the excitement as the men come closer to the treasure's location. "Manfish" is the name of their boat, not a monster. The skeleton giving muscular captain John Bromfield (as Brannigan) his half of the tax card is very good. The old salt Victor Jory (as professor) gives the other half of the card. First mate Lon Chaney Jr. (as Swedish) plays stupid, and sexy Tessa Prendergast (as Alita) protects rooms (not so good, of course). Serious editing and continuity problems mar the picture, which could otherwise have been something. <br /> <br /> *** Manfish (2/56) W. Lee Wilder ~ John Bromfield, Victor Jory, Lon Chaney Jr.
