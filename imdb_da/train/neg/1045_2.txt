Revenge Victor Vargas fails terribly in what it tries most to be: to be real. Unfortunately, there is no reality in this movie. The signs and situations feel completely artificial and false. The reason? Poor routing. Peter Sollett uses all the wrong tools in his arsenal. It seems that Mr. Sollett read a place that did not illuminate his film would give it an authentic feel. Wrong! It just gives it a badly prominent feeling. Similarly, shaking does not give the camera a documentary style for your movie, it just gives the audience a headache and detracts from what's on the screen instead of improving it. Of course, what is on the screen is so painfully false, as if Mr. Sollett wrote his script with the only goal of trying to look "hip" to his Sundance friends and show how "edgy" a filmmaker he is. All in all, the only lasting impression this movie leaves you is what a bad director Mr. Sollett is. Next time, what about taking a few writing and instructor classes?
