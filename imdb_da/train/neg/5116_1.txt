I rented this movie today and thought it might be a good football movie, as I am a big football fan. Boy, was I wrong. This film is far too religious and preaching and is truly unrealistic. This movie pretty much says that if your Christian can get something you want in life easily, like a great football player! You don't become a good footballer by becoming a Christian and asking God, you do it through practice and hard work. All you have to do is ask God and he will give you something .... puh-lease. It's not true at all, duh. I laughed several times because of this embarrassment. The only part that was fun was when they were stupid (the Shultz comic book? No, the guy flying over the Atlantic, etc.) But really, this movie wasn't that big. I do not recommend it, especially if you are not a Christian, lol.
