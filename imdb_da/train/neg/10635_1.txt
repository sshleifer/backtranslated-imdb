There is a remark that one of the heroines was raped by "Russian soldiers" who are completely untrue. This movie should not only appear because of this. <br /> <br /> There is also a statement from someone that the KGB is prosecuting "Jews, gypsies, etc.", who are "worse than Nazis". The KGB sought so-called "Zionist" agents who were (KGB believed) imperialist agents. This is quite different from targeting Jewish as a whole nation that Nazis did. Gypsies were never prosecuted. The KGB was a political tool and was used politically, but from an international point of view. The Communists do not really distinguish between nationalities. <br /> <br /> Whole movies stink like fake. Main hero does not speak Russian, signs in Berlin contain typographical errors, KGB generally looks completely fake. Some so-called "Russian proverbs" are entirely structured and the list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> Not recommended to watch - this movie is full of lies and false stuff. Go to "Good Shepherd" instead.
