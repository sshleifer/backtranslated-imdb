WARNING: I do not advise anyone who has not seen the movie yet to read this comment. Although I haven't seen them all, The Hamilton's certainly delivered a lowsy piece of entertainment that it didn't entertain me at all! I thought that together with the semi-bad play, the stupid plot scheme and the twisted end of the movie, which was very retarded, this movie sucked !!! Okay, so suppressive are people eating other people. Yes ...... note I did not say people to people, not because they are not people, or wait I think they are, OH NO wait, they don't tell you !!!! So okay, are these people cannibals, or are they imbreds, or what are they !!!! I mean, maybe they are just "things" that came here to see what people taste like or are they cannibals who have eaten people for a long time now, or maybe this movie was HHORRIIBBLLEE !! WHERE IT WAS !!! So if you think The Hamilton's is good, I ask you why, why, why, why, why was it so great because for me it was just plain horrible !!! A great BOOOOOOO to The Hamiltons !!! Go see Gravancans, Tooth & Nail, or Borderland for a piece of entertainment !!!!!
