The horror of poverty of the 1930s and the 40s depress hell out of me. God knows I don't mind low budget movies, but those produced during that time have such a dull and shabby look about them - and in the end it's just not that good. "The Corpse Vanishes" is a bit more entertaining than the bottom of the dream as "The Invisible Ghost" and "The Ape Man", but it's not a classic. Bela Lugosi, long past his "Dracula" thriving, plays yet another mad doctor; the unbearable Elizabeth Russell plays his wife. They sleep in coffins because, as Lugosi explains, a dubious young female journalist (Luana Walters), a coffin is much more comfortable than a bed. Ho hum. Angelo Rossitto and Minerva Urecal are also on hand, who might like hardcore fans of '30s and' 40s movies.
