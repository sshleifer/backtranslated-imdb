Who plays in their right mind a lyrical song while depicting an emotional scene between two people? When Flipper confronts his unrighteous wife in the dressing room, the song sung with lyrical content is as high as the dialogue, so one cannot hear what dilution the emotional impact the scene might have had. The scenarios in Annabella were beaten by his father with his fists, a lamp, and then a belt was so cartoon-like to be absurd. This whole movie is a cartoon, the fierce prejudice against whites is literally amazing. The discussion of the black women after the flipper's wife finds out that he has cheated her with a white woman - as if it were a discussion from an oxford debating team, is ridiculous. The violent racism may be possible to endure, but the soundtrack and sound mix of this 'movie' is too much. It was a technically poorly made movie. There is no understanding of the basic craftsmanship of film making, soundtrack, editing, and desperate attempts at great actors trying to keep this film over. I actually felt sorry for Anthony Quinn and wondered why he had accepted a role in this flick - his appearance in this is painful. This is the first movie I have seen by this director and that will be my last.
