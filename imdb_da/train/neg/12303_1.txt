This movie is so bad, it's good - in an unintentional fun way. I couldn't stop seeing it, I laughed so much! It's like a parody of a romantic thriller, except that it's not a parody. <br /> <br /> Alexandra Paul plays Emily Wendell, a repressed preacher's wife who becomes difficult for Luke (Corey Sevier), a hunky and mysterious drive that we eventually learned was in prison; The only thing Sevier's fault is, however, bad to trade! Mind you, he's not worse than the other actors. You get the sense that the actors have * no * idea that they are in a really horrible movie; they play it right. Everything about the movie is bad: the play, the manuscript, the love scenes, pacing, plot twists, choice of music. Climatic scenes are just as ridiculous - first the shooting game in the church, so Luke's last words to Emily - I shouted with laughter. <br /> <br /> Of course, Luke made a lot of weight lifting and ab crunches in prison and we see lots of his naked torso. It's probably the highlight of the movie.
