This is not quite the plumb depth of Creepshow 3, but it comes close. It also uses the same technique to use some of the same actors in multiple roles throughout the anthology, which is at least distracting. It is also quite annoying rips off The Twilight Zone (with the bookstore being comparable to Serling's later night gallery). Unfortunately, the producers and the authors forgot that Serling would build sympathy for his characters before destroying them. None of the characters are particularly sympathetic or interesting to the last segment. <br /> <br /> Framing story: Adam West is ... Now. He does not go the Bruce Wayne / Batman campy 60s route, but he rarely does. He simply plays the non-puzzling "Jay" (which is a vicious spine-calling name to compare with Dr. Terror, Eramus and The Cryptkeeper) and makes some mildly awkward / scary statements. <br /> <br /> Abernathy: Seen Rod Serling is "A Stop in Willoughby"? Then you've seen this. Nutso's wife's red herring is introduced for no reason, but even the protagonist's friend identifies him as a glance. As good as it can be expected, but virtually incoherent. <br /> <br /> Nex's Diner: Reminder of various Serling time trips, mixed with Steve Allen's "A Meeting of Minds." Most of the actors are not that bad (with the exception of Josh Astin as Cassius, who manages to walk, talk and even breathe), and the idea is mildly interesting. But as Abernathy it does not go everywhere. The protagonist raises some fairly reasonable questions, bugs a little (who wouldn't it?), And for some reason he stops being banished to a nuclear water. <br /> <br /> Life Replay: Not a bad little piece and can anticipate both Click and Creepshow 3. I suppose it says something people are fascinated by the magic features of remote controls. The protagonist is mildly sympathetic. Nothing essentially innovative here, but it's okay. <br /> <br /> Fighting Spirit: You see the wrath come a mile away, but as the protagonist has some heart, and it's a decent story of defeat and redemption. /> Finale: So ... why do people put in cold storage in silver lame suits? Do not know. And doesn't make sense. So ... all the protagonists walked into the bookstore and got caught? Kinda undermines the happy end with the boxer (thanks, guys!), And the guy in the first segment died. So how did he get caught? He visited the bookstore before he died, was caught and ... did not die? What? Huh? I suppose this is not expected to make sense because it is supernatural. But still ... Overall: pretty much unlike the two newer Twilight Zone series or some episodes of Tales From the Darkside or Monsters. The last two stories and part of the second is probably worth your time. But there is nothing quite spectacular here.
