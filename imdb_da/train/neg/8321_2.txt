Hayden Christianson and Jessica Alba two of my least favorite actors in this century are kept up in what is, indeed, the flattest attempt to reinvent the already gloomy Butterfly Effect. Awake is so boring and so utterly uninteresting that you'd rather sleep. Terrance Howard, still recovering from the devilish August Rush, sets up a decent fight as the sadistic physician who seems to be full of killing Christianson, and having seen his achievements, will be happy to help . <br /> <br /> Alba is still coming after the Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer. Of course, it is disastrous and as unmatched as she always was. Only once has she ever been quite brilliant at what was in the safe hands of master leader Robert Rodriguez in Sin City. It might be that Jessica alba is not so bad for an actress that most gives her credit for, and perhaps her acting abilities are being let down by a bad script. In that case, it would explain Awake. What about a script that would be ashamed of Plan 9 from outer space. <br /> <br /> Jessica Alba, Hayden Christenson and Terrence Howard star in first-time director / screenwriter Joby Harold's thrilling psychological thriller about a man experiencing the frighteningly common surgical phenomenon known as "aesthetic consciousness" where they placed on the operator's table, remains acutely aware of what is going on around them, even though they remain completely paralyzed and incapable of crying for help. When a successful young man (Christenson) goes under the knife and realizes that the anesthesia has not done his job properly, the horror goes in quickly when his worried wife (Alba) is waiting with anxiety and a scary drama unfolds in the operating room. <br /> <br /> Hope to make for operating tables what Final Destination did for airplanes, this first effort by Director Joby Harold revolves around a blood-freezing operation. The pre-credit sequence tells us that one in 700 people suffers from a phenomenon known as "anesthetic attention" where the patient remains conscious but paralyzed during surgery. Such an unfortunate person is Clayton Beresford Jr. (Hayden Christensen), who finds herself awake during a heart transplant ... and he can feel every cut. <br /> <br /> Intermittent inventive as it is probed away by its torture psyche, Awake fails to inject true terror into its new premise. Spiraling from chilling simplicity to absurd conspiracy, it is prevented by silent turns from Christensen and Jessica Alba. You wish you had beaten a soothing before you see ?? <br /> <br /> VERDICT: Awake is extremely extremely evasive. A pull no stops film that undoubtedly looked better on paper. As a movie though it is very generic and extremely derivative. Awake fails to inject terror into its new premise. The end result is really miserable. Alba and Christian are the least of your worries, as the film's main mistake lies in the inability to scare the audience. Awake is a movie you will probably sleep through.
