I feel much less generous with this movie than others of its ilk. The portrayal of wizards in this century is always done by being so bizarre to be another species. Their antics are so scandalous to be completely fictionalized. Everyone is Napoleon or another historical figure; or they have a fascination with chickens. They are on the make or beat each other. It's as if the screenwriter said, what can I do for them to do without a sense of what madness or even mental illness is. See the wonderful human depiction in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" where the diseases are credible and real. I once worked in a state psychiatric hospital. I didn't see any of these guys. These are too clever and calculate to bring them to life.
