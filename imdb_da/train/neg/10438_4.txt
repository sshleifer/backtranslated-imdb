The movie sucked, it wasn't fun, it wasn't exciting. They tried to make it so bad that it would be good but failed. and think it's cool to like this movie beside the hype, the only reasons why this movie is a success ... the fact that currently 50% voted 10 out of 10 for this movie seems right related To me, either the film that goes public, goes crazy or this voice is unrealistic, which can have many causes and should be addressed. Nevertheless, it is a less than average movie that flourished through mouth to mouth advertising. It is success that can only be described as a marvel for marketing.
