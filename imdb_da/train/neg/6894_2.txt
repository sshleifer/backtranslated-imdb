It's sad when you see what a movie was trying to do, and it is quite obvious that it fell far from the mark. Film students should take this as a lesson and a warning. Would be a candidate has an idea. He wants total control. Then he writes, instructs, produces, his cinematic masterpiece all alone. Usually his concept is far above his budget. Usually he writes an overblown script full of every tag line he can bring. Usually, he is more interested in the great sweep of history rather than the nitty gritty of working with actors on individual scenes. He usually ends with a film that is weak in his attempt to create miracles on a small budget. Usually he ends up with a number of meetings (we can't do justice by calling them scenes) that feels like they were written by a 12 year old. And usually he ends up with badly acted scenes that do not address the viewer. When you look at judges from this perspective, you can immediately tell it is just the usual fare.
