Your first idea that this is a cheesy movie is that it was shot on video, not film. The story coincides, and the production is incredibly sloppy. Note that when the title pair is on a plane that seems to land in Vermont, where they have gone to celebrate their relationship in a civil union ceremony, the plane appears in an airport surrounded by palm trees. Their ceremony - in Vermont - takes place in a garden of tropical plants, including palm trees, which do not last five minutes in the New England climate. On yet another airplane trip, the establishment shot depicts a FedEx freighter that starts. Probably they could only afford to travel in control. As for the plot, this movie expects you to think that Victor, the devoted Christian brother of Arthur, is kicked out of his church when the congregation learns that his BROTHER is gay. Not only that, but the pastor finally puts Victor up with a hitman to get Ben and Arthur killed "to cleanse their sins." Apparently, no one in this church has ever heard of the Ten Commandments. If it wasn't for Jamie Brett Gabel, who is surprisingly effective as Arthur, this movie would have no redeeming features at all.
