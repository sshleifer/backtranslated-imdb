Slagning High the revenge story of a nerdy guy who became the victim of one of the coolest and coldest jokes in the cinema history. Unfortunately, after the promising opening, the girl went straight to hell. A very boring and redundant mess with mediocre slashings and a last half hour sucking on a whole new level of suckiness. The guy who played the nephew killed himself shortly after the girl was released. If you want to rent the girl, stop it after prank and remember, choose life.
