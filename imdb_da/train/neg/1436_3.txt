Oh God. Some of the best talent in British television did this serial and therefore I can only assume they were working under incredible time pressure and had to settle for the first recording of many scenes. There are some scary scenes in this Highland mystery (mostly when the "monster" attacks and we see it from his point of view), but I'm afraid I found most of the story inadvertently fun! Such as the moment when the hero discovers a dismembered corpse on a golf course: oh, there's a hand ... oh, and there's another hand over there ... hmm it's a little scary ... <br /> <br /> For many years, fans of British cult TV shows have struggled to get this series released on VHS or DVD, but the BBC always said no. Now I think I understand why!
