I rented this back in the 80s and honestly can't remember anything specific about the movie - just that it's the worst movie I've ever seen. This is not one of them "it was so bad it was fun". This is not one of them "it was so ugly, it leaves you with a bad feeling" movie. It wasn't even one of them "what was it?" movie. I can't remember the practice of the actors, but it was badly shot, the story was uneven, and it had no definable style. When it was over, I was angry that I had wasted time. <br /> <br /> I've seen lots of movies I didn't understand because of unknown cultures, styles and / or storytelling, but it was clear that these movies had some of these features. Incubus has no. <br /> <br /> In fact, I was NOT considering commenting on this "piece" for fear of anyone seeing it out of curiosity, but I am forced to warn anyone who appreciates movies to skip this movie.
