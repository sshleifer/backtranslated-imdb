The TV productions at the start of the 2000s were between weak and bad. Before brands like (Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives, or Monk) the TV didn't have the right hit yet, which could catch the attention and interests of the 2000s viewer. Titles like (Relic Hunter), (Mutant X), (The Lost World), (Sheena) or even (Baywatch Hawaii) were not encouraging for you to see and follow or at least not so captivating and interesting all the time as before for them. (Special Unit 2) was no exception. In fact, men in black encounter X Files' spoof! (As if these were the special unit 1). But even according to this glorious formula; It didn't work well. It was promising; At that time there was some saturation out of the "supernatural" cases after a decade of many X files already, so the natural spirit to make it too uncomfortable. (Imagine Mulder as a womanizer!). But (Special Unit 2) was not the strongest in this, or a strong one when it comes to making a comic Sci-Fi show. It was very ridiculous where, for example, any sexy situation should become ugly disgusting. It enjoyed the bad taste sickeningly. (Michael Landes) was non-charismatic and mostly unbearable as a comedian. His chemistry with (Alexondra Lee), as well as any suspected sexual attention, was all dull. The Sure show had a fun look, but in general it was unfunny work. It is clear that there was nothing more interesting than its main page. Among (Evan Katz's) other works as co-author and co-producer as (Seven Days) before or (24) later, this must be a low point! Despite the distinctive personality, it was a silly fun for most of the time. Therefore, if that were the goal, they did one of the silliest indeed! And it would really be one of the rarest times to be grateful for the cancellation of a show after 19 episodes of it!
