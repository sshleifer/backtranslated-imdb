This anime series starts amazing: Interesting story, exciting events, interesting characters, beautifully rendered and executed. Not everything is explained immediately and dangles a proper carrot before the viewer and entices the viewer to see each subsequent episode. But imagine the disappointment of finding out that the sci-fi thriller / giant robot adventure is just the backdrop for psycho-babble and quasi-religious pre -achy exploitation. If you want to hear "You're ok. It's good to be you." After being hit by negative slogan and the negative emotions of the characters, it is for you. If you want a good sci-fi girl who is just fun to watch, forget it. Both the original and the alternative conclusions were grossly disappointing to me. All that and this movie was for the sermon.
