It is here. Finally, a movie that I can honestly say is worse than Larry, the cable core: Health Inspector. Still, I'm willing to bet on how Wayne's brothers (hilarious) will make more money than I ever do in my entire life on what is probably one of the top five worst movies all the time outside of my fifth grade outside the class re-enactment of Romo and Juliet. I really mean why anyone would ever see this movie unless they were paid for. The comedy is weak, and all even extremely funny jokes from the spanked plot were probably revealed in advertisements. Finally word is this movie was a horrible letdown for me. And the advertisements looked so promising ...
