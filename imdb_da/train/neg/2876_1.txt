I questioned the motive of the creators of this fictitious account of the motives of the BTK killers. Are they trying to exhibit animal rights activists as sick monsters? Who is responsible for this? Don't they think that the people involved in this monster hurt? What a blatant disrespect and exploitation of the victims! It was like a personality experiment: What disturbs you more, the slaughterhouse or the human murders? They used actual names of some of the victims .... this movie was horrible, disrespectful and insulting! The creators of this movie used this tragedy for their own agenda! People have to wake up and redraw the line!
