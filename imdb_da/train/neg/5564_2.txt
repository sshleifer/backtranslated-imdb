Probably the worst Dolph movie ever. There is nothing you want or expect here. Do not waste your time. Dolph plays a miserable policeman with no interest in life. His brother is killed, and Dolph is trying to figure things out. The character is simply stupid and stumbling around aimlessly. Meaningless.
