A stupid rich guy around 1800 wants to visit a nearby mental asylum to see how a famous doctor cares about his patients. Despite an initially hostile answer, he is soon invited warmly and given a tour of the good doctor. And as the doctor shows him, he speaks and speaks and speaks !!! And as he speaks, loonies run crazy here and there is nothing particularly productive. While there is such action here and there (and some of it is quite disruptive), it is amazing how boring and cerebral it is - lacking life and energy, which is strange to a scare. Even a guy who thinks he's a chicken and dress like one gets pretty tiring. The longer this trip takes the guest, the more disruptive it becomes, until eventually you realize that the inmates have taken over the hospital and tortured their users. Once again, in spite of this twist, the movie is incredibly lifeless in many places - especially when it moves very slowly, as a bizarre ceremony takes place or people just wander around the set. Only when the workers from asylum found in a prison cell starving, the film has some real influence. Considering this plot, it's probably hard to imagine making it boring, but the people who made this cheap movie have! Now with the same plot and competent writing, acting and direction, this may have been an interesting and worthy movie. <br /> <br /> You now know I'm thinking about it, it was plotted by one of the episodes of the original "Star Trek" TV show! You know, the one with "Lord Garth - Master of the Universe" and Kirk and Spock are being held captive by this bile and his crazy followers. <br /> <br /> A final note: The movie has some nudity here and there and includes a rape scene, so be aware - it's not for kids. In fact, considering how worthless the movie is, it's not for anyone! But with the version included in "50 Movie Pack - Chilling Classics", the print is so incredibly bad that it is difficult to see all this meat because the pressure is so dark.
