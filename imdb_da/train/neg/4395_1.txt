December holiday specials, like the original Frosty, should be richly produced with quality music and a healthy but light-weight story. They should have a touch of the holiday's mysterious magic. Basically, they must look, sound and feel ... yes, "special" and they must have a decent and appropriate December holiday subtitle. So when I saw the Legend of Frosty snow in the TV listings, I got my kids (6 and 8) pumped up for it by telling them the story of the original Frosty and passionate about how much I enjoyed it as a child. As my wife and children cozied up on the couch to watch the movie the expectations were high, but 10 minutes in it were my kids gaping and my wife and I gave each other the "look" and rolled our eyes. After 35 minutes my children actually asked to go to bed - I suppose they were tired of the insensitive language and meaningless, broken segments. I was actually embarrassed by their (and my) disappointment with this movie. Unfortunately, the Legend of Frosty Snowman is more like a bad episode of rather weird parenting cross with a worse than normal episode of Sponge Bob than a classic holiday movie. Don't make me wrong ... these shows are fine and I like them just as much as the next guy, but when I see a little weird parents or sponge, my low expectations (for mediocre, off-color, zero subtext, mind numbing episodes) are always satisfied. <br /> <br /> We chose some good books and spent the rest of the evening reading together. A much better choice than the embarrassingly bad Legend of Frosty the Snowman.
