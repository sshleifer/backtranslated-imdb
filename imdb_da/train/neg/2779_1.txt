Obviously, when you offer an actor enough money, they will do something. I'm not sure how much John Rys-Daves got, but most of the money he made should go to his fans as an excuse to be associated with such a ROTTEN movie. The special effects were worse than the effects of the 1950s B-films and the play of the rest of the casting was even worse. How much the play was a child gave the next best performance in my opinion. The English was terribly accent and I don't think anyone could really speak English, they just remember how the words should sound instead of remembering the script and trying to make their character both "life-like" and true.
