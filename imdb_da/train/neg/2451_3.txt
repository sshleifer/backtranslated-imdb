This movie causes more accidental laughter than anything else I've ever seen. Really, if you're a Tolkien fan, just rent it to laugh with your friends. I will not be the millionth person to distinguish his mistakes ... all I want to say is that the movie (for me, anyway) lost important points to make my favorite character, Sam, a bumbling idiot. Shame, shame ... 3/10
