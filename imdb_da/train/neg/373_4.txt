Blank Check is a movie I watched on TV one day, and like most movies they aired on TV Blank Check was not as good. First of all, no one I've ever met is seen Blank Check, and it includes people who grew up in the 90s. Also Blank Check will not be remembered in the 00s either simply because of the fact that it will be overshadowed by pixar's movies. I wouldn't call Blank Check a bad movie, but it's not entertaining either. (Or at least it's not for anyone over the age of 6) Blank Check is not an entertaining movie because nothing about it is original. Everything just makes you go "what haven't I seen before?" Blank Check rips off and tries to deposit on everything from Richie Rich to Home Alone (Which weirdly both Macaulay Culkin has in it). Blank Check is not a bad movie, but it deserves to fade in ambiguity.
