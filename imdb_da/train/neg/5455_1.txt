Saw this work at a film party in CA. My God, what did the instructor think? Film professors should use this film as a case study on what should NOT be done when making a short film. First, this project makes absolutely no sense. The movie takes place partly in "The Waystation", a stupid vapid bar in the middle of nothing where nothing really happens. <br /> <br /> It is beyond evil. So bad that I almost thought it was a comedy. The leading actress Julia Reading is a step in the play of most amateur porn movies. There are one or two decent performances, including the guys who played Jacob and Fenner, but it's like the director had no idea how to work or use his thespians. The only thing worse than the play was the dialogue, which was absurd. The author (who I assume is also the director) writes each character as if they are reading for a cartoon villain. <br /> <br /> The overall production value is pretty good, but to be honest with a movie this is bad it is easy to overlook it. The production design is pretty good, although Waystation looks like any ordinary rod. Costumes and makeup are okay, and I understand that production was working on a low budget. It's just when the characters speak, or they try to push the plot forward, the movie unravels into a muck crap. As I have said, this movie is god horrible. It is as much as the director / writer so many sci-fi movies and threw all the parts he liked in a blender and came up with this. My only hope is that he used other people's money on this because if he used his own, he was a total sucker.
