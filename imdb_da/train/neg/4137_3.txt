I have a high level of tolerance for crap, so I was looking forward to this. It did not disappoint. Apparently based on Sheridan Le Fanu's classic Carmilla, it follows a father and a daughter in search of a female vampire who fortunately is traveling with them. Then we have Santa Claus (or the general he likes to be called here) running over random zombies. Did I say there was a zombie outbreak? The dead return to life, but no one seems too worried. We have construction worker zombies, soldiers' zombies and even St.Trinian schoolgirl zombies. Apparently, Santa Claus is seeking his daughter, who has been transformed into a vampire. Oh wait, there are no vampires, the girl is in a lunatic asylum, and Carmilla is the nurse, or is she? The zombies are back and Santa is angry. Lesbian sex, I like vampires and I like zombies, but I especially like lesbian sex. Nothing like some simulated cunnilingus to get the juices floating. When should we watch vampires fight zombies? Is she a vampire or is she crazy? Or both? Is Carmilla a hot sexy lesbian vampire or a nurse? More cunnilingus, you can never have enough cunnilingus. Here comes the St.Trinian zombies. Chain saw time !! More lesbian sex then kills the zombies and eats the vampires. I think the zombies won, or did they? Reason? Who needs a plot when you have lesbian vampires and schoolgirl zombies? And cunnilingus?
