I'm sure Operations Dames were a favorite on drive-ins back in the day. There is absolutely nothing in the way of a plot that you might miss if you were otherwise busy. And if you need to get in the mood for other activities, you've got some curvy cuts on the screen to get you in the mood. <br /> <br /> There isn't much that Operations Dames has for it. It is set in the Korean War, where a platoon of GIs along with a British thumb becomes a little too far ahead and must return to the UN lines. Bad enough already, but these guys also come across a stranded bunch of USO girls and their choreographer in the same situation. <br /> <br /> You know what's sad about this movie that it took female generations to finally be accepted into the army and in combat situations. These bimbos from the USO put women's liberation back light years. In fact, it is not even the hard-bitten professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of those men who can hold it in their pants. <br /> <br /> But it was better to recall what they were at the driveway. This name is no better than I do not recognize any of them for any single effort. Operations ladies are definitely a teamflop.
