The wife of a stage producer in London hopes to rectify the American song and dance man starring in her husband's latest show with an acquaintance, an American girl who makes her living modeling model in community circles. Unfortunately, the couple has already met alone when the girl thinks the guy is actually the show producer married to his friend (the fact that he does not wear a wedding ring should have discouraged misunderstandings!). Wafty Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical is gradually being pulled back to the ground by Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott's idiotic script full of youth behavior. Astaire and Rogers do not just meet sweet - they meet ridiculously (he's tap-dancing like a lunatic in the hotel's suite of hers and her complaints). The 1935 audience probably did not care how these two would come together - as long as they did and luckily. Seen today, the central signs do not seem to have any motivation to end in each other's arms: he pleads her with flowers (after telling his friend he will remain "fancy free" in the love section) and she gives him the brush. Nothing that a little dance couldn't cure! This glamorous twosome is as deliberately unreal as the London and Venice settings, but we simply see because the leaders are Fred and Ginger. It's a fantasy for garden-nots ... those who don't mind the dumbed-down plot. The musical moments break up monotony in the constructed scenario, but fail to transcend the surrounding petty. ** from ****
