The hardest thing about this movie is to say something positive about it. The characters were stereotypical "white trash", the movie's "plot" was stunted from the start, and the worst feature of this movie was that nudity was so obvious from body doubles it was fun. It was regrettably the only fun thing in the movie. Mrs Jenkins would be better served if in the future she would refrain from using her life story to "entertain" people. It was simply so bad. The one positive aspect of this movie (this has nothing to do with the film's lack of quality) is that my brother has been paying out the money to this stink.
