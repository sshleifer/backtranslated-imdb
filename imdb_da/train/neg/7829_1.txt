In the early 90s, many independent films brought "unnoticed" and "off-beat", where a particular subgenre is the semi-spiritual desert crime film. Others of note are "Wild at Heart", "From Dusk To Dawn" and to some extent "Natural Born Killers". Good movies like the wasted junk like "Highway 666", "Destiny Turns on the Radio" and this outrageously surreal masterpiece "Under The Hula Moon". It's a comedy that targets a particular emotional tone, achieves it, but continues to annoy. While the pursuit of the desert spirit world and the casting of Chris Penn are good ideas, the film is not dirty enough or hard enough to be a good crime film and is not focused enough to laugh at really being a comedy. I won't blow the end, but let's just say it's bad. The film is basically a bad side effect of gene cancer. This is indie mania's dregs.
