I want to be honest, it's one of the worst movies ever. If not, it is very close. Ever seen a bad teen soap opera. Well, it's like one of them. Except worse. For example: (POSSIBLE SPOILER) girl: I want to go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> The guy: everything we need is here. <br /> <br /> girl: but I'll take another place. <br /> guy: I take you somewhere else. <br /> <br /> ... After completing this line, they have sex. The music is bad pop and bad punk rock. If you've ever read the book, avoid this movie like the plague. They completely change the characters' characters and events. In addition, they just drop things off. Finally, the film ends before the book is finished. It's an AWFUL movie. So, if you haven't read the book, don't see it. If you have read the book, burn it (the movie). If you like stupid teenage soap operas that are lower in quality than your average low-quality teenage soap opera, go for it. So again, should we expect something other than MTV?
