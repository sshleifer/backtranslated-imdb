The only thing that happened to me when I looked at this drive was that I would never have the time I used to see here again. If you want to see Stacey Keach and Michael Dorn try to earn what must have been, then the repayments on a holiday home are then matched. Wood-like, bad special effects, the only comical highlight was while our alien heroes were in female form, and this is over as soon as she has made her mandatory b-movie naked sex scene within 30 minutes of the movie. The opportunity to have done what could have been a decent movie disappears the moment Nicole Eggbert looks at the bar in a bar within 30 seconds, while the police, the military and the Joe public do not use cotton that the woman drinks coffee, must Don't use the cup handle and carry four jumpers at once. Of course, she must be from another planet. Just where I wish I was when this movie was on.
