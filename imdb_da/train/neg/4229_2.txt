I'm a big fan of low budget horror movies like this, but come on! This must be the worst piece of monkey S @ # t I've ever seen! I ignored the reviews posted on this site and found that it would fall into my taste in horror, but I got bored and off. Let's see: Wardrobe: consisted of cheap cameo outfits and painters outfits from home depot. The masks were made from what looks like tin foil. <br /> <br /> The Gore: The Gore was pretty good, I have to give it. But Ittenbach's burning moon was better for a low budget film. <br /> <br /> Acting: Be horrible! I didn't mind dubbing. I find this humorous as in Ittenbach's "Premutos" (great movie). The fighting sequences were pi $$ poor. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Don't see any of Schnaa's movies. There are much better directors like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach with films of the same kind and subject. Check out Premutos, House of Blood, Schramm and Nekromants.
