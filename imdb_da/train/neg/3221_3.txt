I saw this on the tube last night. The actor involved first got my attention. The first scenes were the attention of getters. Some funny some sad. Good character development. I felt the last third of the film diverged. If it wasn't at the start of the movie, I'd have stopped watching. I kept an eye on how it was connected. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I feel it never happened. In particular, I did not like the expansion period that several of the characters spoke Yiddish (?). Was it the other shoe? <br /> <br /> Would I recommend? No, I think not. As other reviewers mention much of the snake is dated (60's jive), but it wasn't too distracting. The end completely knocked me off.
