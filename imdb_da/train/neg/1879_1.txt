It's hard to believe this is a successor to Henry Fool. Hard to believe that the same director and actors were involved in both films. While Henry Fool is refreshing, witty, comical, Fay Grim is slow, dull and does not go anywhere. Where's the white gone? I'm confused. <br /> <br /> It's been 10 years since I saw Henry Fool and many of its dialogues and scenes are still alive in my memory. Fay Grim is painful to see. These are no flaws in the actors who are good (Parker Posey) or big (Jeff Goldblum) - the blame lies entirely with the plot, dialogue and even some of the movie (low budget is no excuse). A huge disappointment. <br /> <br /> Sorry I couldn't pay attention to the plot, I was so boring, so disappointed ... If you enjoyed this one, you can't enjoy Henry Fool so much ... the two movies have absolutely nothing to do with each other ... there is no continuity in the person's personalities ... it's all a fraud to entice Henry Fool's fans to see the sequel. <br /> <br /> I turn this on now - Henry in a kind of prison with a Taliban?!?!
