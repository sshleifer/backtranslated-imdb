Joe Don's opening line says everything about this movie. It takes place on the island of Malta (island of pathetic men) and involves Joe Don Baker to track an Italian mobster. Joe Don's character is called Geronimo (pronounced Heronimo) and all he does in this movie is shooting people and being arrested over and over agin. Everyone in the movie hates him, just as everyone hates Greydon Clark. I liked a former Greydon picture, "Angel's Revenge," because it was a shirne for thrite-year-old boys. Avoid this movie at all costs !!
