This movie is much like the movie Hostel, except with * BAD * acting and not much excitement. The Gore elements are there, but you do not feel the signs, which makes the violence not very effective. Some parts are just strange ... like forcing a snake into the throat. What happens to it? Should it be scary or gory? It's just a little stupid. As far as torture is concerned, there is really no one (except that the guy gets blown in the beginning, as they do not show anyway). The biggest evil guy says "cause them to die slowly", but the butcher kills them all very quickly. The deaths are all relatively quick. Yes, I'm looking at the "unrated" version. So in general, not the worst doing movie I've seen, but not at all good either. You won't miss anything if you skip this one.
