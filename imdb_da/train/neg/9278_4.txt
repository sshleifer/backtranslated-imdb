That I saw this whole movie says something about it ... or me. It's not a good movie. Terrible indeed. But horrible in the way that kept my attention in the perverted way that is akin to seeing a tragedy and not being able to look away. It would have made a good MST3K topic! <br /> <br /> Most of the things that make a horrible movie enjoyable are here: poor dialogue, inappropriate music, constructed plot sequences, ridiculous pseudoscience. You range on slo-mo death sequences, the poor victims with mouth agape and waaaaaaaay too much time to consider their impending doom facing the outrageously savior of their deaths. Your heart will be heated by old action scene cliches, like when two women fight for a gun and it goes out, but who's shot? Both look at themselves, then the other, then themselves, then (apparently 15 minutes later), finally goes down. You will sing (in Latin of course) with the paths that turn into a horrible death toll that in a moment threatened to make the movie a twisted musical. <br /> <br /> So if you think I'm making it a movie, it's getting better, so this can be a decent choice for you. It's not as fun as my current sci-fi schlock favorite, "De Live" with Rowdy Roddy Piper, but it's fun to see than weed-hot movies like Omen II or III. <br /> <br /> I give it 4 out of 10
