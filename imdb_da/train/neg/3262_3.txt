I was fortunate enough to meet George Pal (and still have my DS: TMOB poster autographed by him) at a conference shortly after the release and asked him why he chose to make the movie "camp". Before he could answer, two studio flacks were intercepted and talked to me about how the studio "knew best" and how "no one would take such a film seriously". I had read Bantam reprints for a couple of years thanks to a friend (ComiCon 1970s participants will revoke Blackhawk and his band? I was in it for a few years) and had higher hopes than what we got. <br /> <br /> Flacks insisted that no high adventure would ever be done seriously and therefore "camp" was the only way. Several other fans jumped in on my side, with Pal listening as best he could. At the end of the small event, Pal came up to us and apologized for wishing he could have done more and better. <br /> <br /> STAR WARS put the lie to flacks and a year after Pal's death, Spielberg and Lucas turned out that Doc Savage could have been the next big movie franchise ... if it hadn't been too flack. <br /> <br /> Release the memory or story of Doc and the movie would have been worth a 6/10 rating as nothing more than a thoughtless popcorn seller. <br /> <br /> But the destruction of the inheritance was no less an abomination than killing a baby in the crib. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage can still come to the screen and survive the inevitable comparisons of the uninformed Indiana Jones, but it must be done completely and honestly to regain the glory we should expect from the first American superhero. <br /> <br /> PAGE NOTES: Yes, there was another script for ARCHENEMY OF EVIL, and that's much more serious. Yes, there was at the same time footage shot, but mostly establishing shots and very little with actors. And yes, there's a one-sheet of Ron Ely jumping over a wall and bursting with something over his shoulder with a specially built bronze gun. Ely wears a boot over a button down white shirt with a bronze tie, and the words "DOC SAVAGE: ARCHENEMY OF EVIL ... Coming Next Summer!" POSTSCRIPT: If anyone knows who the studio flacks, followed George Pal in 1975 to San Diego for the convention, slamming the idiots on the side of the head and calling them idiots as they are. At that time, they made dorobnobs and Fu Manchu in stripes and baggy canvas pants and brought Paramount portfolios.
