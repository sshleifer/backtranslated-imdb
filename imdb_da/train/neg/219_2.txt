it could have been a good movie if it had explored something more interesting than just the surface of a lesbian relationship, if it was the intention of the movie ... it is quite predictable not to mention that the two girls resemble the Russian group tATu. ..sammentr√¶f? I do not think. There is nothing original in this movie to support it so they have to use something that is already famous. You know the recipe. The other actors ... Well, I just don't know what their role should be. Most of them are well-known people in Romania, and I have to mention some of them are not even actors (eg, Mihaela Radulescu) .SO to sum it up: "girl band tatty" + desperate / publicity needs "actors" + a non-existent plot + the opportunity to use bad language to shock = love ill .... too bad ... the idea was good, though ... and I am serious about commenting on the title ...
