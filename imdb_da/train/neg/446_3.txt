This was disappointing. It started well enough, but as it went on and lost any opportunity to hover, it fell flat. Maria Schrader's play is horrible, never seems to mean what she says or even knows what she says until she says it. She showed no true feeling at all, not for her beloved goy or her mother's story. As she with Lena seemed to have suffered more than an academic interest in Lena's story. There never seemed to be a genuine relationship between Lena and her mother unless mother seemed to have a good time at the wedding, which is not much. The supposed parallel between Hannah's "mixed" romance and her mother's relationship with her father was as clich√© as they come, and yet failed anyway. The wedding was completely convincing and a stupid finish. The highlight of the protest was uninspiring, and whatever Lena had or had not done to influence the outcome, she would surely have shown a sense of complexity at the time, a haunted look, an inexplicable ambivalence. In fact, none of the characters in the film had any depth or spark. It was very hard to worry about any of them, even little Ruth. Everything with Luis was a distraction. (Why did she beat him when he was on the phone from the hotel? There was no connection or explanation for that.) If any reference to him was removed, it would not be noticed. <br /> <br /> A simple story that was confused by bad character development (who was whose mother, again?) weak actor and controls what made everyone look like they were acting. You could almost hear "quiet on the set!". I began to think it was worth 7, but when the movie went, it quickly fell to a 4, and then earned a 3 after the bride's scene. It was so cold and sterile a movie I've seen. A terrible waste of a good story.
