No place near the original. It is quite accurate copy that brings nothing new to the story. But the control is very poor. Basinger is weak - without good management. Baldwin is simply another league compared to McQueen. I just saw it out of curiosity, was a big fan of Peckinpah's masterpiece, and I got what I thought. Almost a B-movie with second rate acts and controls. I wasn't even disappointed, I just don't know what they were trying to do. This remake does not attempt to play with the original material, it is not a tribute and actually lacks a really good actor in his era. It reminds me of a poor xerox copy of a wonderful photograph. <br /> This is a complete waste of your time. Save yourself 2 hours or see the original (again :)))
