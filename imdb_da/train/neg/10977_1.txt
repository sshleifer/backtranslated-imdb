I live in Ottawa where this movie was made and I really wish it hadn't been. This is a godly flick. I'm really trying to support independent movies, but there is this stigma attached to some indie and the stigma is: Indie Films Blow. Well, this movie doesn't matter to throw this curse. The actor, the author, director Brett Kelly does nothing to contribute to the genre, but he rather skips tired clich√©s from film past. I'm really tired of threatening evil-looking characters who lurk in the shadows and bid on the unsuspecting, it's too exaggerated. <br /> <br /> I can especially remember a scene especially at the end of the girl, where the whole scene is lit by headlights. Now, some can say that this was an effect that was used to create mood and excitement, but unfortunately it was to present the wonderful budget for this movie. Also for a movie that dares to call itself horror, a viewer will be hard pressed to find a real gore, except for a few scenes of corn syrup and red food color. <br /> <br /> The biggest thing that pulls this movie down is the pacing and lack of character development, the basic plot being that children are kidnapped and parents must track this Bonesetter fellow before a certain time in order to Get their children back. Not that this concept tugs me, but I didn't find it really credible that when the two main characters, both who have lost children find time to get along with each other. This is done in such a short time that it is unthinkable, my first priority would be to get my daughter back and at least get to know the lady before he came out with her. <br /> <br /> The last point I have is .... and I don't want to hold this against Kelly, but the movie is shot solely on boring, numb video, and it really takes away the tense moments would have oozed style of film. Although if this movie was given a million dollar makeover and redirecting the story and boring plays and llamas, everything could not keep this movie overflowing. My only hope is that something happens to prevent Brett Kelly from making a sequel that has been reported on his site, a sequel that was half written in a meeting. <br /> <br /> Lord helps us all.
