Naming the most pathetic piece of shit in movie history is not an easy task, the candidates are so abundant, but Nemesis 2 has been my personal favorite ever since I saw it. It was so fun we had to rent it again the next day, and again I laughed so hard I literally rolled on the floor. (This usually only happens when I see Monty Python's "Scott of the Antarctic".) <br /> <br /> An overwhelming feeling of victory gets hold of the viewer. I am totally confused that this lumpy home video has ever made it to the production stage. It must be a sequel, but has no apparent connection at all with the first movie. The hero has the same name, but this time, "Alex" is female, even though it took us halfway into the movie to stop guessing, what about all the muscles and the barbaric nomad outfit! <br /> <br /> There is really no plot whatsoever, it is just a long-standing chase scene, only it is so slow and pointless to call it a chase scene making it feel more interesting than it really is. There is almost no dialogue that equally well takes into account the quality of it, and then the movie suddenly just comes to an end after a blatant action scene with lots of gasoline explosions without ever explaining what it was all about . Fortunately, it never gets boring because there is always something stupid and false. <br /> <br /> Terrible movies are usually just boring, but Nemesis 2 is a perfect blend of over-seriousness and utterly accidental wackiness that is truly entertaining. Rent this movie or buy it yourself, you won't be disappointed!
