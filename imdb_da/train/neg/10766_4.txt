Anyone who sees Tammuz's childhood parents knows that this is a director who can do better. Let's hope this was not the case with too many hands in the pool (Telefilm anyone?), And that was the case with other tricks. The signs are one-dimensional and over used. However, the landscape is stunning and shows beautiful Northwestern Pacific. <br /> <br /> The camera is amazing. Shot almost completely outside, the pictures are sharp and beautiful. You can almost smell the wind blowing through the leaves. Technically, this movie is as sound as it comes - it just lacks a heart.
