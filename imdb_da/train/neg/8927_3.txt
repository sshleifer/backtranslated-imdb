Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed !!!) gets a sex change from a doctor (John Carradine - dead) and comes out as Myra (Raquel Welch). Then she decides to destroy male masculinity (or something) and continues to teach film history at a play school run by lecherous John Huston (not asking) and breaking up a young happy couple (young, handsome, hunky Roger the Lord and Farrah Fawcett - yes Farrah Fawcett). <br /> <br /> They took a great novel by Gore Vidal, who was unmistakable and of course tried to film it. They also hired an English guy with a particular anti-American attitude and hired a lot of doubtful talent actors (Welch, Reed) and arguing old professionals (Huston, Carradine, Andy Devine, Jim Backus, Mae West), threw it all and .... BREATHING !!! An absolute disaster. <br /> <br /> The movie received an X rating at the release (it has been lowered to an R), mainly due to a really tasteless scene where Welch sodomizes Rusty (Roger Lord) and a scene where Welch tries having sex with Fawcett. <br /> <br /> The movie is very scattershot ... scenes jump everywhere and people say and do things that don't make sense. It's not good at all, but I never got sad. <br /> <br /> Acting varies wildly ... Reed is terrible ... really sorry. Huston chews the landscape again and again and again to a nauseating extreme. Welch is actually not bad as Myra, but her lines make no sense, so you never know what to do about her. West is hardly in the movie (a blessing), and it is really bad to hear a woman nearly 80 years old who bursts sex jokes. The Roger Lord (what happened to ...) was very young, beautiful and not bad like Rusty. Fawcett is ok. <br /> <br /> It's hard to find things to say about this ... you just look at it in disbelief. A must see movie - to believe !!!!
