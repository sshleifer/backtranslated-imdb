I'm stunned to find out how many fans this show has. Have not said that friends were at best an "average" sitcom, and not as big as others have. Let's see it if it wasn't for casting Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston and Matt Le Blanc, who knows if this show would last as long as it did. I very much doubt that. Although the series was progressing, friends became more progressively predictable, boring and boring that I could not care less about the characters that they most overestimated in television history - or their situation, nor who slept with whom. And it went from being fun in the first four seasons to occasional fun. And even though it had all these A-list Hollywood actors from the movie world, I still didn't disturb. The writing in friends was outdated that I lost interest in this show from the sixth season until the end it was predictable to say the least. What was annoying was that it lasted ten seasons, while some of my favorite shows lasted only for three, four seasons and were eventually canceled and taken off the air for good. The performance should have been stopped immediately, as throwing wanted larger wages. In fact, it was as much as the series fell, the show was bigger than the actors themselves, not the other way around. <br /> <br /> When it ended in 2004, I was so relieved to see the back of this sitcom. Now it's a friendship that comes to our TV screens very soon. And yet, for one, I don't want to look forward to it at all.
