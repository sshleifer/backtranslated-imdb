When I read the back of the DVD case, I thought it sounded very interesting ... so ... I had my mother throw it in the pile of movies in the "4 to 20 dollars" section of Blockbuster. When we got home and popped into the movie ... twenty minutes into it, we found ourselves turning to each other, "this suck. Let's put something else in." I admit that some of the lines from the friends in the cafe made us smile a little. But come on, at least get some decent actors! Every time in a movie, if the play is bad and the movie does not go at a painfully slow pace and actually seems interesting, I can gut it out and have a few laughs about how they are passing (or below) their lines. But I can only take so much. Crying scenes looked as if the actors had hysterical laughter, there was no delivery for their lines ... amateur doesn't even come close to the actor in this movie. Anyone who came here to have said that this movie was good should have been on some really good stuff while watching the movie. It's the most pointless thing I've ever had the displeasure to see. Don't look or buy this movie !!!!!
