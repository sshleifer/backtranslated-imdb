Surprisingly, it had a plot! ;) I've seen movies with a smaller plot (I don't want to mention Asian movies but ...). I thought the camera was not bad at all for a cheap movie like this, and the atmosphere wasn't that bad. There is no real reason for most things people do and the way they respond to what happens. Although I think about a lot of movies, it was at least terrible. <br /> <br /> It ripped some movies so much for just scenes. The action was bad, but I've seen worse. The movie was bad, but I've seen worse. Watching this movie is an experience of boredom, laughter, desire of death, sadism, ridicule and low-level entertainment. <br /> <br /> So if you like gory movies with stupid sites, it's the right movie for you. <br /> <br /> I gave it 3/10 because it can be entertaining if you don't expect to see a good movie and you have the right mood.
