I really liked this show, once at a time. That's until I realized all the errors in it. It's so unrealistic. I know it's fiction, but it's not even the least credible. Here's why. ** Spoilers in front of people ... ** Do we really believe that a child like Yugi would have descended from a pharaoh in ancient Egypt? C'mon! He is the greatest geek on the earth's surface. And what about Pharaoh's hair (including Atem and / or Yami's)? Lastly, I checked that the pharaohs were shaved (except for a little bit of hair on top of the head) and had great hats. <br /> <br /> And we should be convinced that an evil wealthy boy's genius, Seto Kaiba, can legally run a successful business while still having the time to go to a creepy little school like 'Domino High '? Puh-leeze! First, he must legally be an adult to run a business. And it wouldn't make him too much of a brilliant because he would be the only adult in his class. And secondly, why should he attend a school like 'Domino High' when his business is clearly successful enough to attend a fancy snobbish academy? Plus, the site's plots with their little brother are so juicy and paralyzed. Every time you turn around, the kid has been kidnapped by goons for baddie. * yawn * Nothing new, nothing new. <br /> <br /> Joey is the poor child who lives with a goodbye to father. It says that Joey earns all the money to go to school because his father is an alcoholic, but you never even see Joey doing anything like work. He doesn't even mention work. And his sister Serenity is a complete moron. Why would she choose a snob like Duke (who dressed her brother in a dog suit and publicly humiliated him on television) over a lovely guy like Tristan? Is she really so clueless? Various characters during the show get possession of demonic forces, get their souls stolen by demonic forces and fall prey to mental illness. (Oh, it's child-proof, NOT.) Tea is the typical girl-next-door type whose sole purpose is to be Yugi / Yami's girlfriend. And while she has some cold points for her, she just doesn't have enough time to shine as a protagonist. <br /> <br /> The animation is simply horrible. All signs look sick and anorexic. The perspectives are awful (especially when approaching someone else's hand) and the colors look good, but not star. <br /> <br /> But the worst ploth hole in the series was the fact that Yami says his Millennium Puzzle can send souls back to their bodies. If so, how did he first and foremost save Yugi's grandfather when Pegasus stole his soul and saved himself in the trouble of getting it back? All it really is is a commercial one for itself. The only positive side to it is "Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abridged Series" by LittleKuriboh. <br /> <br /> Please. Worth doing something more. Like, see the abbreviated version. <br /> <br /> 1/10
