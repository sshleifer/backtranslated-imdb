This was a silly movie with a predictable story and horrible acting !! Willy Nelson was as stiff as his braids. The movie just seemed like a very long ad for the bright red lipstick that Jessica Simpson wore - especially as there were so many close-ups on her face. The premise was not entertaining and, as I said, sooooooo predictable. Whatever money was spent on making this movie was a shameful waste. Any reference to other old Marilyn Monroe movies has not improved the Blonde Ambition view at all. It was so incredible too - Jessica Simpson could step into an executive secretary at the drop of a hat - it was ridiculous !!!
