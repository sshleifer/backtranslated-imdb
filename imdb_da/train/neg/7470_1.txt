In SÃ£o Paulo, the upper middle class teenagers Cristiano, Chico and Gabriel have just joined the university and on the threshold of the opening class they go to a party with drugs and spirits. The next day, after their classes, the date of Cristiano in the previous night comes to his house and the three friends rape the girl. The girl dies, they panic and decide to get rid of the body, but Cristiano's mother comes, scares with Gabriel and rolls the stairs and breaks her neck. The trio decides to dump and burn the bodies in a landfill, but during the night other tragedies occur. The polemic and shameful "Cama de Gato" is an overstated pretentious crap about the alienation of youth, and is certainly the worst Brazilian movie I've seen in many years. The low, tragic and dark story is actually a black comedy comedy with bad taste. The play is not fun, with stupid lines and dialogues, and boring, manipulative and stupid images with interviews with moron's teens at the beginning and in the end. The action is horrible, apparently with many improvisations, but no talent, and I was disappointed with the presence of the promising Caio Blat in this bin. The camera, framing, filmography and edition are amateurish and of very low quality. The sound is horrible, and in many parts it is impossible to understand what the actors and actors are talking about (probably this is a plus as this flickers sucks). The Bang band is very realistic and is used to promote this mediocre movie in a very poor marketing of sex exploitation. My voice is a (terrible) one. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cama de Gato" ("Bed of the Cat")
