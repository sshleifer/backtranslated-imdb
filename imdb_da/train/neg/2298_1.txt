Here are some examples of Pat Robertsons doubtfully arguing "relatively good track record" on predictions <br /> <br /> In his highly reported January 2 issue of Christian Broadcasting Network's 700 Club, where he predicted that would be "very serious terrorist attacks" and "mass killings" in the US in the "second half" of 2007, hosts Pat Robertson boasted that he had "a relatively good track record" on previous predictions. But a review of Robertson's 2006 New Year's predictions undermines this claim. For example, he suggested that: <br /> <br /> * "President Bush will strengthen." ERROR <br /> <br /> * The choice of autumn will be incredible, but the outcome of the war and the success of the economy will leave the Republicans. "WRONG <br /> <br /> *" The war in Iraq will come to a successful conclusion. We begin to withdraw troops by the end of this year. "WAY WRONG <br /> Further, as a reported January 3 Associated Press article, Robertson has the story of making questionable predictions: <br /> < Broadcaster predicted in January 2004 that President Bush would easily win re-election, Bush won 51% of the vote, and beats Democratic Sen. John Kerry from Massachusetts WRONG <br /> In 2005, Robertson predicted Bush wanted victory after victory in his second period, saying that social security reform proposals would be wrongly approved! <br /> <br /> He claims to speak directly to God ... If so, God has a sense of humor to see Pat make a fool of himself again and again ..
