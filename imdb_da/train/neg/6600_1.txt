Yowza! If anyone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it, you are a better person than me! This movie, while a great attempt to emulate Laurel and Hardy through appearance, sound and routine, falls very little to honor them or even be a movie of any substance. I blame Larry Harmon. The dialogue is torn from old L + H films and planted unrealistically, the plot is confused with unusable characterization of the other unnecessary co-stars. Pinchot's accent was bizarre for Stan, and while Sartain did an excellent job with Ollie's accent, he also tried hard to create the wonderful mix that was Mr. Hardy. Where was a (good) song? Editing is choppy, acting is stiff, lines are awful, physics are - explanatory - (though they might try to give it the feeling of cheap sets?), And it's generally a terrible thing to witness. It is even more painful to see than ATOLL K, where the legendary duo made their last film in horrible 1950s revelation and photography. Do yourself a favor and see as much of the ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy movies as you can and learn how things were. You know what a MAGNATE is, don't you? Stan Laurel did not always respond with semi-moronic quips in each sentence. <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for someone who thinks this was a decent update / honor of the boys. Where was the classic theme song?!? Why destroy 'Here's another fine mess'? Why skip 'some wiser'? Why was there a meaningless gaggle with co-stars?! WHY MISS GULCH FROM WIZARD OF OZ ???? WHY SHOULD LARRY HARMON BE IN IT? Why BOZO! And did the Learning Channel help finance the case? <br /> <br /> I really mean. Speed ​​jokes, for God's sake. <br /> <br /> SPEED JOKES.
