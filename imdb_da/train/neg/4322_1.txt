Read on and note - you could save 88 minutes of your life (was it all!). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, bleak, this film shows producing (I guess) a modern little town American Christmas fable in the Capra style. If fails .... completely and absolutely fails. I've tried to think of a good thing about it and can't. Let me mention some of the highlights. <br /> <br /> People don't die, they use to spend eternity as immigrant workers at Santa's factory. Angels are actually ex-cowboys sitting in trees. Santa Claus can bring people back from the dead (if you send him a good letter). <br /> <br /> And the plot .. I don't want to spoil it for you, but there must be some light in movies if it's only in contrast with the dark, but there's nothing. Even the shooting is gloomy - snow shown at the end of a freezing, cold, humid and miserable everywhere. <br /> <br /> As you might guess, the movie has a happy (schmaltzy) end. What a relief !
