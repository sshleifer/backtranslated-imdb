Young and attractive Japanese people come on the wrong side of a curse again, this time involving mobile phones. Different people die to the unsatisfactory spirit behind it all excavated, so essentially, if you have seen more than 2 recent Japanese horror movies, you can plot this movie in the dark with your hands tied. <br /> <br /> The main attraction here is the fact that Takashi Miike is behind the camera. So far I have been more impressed with his low key works such as the City of Lost Souls, but as a missed call plodded together, I longed for his more familiar envelope that pushes Dead or Alive or the overly-pseudo-Cronenberg style Audition. Despite the fact that many of his films are essentially empty, they have at least benefits like these, or at least something to keep your attention as Tadanobu Asano boasts in shiny suits that translate Johnny Depp. There is none of that in a missed call; There is just very little credit: the action is bland and average, there is very little (nothing, honest) in the way of scare or excitement, and in places it's just pretty boring. <br /> <br /> But there are moments when Miike's glacier-like sense of humor permeates the bland commercialism; especially with the appearance of the TV show, which intends to film the decline of one of the damned issues, and the TV programmer is more concerned about his ratings than the girls' lives. But apart from this there is nothing to suggest, it is Miike behind the camera; especially his usual visual flair has disappeared without a trace (and that includes his famous gore), though he is more likely to have no enthusiasm for the project and I can understand why. A missed call is not offensive badly. It's just frustrating average. <br /> <br /> Of course, Miike loves to lead. With its large annual output, it is obvious that he will not be 100% concerned about all his projects. But even with this in mind, a missed call felt that he just paid the bills.
