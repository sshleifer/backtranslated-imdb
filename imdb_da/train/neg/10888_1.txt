This movie is absolutely horrible. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story hardly exists, the characters are full of stereotypes, and Special-FX just makes you laugh. The only noteworthy thing about this movie is Rapper Coolio's guest feature as a kind of police officer. <br /> <br /> If this movie were to be a comedy, I wasn't quite sure about it. If you want to watch this movie: Please be full and first prepare for some good laugh ... especially when the first Special-FX appears on the screen. <br /> <br /> But if you like trash movies made on the cheap: this movie is a must-see for you.
