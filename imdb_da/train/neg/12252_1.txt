** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> This is a BAD movie. Seriously. Acting in horrible, FX is terrible and the plot is down terribly terrible. But hey, it's so bad it's fun to watch! The script is so bad that it's fun! You just have to cringe and laugh at lines like "I guess that's what you call CROCASING." as the women blink their breasts at the crocodile. I think it's fun because it's so bad! It has such terrible jokes that they are fun! But after a while it just gets too much when the film becomes shame. I really started to fall asleep. Trust me, the plastic hook-foot punch on the blades and the constant swishes in a hedge keep you laughing for a long time. Although I have to say that it had a cool part when the hook ripped, firing in half, and he just hung there for a while and found out what to do. Heh heh thoughtless movie to be nominated for the MST3K line !!
