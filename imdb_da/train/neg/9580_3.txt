Former brat pack actor and all round pretty boy Rob Lowe stars in a movie set in a high American prison. I had a gut that felt his character should be popular for all the wrong reasons like Tobias in the first series of OZ, but PROXIMITY is not that kind of movie, it's more like a "Man on the run" movie like THE FUGITIVE . It also makes a key to the themes of punishment and justice with James Coburn putting a como as a spokesman for justice for victims of the press group, but any intelligent discussion on how societies should treat criminals is completely ignored as the film degenerates into tired old cliches of shoot outs and car chases
