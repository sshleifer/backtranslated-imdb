Let me start by saying how much I love the TV series. Despite the tragic nature of a medieval man apparently unable to pursue his dreams because of his indulgent, manipulative father, it was incredibly easy and fun to see in practice. In my opinion, this is undoubtedly one of the UK's largest British sitcoms. The TV series has my 10 out of 10 rating without reservation. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this movie spin-off is a true tragedy in every sense of the word. Hardly any of the essence of the TV show is successfully transferred to movies. This movie has a very sad, depressing tone that almost moved me to tears on several occasions. Watching Harold be posted in a pub (and not in a comical way) is not my idea of ​​comedy, but it is definitely a reason why TV show fans don't like this movie. The film was painfully unfunny except the scene where Albert was bathing in the sink and seen by a neighbor. The romance between Harold and Zita is completely out of touch, and it makes me wonder if the producers of this movie ever bothered to watch the TV series. In the television series Harold always went for respectable girls, not strippers. <br /> <br /> Albert's responses to the comments by Harold's girlfriends were absolutely invaluable in the television series. In the film, Albert says almost nothing when such an opportunity increases. <br /> <br /> Most movie spin-offs of British sitcoms tend to be rather boring, with the remarkable exception of the ON THE BUSES films (which in some respects were actually better than the TV series themselves!). However, STEPTOE AND SON must rank just below the bottom of the deck, even under GEORGE AND MILDRED. <br /> <br /> My advice - skip this and see the other spin-off, STEPTOE AND SON RIDE AGAIN instead. It has a much brighter tone, is more faithful to the TV series, and is actually a lot of fun.
