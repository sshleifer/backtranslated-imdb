There are several things wrong with this movie - Brenda Song's character is one of them. I don't think the girl is a miserable actor - I honestly don't. I think she gets poor lines. She just has to be "the unsuccessful girl" and while it is fun in the TV shows she plays in, it can't even get a dry laugh from me here. <br /> <br /> Either way, I really knew what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie. The movie was not so terrible ... originally. Wendy's reaction to Shen was completely natural. I mean, how would you feel about a man claiming to be a reincarnated monk, chasing you and commanding you to wear a medallion and insisting that you had to fight "the great evil" and save the world? Which brings me to another point. I know this movie is completely fiction, but it still has a foundation in Chinese culture. It seems that all the "warriors" in Wendy's family line were women. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I doubt the monks would just be okay with that. Sure, maybe they could have worked it somehow, but they offered no explanation at all. Thus, they only contribute to the many cheesy attempts at women's empowerment made by Hollywood and the media. <br /> <br /> Nevermind it, but let's continue. <br /> <br /> Wendy's character becomes more unbearable as the movie continues. Yes, she is a teenager, and it is near homecoming - I mean who will fight evil during the return? The problem is that when the "evil" begins to manifest itself, Wendy doesn't seem to freak out as she should be. She is extremely careless - even for someone like her. She does not continue to worry about her training. I will use this conversation as an example, Shen: "If you don't win this fight, evil will take over and everything will be gone." Wendy: "Who's talking about pressure. Well ... let's talk about something else." Yes, let's Wendy. Let's also start dancing when you are right to train. Of course, Shen lets her go, but his character has an excuse. Better that he cooperates with her than he does not, and she does not train at all and gets them both killed. Oh, that's talking about which. Shen also told Wendy that it was his fate that he died for her in battle that he had for his bedikelenor (I assume that part). <br /> <br /> This makes Wendy's actions more unforgivable. <br /> <br /> As the scriptwriter wanted it, Wendy's homecoming and this "big fight" are exactly the same day. Do you know what Wendy does? Do you have to guess yourself? Yes, she ends up going to the battle because when she tries to leave home, the monks (whom Shen had captured by her trainer and teachers because she "felt strange struggle for an old man") inform her that Shen is gone to battle alone so she goes to rescue him. <br /> <br /> Initially, we see some semi-decent battles, it's actually entertaining. Until finally, the great evil comes out of Wendy's rival-to-home body and creates the actual embodiment of himself out of the broken pieces of the bodies of his old warriors. <br /> <br /> Don't ask. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Wendy gets all the "panic". Then Shen goes and defends her from this guy - forgive me for forgetting her long Chinese name - and manages to get him killed. <br /> <br /> Wendy catches Shen as he makes his long descent from being pushed uncomfortably high into air. <br /> <br /> She screams the title of the article. <br /> <br /> Now ... it was bad enough that Wendy got strong, too fast. No, I won't let it be excused because it was her "fate" and she had "power in" her. Since when did she learn healing? No, worst ... since when could she revive people? So Shen is upright from the dead. Then Wendy and he fight the guy. <br /> <br /> He loses the road easily. The worst part is when they jump together and kick him at the same time, and he's banished forever. So the monks praise Wendy on his victim. <br /> <br /> Two things, # 1: Shouldn't the scriptwriter and the instructor know that a fight needs a little more "finesse" for it? # 2: What sacrifice? The fact that she did not return home? Because the girl did not hit a sweat or even bleeding. I mean, come on, this movie was TV PG, I wanted to see someone hurt. <br /> <br /> Ah-him ... continues. <br /> <br /> I know it sounds like maybe I should have given the movie one, based on my comments. Some of the criticisms you need to know, however, break one thing down. You do not necessarily try to look for the bad ones, but if it is, be aware of it. This movie has very bad, but something fun happens when you never really expect something that should be too big at first. So I suppose it was okay. Not that I didn't say it wasn't okay would have stopped anyone from seeing it.
