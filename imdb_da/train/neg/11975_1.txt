How has this piece of shit stayed on TV for a long time? It's terrible. It makes me shoot someone. It's so false that it's actually worse than a 1940's sci-fi movie. I'd rather have a stroke than see this nonsense. I remember seeing it when it first came out. I thought hey, it might be interesting, so I found out how absolute, insane, ridiculously stupid it really was. It was so bad that I actually took my pocket knife out and put my hand to the table. <br /> <br /> Please people, stop seeing this and all other reality shows, they are the waste that sticks to the network and cancel quality programming that requires something to think about creating.
