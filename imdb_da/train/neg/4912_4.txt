I haven't read the novel, I can't tell how faithful this movie is. The story is typically mystery material: killer targets newlyweds; Women's scientist falls in love with her partner and is diagnosed with a fatal disease. Yes, it sounds like a soap opera, and that's exactly how it plays. The first two-thirds are boring, afraid of the murders, and the last one-third make a partial comeback, as it is gaining momentum towards its cunning conclusion. It is strictly underperforming, although it is difficult to blame the actors alone: ​​the manuscript is terrible. During the last 1/3 you stop by noticing because the film actually gets interesting, but it's only the last 1/3. Director Russell Mulcahy is very much in his element, but there is only so much he can do with a TV budget and network censors on the back. He is largely confined to quick cuts and distorted lenses, although he managed to squeeze in a pair of "under-floor" shots under the club toilet murders. Unfortunately, as this is made for television, the cold composition details he uses so well with a wider picture are nowhere to be found. Note to Manufacturers: Give this man a reasonable budget and an anamorphic lens when hiring him. <br /> <br /> Summary: This movie is poor with movie standards and mediocre by television standards (see CSI, instead). If you're in the mood for a movie like this, I have some great suggestions: Get a copy of Dario Argento's "Deep Red" (my highest recommendation, super movie), "Opera" or even "Tenebre". They are stronger in each category.
