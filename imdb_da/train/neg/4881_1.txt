This is the most boring worthless piece of shit I've ever wasted an hour in my life on. All I can say is God, it was only an hour. Over half of this 'movie' is footage from the original "Criminally Insane". At least, I could see the highlights of the classic rare-use classic, as for some real-life reason, it only has my video store "Criminal Insane II" (as it had "Crazy Fat Ethel II"). But the rest of this movie is some of the absolute worst home video plays and backyard filmmaking you'll ever see. Why is it my video store has this and not the original? Why do things really end up in video stores? Why do people rent it and do not immediately burn the copy when they have seen their pure horror? Why - AAUUGGHH - Why, God, why? Unless you enjoy seeing annoying fruits that eat a whole candy bar in a creepy slow scene, or if the fruit is hung from the stairwell in an even slower scene, or a sign is squeezed sideways (don't ask) several times in the back or brain-cellular monologues to give poisoned tea to his wife and then complain that the whole speech has made one's own tea cold or mentally retarded eating fly soup, or just want to see Crazy Fat Ethel dancing with a bloody knife in a garden: Don't see this movie. Repeat: DO NOT watch this movie. Don't rent this movie. If at all possible, do not go past a shelf in a video store that has a copy of this movie setting on it. You can still be saved, but it's too late for me now. . .
