I watched the movie and was horrified to say the least that the movie could not communicate with me as an audience. The language would be ashamed of the street islands. <br /> <br /> The reason; A father who forces none of his son to marry seems to be long-term. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a grandmother asking her grand child to destroy an enemy would only draw weak minds attention. <br /> <br /> ... and I waited the whole movie for a laugh and laugh I did my stupidity to waste 3 hours to convince myself that the movie is not even worth seeing a first look. Hope it saves your time!
