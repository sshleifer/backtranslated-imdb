Great Payne was really not very good at all. Despite being fun here and there, the story was ridiculous and the play was poor. Major Payne's voice and temperament were particularly annoying. The idea was ridiculous, and the things the boys had to do in that movie were even more ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
