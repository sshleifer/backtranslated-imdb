We rented five films for New Year's Eve and first saw this. All I can say is that there was no place to go, but after seeing this. It was pointless and vulgar. Harvey Keitels script must have been easy to write - just make two out of every three words a curse word. Andie McDowell is surprisingly good in a character roll, but the film has nothing else to recommend.
