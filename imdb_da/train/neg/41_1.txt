How do you know that a horror movie is horrible? when you can't stop laughing of course! The reason has been well covered by other reviewers, so I just want to add a few things about the whole of it all. <br /> <br /> Some reviews have placed the location in South America, others in Africa, I thought it was in some random Pacific Islands. Where exactly this place is, seems to be a mystery. The cannibal strain is, in accordance with a pair of black women, some black men and a man who resembles a young Frank Zappa who beats the drums ... The devil God is a great black man with a terrible case of pink eyes. <Br/> <br /> One of the "most freakiest" moments in the movie is when "Pablito" finds his partner hanging from a tree covered in what appears to be an orange fabric that I assume is blood, begins to scream in minutes over and over again (it's actually fun) and then the head of his partner falls into the ground, and "Pablito" kicks it a little, for what I suppose is "shits n 'giggles" and the eyes actually move. .. <br /> But of course the "freak" is gone when you realize the eyes are moving because the movie is just bad ... I didn't laugh like that in a loooong while and I definitely recommend this movie to a Sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do ... take a case of beer and start watching this movie, you will love it! If you are looking for a real horror or make movies, but ... don't 'bother.
