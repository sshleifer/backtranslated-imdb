This movie should not be seen unless you are trying to kill yourself. I think this movie could actually cause serious brain damage. The main characters are the white non-hero Kevin, Amy, his bratty, vicious conservative girlfriend, Kyle, a red shorts dork who enjoys phone sexuality, Daphne, a scrawny, horny girl who should be "cool" and have no sense of how to dress and her oversized boyfriend Nick, an army recruits who can make an insinuation out of something. No, I'm not a pervert, it's really how the movie goes. The movie itself is a super-rip-off of 1986's Gremlins, only you will never find traces of Gizmo anywhere. No, these Hobgoblins, released by Wimpy Man (sorry, Kevin), make anyone's wildest dreams come true, and then kill the victims. Yeah, you guessed it - at last they close up in a strip club where the ghastly Amy's biggest dream is revealed - she'll be a stripper! Look, I saw this flick via MST3K, and even with Mike Nelson, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot made a laugh from this movie stream wreck and it still made me soft from both eyes. Not really, but I wish I had it. I don't give you any more plot because reliving it gives me this great urge to drive a pitchfork through my brain. Moreover, it is not as if there is a plot worth mentioning. They should put a surgeon's general warning on this movie.
