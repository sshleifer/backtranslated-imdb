I am both amused and disgusted by the people who claim that this movie is so precise about Vietnam and was NEVER there. This film is about as true about the entire Vietnam War as Rodney King beating is true of ALL police officers. Yes, things happen (and did) bad things, but generally people are like you and me. They have morals, they do not kill machines, they do not all drugs. Atrocities were the exception in Vietnam, not the rule. They happened far more rarely than "hype" would make you believe. Oliver Stone has the ability to make films depicting the Vietnam War as this brutal carnage, but is so much in reality as Star Wars. If you honestly believe in the stereotypes of Vietnam, do yourself a favor and learn the truth. Fact: Viet Cong and NVA did far worse things to the South Vietnamese than any US soldier ever did. Fact: The soldiers of World War II treated the enemy much worse in general than the soldiers in Vietnam did, and they were welcome when they returned home. The fine Americans who served this country in Vietnam deserve our respect; Although the war was severely fought from a political point of view, no one could have asked for more from our soldiers, and it is a great misconception to claim that this kind of "most true" fiction is the way that really was.
