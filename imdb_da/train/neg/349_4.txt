A pot - kettle if I ever saw one. An implied thriller that borrows from "A Time to Kill", "The Silence of the Lamb", even vice versa "In the Heat of the Night" with a small reverse murder, a "Strangers on a Train" thrown in, fails abysmally where all of the largely succeeded. Namely, in supplying excitement. The plot seems condensed from a larger book that makes the plot evolution obvious and unaffected, while the direction lacks pace and enlistment. To clear some kudos, a large twist had to be delivered along the way, and here too it fails tangibly. Connery clearly shrinks his age, barely disturbs his attempt at an American accent and, in addition, seems too old to be the husband of Hope Lange and the father of his divine children. He even has a father-in-law who seems younger than him. Laurence Fishburne hardly gets the chance to live in his role, and you're confused from the start, whether he's a bad guy or a good guy. Someone once said that flashbacks should not lie - they make it confusing here. The rest of the game is just the average of a reasonable cast in their underwriting stereotypical roles. The supposed climax also managed to roll by leaving me firmly anchored in the back, not as it should have been the target leading edge of my seat. Mediocre sloppy Hollywood movie certainly.
