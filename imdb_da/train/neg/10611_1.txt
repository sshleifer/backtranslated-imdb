Terrible acts of Potter and a flat plot without excitement what so ever. And as for the feminist polemics, it's ridiculous. I saw this waste when it was first released, and although I found it boring without faith, I am glad I went to see it. That's because I now have an immediate answer to the question 'What's the worst movie you've ever seen?' Moreover, I am comfortable knowing that every movie I see for the rest of my life gets better than The Tango Lesson. But I have to admit that I was impressed with the way Potter wrote a script that would outweigh the maximum number of fellowship grants from all over the world (as revealed in final credits). I am only very recently saw Orlando, and I can see how Potter taught the wrong experiences of making that movie. All it took was a bunch of frilly costumes, a few staring at the camera of the leading lady, and a loose plot to seduce the cinema that goes public. So why shouldn't she think she could get away with the self-indulgent thing that is The Tango Lesson?
