I watched this movie really late last night and usually if it's late, then I'm beautifully forgiving for movies. Although I tried, I just couldn't keep this movie at all, it got worse and worse when the movie continued. Although I know it's supposed to be a comedy, but I didn't find it that fun. It was also a very unrealistic and enchanted depiction of rural areas. If that is how some of you think the country's life is like, it certainly is not. I agree that some of the cast members were sweet, but the French guy was really fake. I have to agree that it was trying to get a good lesson in history, but in general my recommendation is that no one over 8 sees it, it's just too annoying.
