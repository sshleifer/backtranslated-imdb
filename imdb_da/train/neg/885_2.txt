An anthology is always risky, and I think this endeavor should be praised. There is a lot of talent involved here. A large number of talented actors, directors and writers. Unfortunately, I really couldn't enjoy this movie based on three issues I had. <br /> <br /> First of all, the segments vary immensely in tone and quality. And unfortunately some of them collide with the others. <br /> <br /> Second, several segments feel underdeveloped for me. Like seeds of good stories that will never work. I'm not talking about happy conclusions here (or even an end period), but rather they lack basic development or even solid setups that pull you in. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, I didn't feel like New York and its residents were properly portrayed. <br /> <br /> What you are left with is high-brow short film that may still be interesting for some, but will leave the average viewer dissatisfied.
