When I first heard of "Down to Earth", I was very excited. I'm a pretty big fan of a Chris Rock, he was especially fun in Dogma. But this movie turned out to be a disappointment. Chris Rock's performance was not as good as his previous performances, and the movie was just very poorly directed as a whole. First of all, Chris Rock. He plays the whole movie as a standup comedy routine. Of course, it works fine in the scenes, where he has to do standup, but in the rest of the film it doesn't. Even when he speaks to another character, he thinks he is trying to make an inclusive people laugh. He has some fun moments, but they come mainly under standup scenes (no wonder they decided to make their character a comedian). As for the rest of the casting, they are just about to give Rock someone to talk to, none of them stand out. <br /> <br /> The film was also badly adjusted. The film basically has a one-joke plot: old white guy acts like a young black comedian. While I prefer movies with more than one joke, it could still have worked and been quite fun. The problem was, we saw too much of Rock and not enough of the old white guy. It should be fun because it is the white guy who tells Chris Rock's jokes, but for the most part we just see Chris Rock, so it's almost not that fun. The few scenes where they decide to show us the white guy who speaks like Rock is actually funny. If he had been shown more, the movie would have been much more fun. Overall, a few moments of laughter can not make up for the fact that "Down to Earth" is badly acted and poorly directed. This one was a pretty big disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10
