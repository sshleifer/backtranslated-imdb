CLASS OF '61 <br /> Image Format: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Stereo <br /> <br /> In 1861, class leaders from the West Point Academy were torn apart from the outbreak of the Civil War . Gregory Hoblits OK historical drama makes an obvious point - virtuous men become blind by conflict - even though production seems a little silent, despite authentic details and a cast of talented beginners (Clive Owen, Christien Anholt, Josh Lucas, Andre Braugher, Laura Linney, etc.) ), coated by Dan Futterman as a conscientious south-facing, taking arms in defense of slavery and directing him in direct conflict with his former northern friends. The film's emphasis on such a misunderstood - but sympathetic - character is particularly brave, but the drama is otherwise flat and superficial, and Hoblit's direction is effective rather than inspired.
