First, I must admit that it is not a good movie. And I would never see this movie if Pacino wasn't in it. <br /> <br /> The film is about a publisher's strange 24 hours. And he is overtime, dizzy, sick and sometimes regrettable. I don't do it like the character at all. It's really boring, after 20 minutes you can fall asleep. And I don't understand why Pacino would be part of this horrible movie. Just because of money or what? <br /> <br /> Since I am an avid Pacino fan, I bought this movie from 2002, People I Know. If you haven't bought it yet, don't even think about it, it's just a waste of time.
