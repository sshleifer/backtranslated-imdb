If you liked the first two movies, I'm sorry to say you won't like this one. This is the real nonsense and unnecessary for video, probably the TV-based sequel. The still idiotic, but quirky scientist Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) still lives with his family, and he has his own company, Szalinski Inc. Unfortunately, his wife will get rid of a statue, Wayne is so stupid, he shrinks his statue and himself with his brother. Then he shrinks his wife and sister-in-law too. Now the adults have to find a way to get the children in the house to get them bigger. Almost a repetition of the other two with only one or two new things, for example. a roller coaster slide, swimming in the dip, etc. Very bad!
