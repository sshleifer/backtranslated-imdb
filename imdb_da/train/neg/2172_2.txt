Bottom of barrel, imaginative and practically impenetrable remake of ROAD WARRIOR. This movie follows the exact plot that the Filipino film strokes and is worse by far! Bad plays, dialogue, effects, dubbing, pacing, action sequences ... The list goes on and on. Italy literally made dozens of Road Warrior rip-offs in the early 80s, some good, some bad. This is the worst by far, no competition. Not only was the mood in the movie completely gloomy and miserable, the experience of sitting through it is half and a half. There was 1 (one) good hunting sequence against the beginning of the movie, and a cool shot of a man with a hand grenade exploding. But everything else about this movie seriously series! For the actual post-nuke fun, you must track a copy of ENDGAME, AFTER NEW YORK, or ESCAPE FROM BRONX instead. They are much more fun than this nonsense.
