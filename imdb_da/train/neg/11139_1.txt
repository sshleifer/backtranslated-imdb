There's not much to say about this movie, it's terrible. The actor and dialogue are far from even decent. The story of the hybrid werewolf is not very well explained and it all has plot holes here and there. <br /> <br /> CGI is something you don't want to see. It's so amateurish that it makes me throw up. <br /> <br /> The only good thing on the DVD was in Extras. Gag the coil. Everything else, just a waste of time and money. I hope nobody will buy this, it is not even worth renting. <br /> <br /> Just stay away from this.
