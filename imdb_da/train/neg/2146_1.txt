I just want to say this, it was the worst sequel to a classic Disney movie I've ever seen. In 1950, Disney released it, I hail as one of his greatest films all the time. Now take the big songs away, add a bad plot that looks like a lost TV show. "Put it together and what do you get?" the biggest cargo Crud I've ever seen. After I saw this, I thought it was over to Disney. Cinderella should be finished with, "and they happily ever lived." not this waste. This movie did not deserve a successor like this one. I thought it would be like "A twist in time" that was moderate but better than this. What do we also need about Anastasia? She changed pages that Iago did, but it didn't help anyone.
