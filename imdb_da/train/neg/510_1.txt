This is certainly one of the worst movies ever made and published by a major Hollywood study. The reason is simply stupid. The dialogue is written in clich√©s; You can implement many phrases in the script because of this. The act is ridiculously bad, especially for Rod Cameron. "Choreography" is silly and completely untrustworthy. One can only spoil the critic who saw the 23-year-old Yvonne dance as sexual; it is only very poor choreography. The ballet scene in the beginning of the film is especially ridiculous. If you are in bad movies and enjoy laughing at some of Hollywood's turkeys, this is for you. I bought the colored version on VHS, which makes the movie even worse. Yvonne is heavy makeup when colored, she looks like a clown all the time. And she's the best part of this movie. What way to start a career.
