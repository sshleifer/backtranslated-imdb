This movie was ridiculously bad. A friend rented it from Netflix and made me see it. There are so many gaffes and goofs that it is impossible to even disturb to know the characters and the plot. For example, what about these ... <br /> <br /> "Vermont Airport" surrounded by palm trees <br /> <br /> Ben's miraculous looking shirt during a phone call <br /> <br /> priest's palatial office. .. complete with a folded table top <br /> <br /> There is a decent story hidden behind a very bad movie. But even if you look past the technical flaws, you will find scary action and casting. I became most source by throwing a flamboyant gay actor to play the right-wing believer's brother. His opening scene sat in his immaculate apartment that stroked his kitty cat, was fun. <br /> <br /> I welcome the author / director / producer / editor / star / caterer / cast dentist / composer (and what else he did on this step) to actually get a movie like this distributed. If you have nothing better to do, it can be a fun group movie or even the basis of a drinking game, but don't hire it for a strong story of homophobia and gay marriage.
