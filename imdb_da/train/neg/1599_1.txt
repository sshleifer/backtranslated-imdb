NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CLASS REUNION was a flop when released. It didn't take long in theaters in my big city. Why? Because it's bad !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not bad in a good way but bad in a really painfully unfunny way. The whole cast of actors was mostly unknown and has remained unknown after this turkey. The idea is actually great (a parody of slasher flicks), but the performance is largely lacking in every aspect. <br /> <br /> Just avoid this "comedy". Your time is more valuable than spending a nanosecond who sees this embarrassing misfire.
