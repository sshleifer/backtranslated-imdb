I'm really surprised that this movie gets a ranking like this! I haven't seen such a bad movie for years. Also this was a really bad movie. Splatter is not enough to describe the unnecessary (almost fun) blood scenes. If you didn't like hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007) .. this is 10 times worse. The story reminds me of RL Stine goosebumps.! <br /> <br /> I can't tell about the play as the script was so terrible. Clich√© all the time. (why should I write 10 lines? I never understood this.) <br /> <br /> == Here comes spoilers == <br /> <br /> The story is about a butcher who kills people all the time in metro. We are talking about thousands of killings and nobody is aware. In fact, these people just lack. And there is the good guy who is trying to solve the mystery (well, there is no mystery to us, for we know from the start the bad guy) and who usually believe no one in him! What a surprise! Finally he puts butcher clothes and fights with the death butcher!
