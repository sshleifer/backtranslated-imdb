It is the early 80s. There are a group of suspiciously ornate teenagers. And there's a maniac stalking around. Yes, this is Slasherville. <br /> <br /> This movie is called Pranks. Why is it called Pranks? I don't have the weakest idea. Unless your idea of ​​a big prank is to repeat a person's dinner with a baseball bat - in balance, not a good prank; In fact, there is some nonsense if the truth is told. But there you go. <br /> <br /> The film itself is about a group of teenagers who are tasked with cleaning out a dorm. They become aware that a psychopath is loose. To combat this development, they split up and wander in the dark. It ends in tears for most of them. <br /> <br /> Pranks are a badly made slasher movie. The DVD release I watched was the Vipco. It seems to have been cut by a fair amount of violence. This makes the DVD even more meaningless because we make it look, a slasher film that is removed by violence is a waste of time. For slasher movies and video nasty completists alone.
