I have to say I usually like horror movies that I have never seen ... but this one was just too pathetic for my gory taste. I'm used to gory, gut wrenching types ... but this particular movie was lamb. The actor was horrible (though corny (no pun intended) the one-liners were cute). And the sequel to it was the scarecrow slayer even worse! Yes, probably when it first came out, there was a huge rave about it and people liked it. But when movies like The Ring and The Exorcist of Emily Rose come out, movies like these make movies like scarecrow seem childish. If you want a movie to just pass on the time, choose this one! The special effects are cheesy as heck. But when I saw that it was a low-budget movie, I can see where it would come in. This will remind you of the movie "Children of the Corn". Independent movie rock .... most of the time. So if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with corncobs or in the sequel, 2 scarecrows will go on it, so these movies would be for you.
