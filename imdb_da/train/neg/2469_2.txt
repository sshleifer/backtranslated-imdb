I suppose if you like endless dialogue that does not forward the story and flashy camera effects like scene transitions in the TV show _Angel_, you will enjoy the movie. Me? All I wanted was a nice, tight little story and it wasn't there. The pacings were almost back, plot points were buried under a sea of ​​unnecessary dialogue, and there was absolutely no sense of fear or excitement or anything. <br /> <br /> Is it redneck? Is it Wendigo? No, it's a camera man at speed. It's not scary. It does not generate a single tone of tension or atmosphere unless you are afraid of MTV. Like the reviewers in front of me, I also noticed that in the end, the film calls for ridiculous audience laughter. <br /> <br /> Terrible movie.
