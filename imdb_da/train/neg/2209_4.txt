If you read my review of SyFy's "Dinoshark", you know that I can appreciate the low budget schlock that these television films can offer. They're stupid ... they're stupid ... but they're still pretty funny in a "so bad, that's good" kind. So I still blamed for suffering (and recommending) the undeniable hokey "Dinoshark", I sat down to see "Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy", a SyFy Original Movie about a half-human, half-hammerhead monster who is terrorizing people on an island. With SyFy Channel's sur-four recipe for creating B-movie creature features and a cast that includes William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo, how could it go wrong? Well, to my surprise, it actually misses the mark ... not too much, but enough to make me not recommend it. Why? Well, first of all, his titular monster, the dreaded hammerhead-human hybrid, takes a back seat for a bunch of faux-military bullies that really become the movie's primary villain. Even though the hammerhead protrudes into the body, he (or whatever you call it) counts just before someone gets munched on and leaves right after. The rest of the movie is filler, pitting our heroes against the aforementioned soldiers. That, for me, is just not as convincing as seeing a wandering hammerhead eating people! <br /> <br /> Read the full review on my blog: www.horrormoviejournal.blogspot.com
