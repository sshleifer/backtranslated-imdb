I've read the book a couple of times, and this movie doesn't follow exactly as it should. I could let this slip, it's a movie. But I have serious problems with setting the movie. No one has seemed to mention that this film and the book it is based on are based on actual events that occurred in Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I grew up in the city that this movie should be based on. First of all, the "small" city spoken of as the setting is the third largest city in the state. With a population of about 50,000. Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver. Second, the scene for the movie is wrong. Grand Island is located in the Platte River. Which is very flat with very few trees. I tried to watch this movie, but it made me sad to see my hometown treated so badly. This was a real event. Large parts of the city were wiped out. In the book, they talk about riding bikes from Mormon Island to Fonner Park. I think you could if you didn't mind a 15km trip each way.
