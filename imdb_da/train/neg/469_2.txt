Mad Magazine may have many crazy people working for it ... but of course someone who had some common sense when the powers-it-be spoiled this waste of celluloid ... editing is el crapo, the plot is incredibly thin and stupid. ... and the only reason it's two out of ten is that Stacy Nelkin takes off some of his clothes and we get a good chest ... I never thought I'd be sorry that Ralph Macchio would make the decision about being in this thing, but I do ... and I feel really bad for Ron Leibman and Tom Poston, gifted actors who should never have appeared in this piece ... movie ... at least Mr . Leibman cajones to refuse to have their name placed anywhere on the film ... and he comes out ahead ... actually there are copies of this thing with Mads initial order still on it ... if you can find one, take it cuz it's probably worth something ... it's the only thing about this movie that is worth something ... and a note to the people at IMDb.com ... there's no way to destroy this movie for anyone ... the makers spoiled it yourself
