From the start, you know how this movie will end. It's so full of clich√©s, your typical NRA member won't even like this movie. I give it 2 out of 10, only because of William Benton's appearance. I can't believe people voted 6+ for this movie. It is so biased towards a "definite point of view" (once a thief ...). People are not born bad. They are also not well-born. They are born with a clean slate. It is society, parents and education, what makes them who they are. And if they take the wrong turn, somewhere down the bargain, it certainly won't be the US criminal system that gets them back on track! In any case, avoid this movie like the plague. I bet you have better things to do with your time than waste it on this piece of crap. <br /> <br />
