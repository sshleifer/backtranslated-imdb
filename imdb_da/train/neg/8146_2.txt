1e watched 11/7/2002 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-John Bianco): Pretty lame gangster movie about a godfather-like family in Brooklyn who likes to say four letter words a lot and kill people. The only thing of interest here was their attempt to show that the fathers were much like the gang. This is the only attempt at good filmmaking. The rest of the movie was predictable and cheaply produced. The quality of photography on some of the scenes within the columns and floozy joints almost made you think there was a problem with your DVD player due to the bad contrasts and some of the actors were difficult to hear at times due to of the bad sound. The action was pretty much characatures of all your favorite goers from better movies with corny names like Vinnie `Knuckles 'and Jimmie` Tattoos', and the plot largely followed these patterns. Then watch a better gangster movie before you put your money off this one.
