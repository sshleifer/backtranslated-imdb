Carlo Verdone has once managed to combine fantastic comedy with smart and subtle social analysis and criticism. <br /> <br /> Then something happened and he became another boring "holier-end-you" director. <br /> <Il Mio Miglior Nemico can be more or less summarized in a line "working class = friendly and warm, while upper class = snob and obscure. But love eventually wins". <br /> <br /> Such a tired clich√© for such a smart instructor. <br /> <br /> There's not too much to talk about in the movie. Each character is a stereotype: The self-made man who forgets his roots, but who becomes "good" again, the mocking wife, the rebellious rich girl who falls to the honest but poor guy. barely average. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing in all aspects.
