Feature of early 21st century cinema of lets pit different evil creatures and evil boys against each other. We haven't seen things like this since Godzilla v King Kong and the like. Always sound good on paper when you splice up, and in a blur of the good things you have an inspired idea and look the whole game out before you like Beethoven's symphonies. Then you will write it. Great ideas that all vampires are female. Ergo hot, seductive deadly, but somehow I will get lost. And all the zombies are men. Well, what men are like a woman right after they have been dumped or cheated right? So it looks good to do it actually. Then the rat starts to set. Mosters have a fight. Nothing happens much. Another fight. Philosophical noodling and cod wallop. Eureka we've found out how to win. Great fight again and the end. It sounds good, doesn't it? If it was made an indie company it would be great. But this is Hollywood with an eye on the money: shine instead of what the fans want. The whole thing could have been gore soaked beautifully.
