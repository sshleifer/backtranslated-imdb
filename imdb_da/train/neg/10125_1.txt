... it would have been what you got. <br /> <br /> Words alone cannot describe how bad this is. If you have trouble sleeping pop this in and I guarantee you will be out for fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> Robert Lowery was a really good actress in his 40s - but he calls it in here. Johnny "Duncan" Robin said in an interview that he and Batman had to run from the car to the house and that Lowery was doubling outside the camera area because his belt was too tight! Duncan himself looks more like a motorcycle cap than a boy's wonder. In fact, he is more like a guy in his thirties and is waiting for Lowery to kick so he can wear the big cloak. <br /> <br /> Running a Batmobile looks like it rolled out Honest Als used car volume during the sticker price - Dynamic Duo doesn't put much emphasis on hiding the fact that it's Bruce Wayne's car they are driving - actually It is noticed by several characters all the way through the serial. <br /> <br /> The action is wood - the sets are cheap - the dialogue is horrible, and if there was even a script they followed, I'm sure it reads in accordance with "Batman says something here" because It certainly seems like they are doing what they do together. <br /> <br /> Batman's Utility belt is made of thin fabric with no apparent bags to hold its gadgets - in a scene when Batman needs a full size blowing square, the producers just stick in as the scene starts - never to be seen again. His blanket is so bad that he can't even look out of it, and his ears look more like flopsy mopsy the unhappy easter hatch than they do something decent. <br /> <br /> In a scene (I don't make up), Batman replaces the uninhibited radioactive money that will burst into flames the other, being exposed to air as a payout to some caps. It is radioactive so he can trace it - the reason why it is so flammable is not explained. Well, thugs open the package in a carton store - we know it's a cardboard store because Batman sneaks in and pushes these boxes that seem to weigh about six ounces on the caps to knock them out - and soon burns the whole place to the ground. Thanks Batman! In another scene after Batmobile is disabled, Batman flags a passing motorist in the middle of nowhere and takes his car - leaving the man to take care of himself and tell him he should not worry because if Batman smashes the car, the police will surely buy him another! Yes, you guessed it, said car care from a rock within seconds. Not that it means much to the driver who is probably dead of exposure and is trying to head back to Gotham City. <br /> <br /> There is a tired subplot with Lois Lane clone Vicki Vale, convinced that Bruce Wayne is Batman - she must have noticed Batmobile parked outside Bruce's house - or maybe she saw Batman and Robin runs up the hallway in the densely dense suburban area. <br /> <br /> Everything about this series is bad - and anything but the youngest in the audience would like to throw toast on the screen. If you're looking for a bad cinema, you can't make a better mark - if you want entertainment, try the Burton Batman movies, the Adam West Batman TV series, or the former Lewis Wilson Batman series.
