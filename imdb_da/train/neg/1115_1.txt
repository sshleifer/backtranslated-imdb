We saw this on the shelf of the local video store, so "Coppola" in the credits and was excited. It was the only time this movie was of any interest. I could never quite work out if it was an attempt at a humorous movie that failed unhappily, or an attempt at a serious movie that falsely failed. In general, the whole production seemed incredibly amateurish. Especially the sound was absolutely terrible, especially in the scenes shot in the small bar; The dialogue was so corny in parts, it was incredible. Very disappointing.
