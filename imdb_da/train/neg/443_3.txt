Overall a very disappointing picture. Very, very slowly built up for basic history. Maria Schrader's role seeks her family's secret past. (Every time it seems to last forever. There is really no rhythm in the movie.) *** SPOILERS *** Her mother Ruth is rescued from the Nazis, by a German woman played by Katja Riemann. The whole character of Ruth is so one-dimensional, so stereotypical. *** SPOILERS END *** The movie cuts back and forth between today's New York and Berlin and Berlin's 40s. Please give the audience an indication of the exact time of the story. There is never a clear indication of time ?? very annoying. Worst part is the end. *** SPOILERS *** The whole show and jabber that the Jews are so terribly troubled, simply by a bureaucratic accident! Give me a break. How did the Jews get out of Rosenstrasse? The question of who released the Jews is NEVER answered. Where are Goebels who released them? Did Lean Fischer read with Goebels? In Venice, the movie won a play for K. Riemann, why? ?? I have no idea. Must be the Jewish theme ??
