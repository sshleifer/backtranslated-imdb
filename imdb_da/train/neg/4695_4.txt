I've seen this movie a couple of times and never thought it was fun, but it's still fun to watch and good for a few laughs. It's about women who work at a company and their boss is a jerk and they end up giving him a taste of their own medicine and trying to get the respect they deserve. <br /> <br /> The action is really good. Dabney Coleman is one of the 80s stars playing a good bad guy, not really evil, just unlikeable. Dolly Partin is lovable and fun to watch in comedies and her south-south wines really shine here. Jane Fonda is so-so and does a little for me. Lily Tomlin is the best thing about this movie, she has the funniest lines and made me laugh loudly several times, to love her. I could recommend it to anyone who likes the 80's comedy. I like the movie, but it has things about what I don't like. It starts well and has a good flow, and then everything starts to come together at once and made me break less about the signs. They all have a little imagination about what they want to do to the boss and even though "cute", I just thought it lowered the flow of the movie. As the film continues, it retrieves it once and the funniest things happen, and again it goes slowly, only to unpack in a quick way, it's too good to be true. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 stars, but try it if you haven't seen it. I think depending on them mood it can be more or less sympathetic.
