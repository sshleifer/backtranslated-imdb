This movie had potential and I was willing to try it, but there are so many timeline issues that are so obvious - it's hard to swallow treated like such an idiot. Rise to Power is set in the late sixties. Carlito's Way is set in the mid to late 70s. In order for this movie to be realistic, it would have to be set in the fifties, if not that late is over. <br /> <br /> Rise to Power has no sign of Gail (Pennelope Ann Miller), no sign of Kleinfeld, No sign of Rolando, that Carlito apparently ran into his "hey day". None of the primary characters in the original movie were in this movie. We must believe that Carlito met all these people within a few years. Stig to Power ends with Carlito, who walks down the beach and talks about walking in paradise, which is what he would do in the original movie. Also prequel creates the Rocco and Earl characters - what should happen to them, as they obviously are not in Carlito's Way? It is also hard to understand how Carlito could have the relationship with the Italians he has in the original movie that looks at the events of Rise to Power. Where's the Taglialucci in this movie? There are probably seven years between the two films and he uses five of them in prison. It's like trying to put a square plug in a round hole. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that no one was interested in telling a good story and that they were more interested in making some money by making an average gangster movie and throwing a character called Carlito Brigante into the story . The movie had some good moments, but I think they would have been better off leaving this movie to stand by itself instead of trying to make it a prequel to Carlito's Way. <br /> <br /> If you feel like watching this movie, the only advice I can give is not to think of the movie as a linear prequel. Think of it as spaghetti westerns with Clint Eastwood's man without a name, in other words, two films of the same character but not necessarily connected to each other.
