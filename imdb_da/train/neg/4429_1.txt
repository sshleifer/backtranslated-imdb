What a piece of stupid move. <br /> <br /> I won't even waste time evaluating any of the points in this show. It's not worth the time. The only comment I want to make is - why get such a DUMB, naughty doofus to be the star?!? <br /> <br /> There are not many more bleak testimonies about the worsening mental state of networking than the fact that FOX has stated it will not bring John Doe back (a decent series), but will bring brain death as Joe Millionaire back for another round of killing the brain cells of the American public. <br /> <br /> FOX has lost it, IMHO.
