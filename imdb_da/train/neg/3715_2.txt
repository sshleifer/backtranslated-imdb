Black guy gets rich white guy, and rich white guy seems to embrace hip hop culture, and most of the "fun" moments in this movie are playing from here. The problem I have is that it doesn't work and almost never works. <br /> <br /> So no one would expect Lance to take a body like this and suddenly start acting like Charles Wellington. It would be too much to ask. I'll give it. But at the same time it goes too far in the other direction. I'm supposed to imagine a rich white guy singing rap and completely upending things, playing as if he's a bastion of hip-hop culture, and people just accept * him? And what about Sontee who falls in love with him * as a rich white guy *, even if she doesn't care about his money or power? It's so amazing, it's not even fun. <br /> <br /> I just couldn't suspend disbelief and I couldn't finish the movie. I added an extra star because it made me laugh, even hard, a couple of times. But I just couldn't get past the whole "white guy doing hip hop" thing that has never been well done in any movie I've ever seen trying it. This was no exception.
