This movie is so much of a rip-off of masterpeice "demons" and that's the only thing that makes the movie worth seeing. The action is horrible, the action scenes are accelerated, the manuscript is almost painful and budget non-existent. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is good, then you haven't seen a real horror movie, skip this and get a copy of the movie demons.
