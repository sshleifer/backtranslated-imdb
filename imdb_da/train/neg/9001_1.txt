When I see a movie, I realize that it is "just a movie," but I will nevertheless allow myself to be immersed as much as possible under the circumstances. I think that's what makes us cry, scream, laugh or otherwise react emotionally like the audience, even though we're deeply down, we know it's just a movie. "What I don't want is that the movie reminds me that it's just a movie so I can't slip into the above-mentioned engrossment regardless of the quality of the movie. This movie's director chose to use multi-angle camera images simultaneously on the screen. Maybe it's just me, but I find this terrible and just annoying. They may as well run a continuous banner across the bottom of the screen reading, 'Note: This is just a movie. Don't let yourself be too interested or engrossed '. If I want 'picture-in-picture', I activate it from my television remote control, but never under a movie I will enjoy.
