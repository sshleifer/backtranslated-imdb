I watched this movie at the mystery science theater when it was called "It Lives at Night". That title is much less misleading than "batfolk". In fact, it would be more precisely called Batperson. This film is about a doctor studying bats I think because he wants to make a better cure for rabies. This is not entirely clear. Obviously he and his wife take a walk in a hole and he is bitten by a bat. Why a researcher must take a trip to study bats is beyond me. Should he not be able to enter himself. Well after being bitten, he and his wife go on their honeymoon, where he begins to look after. They go to the worst doctor ever. The guy stays in the hospital and kills a nurse. Eventually the guy kills 3-4 people, and his wife stands by him, and you have to root for him instead of the sheriff investigating the murders.
