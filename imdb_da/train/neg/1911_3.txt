Formula flick of guy who wants girl, guy who will lie to come next to the girl, guy who will get the best friend to help in outrageous way (comedus reliefus, no?) To help cheat girl etc. This one has been made to death, and with rare exceptions from a few z-rated excursions, it has been made better. <br /> <br /> Stale plot aside, the wires are attractive, and there are a few good moments. Jonathon Schaech has done better and his plays came close to being called. Not a complete loss but nothing new here in this weak affair.
