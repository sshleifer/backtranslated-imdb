I didn't expect much to go into this, but still disappointed. This was my least favorite Halstorm production I've seen. I thought it was going to be a comedy, but I only talked about 3 or 4 jokes. Is it really a fun gag to see a fat guy eating donuts and falling down over and over again? What was with the watchman in the sky scene? Fred Willard has been fun with some of his Christopher Guest collaborations, but it didn't work. They must have spent the whole budget on getting "known" actors to appear in this because there was no lighting budget. It looked like it was filmed with a camcorder, and most scenes were very dark. Is it really that much movie to show that someone actually shoots and makes a basket, as opposed to cutting away and editing a ball that swings through a basket? I'm not trying to be too critical of low budget comedies, but if you want to see something funny, go to a real church basketball instead of this movie.
