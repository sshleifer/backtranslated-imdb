Anita and me seem to be a little more than an excuse for the novelist and manuscript, Meera Syal, to give her prejudices, complaints and general antipathy to English. The general sense of Indian superiority in English in this movie is foul. The English population of this film is portrayed as obese, violent, creepy, promiscuous, engaged in child neglect, stupid, uneducated, racist, ugly, eating poor food and dim-witted - narrative, only by turning to Indian culture the local priest be "redeemed" at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Indian family is beautiful, smart, educated, can speak many languages, is caring and loving parents and grammar schooling. The film is so detrimental that I am surprised that the BBC funded it at all. Had it been reversed, an English family in an Indian society depicted this way, the film would have been seen as racist. <br /> <br /> There was a moment when my eyebrow shot so far up on my forehead I thought it would be in my hairline. First, the gossip scene between the women at the Divali fortress - subtitle: the English is dirty and promiscuous - and the men - subtitle: English women are prostitutes. Secondly, the meal with Anita, where Neema is family, is lying to her about cutlery - subtitle: English is so stupid you can get them to do something. <br /> <br /> But the underlying contempt for some English - even English weddings is an object of contempt - is clearly through the film. Anita's character was drawn so appallingly - almost the fallen woman's trope - that I finished the movie feeling angry. <br /> <br /> This is not a "Bend It Like Beckham", where humor is focused on loving exaggerations of a society's behavior and customs from anyone in this community, and is a movie about two girls from different backgrounds who come together. Instead, Anita and Mig seem to convey that some kind of cultural apartheid is inevitable, as English is almost a version of the Indian unlikely cast, and this is underlined by a thinly blurred series of attacks on the film's "other" community: the English. <br /> <br /> I felt Anita and Me were a hate-filled, complaint-based job. Against this background, the BBC should not have financed its production.
