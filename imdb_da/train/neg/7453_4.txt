Wonderful actors. <br /> <br /> Lousy script and not too big direction either. My main problem was that I simply didn't care about any of these people. Not the killer not the victims. The settings were pretty boring. Dennis Quaid's characters were so poorly written in, I wasn't even worried when the end came. He got his baby back. Big deal! I wanted my money back.
