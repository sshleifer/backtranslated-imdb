I am an actor, producer, director and what I am saying are facts. This project was the worst movie in film making. From producer to director and editing this so-called movie is a joke and I mean a BIG joke. Why would Blockbuster release such crap? I take my work very seriously and this film is an insult to my profession. Was the director trying to make a bad movie? I do not think. I've seen bad Zombie movies, but it takes the Coffie cake and everything on the table. THIS MOVIE SUCKS !!! I really hate to talk badly about other filmmakers because I am a self, but please consider taking another profession. I respect the fact that you have completed a movie, but I have to ask you "WAS YOU SMOKING CRACK", I mean makeup for your girls, the scary zombies, what did you think? To the whole nation, if I could have voted zero I would have. WORLD MOVIE MOVIE MAKING HISTORY !!!
