Don't be fooled by all the big names like Burt Reynolds, James Woods and Anne Archer. They are just glorified extra. Their scenes were probably filmed on some day. Whatever their motives to be in this movie, if you have an actor like James Woods, you make better use of him. For me, this is a sign of poor direction through and through. The plot itself wasn't that bad. And the play from most of the actors was above average. Cuba Gooding Jr. was terrible though. He was so incredible that I almost laughed at his dramatic scenes. And since this was supposed to be a serious movie that can't be a good thing. The action scenes were not bad, but they lacked the special blow to make it more exciting. Again, better direction was needed. Pacing was also wrong for a movie like this. It took the protagonist almost half an hour to get into action. For an action thriller in just 90 minutes that is too slow. The only redeeming factor is Angie Harmon. She does her best to make it work. Too bad the instructor left her. Yes, this movie could have been much better with a great instructor. Andy Cheng is too inexperienced as an instructor to pull it off. And for an action / stunt coordinator of his caliber, you'll expect at least more exciting action scenes. Don't waste your time with this one. Avoid!
