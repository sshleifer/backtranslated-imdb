Gung Ho was a good idea, but it's too much to ask Americans viewers to understand the dynamics of US jobs and foreign competition. In this movie, the protagonist Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) goes to Japan and convinces a Japanese car company coming to America and helping his dying Pennslyvania city. Two things come to you. First, why would a Japanese company come to America to make cars when they do, and so good at it? Second, can anyone understand that US companies of all types go to third-country nations to get their products made to escape US labor costs? This makes the film's premise that the number one maker of cars in the world would go to one of its best competitors (except Germany) and put a plant there as unrealistic. Keaton was still in his comedy mode at this time. But he does give a credible performance that he could prove he could go from comedy to drama in a few seconds and still not be ashamed, but director Ron Howard can't keep this from becoming a television movie it ends to be anyway because they have to give the unlikely story a happy ending to politics and problems in Japanese and American relations that do not resist. Gung Ho has a Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley feel like the producers of both TV shows made the movie and then made the TV version of this movie, giving the film its' light feel.The Japanese manager is fond of his American workers and feel that he and other Japanese people can learn from the Americans. His second man, Saito, who apparently doesn't like the Americans, doesn't think so much. I would have preferred that all the Japanese characters were like Saito than the soft goofball characters they made the Japanese to be. It would have made the movie more interesting.
