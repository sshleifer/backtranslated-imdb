Dr. K (David H Hickey) has tried to master a formula that would stop all illness and disability, but must live donors to complete his work. His medical brother Richard (Dennis O'Neill) has a son named Eddie (Derek Philips) who is licensed for medical education. Eddie has a boyfriend named Sarah (Lizabeth Cardenas) who is pre-law and plans to attend law school even in the coming fall. She and Eddie resume their relationship when Sarah calls things with her current boyfriend, who also shags Walt's lady (Bill Sebastian, Eddie's best friend who recently paid for her cheating boyfriend's boob job). Eddie is accidentally hit by a car and appears on the death of death when Dr. K makes a suggestion to Richard. Let him "restore" Eddie using his secret and illegal methods. When Dr. K uses his serum for Eddie, scary results arise. Eddie's face bends massive warts, while he also has a taste for human flesh. Many will die, so Eddie can feed this uncontrollable appetite, he can't quench. Soon he can even pose a threat to his father and girlfriend. The devil's monster must be stopped. Typically horrible direct to video horror flick suffers from a serious lack of budget, acting and overall talent. The premise, which seems like an interesting scary party, fails to deliver just like a zombie girl. Gore is limited with a few munching scenes, but most of the violence is off-camera. Using time to move the story together can really be annoying.
