As one of the few commentators who haven't seen the first movie, I found this to be a very disappointing movie. Yes, it has a funny, awkward humor if you can carry (very) morally questionable premise. However, it fails abysmally in the important areas. There is a thin and obscene plot line involving Gordon Sinclair's generous friend, who may or may not be confused in a conspiracy to deliver dangerous electronics to third-country countries - possibly in free computers ... or perhaps not. Guard, long lasting and incomplete. The lack of any significant ending is so annoying, and what is present is pompous and completely illogical. The film feels half-finished. Suspension of disbelief is extremely difficult when witnessing a very attractive female teacher (Maria Doyle Kennedy) can be drawn to Gordon Sinclair's unimpressive character, especially when he is averting her progress. Ridiculous. It worsens later in the movie, when he achieves his romantic ambitions, then throws it all away to some ideals based on very little sign of ambiguous value. Not many movies give me the feeling of cheating, but I felt my time was stolen.
