I actually felt bad for the actors in this thing. There is no doubt that a gymnasium's drama class can do a better job or at least also a job. The actors must have thought that this would be their great chance to work in a movie, it certainly wasn't. Besides the horrible action, the stories were boring and mostly predictable. The one about the remote didn't even make sense. For bad reasons, it had the best premise in the pile. I am all about supporting low budget films and giving new filmmakers a fair chance, but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to the viewer. I've only seen it because of some good comments posted here. They must have been planted by people with ties to the film. You can fool people into seeing this, but you can't fool them into feeling what they saw. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because at least the boxer history was trying to be heart warming. Sure it failed miserably, but it tried. I reserve 1 s for the worst of the worst. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor and jump over this dribble. I wish I had.
