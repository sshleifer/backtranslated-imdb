Annie Potts is the only highlight in this really boring movie. Mark Hamill plays a teen who is really really worried that someone stole Corvette, he and his classmates turned into a hotrod (possibly the ugliest-looking car to be highlighted in a movie) and head to Las Vegas with Annie to trace the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joy. I would have picked my eyes after seeing this if it was not fun to see Annie Potts in a very early role, and it is also bad for Hamill that he did not take any plays from her. Danny Bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo.
