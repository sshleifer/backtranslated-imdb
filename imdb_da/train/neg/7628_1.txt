Black and white film. Good photography. Trustworthy characters. <br /> <br /> Just awful. <br /> <br /> I have wasted another perfect night watching a movie that others have considered "worthy" and "very good". There are some good plays here, and the background setting for the plot is good (more should have been done with this), but it is very slow to grow and never develop. It is totally based on sex without much romance with very unnecessary nudity. More could have been done with the protagonists. If you are looking for something to see with you family this in not the movie and if not you have trouble sitting through it. Although this film is long, it is only about 1 cm deep!
