I started watching this movie with high expectations. But after one hour I gave up on this movie as it only recorded many unanswered questions on me. This started already in the opening order and only got worse. <br /> <br /> Why should they bury Hollander under a statue? Why is there an Italian comedian? Why did the farmer's wife save Hollander? Why was he not, when saved, driven for his life instead of loving the peasant's wife? Why didn't the farmer's wife save Holland at a time when the farmer would not be around? Why did these presumably illiterate farmers understand Italian? Why did the Italian comedian know about the Dutch gold? Why did he hide it in the cesspool in the middle of the evil farmer's estate? These and many more questions appeared and none of them seemed to be answered in an acceptable way. So I guess I'm totally missing the point in this movie and I don't associate the story in any way ....
