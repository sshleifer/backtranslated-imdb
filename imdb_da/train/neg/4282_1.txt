I simply cannot understand why all these relics from the Ceausescu era refuse to let go. One can clearly see how frustrated they were during the commission's censorship, which forbids them so many things to show in their films, and now they imagine how much artistic freedom is, so fill the screen with people who defecate, urinate, vomit , swear, and any other kind of disgrace imaginable. THIS IS NOT NOTE, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORHOODS! This is simply visual perversion. Forget about Bunuel's Chien Andalou, about David Lynch, about Forman and Neo-Realism, and other filmmakers who could work with an aesthetics of cruelty. These people mastered their job - well, you don't! Do us a favor, everything you Daneliucs and Nicolaescus and Saizescus and Muresans and Marinescus and Margineanus and others outdated old-fashioned and let alone! It's some time to watch some Romanian movies on the screen, probably with your immature terribilisms! You're Not Directors, You're ILLITATING !!!
