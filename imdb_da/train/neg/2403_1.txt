Whack !!! I got this movie because Elizabeth Hartman was in it. I was disappointed to find out that she was in like two short scenes towards the end. Apart from that, I was pretty much pushing the fast-forward button all the time. Some teenagers go on a trip to Romania with their father and are bitten by a wolf and become a werewolf if there is a full moon. He kills his father and friends. About 30 years past, but he does not age a bit and enrolls in a high school. There he meets a shy teacher, whom he ends up biting and then has children with her. This movie sucked and I do not recommend it to anyone. Read war and peace instead. Only Mrs Hartman did a good job. Check out a very young Bob Saget in this one !!
