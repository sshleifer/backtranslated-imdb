This is the second time I've seen this movie in 12 years. These comments come from a person who finds Kane and Ambersons to be fantastic, worthy movies. But the rest of Welle's career is unfortunately wasted on material that is not worthy of his talent and too flimsy to resist his cinematic embroidery. And when he makes a pot boiler like Shanghai, the lack of something essential to hang his cinematic tricks on is just a little sad. I couldn't tell you what he was doing here. It's as noticeable as Welle's godly Irish brogue; That requires a lot of effort, but adds absolutely zero to the movie. Several Welles projects became this over-developed and baroque. Sir. Arkadin (choose a version, any version) is a similarly trained project. The material is insignificant. It just can't bear the weight of all this noodles. For a director acting in a reality-based drama (like here), he never feels like pulling to tie his bundle of endowments back to reality; or to a coherent story. The murder of hiring the scheme is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Welles, to have Hayworth cut her hair and get that performance out of her. The camera loves her. She is the most classic, most exclusive, hungry and brilliant femme fatale ever put on film. But her betrayal comes so late in the movie it feels like a desperate decision so the movie will have a genre that fits in. The movie cannot be saved by a noir convention implemented in the last 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> When all is said and done in L.F.S., the convolutions are all for what? to convince you that you have seen some thought to give Welles more to do? to make you roll your eyes? Welles has no sensitivity to the extent of a story or to tell a story directly. One wonders what Shanghai has to say to anyone who is not a crippled billionaire, arranges a quadruple crossword to hire the scheme or a fanboy in love with non-sense or substance cinematic performances. <br /> <br /> Overworked, prevented, unengaged.
