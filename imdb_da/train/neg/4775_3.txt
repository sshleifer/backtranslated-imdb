What a complete waste of time. The movie starts as a clone of the Saw series, but with even worse plays. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely horrible. The end is ridiculous, and the story contains no phrases, not plot surprises and just a plain bad ending. I liked some of the characters, and I hoped for everything to be tied together at the end. It just doesn't happen. It's a total "wrestler" ending with none of the good actors. I can't believe I spent the time watching this. It's not "fun" that some people put it on. A guy in a mask kidns people who are connected and forcing them to find out. The connection is a stretch and he should have shot the main actress first.
