It was almost worth sitting through this god-horrible "movie" just to know that I can never experience anything as bad as this again. Action - 0, script - 0, fight scenes - 0, male management - 0 (eight mile cheddar as a suave war hero who gets the girl), Nadia Bjorlin - 10 (She is beautiful and not a horrible actress). These are the criteria I used to average it out to a two. I lost count, but I think ever movie clich√©, ever, is in this movie. When the driver, who apparently killed his father miraculously, turns out to end up fighting at her end, on the other hand, it has not cemented the previous sentence. Plus he turns out just for no reason. He was never even mentioned before. I don't know what's more to say here. Just watch it when it comes out on television in a couple of years. At least that way, some of it will be edited out for advertisements.
