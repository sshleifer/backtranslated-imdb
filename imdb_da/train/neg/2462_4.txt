Well, I like to do in this movie - it's genuinely unsetteling. Anyone who has been to the dentist will know why. The story is really not so bad that Corbin Bersen's character motivates much more than in most horror movies. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse acting, director, script, etc. But at the end of the day it's still a bad horror movie. So it comes down to if you enjoy that kind of thing or not. I tried to see the sequel, but it was exactly the same as this movie. Just remember if you enjoy people being tortured by the dentist then this is the movie for you!
