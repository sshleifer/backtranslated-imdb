I was gifted with this movie as it had such a great premise, the friendship of three friends the hassle of falling in love with a younger man. <br /> <br /> Intriguing. <br /> <br /> NOT! I rush to add. These women are all drawn in extreme caricature, not particularly supportive of each other and collapse and strive to bring each other down. <br /> <br /> Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton couldn't do anything wrong in my book until I saw this, but here they are handed a gloomy script and told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball, which doesn't work too well when the women are all well-known professionals in a very small town. <br /> <br /> And for intelligent women, they spend a whole bunch of time submitting to the lack of men / sex / desire in their lives. I felt much more could have been made of it given a proper script and more excitement, the lesbian subplot went nowhere and the smokers / drinking women (all 3 in the eighties?) Were very unrealistic - even in the baby scene - Screw the baby, give a cigarette! Right. <br /> <br /> As I said, a shame of waste. 4 out of 10
