"Whipped" is one of the most horrible movies all the time. It is a medium-sized piece of waste that has forced me to stay in the theater more than any other movie in 2000, except perhaps "The Grinch". It's not what people have called it, an insight into modern relationships. It would be a small movie called "High Fidelity." While this film was honest and sympathetic, the "whip" is hostile, cynical, misanthropic movie venue. Avoid this as so many ailments unless you want to see how really a bad "comedy" can get.
