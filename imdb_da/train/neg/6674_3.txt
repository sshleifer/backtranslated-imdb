I have to admit that the drawing of this movie is director Eduardo Sanchez who fucked the wildly popular and successful Blair Witch Project. Moreover, this is a foreign movie of the kind and sounded like Stephen King's Dreamcatchers, one of the films the critics hated, but I enjoyed. <br /> <br /> But no, I felt sorry for most parts, Altered is a waste of time, so I have to keep this review short. Premises are always promising and Altered is no different. It tells the story of a group of men who experienced strange encounters when they were younger, and like others, others will take you as a nutcase to imagine things. Stories of alien abduction must always handle probes in the openings, so I do not go into details, but you get the drive, it is damn uncomfortable and something you would like to forget. <br /> <br /> What if you have the chance of revenge? You succeed in chasing and catching a living. What do you want to do? For this group, it is a happy buy-back, or they thought. And here's the movie starting to evolve into a snoozyest with poor, uninspiring dialogue and even worse acting. Though it is low budgeted, there are not many redeeming factors, be it the strength of the story or any kind of help from the cast to make their characters just a little interesting. It's standard cardboard fare from a vanilla plain script, combined with some cheap scare tactics employed. What is good, but is makeup. Great emphasis has been placed on making some of the things that I should not mention because it will only ruin the few elements of what makes this movie tolerable. Apart from that, there are the usual cheap special effects, blood and gory moments that are not something you have never seen before. <br /> <br /> See this only as a last resort. Compared to the other monster movie in town - Fest, this is less fun and takes care of seriously. Bogged down by an uninspiring direction you've been warned.
