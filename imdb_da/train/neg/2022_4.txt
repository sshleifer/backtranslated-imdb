Man, it gets many good reviews in the review books. Frankly, I found it too slow and uncomfortable right from the start. I was waiting to get some steam, but it never happened. This movie is very overrated. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare, with King James English, has never appealed to me anyway, so it may just be me. There is a fair share of the latter in the first half of the movie as they show Ronald Colman who plays Othello. <br /> <br /> The good points in the movie include - thanks to a restored print - some decent movie and a young, slim and attractive Shelly Winters. All in all, this is simply too boring, too much repetition in some of the scenes to see again. Moreover, we all know that most actors are emergency cases, yet, but kudos to Hollywood to demonstrate this in this story.
