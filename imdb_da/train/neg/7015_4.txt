"54" is a movie based on the infamous "Studio 54" in the 1970s - the hangout for the social elite and the party clubs. In the film, Ryan Phillippe is the protagonist, based on an actual employee of Studio from 1977 to 1982. <br /> <br /> The problem of the film is that it is all glitter and style and no fabric. It tries to be a really grimy and probing satire as "Boogie Nights", but eventually comes across as a poorer wannabe. Mike Myers gets the incredible job of playing cocaine-snorting club owner Steve Rubell. It's just a little comical role, and if this was Myer's best attempt to slip into the drama that Lemmon and other comic actors did in their time, it's a total failure. "54" might have been insightful and interesting, but instead it's just another stupid teenager game that isn't entertaining or even externally engaging. Look at your own risk.
