This movie is NOT the same as the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason, and it's a shame because the 1954 version seems to me to be much better. I do not deny Barbra Streisand's talent at all. She is a good actress and brilliant singer. I am not aware of Kris Kristofferson's other work, and therefore I cannot judge it. But this film leaves much to be desired. It is the pace slow, it has free nudity and foul language and can be very hard to sit through. <br /> <br /> But I'm not a big fan of rock music, so it's only natural that I would like the Judy Garland version better. Watch the 1976 film with Barbra and Kris, and judge for yourself.
