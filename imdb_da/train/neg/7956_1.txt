This film must be number one on the bottom 100. The play is so terrible that when my son and I looked at it, we became almost physically sick. And the story is worse. I could go on with how bad it is, but all I really wanted to do was add a warning to Frank's review, seeing that no one else has been bothering to do it yet. Don't waste your time, money, energy or anything else in this movie. For goodness we saw it on TV so we didn't use anything on it. Had we, I would have been forced to write the people who are responsible for this abomination and be forced to cast an expulsion in their general direction. In conclusion, I would like to say that I have always enjoyed seeing Carrie Fisher action. But I'm sorry to say she's not worth watching in this movie. Do not spoil your opinion of Carrie by seeing it.
