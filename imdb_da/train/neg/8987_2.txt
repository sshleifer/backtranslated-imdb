The only redeeming quality of this movie is the real story ... Otherwise, this movie was horrible. The play was ridiculously bad, and the set design was cheesy and very sticky. The story was decent, but it was very hard to see because of all that scary play. I don't recommend watching this one ... The only redeeming quality of this movie was that the actors were somewhat attractive ... Especially Ryan Bauer, the man who plays the soap opera star. Some of the editing was well done, but there are continuity errors everywhere ... I'm just starting to get sick and tired of watching gay movies that are bad ... Can we get a good one soon?
