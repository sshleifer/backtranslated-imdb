Elizabeth Ward Gracen, probably only remembered as one of Bill Clinton's "bimbo outbreaks" (they have pills for it now!) Is probably the weakest item in this show. It really continues the tired formula in the Highlander Series Hero hero immortal encounters another immortal with flashbacks the last time they met, but there is some conflict and there is a sword battle at the end where you have a cheap special effects sequence. <br /> <br /> Then you have the character of Nick Wolf. Basically, your typical unobtrusive 90's is, with the typical "Sexual Excitement" story. (Seriously, why do you think in Hollywood that sexual excitement is more interesting than sex.) This was a common Canadian / French production, so half of the series is in Vancouver imitating New York, and the other half is in Paris .. Just like Highlander did.
