If you saw this movie, you know why I said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus". Hehehe !!! Every time they said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus" ... I laughed thinking "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did I rent this movie"? I can't believe how Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appeared in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Dreaful trades! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could have done a much better job! This job was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believe me, I'm not a big fun of him ... but I really prefer an actor, not this android called Timberlake. And his girlfriend was low, hollow and annoying as hell. I was happy when they were both popped on the street. <br /> <br /> The story was ok and I think Dylan Mc Dermott made his bad guy very good. The movie was entertaining, but I think Timberlake destroyed it all. It would have been a lot of fun without him. By the way, the music was ok, but suddenly every time the music appeared, the film was converted into an MTV video clip with flashes, low movements and similar things. Something wrong placed for this police movie I thought. Maybe they would make an MTV video clip for Timberlake.
