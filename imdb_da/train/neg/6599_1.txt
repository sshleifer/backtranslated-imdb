Who was George C. Scott? George C. Scott was a famous actor. Almost any movie he has been in is better for it. Now George didn't have anything to do with this movie ... but he once said something describing the movie to a T. I don't remember his exact words, but he said pretty much the big writing can save bad but great action can Don't save bad writing. Never has this little observation been threatening than in "Laurel & Hardy's All New Adventures: For Love or Mummy". The casting of the two leads was absolutely perfect. Bronson Pinchot (Laurel) and Gailard Sartain (Hardy) not only look the parts, but they do an exceptionally good job by imitating the real deal (way and everything). This film should stand as a lasting testament to their talents. That said, this movie falls flat on the face when it comes to it (you guessed it). LETTER. <br /> <br /> Apart from the opening dialogue between Pinchot and Sartain (which was very "in character") and a short gag with a taxi, this movie is an absolute task to sit through. <br /> <br /> PROBLEM # 1: Too much time and effort went into the plot. <br /> <br /> I don't want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the beautiful British lady. What I want to see is to see Stan and Ollie (or at least their stand-ins). Too much screen time was dedicated to explaining the plot or to the not-very-fun secondary characters that the plot was about. <br /> <br /> But even though this movie had been all jokes, it would still go with us ... <br /> <br /> ... PROBLEM # 2: Most jokes are what I would call "water down" slapstick. <br /> <br /> What do I mean by the "water"? In slapstick, a character gets hurt in an exaggerated way for comic effects (ala Looney Tunes, 3 Stooges ..., or what about Laurel & Hardy?). In the "water down" slapstick (which I define it), a sign becomes mildly damaged or unnoticed, and the filmmakers play it for comic effects. <br /> <br /> Perhaps an illustration will help: <br /> <br /> In Looney Tunes, Daffy Duck is shot by Elmer Fudd. His bill falls off and he puts it back on. It's classic slapstick. <br /> <br /> In this "gem", Ollie accidentally encounters some people. They turn around, tell him to be careful, and continue in their merry way. It's not slapstick. It's not even fun. It's just ... boring ... and this movie is full of these kinds of jokes. It's like they're the movie's bread and butter. The authors and directors just take these dull moments and act like they should be fun. Permitted, the example I just gave is the most extreme case, but I can only cut it so much lax. <br /> <br /> Short story short: The movie just doesn't work because the script fails to exploit Pinchot's and Sartain's ability to imitate Stan and Ollie. Instead, the script is printed on plot display and lame jokes. Seeing this movie looks pretty much like two good imitators who didn't get any real material to work with. <br /> <br /> Not a good movie, but an amazing sleeping aid. <br /> <br /> I say give this one a lady and stick to the right deal (just as long as you remove "Atoll K" and "Be Big").
