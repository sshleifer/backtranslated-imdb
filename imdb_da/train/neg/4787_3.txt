This entry is certainly interesting for the series fans (like myself), but it is mostly incomprehensible. The reason is confusing, as is the continuity of the course. Some striking effects, surely, but we never find out what it all really means. <br /> <br /> Try to see the "NC-17" working paper edition containing the gore cut to be re-rated "R".
