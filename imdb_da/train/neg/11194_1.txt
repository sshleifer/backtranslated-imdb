The coming attractions to "The Order" make it seem like a decent horror mystery / thriller, but what we get is a plot that has the potential to be excellent, all thrown together to form a pile of waste. <br /> <br /> First, the whole movie consists of horrible dialogue and god horrible special effects. The action was also nothing to be proud of, but Keath Ledger (I think I spelled it right.) Saved the movie in this category. <br /> <br /> For heaven's sake: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!
