Overall, this movie is terrible and should never have been made. One of the problems with this movie is that there is no link to the audience and the characters, for example, if she is being attacked, you will feel, "Oh My God, No!" But you do not do this in this case Are you indifferent because there is no link made to know the character. In the trailer, it seemed that the movie would be great, but there is no excitement what ever really happens. There could have been some mystery, but there is nothing. "Everything she has is a toolbox." was said on the back of the DVD, would you think it was carefully planned this movie, and wisely made, but it wasn't, the end was just awful, very straight forward and pointless too. The play is either average or below average, perhaps even lower. In my opinion, it was a waste of an hour in my life. The "Special Effects" and sets were also average, nothing special about what so ever. There is not much to do or bloody violence, not much blood is shown. This movie was announced to make it sound amazing, but really, it is not even worth looking for, I do not recommend it to anyone unless they are easily satisfied, by a few games and a boring story.
