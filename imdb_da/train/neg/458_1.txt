What is this lap? My little cousin picked this out of course for the all-too-fond DVD art and title ... I decided to see it with her so she wasn't bored and I was sure to be horrified at the terrible quality. <br /> <br /> First, the play was terrible. They look like amateur actresses reading off cue cards. Delivery is sub-par and very formal. The scene cuts were terrible. It seems that they took it directly from the storyboard if there was one. <br /> <br /> Second, the jokes and stereotypes were not original or well-played at all, much cheating. I can't count the times I could predict the next joke. I got a couple of chuckles out of the blatantly "subtle" sexual innuendos. The Cat, The Beaver Patch, Hung Wong? .. Came! Just ... get away from this movie. It's not cute, it's not fun, it's not even foolish fun. It's just stupid-stupid. It is like a PG kids movie with unnecessarily sexual induction, vulgarity and violence to bump the MPAA class. PLEASE NOTE. <br /> <br /> "Would you like to ride my yacht?" <br /> <br /> "Is that what they call it now?" <br /> <br /> "You could ride my ding." <br /> <br /> "Oh, I think I got blood on my stool!" <br /> Poor play, sir.
