I rented this by mistake. After a brief examination of the box I thought this was a time-travel / sci-fi story. Instead, it's a "Christian" story, and I suppose it's a pretty typical example. If you are sold on the message, you will probably overlook the sudden / action / etc., but I found it quite painful. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I am bothered by the rewriting of the story in this story. It paints the 1890s as a kind of paradise for family values ​​and morals (a sign is horrified that 5% of marriages end in divorce!), But it overlooks very unpleasant sides of this "high moral" society (stiff race, sexual and social discrimination was widespread, for example). And at one point, the hero complains to a clothing store store about things that don't sound anything but complaints from some Iranian leaders about women's clothing styles (as reported in a recent WSJ). All in all, I thought suppose these are the kinds of things you'd like to suffer if you like this kind of thing, and that's definitely healthy ...
