The good soil is not a good movie in any way, it is all too common. Perhaps it was different in the 1930s, but who would like to see a farmer's life. It's not very interesting to me. Yes, Luis Rainer and Paul Muni do an excellent job, but the film has been drawing too long. I could have told you the end of this movie at first action. In short, Wang Lung (Muni), a little farmer who doesn't want to be like his own father, turns out to be like him. Both fall in love with their wives just as they are on their deathbed. The movie makes a complete 360 ​​go from one generation to the next. Also this movie had no good character actors or funny moments, it was just depressing things about lasting as a farmer in a time of crisis.
