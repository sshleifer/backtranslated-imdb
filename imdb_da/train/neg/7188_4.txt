When I got a glimpse of the title, I thought we should get another try-hard hip slasher, but I actually found "7eventy 5ive" to be mildly passable, and almost 80's throwback after a boring slow middle section captures The momentum for the last half hour that leads to it is the outrageously sticky climax and even cop out durability. It won't win prizes for originality because it's as systematic as you can get and steal its thunder in the way of excitement (usual cheap jumping), placement (secluded mansion) and motivation from other movies. The shiny direction is by-the-book and the material is quite hackneyed with poorly realized red herring within its elaborate plot and flimsy script. Sometimes ridiculous, but nonetheless, I was entertained mainly because of his brutal and grisly acts of pulpy violence against some rather unpleasant annoying college students of a psychotic killer with a battle ax. The performances were not bad in the form of a spunky young cast, but the characters they were portraits were not very enticing. An always presentable Rutger Hauer appears in a brief supportive role as a grizzled detective. A smoothly made, but a low and forgetful addition to the fold.
