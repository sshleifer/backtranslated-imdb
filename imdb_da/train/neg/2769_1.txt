This movie serves as a timely warning to anyone who believes they can both write and control their own movie. Face it, you can't. Because that way there is no one around to tell you when you chop large holes in your plot, have meaningless transitions, trite, immense dialogue and manage to turn a pretty cool Korean play into a steaming pile of celluloid turd. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie as a trashy popcorn movie, I really did; I like lots of crappy movies. But when I have been forced to ask myself what the hell has just happened and why, dear sir, why? more than a couple of times I really can't take it any more. <br /> <br /> I would also love for someone to explain how LA became Mordor to the last scene.
