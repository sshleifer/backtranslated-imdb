I watched this movie recently because a friend brought it with him from NYC. After 30 minutes I said to him, "You must be fooled. Is that such a joke?" He thought it was good. I told him I thought it was probably one of the silliest movies ever made. "What would it be?" I asked. "A propaganda movie made for children?" The reason is stupid. The play is the worst ever for most of the principled and honest people who look at this kind of trick and think it has something to do with life, love or even afterlife, which gives an incredible idiotic view ... need some psychiatric help. If someone tries to make you keep it in your DVD or VCR, consider it as if you wanted to introduce a virus into your computer. It won't ruin your player, but it will ruin your night. If they had made Razzies in their 40s, it would have won in each category. (PS. It also goes under the dubious sobriquet of "Stairs to Heaven.")
