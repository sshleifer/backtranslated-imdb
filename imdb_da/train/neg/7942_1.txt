Really. Oprah remembers every week that she was abused as a child? <br /> <br /> She focuses on each interview. <br /> <br /> Oprah can't resist commenting on answers to every question she asks. She often interrupts guests before an answer is completed to interject their own page or anecdote. Conductors are, of course, instructed to focus on her closeup reaction instead of the guest's faces, because that's what counts - what Oprah feels like Oprah says. Oprah, Oprah, Oprah. It's always about Oprah. <br /> <br /> Oprah says - Pamper me, I was so bad. Feel my pain with my weight. Feel my injury when I am away from a fancy store after they are already closed. Be good at buying my magazines and books. Good for my success. Feel good when you give to my charity to make me look good. Feel good at making me rich beyond belief. My interpretation of her point of view: YOU VIEWERS ARE ALL DEEPLY FLAWED, and you need my daily advice. I have all the answers to your life, even though I have nothing in common with you. I have never been married or I will also be. I've never had to travel a family - but I know all about it. I have little respect for men or marriage. I clearly prefer people like me to others - witnesses "Legends Ball 2006". Gayle is my best friend, but we are not gay. From 31/7/2006, the headline on her website actually reads: "Oprah.com is your leading source of information about love, life, self, relationships, food, home, spirit and health." How and how unpleasant is it? <br /> <br /> In June 2006, she ran two private wedding meetings in Oklahoma to gather footage for her September 2006 shows. She keeps promising to finish television, but her yapfest pulls on without end in sight. Contrary to what she thinks, Oprah is neither a queen nor a goddess or a personal mission from God. She's just a very lucky, overweight, black woman who copied Phil Donahue's style and called it her own. She was in the right place at the right time and knew exactly how to suck up the right demographic. <br /> <br /> Oprah is P.T. Barnum of this age and it amazes me that people cannot see through her facade. <br /> <br /> So ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls and you, too, Oprah, if you can fit the inflated ego through the door - This way to the great exit ...
