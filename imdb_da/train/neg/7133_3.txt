I felt like I was watching Fast and Furious again, but with different actors and a little different plot. I would say that the cars in the movie are very cool. So if you like fast cars, then you will find this movie mildly entertaining. I also liked Nadia Bjorlin because I saw her from Days in our lives. She is a really good singer, but too badly gave her so miserable songs to sing in this movie. I mean songs about cars; Not exactly what you wanted here on the radio. Since it's a Hollywood movie, you have to give this story a little bit, but in reality I don't think an average joe would come across such a hot girl as Nadia Bjorlin, who can drive a racing car, Make a car engine and be a leading singer. It's just stupid. <br /> <br /> Another side note, anyone willing to bet 25 million on a car race is a distress. But it was a little cool at the end when Natasha stopped just before the finish line and screwed Michael over. Priceless. <br /> <br /> FINALLY VALUE: This movie is for car freaks. So if you like fast cars then I would recommend this.
