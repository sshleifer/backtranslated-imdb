I watched this movie at SXSW with the director present. Few people went out, and the audience could hardly even even polite applause at the end. Of the 60 or 70 films I've seen at this festival, Frownland is among the worst. <br /> <br /> In 106 minutes it is at least 95 minutes too long. You will see the protagonist's failed and drawn-out attempts to communicate for a long time. The same grimaces, survive mouth movements, kinetic and frankly repeated words and syllables over and over again - We get the point. <br /> <br /> In fact, a site compares this work to early Mike Leigh. What substances should you be on to make this statement? Since Frownland is a Captain Beefheart song, you may have to enjoy trout mask replica on powerful rotation to appreciate this movie. Amazingly, this won a jury award at the festival. You can bet it won't win an audience prize.
