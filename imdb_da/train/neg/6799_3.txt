Don't expect much from this movie. In many ways, this movie resembles a movie that Doris Day recorded in 1956, titled Julie. In this movie, Doris, who was a flying companion, flight attendant, in those days, the aircraft landed after her infant, played by Louis Jordan shot captain. She did a much better job, more convincing than Kim Ojah, who took control of a 747 and managed to land it without much help from the control tower. I know a little about 747 aircraft, I use myself to be an air traffic controller. As I said, don't expect much from this movie, it was done on a cheap budget. The producers were cheap to use an airplane with the name of an airline on it. Oceanic is a name that several films have used. The only writing on this plane was the name of the company that made the plane.
