This story is about the romantic triangle between an nth. African male prostitute, a French transsexual prostitute (Stephanie) and a Russian servant who does not speak French and never seems to shave. As a movie, it is boring, boring and depressing, shot either on the foggy, cloudy winter days or in poorly lit interiors, where everyone is bathed in a strange blue luminescence. And yes, I know, because the white balance was out. Everyone is pale and worn and looks sharp, shabby and dirty. Bodies are bones and shot in such a close-up that they look pretty ugly and unpleasant. Moles, oily hair. Yuk. Bad news in a movie where people spend a lot of time either naked or having sex. <br /> <br /> And the story? Well, Stephanie's mother is dying. All three characters go back to Stephanie's hometown, where through a bunch of flashbacks to desolate landscapes and predictable spawning grounds, we see a bit of Stephanie's childhood as a boy named Pierre. The mother dies. Well ... and it's really about it. The character development is kept to a minimum, as is the history of history. <br /> <br /> I suppose the story is not linear (it would explain many non-sequiteurs), but really after paying my seven euros I don't feel like having to construct the movie myself: it's the director takes my money for. Expect me to participate in the narrative process and get my hands dirty so to speak, asking too much. <br /> <br /> This movie is a lot of pretentious waste, which is made above all by a desire to epater les bourgeois (ie shock straight). I can see how it was a shoo-in to the Berlin Film Festival, and I can see why it didn't come anywhere.
