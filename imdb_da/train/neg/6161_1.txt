This is possibly the worst fence, sword fighting, movies ever made. It's not just because the so-called sports fencing is bad, but because the plot, the characters are so weak that they have to throw in half a nude sex scene and later suppose that group dances around a fence scene in the fence club trying to preserve audience interest. What a waste of F. Murray Abraham's talents. You're better off with overwhelmed swashbuckling movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, all that has Basil Rathbone as the villain. As the phenomenon itself, I recognize the impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport on film, but if ever it happens, it must be fresher, better drawn figures and a plot with more depth.
