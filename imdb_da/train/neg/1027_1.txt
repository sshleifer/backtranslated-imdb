Usually I have much better things to do with my time than writing reviews, but I was so disappointed with this movie that I spent an hour recording with IMDb just to get it off my chest. <br /> <br /> You'd think a movie with names like Morgan Freeman or Kevin Spacey would be a bankable game ... well, this movie was just awful. It is almost impossible to "disbelieve"; I really tried I wanted it, but Justin Timberlake just didn't want to leave me. <br /> <br /> Timberlake must stick to music, what a terrible achievement - no presence as an actor, no character. Can't blame everything on Justin: The movie also has a horrible plot and badly timed editing; it is definitely an "F". Having seen this, I have to wonder what really motivates actors. I mean, Morgan actually reads the script before taking part. Didn't he see how poor it was? What could motivate him to take part? Money? Of course, the action is sometimes more about who you are seen with rather than really developing quality work. <br /> <br /> LL Cool J is a great actor; He gets much more screen time than Freeman or Spacey in this movie and really struggles to express himself with the poor script. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the audience goes, "What the hell is going on here? You expect me to believe in this crap?" In short, apart from Justin, a large series is poorly executed - very disappointing.
