I had more trouble with the movie: <br /> <br /> (1) The play - especially Kim Basinger's voice over: Movies are not books; they should * show * the action instead of having a voice over * tell us what is happening. Occasionally I find a movie with a voice over what works, but here it seemed more a lazy way to write the script. In fact, it sounded like she practically read excerpts from the novel in the voice above. I didn't feel emotional in the relationship between Jessie and Brother Thomas and also felt that Alex Carter's play was pretty bad. It is a significant mistake for me to define Jessie and Thomas' characters - without them, it seemed to me that she just wanted a stud and it was for him to be sexually deprived. If it had been done properly, the relationship between them would have given much more coherence to history. <br /> <br /> (3) With the book I understood Jessie's mid-life crisis. In the movie it seemed more like a simple boredom. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, I didn't think the movie was so bad that I could turn off the TV. . . even though that thought occurred to me.
