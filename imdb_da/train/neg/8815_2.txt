Yes, I just need to tell you about this, so don't read if you want surprises. I got this with the title Christmas Evil. There was also another Christmas fear on the DVD called Silent Night, Bloody Night. While quiet night, bloody night (not confused with quiet night, deadly night) had plenty of potential and was very close to being good, this one wasn't quite as good. It was interesting enough to see the villain (if you can call him it) to look at the neighborhood and write in books about who is naughty and beautiful, but after a while you are looking for an action and this movie does not deliver. You need character development, but it goes overboard and you are still never sure why the dive guy snaps. About an hour in, he kills three out of four people, while a whole lot looks in horror, and the boys he kills are not even his goals, they just make fun of him. This is one of many unsuccessful attempts to kill the killer. He then tries to kill this other guy, and he tries to break into his house by squeezing into the fireplace. He instantly settles down and hardly manages to get out. He goes through the basement and then tries to kill the guy by smearing him in his bedroom. He can't seem to kill the guy this way, so he takes a star out of the tree and knocks the guy's neck. What the heck was a tree even in the bedroom at first? Oh yeah, the killer before this killer stopped at a party and also had fun. Well, it's about it, except that the city's people are chasing him with torches and the unresolved part with his brother and the tune he wants to play. What was it about? He kept talking about something that was never really explained. How do you quit asking, well since I have spoilers, I'll tell you. He runs from the road in his van and continues to, well let's just say it was lame !!!!!!!!!!!!
