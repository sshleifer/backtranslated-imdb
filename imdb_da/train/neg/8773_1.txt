If you have seen much smaller movies, it may be great for you. If you've seen many movies, it's a joke. The effect of real heroes is done very poorly. Not to mention, there are songs, there are many flashbacks, and most importantly, the martial arts are stupidly done. New characters, good direction, would have done a better job, but since it contains all the Bollywood hero / heroines, you can predict what will happen next time. You don't feel sad when something happens, the feelings they present are terrible, primarily because we've seen this actor in 1000 other Hindi movies. It's supposed to be a realistic movie, but it doesn't show. There are times when you are wondering that you have thousands of soldiers full of soldiers moving and the Pakistanis bombing them, and none of their bombs hit them. Are the packages really bad for aiming or the director made them look stupid? There were few signs that worked very well, but as far as plot, action is concerned, it is poorly directed. This movie could have been short if they took out songs, flashbacks, stick to the point.
