Just as I thought I'd finish a whole year without giving a single movie a "Bomb" rating, a friend brought this infamous turd to my house last night. I feared the worst knowing of his reputation, and it was as God-horrible as I had expected. This is a Mexican-made mess, called to English, and produced by K. Gordon Murray. It has horrible sets and effects and has a rather scary Santa who does not operate in the North Pole, but instead of a cloud in outer space, and who does not have small rivers that help him make his toys, but rather all different groups of children from virtually all countries are there. The opening sequence, where St. Nick hangs heartily as he observes screens that show that all these kiddies work hard while singing horrible holiday songs in a number of languages, seems to go on forever and without history. Obviously, this Christmas law does not comply with the Child Labor Act! <br /> <br /> Finally, we get some unpleasant and slimmed red-handed apprentice of the devil who himself travels from hell to Earth, just to make little kids cheek and turn Santa's Christmas Eve around in a nightmare. Watching this movie is a trippy and twisted experience, and it has to scare young children and turn off Christmas clauses and holidays forever. It is strange that the name of Jesus Christ is often mentioned in this Christmas film, which somehow makes it all the more eerie in the context of all the bizarre things going on. This easily makes my personal list of "worst movies I've ever seen", but I'm sure it's not unique.
