There is a UK edition for this show, which is slightly less extravagant than the American version. The person will get a new kitchen or maybe bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got. The American version of this show is all that reality TV shouldn't be. Instead of making a few improvements to a house that the residents couldn't afford or even do, the whole house is being rebuilt. I do not know if this show is trying to show what is a miserable welfare system in the United States, or if you are begging hard enough, you will receive. The rather vulgar product placement that takes place, especially of Sears, is also not unconditional. Rsther than turning a family into a deprived area of ​​potential millionaires would be far better at helping society as a whole, instead of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a home, building something for the whole community ..... maybe somewhere where diy and power tools can be borrowed and returned together with building materials so that everyone can benefit if they want. Giving it all to a person can cause tremendous anger among the rest of the community, still living in the same run-down homes.
