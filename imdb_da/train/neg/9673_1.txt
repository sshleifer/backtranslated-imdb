"Plants are the most listed and vicious of all life forms," ​​a dopey said would be the victim of "The Seedpeople", a silly and lax remake of "Invasion of the Bodysnatchers", "Triffids Day" and about a thousand udder moovies. And why are seeds moore dangerous than plants you can ask? Because, according to the same stupid, "seeds can hunt us". Yeah, I remember a horrible event when MooCow was just a calf, chased all the way home from the school of ravenous dandylion seeds ... Yeah, right. Unfortunately, the "monsters" in this seedy little turkey look like shaggy little muppets, some of whom roll around like evil tumbleweeds, others who sail on strings. There is not even the slightest incline of terror or excitement found here. For reasons which are not explained, seed seeds are knocked out of 50 volts ultraviolet light, although they can go around in daylight, which has about 1,000,000,000,000 times more UV energy. As you can see, not much thought was put into this cow flop. MooCow says you go in the grass in the garden instead of wasting your photosynthesis here. : = 8P
