I have to admit that over her dead body was actually not as bad as I expected, my mother wanted to see it so I rented it. I was just going to go ahead and see the horror in front of my eyes, but it wasn't actually that bad. I just expect this horrible movie, but it seems that the authors didn't cause any harm, but the casting of Eva Longoria (Parker, sorry), she seems a little off the film. I think I might have found it a little better without her, but she's annoying me. But Paul Rudd and Lake Bell had a decent chemistry that made the movie a bit likeable. But you have to admit there was no opinion on this movie, it was one of the quick pay slips for the actor type of thing. The movie could have been more fun if someone had really emphasized it and had a better throw. <br /> <br /> Henry just lost his bride to be, Kate, who was killed by an ice sculpture on their wedding day. But when his sister takes him to a psychic, Ashley, Henry falls for her, but Kate jokes her out of the grave. Kate is jealous and doesn't want Henry to move on so fast, and she'll make sure Ashley doesn't get him torturing her day and night with her scratches, believe me with Kate's voice, it's scary. <br /> <br /> Over her dead body is a good movie, not sure if it's worth the money, but I will give it a rental for you if you want to see it or are curious. Eva Longoria just doesn't have enough starry power to do the film work, no offense for those who love her, she just belongs to the small screen over the silver screen. Not to mention Ashley's character, she still doesn't seem to be too fond of everything she draws, or her "gay" friend, Dan, just again, not really sympathetic. Just with a little rewriting and proper attention, this movie could have been better, but instead we get the average predictable romantic comedy that will leave with an empty feeling. <br /> <br /> 4/10
