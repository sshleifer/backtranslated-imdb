Odd slasher film from Producer Charles Band. In the full month's greatest success, Band said he would never make "real killer movies" because he felt that the little dolls and big monsters added a fantasy element that made the movies better. People killing each other are thus real and more fun. A good philosophy and a real shame that Band, which destroyed the Full Moon study through possible scary business relationships, became so desperate for the home theater excess that he started to do exactly the same thing that Blockbuster wanted and therefore sacrificed creativity and originality. The team behind this one also worked on the Delta Delta Die! and 'Birth Rite' - both just as bland by Full Moon standards. Debbie Rochon is in the usual top form here as a newcomer to a gang of dudes and dudes who decide to make a story about a "murder club". She - as one of course - does everything she can to join in and then panic because it was not a true story and stupid. Ms Rochon believed in it, and now everyone has to run around to be covered in blood and maybe kill each other or maybe not. The choice is there, and with regard to this movie your yours is ... not recommended, but not quite bad either.
