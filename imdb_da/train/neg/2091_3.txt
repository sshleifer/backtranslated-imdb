I remember seeing BSG pilot. I can accurately describe that night. I remember which chair I was sitting in. That show was magic. It came alive. I have had the first two years of BSG. I also enjoyed parts of the third year, and I looked at all episodes in the fourth year, faithfully in the hope that it would somehow turn around. It didn't. <br /> <br /> I saw the Caprica pilot and got excited. There was hope for something good here. Then I began to see the fixed episodes, and they are becoming increasingly boring. <br /> <br /> It's too obvious, too predictable. It reminds me of the crazy political correctness in his last failed show, Virtuality. <br /> <br /> Much of his line work on the DS9 was good. When he focused on BSG in an organized way, it was good. This was especially true early as the more or less followed the pattern of episodes set by the first BSG series. As they walked away from it after meeting Admiral Cain and Pegasus, it all went. It was as if he wrote the rest of the show without knowing where he was going. <br /> <br /> Maybe it will get better. Maybe it was only a few weak initial episodes. But I'm very, very nervous.
