I watched the whole movie, waited and waited for something to happen. Maybe it's my fault to expect evil and horror instead of psychology? Is it a strange mention of the Oedipal myth: I will kill my father and mother and marry my uncle and compose musical theater with him? I did not understand why certain plate elements were present: Why was the construction upstairs, why was there the large stairwell with a perfect place for someone to fall to their death if no one would actually do so, why do the scenes at all with the father at work So why have a good kitchen if you only need to takeout, why would the boy be baptized and the parents be opposed to it instead of vice versa. I see lots of good reviews for this movie ... has my taste been ruined by going up with the 70s b-movies and old sci fi flicks?
