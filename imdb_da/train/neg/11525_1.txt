Simply terrible! Why wouldn't you use actual actors? Look, it must stop! Stop using non-actors! If you want any credibility or message sent through these low budget movies ... please use real actors for love of God! Most will work for free ... take advantage of it! Now back to my comment ... nevertheless humor was lower than the bathroom variety and was not fun at any level. In terms of quality ... in a scene filmed on a public transport bus, you could see the crew of the crew ... guess what? It was a guy with what looked like a Sony camcorder and probably not even his. Well, I suppose the only audience for this movie is people with a good fetish ... and it wasn't even good gore.
