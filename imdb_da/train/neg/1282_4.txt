Here is one of these films spoiled by the study's insistence on a good ending. Conflicts stretched out for many years are settled in minutes. It would have been far more interesting to inject a tone of ambiguity. The talented Barbara Stanwyck is enchanted by a sudden metamorphosis from independent and confident woman to a compatible woman of the kind she has laid down her entire life. Burned, as usual, is well over his head, and then there is the ridiculous situation of Gig Young, who plays a character named Gig Young. Someone mentions "Gig Young" and who appears, but Gig Young, the actor! Worth to see, however, far below what it might have been.
