I haven't seen the original but just wanted to release a quick note to anyone who happens to roll down this far: Wicker Man is the worst movie I've seen this year. Maybe even in two years. I wish I could ask the theater for my money back or return time to warn me not to see it. I will give it two positive nodes: The sarcasm of Cage's character has at least some laughs from me and the island's scenery was beautiful. Sorry, that's it. Here comes the celebration. The movie's plot is only propelled forward because other characters do not give Cage any straight answer - and he puts up with this !!! How this could continue for over an hour of my time (far fewer days in the movie) is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Not to mention that the plot is filled with holes. You leave the theater with enough unanswered questions to fill a library. How anyone could read this script and think, "Yes, people have to pay $ 11 to see this shady outline of what a movie should look like" is beyond me. Don't see this flick. Or even rent it on DVD.
