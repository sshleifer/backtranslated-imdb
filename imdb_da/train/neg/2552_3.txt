This is listed as a documentary, it is not, it is filmed kind of like a documentary, but I suppose it was just because then they come away with a shaking camera and risky film formation. This has just been released in the UK on DVD as an "American Pie style comedy". Nor is it. <br /> <br /> Basically, a group of teenagers are following spring break as they go to Mexico for cheap spraying and with the endeavor is to come there for a friend finally laid. Throw is a couple of dwarfs, also on the same kind of quest, and you have a non-hilarious tale of drunk teens trying to get some girls. Considering the 18 Rating, this has very little nudity and almost zero six scenes, mostly I assume that the rating is for difficulty where there are plenty. <br /> <br /> If you like raw Jackass's behavior without humor then it may be your thing if you have any brain cells left then I would probably avoid this!
