I just watched this movie 15 minutes ago and I still have no idea what I was doing. Essentially, I think it's a movie about an internet S & M "star" of cd rom that is just as realistic as flash comics online. She is murdered by someone who causes her sister and a team of 2 FBI agents to investigate death. The local murder division in Big City, USA, is also investigating, although most of his work is going to observe the CD-ROMs he claims are as realistic "as the real thing". I know. Wow. Michael Madsen is the only one in the movie who has any kind of credit behind him. He is in the movie for approx. 15 minutes, and half of it is he who beats the maid for apparently no apparent reason. I don't even want to explain the end, because frankly I can't do it myself. But before the final scene we are treated to a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the film. In fact, they could have run it then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with cross-eyed direction and everything. All in all, stay away from this movie. I got it because I love bad movies and I love Michael Madsen. I could really have spent it 80 minutes on something else and have been more satisfied. Like playing the game with a knife where you jab on hand repeatedly. That for 80 minutes would be much more entertaining.
