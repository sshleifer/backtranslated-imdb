This movie offers nothing but the stupid conversations possible. In fact, I probably could not have imagined how pointless a movie how synthetic dialogues could be an hour ago, but then again I saw this video. In a movie that does not rely on a powerful script, one expects to see at least good plays and tasty conversations and even some humor perhaps, but this movie lacks them all. You have heard me it is missing them all. There is not a single point I like about this movie, none. I hate it. I'm sure someone will do that too. The name is intended to give the audience some thoughts on nudity and things, but it even fails on nudity. I don't know how, but I did see this thing in an hour or so, and I definitely recommend that you do not. worst movie I've seen in my life. If anyone allows you to see it, see when you want to
