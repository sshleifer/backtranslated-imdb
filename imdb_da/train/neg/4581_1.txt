Pathetic attempt to use science to justify the news religion / philosophy. The two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about Quantum Physics in this mess is just wrong. Examples? Quantum theory supports the ideas of Eastern religions that reality is an illusion. How? Well in the world of the subatomic, you can never predict a particle placement at any given time. You can only give the odds for it exactly in one place at a time. The observation also works to influence the event. Solid particles can pass through barriers. All this so far is accurate. But then they claim it means that if you sincerely believed you could go through a wall, you could actually do it. This is complete poppycock. Instead, the theory claims that on our level it is possible for you to go through a wall, but it is only by chance and has nothing to do with faith. You also have to go into the wall of eternity to always have the slightest chance of passing through the wall, the odds are so astronomical against it. <br /> <br /> This is just an example of how the misleading science. But much more annoying is the story with an unhappy photographer played by Marlee Maitlan. About halfway through the picture it becomes so confused that it is incomprehensible. Something to do with negative thoughts that lead to addiction and self-hatred. There may be a truth to it, but quantum physics has nothing to do with it. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, string theory is the hot new thing in physics today. Instead of wasting your time with this drunk, I suggest renting The Elegant Universe, a great series made for NOVA at PBS, giving you a story of Newton's physics and the gravity of Ed Witten and M Theory in just 3 hours. episodes. Quantum mechanics is explained quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical grants.
