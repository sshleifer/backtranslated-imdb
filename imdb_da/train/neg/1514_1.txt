I just watched this movie yesterday. <br /> <br /> My boyfriend wanted to see it only because of Richard Gere. <br /> <br /> I feel I wasted my time and money and told my boyfriend it's the last time we go to watch a movie just because a particular actress / actress is in it. I hope she learned the lesson because I had a hard time keeping her in her seat. When I had already paid, I would at least see the end, just in hope something good would come up, but I did not hold my breath and luckily, because I would have been the victim of the movie the same. <br /> <br /> This is not a black and white movie, it is a black and black. The protagonist (Richard Gere) is almost as bad as his registrants, and all the sexual offenders are portrayed as indictable hard criminals and the bad ones among them were really very bad. Talk about a clich√© and the exploitation of a typical American phobia. <br /> <br /> Richard Geres play was good as usual, but the blonde girl who was supposed to replace him was at best wishy. Absolutely unconvincing for the job. <br /> <br /> The movie is trying to take advantage of a popular theme and gives it a cheap, dramatic and sensational trip that is just unreal. They just use sex offenders as an excuse to indulge in cheap violent acts of murder, vigilante battles, rape and torture - something that seems almost free. They even have a wolf that attacks people in the movie - how low can you get. <br /> <br /> I collect the movie will not come out in the United States and want to go directly to the DVD. That was where it should have been in other countries too, but because it was Hollywood and Richard Gere, they just had to show it. Believe me, without Gere, the movie is not even worth a B-series movie.
