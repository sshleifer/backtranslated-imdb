I have long heard that to get their start in 'legitimate' movies, many bag-the-camera types work on porn movies. <br /> <br /> The people who produced and directed this monstrousness became too long. /> Poorly paced, staged and written, it uses very good talent (Diehl, Dorn, Eggert) badly. <br /> <br /> Much sexual activity is gloriously implied by brass jumping host to the alien creature, but it never crosses the line ... <br /> <br /> You still want to shower afterwards.
