The summary summarizes everything up. This is not nearly as good as the original. With a script written by both Stallone and James Cameron (at the same time he also wrote Aliens). Most of the actions were written by Cameron, and the political aspects were written by Stallone. <br /> <br /> Sly was physically in the best condition when he did this and Rocky 4, and he looks good or dressed up for the eye spheres on steroids, depending on your own point of view or opinion. <br /> <br /> Rambo starts in prison and is visited by Colonel Trautman who asks him to go on a special mission that could serve him as a presidential excuse. He eventually joins and goes out to the letter lion, run by Charles Napier, playing a Washington dress that tries to transfer as former ex-forces to place Rambo. The mission is to find out if there are any missing POWs still alive in camps in Vietnam. Rambo was chosen as the camp he controlled was a place where he had previously been a prisoner. He is told that it is not a rescue mission, and he is there to only take photographs. <br /> <br /> After a bad attempt to parachute from a plane, he loses most of his kit, meets his contact (which turns out to be a sweet woman) and travels down the river with pirates to the camp. <br /> <br /> He still finds prisoners and rescues one. As the 3 fly from half of the Vietnamese army on their riverboat, they are betrayed by the pirates, but Rambo kills them all, and they are forced to continue to the pickup point on foot after their boat is rammed and blown up. Rambo almost on board. <br /> <br /> Rambo is betrayed again and abandoned as Napier arranges the revocation of the rescue helicopter. It is clear when Trautman returns to the base to tell him that no survivors were expected to be found. <br /> <br /> Steven Berkoff appears as a Russian Spetznatz Colonel, and Rambo is tortured and eventually escapes only to be persecuted by several Vietnamese troops and Spetznatz. Rambo finally kills a helicopter and rescues most prisoners back to his base. <br /> <br /> He resists the urge to kill Napier to abandon him, but destroys the Ops Center. <br /> <br /> A weak plot and very weak end when Rambo goes into the sunset as a free man.
