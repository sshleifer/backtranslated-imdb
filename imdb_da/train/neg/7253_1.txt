We rented the DVD hoping for a good western. The movie was beautiful and the scenes were reasonable, but the ideas were very poor. Here are my problems with the movie. <br /> <br /> In the first part, why did the bad owner exactly kill? Not really associated with the movie except to determine how bad he was and to have a hide. The bank's employee has gone bad, seems too poor to convincingly decide to hire murderers for his employers. At least keep us guessing. No sign developed at all for the bank's owners or the bank's employee. <br /> <br /> Very long delay in much of something happening. <br /> <br /> Absurd assumption that Martin still needed to see the referee after the tie acknowledged to kill the in-laws. Even more absurd, as he confesses to judge and judge, will not listen to the sheriff's guy. Even more ridiculous that Martin breaks his rope and rope, then the sheriff takes him on guard and eventually returns to his city and saves his wife from the bad banker. Wouldn't he return after the fast shipping of the band to save his wife and arrest the poor banker? Just send the judge a note that the band recognized before he was killed on the trail ???? !!! All in all, very sad to act and no point on film.
