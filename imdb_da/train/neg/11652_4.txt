The script for "Scary Movie 2" was just not ready to go. This is a problem with the film, which is obviously obvious to both the actors and the audience. Director Keenan Ivory Wayans and many actors are funny people; And then the movie is not completely humorous. For their credit, the movie has several fun moments. But as a whole, "Scary Movie 2" is not even close to being as smart and entertaining as the original. The first "Scary Movie" was a funny movie. It became the smallest feature of the slasher movie genre for comic gold. The mood of "Scary Movie 2" is as heavy as it is un-original. They even miss obvious opportunities for parody. Two of the movie stars have previously been cast members of the "Beverly Hills 90210" and this was a show asking for parody! In the end, "Scary Movie 2" is like a fine bottle of wine that was opened too quickly. Scripture needed much more time for age. 2 stars out of 5.
