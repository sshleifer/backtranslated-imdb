Contrary to my principles, I must first make a conclusion, because I have just seen this art form, and I am still under strong impression. The reader is asked to apologize for my stronger vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Now, this movie is horrible, and I would never bother to write a single word about it if it wasn't for the fact that "44 minutes" made me sick to death, which rarely happens for me. The fact that I paid for it doesn't make me any better and the fact that the movie deserved the high user rating here. <br /> <br /> So what's wrong with the movie? It has a fashionable title - "44 minutes". The first thinks of "15 minutes", which by the way is a much better movie, but still bad in my book, and actually the two can be compared to some extent. But as luck would have it, the things they share are their worst features. They both have Mr. Oleg Taktarov, with his strong Russian accent, obviously experiences the popular expectations and prejudices. His purpose is to appeal to the cold war mind. Oh, we miss the good old times. Now, I do not indicate that he is a bad actor, I am not yet convicted of his true performance, but he is simply not a true individual here, he is more like an archetype. How anyone can indulge in such things is completely out of my understanding. We can recognize modern American xenophobia here. The point in the movie when Taktarov explains his friendship that the Romans are not Germans and that they are in America is really ridiculous. Do we suppose that the oldest duo's greatest desire is to become "true" Americans? <br /> <br /> There is the media problem. Yes, it seems that most of what we learn comes from cameras, interviews and journalists. The director should make us feel the rhythm of the supposed 44 minutes. Instead, he drills us with interviews throughout the movie as well as in a cheap TV show trying to reinvent the wheel. For 15 minutes, the issue of media is central. The point is presented in a way that a teacher addresses a blunt student, but it deserves a separate comment, we focus on 44 minutes now. So I have tried to identify the purpose of this movie. What is it? Giving good time to the audience? To glorify weapons? To glorify the police? Spreading violence? Oh yes, the officer gives the Bible to the underground criminal. So it must preferably promote peace and understanding? I don't think so, but don't ask me. I only know that I didn't like any of this. <br /> <br /> Ah, Michael Madsen. I admit I'm a big fan. I hoped he would be a bright point, but I was wrong. However, it's not his fault. <br /> <br /> As a final note, the comparison of "firepower" to "willpower" at the end of the movie was one of the worst lines I've ever heard. <br /> <br /> To summarize the scale 1-10, I give it a clean, unadulterated 1.
