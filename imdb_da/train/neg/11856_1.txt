I just watched this movie tonight in the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival, and it makes me wonder if the people at the festival actually cut the movies before they are chosen. The movie was simply horrible - I say without hyperbole or ulterior motives - it was terrible. Matthew Modine's days as a senior man are far away. Gina Gershon sported an inexplicable and unnecessary English accent - she was ashamed of her participation in this movie. Gloria Reuben had a strange little cameo in it - she was also ashamed. Scripture was horrible and we had absolutely no reason to worry about the signs. I doubt very much that this will be picked up, but then again people in Hollywood are known to make mistakes sometimes. I really think "Kettle of Fish" is a serious competitor for the worst movie I've ever seen.
