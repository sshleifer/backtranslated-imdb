Who in their real mind does something as stupid as this movie? Unfortunate killing of a security guard ... characters that are so two-dimensional that a two-year-old could have painted them ... and better ... <br /> <br /> A red toolbox of death? Please .... <br /> <br /> Hypothermic weak thugs ... <br /> <br /> Works from hell ... Stylistically this movie shifts between teenage comedy, thriller, voyeurism and ... female. .. (uhm) Rambo? <br /> <br /> Amazing and it's an insult to any thinking person. Don't look, go away, it's more terrible than you might imagine ... <br /> <br /> And on top of that, it's trying to be hip by being too graphic in it's violence ... <br /> <Mrs. Montford: Shoot 'Em Up was fun and fun, it's just pathetic and horrible. Good luck next time. :-(
