You ever get the itch to just kill an hour or two to make duties and watch a movie so bad that it speaks the reason? Well, renting movies for a weekend I see boxing art for this and see T-Rex. Knowing that the dinosaur on the package was T-Rex from Jurassic Park, I knew I should rent this because I was in the mood for a bad movie. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with the least. Food scientists, secret formulas, a company more concerned about its wealth and shareholders than life, and of course, a large, poorly animated, sock-t-shirt T-Rex. Is this ours through the movie, were there scenes spliced ​​clearly from other movies? Not to mention Rex's hungry is never satisfied ... ever. How he has hunger is over me because he doesn't actually have a throat (Really if you look down the mouth when he roars, it's solid ... like a toy or something). Now I like to watch incredibly bad B-movies from time to time because it reminds me of how much better a blockbuster movie is. This one was fun. I'm not even sure if this was a thriller or a comedy because there are scenes where you won't make mistakes, you will laugh. <br /> <br /> I owe the film's budget ... yes, but the actor didn't help either. OK, Tony Todd was actually pretty good, as for some of the female roles ... when you cry, don't "tears" come out? Meh, I'm not going to be crazy about this movie, I knew what I was coming in and if you're looking for a bad movie to see with friends, here's what I recommend: Watch this movie, see Immediately Jurassic Park and so the world lost back to back. You will write Mr. Spielberg thank the letters the next day.
