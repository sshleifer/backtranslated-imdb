Historically accurate? Hmm ... Maybe ... if you fall over and light falls right on the subject. But the accuracy of the core is no compensation for a gloomy, rude and inconsistent plot, reams of cardboard dialogue, and an unsatisfactory conclusion. The protagonists are merely characterizations; embarrassing stereotypes that range from the "enigmatic and noble" American Indians to the "heavy but sadistic" British officers. A miserable and unworthy reproduction of a fascinating period in American history. I want my money back.
