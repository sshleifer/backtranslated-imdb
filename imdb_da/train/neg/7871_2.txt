In 1993, "visitors" was a huge hit in France. So the sequence was inevitable, and this order is unfortunately among the worst ever made. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that does not keep its promises. In fact, it should tell a single story. Jean Reno will be in the twentieth century and take Christian Clavier back in the Middle Ages so that time can normally follow his course. The problem is that Clavier feels completely calm in the twentieth century world, and so get him back in the Middle Ages, is pretty tough ... Instead of this, the film goes on several other stories without succeeding in following the main reason. As a result, the film sometimes becomes confusing, sometimes a bit messy. <br /> <br /> But the film also suffers from the performance of almost all actors. Reno and Clavier fall into the trap they could avoid in the first movie: they go over the top and get annoying. Why did filmmaker Jean-Marie Poiré get involved in Muriel Robin in the female lead? He made a mistake because she seems uncomfortable and is absolutely pitiful. The other actors are no better: Marie-Anne Chazel is non-existent and Christian Bujeau, unbearable. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie contains a few good moments with effective gags, but it often falls into vulgarity and ease. Certain sequences and dialogues are affected. It also seems that Poiré takes back elements that secured the success of the first movie. Thus, a young girl takes Reno to a close relative of her family and asks him to attend her wedding. <br /> <br /> A cumbersome and disappointing follow-up. Anyway, what is the interest of this movie otherwise commercially? <br /> <br />
