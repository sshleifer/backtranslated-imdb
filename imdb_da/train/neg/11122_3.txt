I would say so much - This director is about RAW images ... things most of us are not ready to confront. Pictures of sex, suicide, murder and people "relieve themselves" are constantly blocking the viewer, which makes me wonder if the director was trying to convey the concept of relief or release. Although I don't think I could ever see this movie again, I would say that the director has a good eye. There were some really nice shots and "footage" in the movie (the fans, the wire fish in their hair), but the story left me needing more (strictly since we were left asking ourselves "what dunk did we just see?"). <br /> <br /> Note: If you tend to gag or vomit easily ... you can't watch this movie.
