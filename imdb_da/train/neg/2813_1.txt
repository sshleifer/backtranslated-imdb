Normally, I would never rent a movie like this because you know it will be bad just by looking at the box. I rented seven movies at the same time, including nightmares on Elm Street 5, 6 and Wes Craven's new nightmare. Unfortunately, when I got home, I found out that the videostore guy gave me the wrong tape. In the box of Wes Craven's new nightmare, I found this lame film. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly boring, the play is bad and the plot makes no sense. It's hard to write a good review because I have no idea what the movie was about. At the end of the movie you have more questions, then you answer. <br /> <br /> At 'Max Power's Scale of 1 to 10' I rate this movie: 1 <br /> <br /> PS I would like Correct's review correctly (just below mine). He says Robert Englund rips off lingerie, rides horses naked, etc. The guy who did these things was Mahmoud, played by Juliano Mer, not by Robert Englund.
