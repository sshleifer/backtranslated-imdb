Gadar is a really silly movie because it tells a false story. It is too unrealistic and is a typical sunny movie that aims to bash Pakistan. The film aims to mislead the viewers so that they can believe that Pakistan and its government are bad, but trying to hide their own mistakes will not work. And all the songs and music in the movie are all bad. Most likely, the Sikhs will love the movie because they are misunderstood. The movie sucks and sucks with power. I think only Amisha Patel was good in the movie. If I can give 0 out of 10, I would, but the lowest is 1.Please save 3 hours in your life and not see this silly boring movie .Disaster.
