John Candy. Should we say more? He's the main reason to watch this movie. Most people do not realize how gifted he was as an actor. Witness him that he is switching from poor veil to horny shakes. Just a simple (subtle) change of face and off we go. There are many good pieces in this movie and many really stupid bits. The best moments for me are the KUNG FU U scenes as well as the great moment when John (in trance) walks up the stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend - that's how much he and his genitals love his girlfriend. I'm sure to read this, you might think this sequence sounds really raw. It is, but it is also very fun, mainly because it is John Candy who does this. The story is generally quite boring, and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty (both SCTV alumni with Candy) can't do enough in the movie. Levy has his moments, especially the movie wedding at the end (think Rod Serling) and the big scene when talking to his mother on the phone. All in all, a good movie if you have had a hard day and need to put your brain on the stupid. I give this 4 out of 10.
