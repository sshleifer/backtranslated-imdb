This movie has successfully shown what we all already know that professional basketball players are sucking on everything besides playing basketball. Especially rapping and acting. I can't even begin to describe how bad this movie really is. First of all, it's just me, or is it the ugliest child you've ever seen? I mean, his teeth could be used as a canoeist. Second, why does a genius want to pursue a career in the music industry, even though he has magical powers, sucks terribly by making music? Third, I have read the Bible. In no way did it shape or shape that Jesus did geniuses. Fourth, what was the deal with all the crappy special effects? I assure you that any acne-addled nerdy teen with a computer could produce better effects than that. Fifth, why did the ending hit that bad? And what the hell is a djin? And finally, the one who created the nightmare known as Kazaam must be thrown out of an airplane and on the Eiffel Tower, because this film puts the word "suck" to a whole new level.
