I was so disappointed with this show. After hearing and reading the whole hoopla about how it was a "groundbreaking show" and all kinds of wild promises of quality, I tried to see it. <br /> <br /> Which letdown !! The action was forced and exaggerated. The story made very little sense. As for a hint of the sharp "look at teen's life" I could only see a monstrous attempt that had so much reality for it as a reality show. Some wonder why there are so many negative comments about this show. The reason is that it's really not all that is good and beats the drums over quality on this show, only serves to attract the attention of how bad it is.
