Here is another Diane Lane movie where she cheats on her husband. Is it the only role she knows how to play? This time, it was set in 1969 and she cheats on her husband with the blouse. So I'm not surprised because it's so much predictable. Then her husband gets sour and throws the milk. I wouldn't be surprised if she also slept with the milkman. I would not be surprised if she also slept with the ice cream maker because it is a very boring movie. Then she says, after a bit of milk, he is sad and sees the blouse again. You h. So when she does that with him, her son gets stung by wasps. My mother always told me not to throw stones at a wasps. This young mother didn't have time to tell him she was too busy with the blouse man.
