An unanswered call, another Asian horror based on the mobile phone. I recently rented a Korean horror movie based on a mobile phone called "Pon". A missed call was just as boring as that. Perhaps phones are just not scary or anything, but this step was boring and boring. No excitement or excitement for me, and the final monster was disappointingly cheesy and unscary. The film drew quite a bit in different parts and felt too long. Don't keep my attention. It seems that the phones are hard to make scary, it's like trying to make a pop turn oddly scary. And it is ridiculous to compare this with "The Ring", it seems that all Asian horror films are compared to it and so far I have not seen anything measured at least. For horror directors - take the phone off the hook as a horror device.
