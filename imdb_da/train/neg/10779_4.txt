I found this movie to be a totally dissapointment. The talent available to the director - especially Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria, and Alan Arkin (without mentioning the four chiefs) - has been completely wasted on a creepy, mediocre story whose conclusion one could not really care for. once introduced to the gloomy, stereotypical characters. Julia Roberts is weak, Zeta-Jones is simply annoying (seems to reproduce her role from high fidelity, minus humor). Crystal just plays his same old hyperactive, neurotic, annoying alter-ego, and Cusack simply goes through his part, apparently upset by the whole project. <br /> <br /> For what should be a 'romantic comedy', there is absolutely no romance between the key characters, let alone chemistry, and in the case of the SPOILERS comedy, the only moments of mild humor came behind Cusack's role in Grosse Pointe and his relationship with the Alan Arkin scriptwriter, who, of course, could not show any originality at all. (Spoilers) Azaria was reasonably entertaining as the Mexican lover and Walken made an entertaining trip as a parody of an arthouse-maverick dogma-type director - but these parts were very little screen time and instead (Spoilers) we were treated with Billy Crystal have his groin sniffed by a dog. Pure genius. <br /> <br /> For a big fan of the majority of John Cusack's work, not to mention the rest of the amazing cast, I was totally worn by a movie with lots of good ideas and at the same time totally unwilling to explore or elaborate on any of them, rather than resort to the same ancient genre clich√©s and even lower themselves to the depths of almost humorous, teens humor at times. <br /> <br /> A very bad 4/10.
