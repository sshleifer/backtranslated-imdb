I didn't want to comment, but then I realized I had something to say. I saw this movie two days ago, and although I don't think it's a waste of time (it might have been money for the producers), it's obvious that it has serious problems. It has really good movies and (little but) good music. Very much is said about Ana Cristina Oliveira, but let's be honest about what? She is not really an actress and she is constantly balancing between overpowering and confusing subordinates. Her performance passes well because there has never been anyone like Odete in any other movie: crazy? sad? childish? an imposter? no one knows, comrades. So it is just that they dictate the rules here. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was also a good example of the problem most Portuguese movies suffer from: soundtrack. There is a permanent NO to copy and the result is this usual mass of noise coming out of the blue. People in other countries may think that Portugal is the noisy of places. However, I was excited that some of the dialogue was called, but it did not necessarily solve the syndrome. Bad dubbing too, I have to say. It's strange to see a movie where the first thing that hits me on the first scene when the first character speaks is: it's been baptized. And all this to say that the movie has technical issues. <br /> <br /> It also has scripting issues. It tries to be classic from the first to the last scene. There was a desperate fear of letting things be suspended and it shows. Of course, the author tried to get everything right and he does, but ... it shows !! All dialogues are too exponitive and there is not a single piece of talk that sounds like a line from a movie. It's all a bit raw and a little unpleasant. <br /> <br /> Not that the movie is a total mess I have to stress. I just think the good parts are so obvious that I prefer to concentrate on the bad. <br /> <br /> Direction brings a little to the weak manuscript. All shots are classic and un-innovative, but their beautiful. Good work from Rui Po√ßas, by the way. <br /> <br /> Now, what I think was the problem, the one who keeps people from believing in this story and laughing the whole movie rather than taking it seriously: The guy playing the guy who DIES is obviously not an actor. In fact, it's a pretty important role, and I can't see why non-actors are thrown into such parts. This guy is neither an actor nor a handsome man. Which means the whole movie rolls down the mountain as we never believe in a second that this beautiful woman is obsessed with him even though he's gone and that his hunky lover who survives actually has a bad time getting over the loss when all we see of this character is apathy. Too bad. The world is filled with beautiful people who even happen to be cozy seductive lovers. The world is full of good actors who are also cute boys and capable of causing obsession with people after they are gone. The world is filled with great movies and also not the big movies. That's life!
