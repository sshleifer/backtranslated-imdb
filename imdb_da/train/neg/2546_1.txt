This movie is an idiotic attempt at some kind of action thriller. A turbine on its way to Las Vegas is attacked by a group of white trash bins running dune buggies. They drive them into the desert and then steal all their valuables. The reason is constantly changing. One minute they seek to kidnap a rich rancher's daughter, the next they seek a $ 90,000 collective stamp. The dialogue is terrible. <br /> <br /> Please don't watch this movie.
