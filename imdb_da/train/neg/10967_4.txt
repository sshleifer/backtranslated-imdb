Believe me, I like horror movies. I like science fiction movies. I like independent movies. And I like low budget, B movies. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I even like bad acting, plodding scripts, tree lines, unlikely situations and the like. However, I didn't like Christmas on Mars. <br /> <br /> It just doesn't work on so many levels. For all the reasons mentioned earlier and many more. It includes the incomparable, incredible use of images of female genitals. And the many mergers for male genitalia, in a very freudian way. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that this is purely from ineptitude. Unlike some attempts to do something really different. I think any movie that takes years to film just can't keep up with the level of congress and the focus required by modern audiences. <br /> <br /> I was hoping the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination of the protagonist. But it was unfortunately meant that it had happened when we saw things unfold on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only kindness I can express is that the picture at the end was terrible. If this had been used initially, instead of at the end, it could have caused the movie to start, where 2001 ended ... <br /> <br /> Too bad they didn't try it instead. I just don't understand what was so important to this movie that it even had to be made. Was it plotted? It couldn't be. Were the signs? I doubt it; I mean, I could live without knowing about Ed 15. Was that the dialogue? Emphatically no. The music? Perhaps, but more likely, the untrue ego of the protagonists needs to be stroked. <br /> <br /> Much better effort is dead on the floor.
