This is a typical 70-inch soft core wife of the Russ Meyer genre, but perhaps less scary than some of Meyer's work. This movie has higher "production values" than many of its contemporaries, suggesting a larger budget. It's plot, writing and acting is straight out in the B zone. Too late, this movie has become a founder of B movie channels (such as "Drive In Classics") in the 500 channel universe. If soft core is what you are in the mood for, this is as "good" as anything else in the B area. Don't expect Polanski, but Sarno is just Sarno. Nothing more, nothing less. Jennifer Welle's performance as "the mother" is perhaps the best of the cast. None of the actors in the film went on to greater fame, surprisingly. Confessions of a Young American Housewife is by far the worst example of that kind. It can be seen if it is your type of movie. 30 years ago, this would have been an avant-garde and risk movie. You can see more or less the same kind of stuff on the Showtime / HBO series these days and in prime time.
