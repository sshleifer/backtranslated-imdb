Original Claymation Rudolph: Pretty good. Original Frosty Cartoon: Need some work, but can be worse. But Frosty and Rudolph together on the fourth of July? C'mon! Give me a BREAK !!! This was a movie that should not have been made. That was bad. It didn't really go to any holiday in particular, except on July 4th. This made it particularly bad, since Frosty and Rudolph are usually associated with Christmas time. And any movie can be destroyed by too much song. The frequent songs made this movie seem much longer than it really was. The movie tried to mix two well-known Chirstmastime characters with an American traditional holiday (which almost seems to "restrict it" to America), for many pointless songs and a miserable plotline. The result? A bad movie that can't really be seen at any time of the year. I would suggest that you renounce this movie even if you like Frosty and Rudolph.
