Although it's not as bad as it has been done (I've seen much worse), it's still a very boring movie. Basically a rehash of Siegel's "Coogan's Bluff", with the biggest difference that Clint Eastwood's hat has more charisma than all of Joe Don Baker, an unpleasant actor, if there was one. <br /> <br /> But Venantino Venantini is great (and fun) as the bad guy, kind of budget Vittorio Gassman. He is the main reason for sitting through this steampile, as the rest of the cast mostly delivers horrible plays, especially the girl. Bad old Rossano Brazzi, hard to believe he was once a romantic management (see "Mondo Cane" to watch him run away from women). Looks like another tier Ben Gazzara, he gets almost nothing to do. It's all Joe Don's show, unfortunately. And it all scored for generic 80's "action movie" music that couldn't be more boring. Greydon Clark can make good B-movies ("without warning") but here he travels to fall, breaks his nose and loses three teeth. Well, the Malta sites were at least nice and there is Venantini trying to save the day. 10.3.
