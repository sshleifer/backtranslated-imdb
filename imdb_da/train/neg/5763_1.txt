<br /> <br /> "Go aside for Hollywood veterans?" (The way the brothers were "asked") that was what hollyweird demanded and that was what it got. But such a lot of recent decisions made this a unique mistake. The director is so out of touch with today's audience, trying to bring back physical pratfalls and gags instead of a fun dialogue just a disaster. I knew it, the audience knew it and CAST knew it. <br /> <br /> What a shame why were they NEVER considering changing directors? Not only that, but the two Wayan brothers played as two of four main characters, without them being just a farce and a sad one. <br /> <br /> SP <br /> <br />
