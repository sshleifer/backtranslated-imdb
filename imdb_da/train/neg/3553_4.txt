"The Incubus" is a mix of the good (an interesting murder mystery), the bad (a disconnected script, a sloppy resolution, badly made attack scenes) and the weird (strong incestuous overtones, a strange sleepy and stiff performance of John Cassavetes - was the sign really supposed to be so "wacko"?). Not nearly as offensive as it is known to be, but not particularly successful, either. (* 1/2)
