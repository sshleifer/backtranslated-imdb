One of Boris Karloff's true clinkers. Essentially, the dying karloff (looking around 120 years older than he was) is a scientist who needs cash to finish his experiments before he dies. Moving from Morocco, where his funding is taken over by another, he goes to the South of France, where he works a doctor while trying to scrap enough money to prove his theories. Desperate for money, he makes an appointment with the young rich wife of a cotton baron who dies. She will fund him if he helps her poisonous husband so she can take her money and continue with a gigolo (which I think is married). If you think I got it from watching the movie you're wrong, I had to read which other people were posted to find out. Why? because this movie had lost me from two minutes in. I had no idea what was going on with its many characters and several converging plot lines. Little is spelled out, and much is not said at the end of the time when I really don't care. It is a boring mess of interest solely for Karloff's performance, which is quite strange at times. To be honest, it's the only time I've ever seen him venture into Bela Lugosi's bizarre area. It's not all scenes, but a few and makes me think about how much they hung out.
