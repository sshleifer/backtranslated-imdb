I think you should give some points for the pure courage to write a musical story around a story lesson, but what about a decent music? <br /> <br /> Are cartoon-like plays by Howard DeSilva meant to pique the interest of otherwise jaded children? <br /> <br /> Is William Daniels' campy modern (currently) acting style designed to appeal to a 1960s / 70s demographic? <br /> <br /> Do we need any "in-joke" about NY & NJ? (I can hear the blue-haired Broadway audience guffawing on cue.) <br /> <br /> Sorry, I find the whole piece dated, boring and the actor is too hard for the screen
