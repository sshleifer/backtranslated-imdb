Hilarious, laughing loudly high moments ... and yet not a comedy. I especially liked the planted gag in the ambulance, which blew the "dirty bum", which then shouts at them in anger "you rubbish bum", I mean wow, the other's online degree in literature pays off! The worst script that can be imagined, with plot entries in an instant, ridiculous movement in the story, ZERO character development (even between the characters that meet. It's like they all have known and trusted each other for years) risky voice over with added echo effects and plot holes .. oh god there are plot holes !! To be honest I do not even write this to have seen it all, but I certainly expect the last 30 minutes or so to not improve the already pathetic attempt at the cinema ... thank God we have a good look, leads to something to do we forget the movie is a load ... well ... use your imagination to the conclusion of that sentence!
