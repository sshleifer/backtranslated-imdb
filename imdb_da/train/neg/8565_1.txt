Pardon. Someone has to say it. This really is / was a boring movie. Worthy maybe, but bad anyway. I almost cried with boredom when I see it. The play is rather skewed, the story is drawn out and predictable, the score and the camera work are completely standard and unexciting. It's one of the movies you're not allowed to hate (because it's about disabled people) but hates what I suppose almost everyone does. Interestingly, critics have been so kind to this movie. I suppose they must not be objective either. This was made to win awards - which I remember duly did. But it wasn't interesting or entertaining either. I haven't seen the game so it can't be compared.
