What has Ireland ever done to film distributors that they are trying to represent the country in such a pejorative way? This film begins as a primer for film students in Irish film cliches: unlucky pastors, saliva before handshake, square cattle March, cycling rural meadows for background of anodyne folk. However, it soon becomes that the film's main theme is the great Daddy-O of Irish Cliches - religious disputes. It is a Protestant woman who wants to determine where her Catholic-born child is educated, which seems like a reasonable enough desire, though not to the 50's County Wexford villagers she is to live with. Instead of sending them to a Catholic school, she decides to travel to Belfast and then to Scotland, where several clich√©s are regurgitated. While she is there, her father (who looks honest like George Lucas) and the family from home are exposed to a boycott that becomes very unpleasant. I'm not going to give up at the end, not because I think people should watch this movie, but because it's not very interesting. One of the problems with the film is the central character: we must sympathize with her, but instead end up encouraging her to have a life. The citizens are presented as bigots whose prejudices must rise, but the traumatization of your children seems to be an inappropriate way to go. In addition, it takes burdens as it stretches immensely when trying to draw analogies with the ongoing peace process in Northern Ireland: the woman is told by her lawyer that she "must set conditions" for her return. The film is supposedly based on a true story, but its themes have been treated much more imaginatively, and with less use of hackneyed cliches in the past.
