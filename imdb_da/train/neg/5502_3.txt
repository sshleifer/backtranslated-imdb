Foolish, often ridiculous, traits involving the landing of a spaceship and the resulting destruction cause it to Tim (Jeff Daniels) and the people of his or her circles. <br /> <br /> Always amazed by Daniels. He showed such depth and promise in 1983's "Terms of Endearment" as Shirley MacLaine's sister-in-law's son-in-law. As the years have passed, Daniels has not been able to get hold of a good, carnal role. Instead, he is in inane comedies like "Dumb and Dumber." <br /> <br /> This picture fails because of the subject. At least the TV show led to a number of situations. In the film, we have constant slapstick and people become monsters, as the government is opposed to catching Martin Martin. <br /> <br /> The part of Mrs. Brown is a perfect example of the lack of success film. On television, Pamela Britton portrayed a ditsy person caught in situations with the martian who left her confused. In the movie version, a blond cotton shelf like Brown tries to try romantic intestines. <br /> <br /> TV star Ray Walston has a small role as government agent, or is he really? <br /> <br /> A very big disappointment to those who enjoyed the TV show so much.
