Okay, so the previews on this movie only tell you that a rebellious young girl joins her grandmother in the summer to stand out. In fact, this is not the case! It's about a young rebellious 17-year-old girl who reveals a secret, and it's up to her mother to believe whether or not she is telling the truth. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I really enjoyed the idea of ​​this movie. They had a really good reason and a really good theme for a love / hate relationship between mother and daughter. However, I did not enjoy watching Lindsay Lohan's play. In fact, this movie would have been great if they had another, perhaps a better actress. The character of Rachel (Lohan) is a very sexually aggressive person and it reminds us of the real Lindsay, so it takes a lot away from the movie. However, I think if you set aside Lindsay you will enjoy this movie. The finish is quite large (and sad).
