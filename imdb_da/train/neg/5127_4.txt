This movie had no big stars in it, but had a very good cast filled with excellent supportive actors AND Gene Tierney before she became a big star. With George Sanders, Reginald Gardner, Harry Carey, Bruce Cabot, Jospeh Calleia and Cederic Hardwicke, you'd expect more from the movie than it actually delivered. Most of this, I suppose, is due to a second-rate script that director Henry Hathaway was a competent and well-established man at the helm. The film is set in East Africa during World War II - just before the Americans entered the war. The British are trying to control their African colonies while subversive Nazi elements are trying to create problems between locals. One of the white men in the movie is a dual negotiator - working for the destruction of the British Empire! But the lovely Tierney who plays a sultan's daughter (!) Is out to help save the day for good England. <br /> <br /> American filmmakers have long-term empire and in the 1930s and 40s saw an abundance of pro-empire films. Today, with changed emotions, the notion of seeing the happy black natives who die for queen and country seems ridiculous - and that would be hard to mess with each side! At present, this propaganda piece was effective in druming up the British - even though the film is suffering today, it suffers from a prolonged script and stupid casting. One bright moment in the movie is the last showdown between George Sanders and the enemy agent. Too bad after such a powerful scene, the film just seemed to speak and speak - to lose some of its kind.
