I read in the papers that W.Snipes was blown, so no wonder he would take part in low budget projects like The Contractor.He is just the next action star to join a growing club: The effortless action stars from 90 ' erne (Van Damme, Segal, Lundgren, Snipes). Here he steals the lead in a cheap action girl shot in Bulgaria (we must believe that the location is London, which only a complete moron would buy it). The story is one of 1000 other movies: the pensioners good guy gets hired by the government again to do a wet job - after the government wants to get rid of him - good guy comes away after killing evil guys (was it a spoiler Don't guess! The star of the movie: The little girl (Eliza Bennett) surpasses everyone else in the cast! One star is for her plus a star for eye cake Lena Headey, makes 2 stars. Only to die hard Snipes fans! Everyone else: avoid!
