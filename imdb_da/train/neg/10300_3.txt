I'm a fan of arty movies, but unfortunately I have to report this movie to pretentious drift. Agonizing slowly developing a non-existent plot based on a promising premise is the experience, we must say, try. Even after bad movies, I feel that I am learning something or enjoying something, but there was nothing to appreciate. The principle was not uninteresting, but the movie starts and ends there. The action was OK, though the characters were quite boring. For the protagonist to aim for such a fierce goal, she is mightily empty. Pity. I usually enjoy movies that are informal, but lack of formula should not be confused with zero content.
