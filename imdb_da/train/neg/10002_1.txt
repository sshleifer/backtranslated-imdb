Excuse everyone ,,, I know this should be an "art" movie, but wow, they should have handed out weapons at the screen so people could blow their brains out and not see. Although stage design and photographic direction were excellent, this story is painful to see. The absence of a soundtrack was brutal. The loooonnnnng shots were too long. How long can you see two people just sitting there talking? Especially when the dialogue is two people complaining. I really had a hard time getting through this movie. The performances were excellent, but how much of the dark, deeper, uninspired things can you take? All I liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dance scene. Otherwise, this was a ripoff of Bergman. And I'm not a fan either. I think anyone who says they've had 1/2 hours of this is, well, lying.
