........ and an extremely bad one there !!! How long did this train wreck last? 14 episodes or something ?? I can see why now. <br /> <br /> I bought Amazon Unboxed's "Serenity" episode. It was my first purchase, so it was free. It's the only good thing about the experience (incident?) <br /> <br /> I don't really want to comment on the play, as there were some good people who didn't really get the job down just yet. In any case, I have never seen them before in any major show, theater or television. If I did, I have easily forgotten them. <br /> <br /> But the special effects were horrible. That's right, it's not exactly a multi-million $$ project, but the original Star Trek did it better than this and it was twenty-five years ago. I especially got a laugh out of the bad guys (breeders or something like that) as it chased the hilarious appearance of the Firefly, with smoke coming out of the engine, resembling something like a giant model rocket. I was fully expecting to see Wiley Coyote riding upstairs while I was chasing after Roadrunner. MODERN jet / rocket engines don't even make it so bad. <br /> <br /> And it wasn't even the worst. The wild-west type shoot-outs had me wondering if I actually looked at a sci-fi movie or a Gene Autry. <br /> <br /> Whatever hype, you won't waste your time ... I did ... every 80 minutes of the disaster called "Firefly".
