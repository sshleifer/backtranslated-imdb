I haven't seen anything so bad since I left the James Bond movie "Moonraker" twenty years ago. I managed to sit through this whole one only because of Tilda Swinton, but there was nothing she could do to save this animal. As a cross between "Pi", "Orlando" and "Tron", this film failed in all aspects of film making. The signs were cardboard and unable to evoke any kind of sympathy. The reason was absolutely incredible. The action was, with the exception of Swinton, an amateur. Computer graphics were worse than in "Tron". Timothy Leary was extremely annoying. I could go on, but what's the point. <br /> <br /> The only good thing I can say about this movie is that Tilda Swinton was in it. I have no idea why an actress from her caliber agreed to appear in such a dud, but at most she regrets that. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money or your time on this stink. There is nothing worth seeing here.
