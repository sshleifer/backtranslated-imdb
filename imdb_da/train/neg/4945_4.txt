Sure, one is not really a huge one, nor is it such a position. "Dieter" is the first name of a very popular German musician who is either loved or hated for his kind of acting and that is exactly what this film is about. It's based on the autobiography "Dieter Bohlen" wrote a few years ago, but it's not supposed to be exact on it. The movie is filled with some sexual offensive content (at least for the American standard), which is either fun (not for the other "actors" of course) or stupid - it depends on your individual kind of humor or whether you are a "Bohlen" - Damn or not. Technically, there is not much to criticize. Talking about me, I find this movie as an OK movie.
