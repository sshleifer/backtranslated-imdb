It is unlikely that anyone except those who love quiet movies will appreciate some of the lyrical camera work and recorded (but scratchy) background scores accompanying this 1933 release. Although the sound came into common use in 1928, there are no more than fifty words spoken of telling the story of a woman, unhappy married, telling her husband to a younger man after a romantic interlude in the forest. <br /> <br /> The most vividly photographed scene has the jealous man lifting the young man for a trip into town and continuing to drive normally until he realizes that the man is his wife's lover. In a madness of jealousy, he drives at the highest speed toward a railway crossing, but changes at the last minute and loses his nerve. It is probably the most thrilling scene in the otherwise decidedly slow and obviously preferred story. <br /> <br /> HEDY LAMARR gets the kind of close-up that is spoken by Marlene Dietrich by her discoverer, but her beauty had not yet been refined by the cosmetics as they were when she was transported to Hollywood. Her performance consists mainly of looking sad and morose, while taking care of the loss of her marriage with only a brief glimpse of a smile when she finds her true love (ARIBERT MOG), the beautiful young stud that picks up her clothes after a naked swim . <Br /> <br /> The swimming scene is very short, discreetly photographed, and not worth all the heat it apparently generated. The love-making scene, later, is also artfully photographed with the kind of lyrical photograph seen throughout most of the film - artificially it. There is more to the imagination with the help of symbolism - and these are the kinds of things others have proclaimed that the film is a kind of lyrical masterpiece. Not so. It is disappointing, primarily raw in its sound portions (including the strange symphonic music in the background) and certainly Miss Lamarr is fortunate that Louis B. Mayer saw the movie and based on it gave her a career in Hollywood. He must have seen something in his work that I did not do. <br /> <br /> It is obvious that this was perceived as a silent movie where the camera did all the work. The scary "worker" scene in the conclusion is going on for too long and is a huge intrusion where no one is needed. It fails to finish the movie on the correct note.
