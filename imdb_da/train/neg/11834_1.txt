Just put it in simple words, so even the film's makers can get a chance to understand: This is a very silly movie with a stupid script, lame animation and a story about as original as thumbtacks. Don't bother - unless you have to find a way to entertain a group of mentally impaired adults or extremely slow children. They can laugh, especially if they are out of their meds. There is a special kind of insult in a movie, it is ridiculous - not only the filmmakers seem to think that children are brainless idiots who can be entertained with folding boxes that cost around zero effort, but they do not even interfere with sweating inserting a gag here and there an adult can find entertaining. This film, frankly, crossed me generously. Shame on you to succumb so low.
