**** MINOR SPOILERS *** As a bad movie cooler I must have watched hundreds of bad movies and yet "Hobgoblins" are separate from everyone else in their own unique way. Classic baddies like "The Creeping Terror", "The Mighty Gorga" and "Manos" are uniformly bad from start to finish. "Hobgoblins", on the other hand, start badly and gradually get worse as it goes. During my first show of the infamous rake battle scene, I thought this was a really bad movie. I was blissfully unaware that I had just seen the best that this movie had to offer. The film takes its most massive nosedive in celluloid hell in the painfully inappropriate "Club Scum" sequence, which is a continuous strand of an unfunny joke after the other. With this particular movie, director Rick Sloane shows that he deserves to mention along with Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane as one of the worst directors all the time. How bad can a bad movie be? See "Hobgoblins" and no longer wonder.
