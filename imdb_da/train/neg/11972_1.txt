The first ten minutes of "Just Looking" really determine the direction most of this movie takes. Lenny (Ryan Merriman) is a 14 year old boy living in New York in the 50s. He has a burning desire to see two people having sex. Who are the best people he has in mind? Well, his own mother and grandfather of course! How comfortable. Unfortunately for Lenny, he is trapped before he sees anything and is sent off for the summer to stay with his uncle and his uncle's wife. <br /> <br /> Lenny's next level is to see his uncle and his wife have sex. However, the wife is quite pregnant and they are not currently sleeping together. Then Lenny makes a new friend. He and his companion spend most of their free time hanging around a couple of girls. They have a small club where everything they do is sit and talk about sex. The problem is ... it's not done in an innocent, charming 1950s way. I'm not bragging in any way, but I found it quite disturbing to listen to these kids talking about masturbation, blowjobs and anal sex. That kind of rage can work in a movie like "Kids" (1995), but in this movie it just seems perverted. Gretchen Mol is completely wasted here as Hedy, a formerly good model who becomes the object of Lenny's carnal wishes. Jason Alexander should be as far away from the manager's chair as possible. "For Better Or Worse" (1996) was terrible and now this. What a waste. 1.10
