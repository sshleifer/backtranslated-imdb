About 4 years ago I liked this movie. I would see it again and again. But now ... I don't. In fact, I think this movie would have been great for the Mystery Science Theater 3000. It has a lot of commentary heavy actors (Macaulay Culkin, Christopher Lloyd, Patrick Stewart, Whoopi Goldberg) and a beautiful cheesy plot. My favorite part is when Culkin is riding his bike and he comes across a gang and a gang member says, "Hey, Tyler! Where are you going?" The moon ?? "Also look at the classic line," Do you feel in your toes? "On the other hand, it is better than" The Good Son ".
