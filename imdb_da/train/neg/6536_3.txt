This DVD seems to be targeted to someone who just puts it on and plays it in an infinite loop in the background. It is organized as a series of music videos from the Grand Canyon set to various pieces of Tangerine Dream music. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the TD music is boring and the DVD transmission looks pretty blurry and weak. Too expensive a DVD for what it is.
