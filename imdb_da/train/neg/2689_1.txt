Now I'm not a film critic, but I really hated "September 11". This film was generally poor. With the exception of Alejandro González Iñárritu's segment, which was the most effective and directly on the subject, short films were at best boring and at worst offensive. The worst in my mind was Youssef Chahine's pretentious segment, comparing Palestinian suicide bombers to American soldiers, even going so far as to point to suicide bombers fighting for a bigger cause. The segment was completely out of the subject and given Chahine's apparent lack of any decency at all, wasting my time and patience. The idea of ​​getting eleven different directors from different countries to make a movie with their view of a tragedy was good on paper, but in practice it was tasteless.
