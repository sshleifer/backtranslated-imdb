Here's a review for people like me. This movie sucks from the beginning to the end. I threw popcorn on the screen and took me to entertain me a la MSF2000. The plot is based on random events and relies on the stupidity of people who were wise. The management falls for a king and it does not seem to her that she might be confused ????? And she's rich ???? And she is a famous psychologist ????? Come on, people. She goes into the bar at just the most appropriate moment when everyone is gathered to talk about conning her ??? It was so staged that it felt like slamming the face of even half witted movie viewers. The rain man would have been offended. I also admit that I despise the Mamet dialogue with the kind of passion some people have for meat meters, war starters and fur bearers. My hatred is so complete that it can withstand logic. But I give it a shot. That it should not sound right is fine. It doesn't matter. It is that everyone speaks the same thing. The Mamet cannot create characters; All he can do is feel his voice effortlessly through different actors. No wonder his actors are so wood. They are confused that everyone is uniform. (However, his later film improves.)
