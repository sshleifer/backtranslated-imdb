A really uncomfortable movie. While Rick Baker's special effects are quite impressive (if the abdominal cavity), it has no other redeeming properties. Like many films from the 70's, you leave yourself as if you have to take a long shower and scrub the mucus of yourself. The signs are uniformly unpleasant and the plot makes no sense.
