I was China in this movie. I choose the screen name Sheeba Alahani because I modeled at the time in Italy, and they couldn't correctly pronounce my real name, so I chose Sheeba and then added Alahani as it looked like Alohalani. <br /> <br /> I had never acted before (and it shows), but it was so much fun to film. They gave me "plays" every morning (which of course was not helpful). They called my voice (thank goodness). <br /> <br /> David and Peter were a blast on the set, full of good humor and jokes. This movie was never meant to be taken seriously, it was a treasure that was written off according to internal information. <br /> <br /> I give it a 1 because I have a sense of humor, but a 10 for the fun I had "acting" in it.
