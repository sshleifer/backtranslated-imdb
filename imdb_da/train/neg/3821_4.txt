What is the most harrowing movie ever made? The gynecological nightmare of 'Cries and Whispers'? Phase binding oxygen psycodrama? The unpleasant black comedy of 'Last House on the left? I am sure that the part of the film-cutting audience that ties their master to the good ship Buster Keaton, there is only one answer - one of his sound films. <br /> <br /> I don't know what fluttered my soul more poignantly in this movie - the foundation of Keaton's intricate and expansive physical art to mumble slapsticks; the masterful hesitation with this master filmmaker with dialogue - not that he does not have a nice comic voice or that he cannot make the dialogue fun; It's just that the studio doesn't seem to have given him enough, and then he seems to try to remember his lines before he delivers, which only makes him - Keaton, not his character, looks stupid; or is it the humiliation to see Keaton caught in a tawdry sex farce when he has given us some of the richest accounts of romantic frustration in movies? <br /> <br /> No, I know what was most disturbing - have to see Buster Keaton, the movie's greatest comedian, sit aside to observe Jimmy Durante to make his schtick. It's horrors like this that make you compose your Infernos. <br /> <br /> The MGM seems to have got the curious idea that the best way to adapt Keaton to the sound was to make him a Marx brother, complete with verbal pedantry, elaborate, boring "clowning", shambolic slapstick, theatrical attitude, triumph through chaos and Thelma Todd. Keaton just wasn't that kind of cartoon, and where Groucho's malicious heavy and joyful opportunism might just have done this plot work, Buster's socially uneven professor can't, he's too explored and predictable. <br /> <br /> What Buster needed was to be allowed to experiment like Lang in 'M' or Rene Clair; He would never have tried to hold back time like Chaplin. When a movie like 'The General' is used to fight with trains - the loss becomes even more apparent. <br /> <br /> And it's in the flat direction spots that the movie is not that bad - there's an excellent push when a camera on the bus leaves Keaton alone at a train station; and denouement, if hardly original, is at least livelier than what went before. There is something almost unique about how Keaton slows down a plot that needs all the zipper it can get. <br /> <br /> There's a movie here about loneliness, emotionally paralyzing order, the emotional effects of education, etc. struggling to get out. The best way to appreciate this movie is not to look at Professor TZ Post's story but by emasculated genius Buster Keaton, trapped in a mediocrity prison, confused by new technology, mocked by a vicious fate (in this case the study) preserves a stoic grace. Thus it is seen as a kind of masterpiece.
