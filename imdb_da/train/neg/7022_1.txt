For over 70 years of watching movies, this must be one of the worst comedies ever made. Mel Brooks, Mike Meyers and a few others have made some very bad comedies, but it is the absolute bottom of the barrel. It's unfunny from the very opening to the sticky scene under the credits. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton, whom I usually want, has needed her paycheck badly. She desperately needs to resume her craft. <br /> <br /> Dax Shepard (I don't know who he is) needs a better instructor to show him how to act. <br /> <br /> Liv Tyler is also not up to her role. <br /> <br /> Mike White has to find another character, he has done this same type of person a few times for many. <br /> <br /> Ken Howard who started years back as a first-rate actor, also not as good as he used to be. <br /> <br /> There is nothing decent I can say about this attempt at movie comedy. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * (out of 4) points 25 (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10)
