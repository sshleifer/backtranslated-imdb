The bad news is that it is still very terrible. I gave it a 2 because sometimes of this kitchy slapstick parody actually seems fun. It should be better than "Mulva, Zombie Ass Kicker", and progress should be rewarded. Or maybe I drank heavily when I looked at it and felt generously. Regardless, "2" is. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that it's over quite fast. It captures elements of most of Kill Bill I & II's key themes and combat situations, picks them up, snaps them, snaps up the dialog, and cuts the mess for about an hour with really horrible amateur video. <br /> <br /> You'd rather smoke a lot of something powerful if you want to enjoy it. And get this DVD back to the video store on time! You will really hate yourself if you have to pay a term fee.
