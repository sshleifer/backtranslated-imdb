This is certainly one of the most bizarre films ever made - even for Fellini. About the only more bizarre is his SATYRICON. This is a two and a half hour body through a strange nightmare world of decadence, opulence and sexual challenge. Sutherland makes a curiously unpleasant Casanova, and the odd riddles in a number of unrelated vignettes taken from the great lover's autobiography fail to engage the viewer. The art direction and costume design, however, are unsurpassed. The Academy did not even want to nominate it earlier but did itself justice by rewarding an OSCAR for the latter. Also nominated (strange) was the inconsistent, meaningless and almost unacceptable manuscript. Go figure !! The video on video is only 150 minutes, 16 minutes short for the original operating time. This viewer was grateful.
