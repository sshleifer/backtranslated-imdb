Including the virtual reality, the computer's potential, communication with the past, the ongoing struggle to express your identity in a forced society, and the fascinating Ada Byron Lovelace depicted by the fascinating Tilda Swinton, this film should have been great. But it is miserable, terrible if you are considering the potential! The actor - apart from Tilda Swinton and Karen Black - is from tolerable to horrible. The plot design is unfortunate to say the least - the modern programmer is a boring one-character character, but half of the movie is used to create its character, and when Ada finally comes up, telling the events in her life is not to present an engaging story (Swinton almost pulls it off, though). You never fully learn as a real person, just an icon from a master's story paper. The digital effects, such as. A digital dog and bird are miserable and distracting as it was 1997 and not 1985. And finally, the script is just bad. Poor, often pretentious dialogue - especially the battles between the programmer and her boyfriend, which made me choke - cold and distant characters and zero attempts to create a feeling of underneath. The programmer is successful in contacting a person in the past! Astonishing! But it hardly seems to surprise anyone, and her boyfriend says, "Well, beware." (Although we have no idea why or why it can be dangerous and it never seems to be dangerous.) <br /> <br /> Despite being about computers and Ada Lovelace and her love For mathematics, it is clear that no one involved in the script had any knowledge of mathematics or computers - any references to these topics come across as complete mumbo jumbo that can tolerate any suspension of disbelief. A scene towards the end of the movie is quite good, a monologue by Tilda Swinton expressing her sadness on the fragility of life, but her joy in that life. Exciting, passionate and insightful, it seems to have fallen from another movie. <br /> <br /> So I'm disappointed with this movie because it's a missed opportunity for a fascinating little cult movie. If you find the topic interesting, you may be able to rent it, but be aware. See Orlando for another, much better study of gender roles in history with an amazing Tilda Swinton performance. <br /> <br /> *** spoiler / questions: * * <br /> At the end of the movie, Ada asks that her memories not be preserved (in what I thought was the best scene in the movie ). But then the modern programmer seems to do it anyway, transferring the memories to his little girl (hence the movie's title). Am I right that the programmer violated Ada's desires without struggling over it? Or is this another confusing plot point that I interpret?
