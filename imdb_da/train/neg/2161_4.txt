Ira Levin's Broadway smash comes to the screen with almost no flesh on his bones, a mystery with a few tricks and twists, but no one worth worrying about. Frustrated author Michael Caine plots to steal a brilliant young man's work and hand it over as his own; his fake plan may include murder of the talented child who has Caines fleeting spouse in arms. The first action that everyone is introduced to is incredibly dead, with Caine doing everything an actor can to keep pacing. Dyan Cannon is miscast as his wife (she is too smart and clever herself to be rejected as a ditz) and Christopher Reeve (in the middle of the movie) seems extremely uncomfortable in the role of the better author. These three characters, and Irene Worth's troublesome neighbor, are so indeterminate that what happens after the setup hardly even detects well after the second action has begun. Sidney Lumet's direction is stagy and fuzzy, the put design is convincing and poorly lit, and the final is a total disaster. The actors are struggling to give the script some substance, but with such thin material, all we see is their demanding effort. * 1/2 from ****
