Over the years, I've seen a bunch of these just for video Segal movies, and everyone has the same entertainment; unfortanetley, entertainment level is at a low level. Sure, the action sequences were entertaining, but it was pretty much that. Seagal was really in his prime when he filmed; During Siege, Under Siege 2 and Executive Decision (at least at the point of action), however, over the past ten years, these types of films originating from Segal have not really met their previous skills. <br /> <br /> On the more positive side, the movie did well, as did some of the action sequences and the use of white. Just as the movie seemed to just pull on, a pretty cool action scene brought it up. I honestly believe that more of Segal's movies would do better if he was not the only one to recognize fans in the movie. Supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing, and if his current movie had these well-known supporting actors and actresses, the movie might be more popular.
