I downloaded this video after reading the text on the box, the story seemed good, and it had Keanu Reeves! But after 5 minutes of watching, I noticed how terrible his play was, he goes and speaks so stupid all the time, it's false and not convincing. It doesn't end there, almost all the signs seem so bad, it's ridiculous. Alan Boyce (David) is the only acceptable play, but the guy commits suicide early and you can't see him again, you never even know why he did it! Everything about this movie screams low quality, I can't believe how such a thing is released! I was tempted many times to stop seeing, in fact I halfway through, I decided to stop watching and turn off the case, came to IMDB to check what others thought about it, I found no comments (not surprised) so I decided to force myself to deal with the pain and go back to finish it so come here to comment. The only good thing (for me) was the high-school rock band theme, occasional guitar games and song parts, but it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> Very bad acting and conducting ... Terrible movie.
