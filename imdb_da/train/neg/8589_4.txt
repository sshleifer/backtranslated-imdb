Let me first preface this post by saying that I am a fan of the original Star Wars MOVIES ... I do not read the books, play the games, wear underwear or eat the grain (if any). I'm simply a fan of the movies. With that said, I struggle to see how people give this movie such praise. If you take this movie by yourself and don't compare it to the terrible predecessors (EP 1, 2), I don't understand how you can say this is a great movie. For all the terrible flaws in the script - cheesy dialogue, contoured scenes (ie, R2 is suddenly a badass and long CGI intense chase scenes that have little human touch), HORRIBLE acting and noted plot holes ... how is that good? There was no genuine inner dilemma within Anakin; it just seemed like there was a switch, and he was suddenly evil. I was not interested in the movie for the last 20 minutes or so (which, incidentally, was destroyed by the "NOOOOOO!" Frankenstein scene). When you BOMBARD screen with intensely amazing CGI effects and fill the gaps with horrible one-liners when more people could have and should have been said, it's not a big movie. For a movie with such a "dark" tone, there was too much levit in the speech of ALL characters. <br /> <br /> I close with a question: From the beginning to the end of the movie was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was actually going to happen?
