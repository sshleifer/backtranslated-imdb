This could be seen in many different ways. This movie sucks, it's good or it's simply weird. The third probably explains this movie best. It has weird themes and has just a weird plot. So whoever other than Christopher Walken would play in this no matter how bad, average or even how good it could be. The action was what you would expect especially from Ben Stiller. Jack Black I've always wanted you to know what you want to get out of him, but it's not bad. Christopher Walken is always away from the wall. He's always fun to watch, no matter how bad the movie is. Comedy wise, it's a little fun. This of course means that it has its moments (but very few), but can get a little over the top here and there, which makes me feel that the movie is just desperate for laughs, but of course not in a good way. <br /> <br /> The management was also average. Barry Levinson is a slightly overrated director and has really not done a good job here. This movie seemed to have much more potential, and he didn't do much to achieve it. Just very average and didn't seem like a great effort was put into making this movie. Scripture is the key to a good comedy. This of course means that the writing here failed. At best, it is below average. Considering it has its moments it wasn't too terrible. However, it is never a good thing to say about a movie. <br /> <br /> If not for Christopher Walken and the silly ridiculous end, I would have given it a lower rating. He is always right in his films. Style this is just a knocked out strange movie with strange characters that really doesn't go anywhere. Not terribly terrible, but I wouldn't really recommend it, but because it's a very forgettable movie.
