It's pretty ridiculous, I hope many people are exposed to Muslims living throughout the United States, the United States, and all over the world. Religion has over one billion followers. I was born and broke in America and through my religious classes and teachings I have learned to protect my country and work to contribute to society. I am very dedicated to the follow-up and teaching of my religion has been stressed through life to educate and prepare for success through education to contribute back to the world. I have known many Muslims from all over, and I have traveled to countries like Pakistan. I have not yet met a person who believes that we should harm anyone or not accept any other religion except from the people of the media ... I wonder why ... Also it is sad that these extremists are the ones who the media use to represent a whole religion. It is a religion of one billion people, and it is less than one percent, I am sure the other people in other religions will not be represented by KKK, IRA and many more, who are simple small percentage of extremists using obsolete and non-literal passages from the respected books to pursue their own vengeance, personal or business relationship through their so-called religion
