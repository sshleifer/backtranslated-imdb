You all know the story of "Hamlet". I do. <br /> <br /> Now the words "To be or not to be" (not the speech itself) have been dropped into the ground so many times that it is not very interesting (in fact, it was not so nice to start with ). In fact, I find "Hamlet" a good but great overrated game. It's not even Shakespeare's best: "Julius Caesar" and "Romeo & Juliet" are ten times better, with "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "Othello" not too far behind. "Macbeth (knock your table out of the drawers, puck will make amends, OW!)" Nor is it that bad. There are many others that are better than this by Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I don't really want to comment too much on the movie, but I want to dissect the horrible MST3K episode. <br /> <br /> Okay. . . Mike and Bots win a card game, so get the movie. . . they ask for "Hamlet", Pearl sends them this, yadda yadda yadda. . . and prepare for the most boring Sci-Fi episode of MST3K ever (though I haven't seen any of the CCs). While "Blood Waters of Dr. Z" makes displaying that episode awful as it is not really a movie, nor random, split scenes (I am reminiscent of Mike's line from "Future War": "Perhaps this is an anthology of short plotless movies "), SOL Crew a lot got a lot of good cracks. Can't say the same here. <br /> <br /> The reef falls flat, the host segments (pairs usually) are mediocre at best, and when the film itself (which is not so bad) is actually better (I mean, as a quality movie, not as a camp that "Prince of Space") than the MST3K version of what you know the show should be bad. I laughed (last time I saw it was several months ago), oh, maybe eight or nine times through. I tried and tried and tried to be entertained - but I just couldn't. Only the occasional line, like "Hail Queen Dilbert's boss!" (and when it's the funniest line in the episode, well, ahem) - and sometimes I mean every tenth or so - maybe I'll even chuckle. The second time I tried to see it, I didn't even laugh at the few jokes I had found before, and just gave up forty minutes before. <br /> <br /> The movie is not horrible; It's just a German version of Hamlet. The actors are good enough, and although copying is not the greatest, it is not in itself a reason to hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Four stars for "Hamlet"; THREE, yes THREE to the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> PS: WHY why, MST3K!
