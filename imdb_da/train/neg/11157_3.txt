Hip. Erotic. Wickedly sexy ... whatever. It is "The Terminator" with werewolves. <br /> <br /> No, seriously. Police save the girl (waitress!) From the big monster and refer to herself as her 'protector'. Leading actor Ryan Alosio does a pretty good job of imitating Kyle Reese ... there is a massacre in a police force ... the bad guy is muscular with red eyes ... and it even contains dialogue in line with "You said It himself, he will never stop. Never. "The grim script comes from a first-time writer who, thank God, has not sold anything since, and it is all thrown together by the sensible bad director Richard Friedman. <br /> <br /> The movie opens in a bar (always a good sign), and a medieval biker guy bursts in with no apparent reason, pursued by three police. One of them is black and (shock horror!) He is the one who is killed in the first five minutes. The movie goes downhill for the next hour or so, then picks up some decent action sequences before rounding it all off with an eerie ending. <br /> <br /> Mostly, the cast comes across competent actors doing what they can with a bad script and a director who is willing to pay less. If nothing else seems to be learning how to act in this movie, and Alosio along with some of the supporting casts show signs of talent. DarkWolf in his human form is played by giant Kane Hodder - famous for his numerous portraits of Jason Vorhees in 'Friday the 13th' film. He's decent enough, especially considering he doesn't usually speak roles. <br /> <br /> It has become famous among groups of horny teen boys for the lesbian rooftop scene between Andrea Bogart and Sasha Williams, who gets her kit off some of the great tradition of former 'Power Rangers' actresses. And it is unnoticed clearly that the editor used WAY too much time on that scene ... Still, the main redeeming feature is that the physical werewolf effects are pretty good, and the wolf's design is not bad at all. But CGI is bad. Just pretty bad. I seriously think if you can't reach any level of realism - why bother? Just throw some extra money into the makeup! Apart from the horrible script, this movie has the moment, many of which are unintentionally fun. It is good to laugh if you have nothing better to do but just don't spend money on it. Please.
