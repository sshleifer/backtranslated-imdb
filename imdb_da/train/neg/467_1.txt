There are bad movies, horrible movies, even boring movies ... I can see the most and put up to the end, not this time. Avoid this like the plague, annoying music all the way through, horrible editing, no comedy, its tackier than a news shrink ... My missus wanted to see this thinking, it would be legally blonde material or something kind of tough but never better than average, chick flicks. It was the first time she asked me to press the stop button. The girls, they weren't good at first (Denise made OK in the Starship Troopers and Wild Things), but you've picked up gravel. I want a mug that has spent 30 minutes on this ... Pamela Anderson is almost unrecognizable after much construction work on her face. <br /> <br /> Please take my advice if you want to avoid wasting valuable oxygen and brain cells ranting on the complete mince that is on your screen.
