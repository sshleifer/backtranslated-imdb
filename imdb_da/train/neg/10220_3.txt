First of all, this film can be divided into three segments. A promising opening, with Cheyenne's slander of some cavalry. This is followed by what can only be described as a long boring average, with the utterly mistaken Candice Bergen and "Soldier Blue" traveling together to secure security for an army garrison. Miss Bergen spends inappropriate four letters every time she opens her mouth and looks like she just went out of a 1970's Jack Nicholson movie. I think she maintains zero interest, with no credibility. The third and final section involves the completely free slaughter of an Indian village. It is so overtly exaggerated to put on the anti-war propaganda that it comes across as just long, scandalous and constructed. Not recommended. - NOTE ................................ Jacobe (comment above) Here's an idea. Why don't you actually see the movie you are commenting on instead of tweaking your liberal nonsense. This is not a political site for movie review. - NOTE
