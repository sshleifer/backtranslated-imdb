Real premise. Very unrealistic. What I learned from this movie is that the speed that has broken down for the weekend is not the best idea. I loved how Bill conveniently rolls out of the car and down the hill without any harm! Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for his madness. Oh, and the police never seemed to find the car or track the wreck owner. <br /> <br /> Lots of worn out scenes, including a regular stripper (still has nightmares from that scene). Poor assistant guy and his crummy useless hand. I admit I was fascinated to see what the mysterious "thing" was behind the door, but when it looked, I just laughed. HA HA HA !! The girl seemed really sadistically angry to be revived. Personally, I really want a new body after an eerie experience as such!
