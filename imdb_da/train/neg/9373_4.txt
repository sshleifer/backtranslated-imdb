Martin Kosleck's peculiar charisma gives some credibility to the character of the frustrated artist. He imbues his dialogue with a strange sense of realism, making the sculptor Marcel a convincing person. The character succeeds in getting across as a real person and not so much a typical B-film curve. <br /> <br /> History is nothing to write home about, and many scenes are boring. What makes it work is the strange chemistry between Kosleck and Rondo Hatton as Creeper. The flashy, philosophical character of Kosleck contrasts with Hatton's low key, monosyllabic approach. The Creeper's character has not been developed far beyond a basic sample level, but Hatton suggests undeveloped opportunities and makes you wonder about his back story. <br /> <br /> This movie was at Shock Theater a lot when I was a kid, so I have some nostalgic love for it. It's worth a look, anyway, for those who enjoy Fortie's horror movie.
