This movie was different because it didn't show the typical gay stereotypes that I usually see. But that does not change the fact that it is completely missing a story. I am sure there are many gay men who are just happy to see themselves portrayed on the screen as there are no black homosexual characters and when they are, the characters are usually not fully developed. But how hard it would have been for the author to actually write a story with a beginning, middle and end. Or how about a story that was focused. There really doesn't seem to be a point on this movie, and even though it's a low-budget movie, it's still no excuse for the lack of history or plot.
