This would have been a * big * silent movie. The actor is really good, at least in a Look Ma, I do really great action! kind of way. <br /> <br /> Everything is great. Every line is PROFOUND! Every scene is staggered by human trafficking! <br /> <br /> For the most part, I felt like gagging. But as a train wreck I could not tear my eyes away. This dialogue may have worked on stage, even though I doubt it. On the screen, it was messy, random, hackneyed, and virtually all other stereotypical negative adjectives that you can help describe a really bad dramatic work. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy your melodrama in huge, huge doses, you * can * enjoy the movie. However, be prepared to wait. For all that melodrama, this thing goes safely at its own pace. <br /> <br /> This script should have sounded very different when the actors involved read it to themselves. It simply does not work when they come around to deliver it in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> IMDB makes us a great disservice, sometimes when using its cool computerized "weighted score". Love of the starving class deserves less than a 1. Character-driven fiction is great, but when you develop your characters simply by pushing them through hoops without any credible explanation for their maturation or evolution, it's not T character development! Your characters must have a motivation. Being full for a while and waking up in a field is * not * character development. It's a plot contrivance. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie. Or at least, see it subdued. Maybe you get some entertainment from all the arm-waving signs do. <br /> <br /> Oh, and words to the wise - to prove this is really an artistic movie, you can see James Woods in all his dangly male "look-at-me, I'm the figurative and literal representation-of-the-naked-vulnerability-of-man "glory. <br /> <br /> Don't say you weren't warned.
