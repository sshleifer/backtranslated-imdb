I don't go often to write comments, but for this I just had to warn someone who might think they are watching a comedy by looking at this. This does not come close. While the premise (change in color / gender / whatever) is poor enough (and it has been done better many times before), the actual transformation of two black guys into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever. put on the screen. It would be bad enough if all that is required of the script was a change to white chickens. But the Wayans brothers must pamper themselves as two specific white women. As you will have guessed now, they fail completely. I have seen drag queens without makeup make more compelling women than these two do with the best special effects and make-up people that Hollywood can offer. It is appalling. Add to the mix a basketball player built like a building, horrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course and this movie hits a new personal low. And I like bad movies! Avoid like the plague.
