Now I finally saw it. I didn't go when it first came out because I was honest, terrible. Afraid how bad it can be or how disappointing. Though not as bad as the Menace and better than Clones, it was not very memorable or satisfying. I was 11 years old when I saw Star Wars. I still remember sitting in the theater. From the opening cry to the final credits, it was a movie experience I will never forget. A timeless story of the boring farm boy who just knew he was meant for more, and saved the princess and galaxy from the evil threat while being mentored by the clever wizard, the scourge pirate and the various comic relief - all in a room-opera setting. <br /> <br /> It's not to tamper with Lucas to use an old formula. It's an old formula just because it works. And to his credit he gave the new terms that made it very special. <br /> <br /> Then came Empire and the story became more than just an adventure. The darkness entered the picture and we learned one of the great film twists of all time. The great villain, Vader, was Luke's father. Wow, nobody saw it coming. Of course, I am convinced that neither Lucas before it appeared in the manuscript. Go back and see Star Wars again. Knowing what you know now, especially in light of the first three episodes, see if it really meshes. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the problem I have. Revenge is an entertaining movie - huge effects, lots of action, some good fighting scenes. But a movie still lives or dies on its plot - the story it tells. Oh, surely, really good acting can save a weak plot, but a weak plot combined with bad action - it's a burden no director can overcome, certainly not as bad as I am forced to realize that George Lucas is (The man has managed to correct some of the worst performances in their career from some very fine actors - Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Samuel Jackson). <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILERS AHEAD ******* * Plot. Oh my. Understand, he is already handicapped by what has happened in the first two films, so it is an incredible burden. One too much for him to overcome. <br /> <br /> First, we have the pure absurdities in the background. We have found Anakin as a child at Tatooine, the product of a virgin, miracle birth - the "chosen". Well, this detail is never remotely explained. In fact, the closest explanation is Yoda's observation that they might be wrong. Oh, okay then. Our mistake. <br /> <br /> Now the same wunderkind shows up to the creator of C3PO. Hey, what a coincidence it is. And he comes back to Tatooine and never knows he was in there? Wow! What about that. Tests the old willing suspension of unbelievers, eh, George? Still, we have this bratty kid, moody, petulant, whining young adult, somehow to become one of the greatest villains in movie history - the great tragedy of Darth Vador - the good guy who falls from grace, for only to achieve final redemption in the end. <br /> <br /> How, asking tell, does this happen? Why does he have a dream that his wife will die in childbirth? Now he surely lives in a stellar civilization that treats gravity as we treat petrol, but it seems to be the "dark one to be" to perhaps check with a doctor because perhaps, perhaps, perhaps, this futuristic society might be about this problem? Why, no, the only thing he can do is kill some kids because the bad guy at the root of all the evil they've been hunting for two movies tells him he has the secret to immortality. <br /> <br /> Well, of course he does. <br /> <br /> Sheesh. How can Lucas expect us to see such foolishness and be moved by it? How can anyone expect us to care? Hell, why would somebody want this quarrel to be rescued or redeemed in the first place. I wanted Kenobi killed him, not because he was evil, but because he was pathetic stupid. <br /> <br /> By the way, Amidala eventually dies. At birth. Why? Now they don't know. The physician, who is a droid and even indicative of the incredibly high technology advanced by this society, only gives the conclusion that "she has lost the will to live". Well, oh, okay, of course she does. Perhaps it finally seemed to her what a dweeb she slept with. <br /> <br /> But here we are. We have Kenobi present for all this. He knows Luke and Leia's birth. Know who their father is and know what happens to them. Also knows the role of both R2 and C3PO. And yet, over the years, when Luke approaches crew and appears with 3PO and R2 (curiously, 3PO minds are wiped out, but not R2's - why ????) stating "I think that these droids belong to you ", Kenobi, who knows that the protocol rule was built by the one he believed to be" the chosen "and apprentice to the emperor himself and who has just been built on this planet, says" oddly, I do not remember to own no droids ". <br /> <br /> Oh good sorrow. <br /> <br /> Lucas just made it up when he went together. When he first introduced Vader as Luke's father, history began to go out of control because he didn't know what the story was. Plots of episodes 1-3 are simply incomprehensible. Nothing Palpatine made any rational feeling at all. And none of these binds to the story he originally told in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> It's an afterthought, and it seems. <br /> <br /> I can't give this movie a high rating. It reminds me of Triple X. A fun movie to watch, but completely forgettable. Star Wars will stand in my mind forever. Fortunately, one and the two previous ones will soon be.
