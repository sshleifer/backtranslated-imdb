The first ten minutes of this film about making an international film in Belgium are fine: you see real chaos on the set, a producer on the edge of a nervous breakdown, the black has been director (Mickey Rourke), the bad tempered star etc. You've seen everything before, but it's well done. BUT THEN! The rest of the time the movie resumes only: the same ten minutes again and again. No climax, no dramatic development, no good acting, not even bad acting, it just goes on and on. Mickey Rourke has two good minutes when his character talks about his f ** k up career in a scene where reality and fiction meet. Overall it does 12 good minutes. <br /> <br />
