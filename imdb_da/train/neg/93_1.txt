A woman asks for a road to a mysterious city, and hears two ghoulish stories from the local weirdo, both zombie-related. But maybe fate has something that is also wrong for her too ... Zombie Chronicles is definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In fact, I must confess, so bad was it that I quickly forwarded through most of the garbage. And there was a lot of it, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes and there are still tons of fillers. You get some skin heads to do many push ups, lots of boring kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (the rhyme, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors. <br /> <br /> As for the titles, they hardly have a footnote in the movie. Why do you get more undead action in the intro than you do the previous item! While considering how pathetic the eyes break out of electrical outlets and eating brain sequences is (including "delights"), it is perhaps a blessing in disguise. <br /> <br /> And to top it all, it seems like it's been filmed on a person's mobile phone for broadcasting on Youtube. Jerky camera work, scratches on the print, shimmering light ... I had to rub my eyes when I realized that it was made in 2001 and not 1971. Even the clothes and the fashion designer look about three decades! <Br /> <br /> If you think I'm not qualified to make a review of Chronicles, you haven't seen the whole movie, so go ahead. You're trying to get through what I betcha, you won't even make it the first look of the blue-smartie colored freaks before you make your excuses and leave. It's really ridiculous that someone chose to release it, and honestly you will be much more fun, resting your drink on the counter than actually torturing your DVD player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. In fact, it doesn't surprise you if it packs it, bags and leaves in the morning, so you judge to see VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You've been warned ... 0/10 <br /> P.S What kind of 18-ranked horror does the woman have on a massive sports ball during the mandatory sex scene? See, the movie can't even get the right part ...
