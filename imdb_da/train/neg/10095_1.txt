Someone actually gave this movie 2 stars. There is a very high chance that they need immediate professional help, since anyone who does not spend 30 seconds to see if you can award stars is not quite literally scary. <br /> <br /> This movie is ... well ... I think it's pretty much a kind of attempt at a horrible porn / snus movie without porn or no real horrible bits (except for acting, plot, story, set , dialogue and sound). I mistakenly assumed it was about zombies. <br /> <br /> Seeing it is actually quite scary in justice; You are afraid someone will come over and you will never be able to describe what it is and they will go away and believe you are a freak that looks at home-made amateur torture videos or something like that. <br /> <br /> I'm so surprised I write this review on my mobile so I don't forget to try to bring the rating further than the current 1.6 to save others from the same terrible fate that I'm right little. <br /> <br /> I'm the worst movie I've ever seen, and I can say (by hand at heart) it will never be topped.
