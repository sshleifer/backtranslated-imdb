I'm sorry to say this, but the actor in this movie is horrible. The dialogue sounds like they are reading their lines for the first time ever. Maybe I accidentally got the version "dress rehearsal". The director uses slow motion during special effects, perhaps as an attempt to compensate for the poor performance of the actors themselves. The story is pretty well written, and the battle sequences are actually better than I've seen in many action films. The fighting seems pretty real. But all this happens while two leading players time and again miraculously survive incredible amounts of empty automatic firearms, grenades, mortar rounds and bazookas. The enemy soldiers are certainly some of the worst shots I have ever seen, especially when they have the escaping truck in their sights from about 30 feet, and every bazooka shot is wide by at least 50 feet. These bazookas need serious site calibration.
