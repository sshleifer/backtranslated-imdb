Istanbul is another of the exhibited films that Errol Flynn made in the last decade of his life, trying to support his family and remaining out of trouble with the IRS. It's a remake of the Fred MacMurray-Ava Gardner movie Singapore a decade ago. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the studio product, Istanbul has the benefits of the great location kinematics right at the sight of the golden horn. But Errol Flynn, who grows exponentially in front of the camera in each movie, was far too old to play these action / adventure types anymore. His scenes with Cornell Borchers really lack the conviction. <br /> <br /> For Cornell, she plays Errol's former boyfriend who, through the trauma of being rescued from a fire, now has amnesia. She can't both remember Errol and is now married to Torin Thatcher. <br /> <br /> But Errol has some unpleasant people led by Martin Benson and Werner Klemperer, who are after some diamonds that have come into his possession. Also has to deal with them. <br /> <br /> Best reason to see Istanbul is to hear Nat King Cole singing and playing the piano. Most people today do not realize that Cole was a well-established jazz pianist, they only think of him as a singer. In fact, he was a pianist first, the song was an afterthought. <br /> <br /> Istanbul is a routine action / adventure movie for those fans of that kind of movie.
