Comparing this squalor with an old, low budget porn flick would be an insult to the old, low budget porn flick. Animal scenes have no meaning, nor do they represent this man and his crimes even in the broadest sense of abstractions. Synopsis on the back of the DVD case is partly for "poignant tale of BTK Killer's terrorist government". This is NOT a story. A narrative would indicate that you are told the truth about what happened or how or why. None of these things are true. I am an enthusiastic study of serial killers and have seen some beautiful crappie movies about them and honestly this is NOT one of them. This is not even about the BTK killer. Save yourself time and a few bucks and rent Dahmer instead. This serial killer movie is accurate and true. But if you just want to watch this movie for yourself, check it out for free at your local library and even then you will still feel cheated.
