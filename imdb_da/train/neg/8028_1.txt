Please! Don't waste money on this movie. It's nothing but a boring German Blair Witch ripoff made by some high school kids. I couldn't finish watching it and I usually like to see all kinds of B movies. How on earth could they find a distributor for it? !!! Fun: Please see Wikipedia for "dark area". The guy who wrote the entrance must be completely out of his mind. Maybe he got lots of money from the producers. Money that should have been spent on actors, cameras and editing. Even that would not have helped, as there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this movie. Unfortunately, "dark area" has already become too attentive. Please, director, producer and author of this movie, stop making movies that way ... you don't do yourself a favor. The world would be a better place without this movie.
