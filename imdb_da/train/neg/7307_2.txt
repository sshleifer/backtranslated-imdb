This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The events in it are completely random and give little or no meaning. The fact that there is a successor is so sick I can come down with a case of cabin fever (I'm so sour). I describe it as a bug that gets smudged into a newspaper because it seems to be different parts of things mixed together. For example, Kevin's pancake loving karate child is just freakish weird on his own, so there is the policeman who is a little weird and perverted, so the addict then there is the fact that they are attacking some random guy who clearly needs it help. so suddenly the protagonist has sex with her friend's friend just because she says something stupid about a plane going down. So at the end a good old family racism followed by a rabbit operating on Kevin Karate's child. It is actually quite despicable that they can use racism as a joke in this movie. There's no reason anyone can enjoy this movie unless you love Eli Roth, even that didn't make me like this movie. Hate is a strong word, but since that is the only word I am allowed to use it has to do. BOYCOTT CABIN FEVER 2 !!!!!
