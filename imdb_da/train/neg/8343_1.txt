Salvage is the worst so-called horror movie I've ever seen. There is nothing far terrible about it. It doesn't deserve to be in a genre so nice. First of all, I can't see how so many people can think of this piece of shit such a great movie. If I wrote something as boring and utterly ridiculous as this, I would be laughable and embarrassed to subject others to the stupidity of it. Other: The act is horrible, and the leading actress is terribly ugly. Third: The story sucks, it's been used before, and the excuse that it's a cheap movie is no excuse. Read the summer story at the back of the case, it reveals the whole story. I do not recommend watching this movie unless you have 80 minutes to waste anything that will leave you regretting that you saw it. I feel really bad for the Crooks and the irony in their name. All hail Anthony Perkins !!!!!!!!!
