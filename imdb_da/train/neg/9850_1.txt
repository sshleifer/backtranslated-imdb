I felt brain dead, I tell you. This is the worst movie I've ever bought. (In my ignorance I thought it was the Peter Jackson movie of the same name). The performance is so horrible that they are ridiculous. The special effects have not stood the test of time and look bleak. The script promotes that kind of television movie, staring into the spacing kind of play. It cast looks like they have taken lessons from Joey Tribbiani, they have a look each and stick to it. And I've never been confused by a movie before I sat down to see this. It's a dream, or no plot is so terrible that frustration sets in within minutes. Avoid as a plague.
