The song's echoed 'bubbling' sound effect used to put me to bed. A very calming show. I think I could have slept through the parts where there was danger or danger. I had also heard that some shots for a show of fungicides were shot in Tarpon Springs, Florida. I would assume Lloyd Bridges never died there. I can only remember the show in reruns, and although it was never huge, we wanted to make our own underwater episodes in the lake at my grandmother's house ... imagine the echoing bubbling sounds and telling our adventures in our heads. I thought 'Flipper' had better underwater actions. Of course, he benefited from being in his natural environment.
