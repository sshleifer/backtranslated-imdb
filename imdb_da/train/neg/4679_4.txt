What a horrible movie. Don't make me wrong, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors, but apart from a few interesting sets, the movie is mostly concerned with hysterical submarines shouting, crying, sweating and generally freaking out when something goes wrong. /> <br /> Take it easy pages to make sure the audience still understands what's going on (the scene where Denzel Washington explains a radio repairman how to be like Scotty in Star Trek is nothing but a joke) And you have a dumbed down thriller that is not worthy of the actor. <br /> <br /> Let's just hope the real nuclear US Navy is not in the hands of such a script! <br /> <br />
