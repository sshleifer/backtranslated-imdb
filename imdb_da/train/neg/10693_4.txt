Maybe it's dubbing, or maybe it's the endless scenes of people crying, moaning or otherwise continuing, but I found Europe '51 to be one of the most overwhelmed (and therefore annoying) movies I ever have seen. The movie starts promising if it is known, as mom Ingrid Bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled brat by a son (Sandro Franchina). While mummy and daddy (gentle Alexander Knox) ​​entertain their guests at an evening party, the kid tries to kill himself and launches a life-changing series of events that find Bergman spending time-consuming compassion on the poor and needy. Spurred on by communist newspaper editor Andrea (Ettore Giannini) she soon uses more time with the shaded than she does with her husband, who soon unlocks her in an insane asylum for her problems. Bergman plays the sacred role in the hilt and echo of her 1948 role as Joan of Arc, and Rossellini makes a fantastic work of lighting and the film her for the best effect. Unfortunately, the manuscript points its point home with skin-fisted subtlety that Andrea and mother offer to clarify Marxist and Christian platitudes. By the last tear of the soaked scene, I had had more than my fill of these tiring signs. A real step down for Rossellini when he walked away from neo-realism and further embraced the mythical and mysterious themes of the 1950's flowers of St. Francis.
