This will be short. Let me first say that I am agnostic and not exactly mad at extans, especially xtian fanatics. However, this documentary had a similar tone from some teenagers who were angry with his xtian mother for not letting him play video games. I just couldn't take it seriously. To mention how Charles Manson believed he was Christ to illustrate the point that extinction can raise evil? I do not know it was just cheap and childish - made the opposition to be ignorant. In addition, the narrator seemed just snob and pretentious. Delivery was completely overkill. I can't take this documentary seriously. Can appeal to an angry teen piss3d off at her xtian mother for not letting him play video games.
