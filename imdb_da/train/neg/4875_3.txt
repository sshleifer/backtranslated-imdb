My grandmother took me and my sister out to watch this movie when it came out in theaters back in 1998, and we happily bought the tickets, popcorn and sodas and went straight into the theater and sat down to watch the movie. When it was over, the audience did not succeed, I remember hearing some people say they didn't like it at all, I didn't like it, I thought it was pretty stupid and not worth seeing. Eddie Murphy was hysterical in this, but apart from him, the whole movie was bad, I rarely laughed at the parts of this, I also remembered that the others in the theater almost never even laughed. And what I really thought was bad was that the animals talked because there are only talking animals in cartoons, in live action movies, they are quite tired! I said that apart from Eddie Murphy's hysterical twist he brings in, this movie is not worth seeing, it's pretty silly. <br /> <br /> I've seen Eddie Murphy in several of the movies and I thought he was fun in those I just said he was the only fun part of this movie, I haven't seen Eddie Murphy in the really "big" movie, The Adventures of Pluto Nash. This movie is not a movie that I really recommend that you see, because unlike Eddie Murphy you probably won't like it here, especially because of the many talking animals in it! <br /> <br /> I will give this movie a rating of 3 stars out of a possible 10 stars.
