I think if I went to a first school somewhere deep in the country and asked English to come up with a script, it would be more sensible than this. I could then go to the first year's drama group and they would act better than the jokers in this movie. This really sounds, but I'm sure they did it as a joke and are fully aware that they possess (see what I did there?) Neither the ability to act nor write anything, ever. <br /> <br /> See this only if you are incredibly full, tall or in need of a good excuse why your matured corpse was found with a wrist. I will now go to my fishing bowl and collect all the poo at the bottom. Then I push it in the shape of a disc and put it in my DVD player and it fully expects to produce something far better than this trumpery. Acting - 0/10 Plot - LOL / 10 Breasts - 9/10
