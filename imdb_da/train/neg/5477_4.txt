Take a SciFi Original Movie and mix in a small alternative / revisionist story and you'll get "Aztec Rex." Apparently, before he overcame the Aztec Empire, Hernand Cortes was first to conquer a Tyrannosaurus Rex and her mate. It's the shot of this movie. Considering the plot, it could really have been sucked; The fact that it is only sucked is a tip of the hat to the authors. There are some problems. Initially, Cortes is played by Ian Ziering. Even with a black gem, Ziering as Cortes is as convincing as Axl Rose plays Gandhi. And even though Cortes conquers the indigenous peoples of Mexico, the Aztecs look to be played by a whole Hawaiian ensemble. Casting aside T-Rex (e) looks pretty good, but every time one of them is shot, it's just CGI. And they die too easily; I assume that if a T-Rex was in fact, they could probably be felled or at least wounded by some rather rudimentary 16th century weapons. But it takes something away from the movie. There are also some graphical T-Rex extinction-human scenes, which is surprising, but in this context I thought they were working OK. There is plenty of action and the entire colonization angle prevails throughout but does not overwhelm the dinosaur angle, unlike the other recent SciFi Original Dinosaur movie "Warbirds". Overall, a mediocre (but decent by SciFi Original standards) movie that speaks a message 4.
