If you want to make a movie like this, the threat must be genuine. Don't bet your patsy with a bunch of Bonzos. There is no credibility here. The reason is dull and incredible. The action is even worse. I thought I saw Arthur Lake (Dagwood), one of the worst actors in history when I saw the protagonist. Oh yes, at some point he has to face the music and become giant angry. It doesn't matter. Do you? There are all these long scenes set in this strict office (the furniture made of cardboard or masonite). People talk and smoke and do nothing. Most of the action takes place in a five-minute order. Then it's over. Do not want to.
