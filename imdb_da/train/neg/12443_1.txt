- Let me start by saying that I understand that the invasion of the starships was supposed to be a parody of the 50's sci-fi films. I understand that none of it should be taken seriously. The problem I have is that none of it works. A parody should be fun, and one is just not. Not once during the whole runtime did I do as much as a smile. In general, I am easily entertained, but I could not find a crooked entertainment anywhere in Invasion of the Star Creatures. <br /> <br /> - I knew I was in trouble right from the start. The two "stars" make their screen look with one of the lameest gags imaginable - a water hose they can't control that gets them both wet. These two come as Bowery Boys wannabes. Why anyone would like to mime the action and persona of the Bowery Boys is beyond me. After the lesser-known beginnings, the movies continue with comic hunting sequences, dancing Indians, vegetable men, decoder rings, and other various unfunny bits. It's just a waste of time. <br /> <br /> - I bought this on the dual feature DVD with Invasion of the Bee Girls. The film is Academy Award-winning thing compared to Invasion of the Star Creatures.
