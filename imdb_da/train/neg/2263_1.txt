Okay, let me say I didn't expect a movie starring Jerry Springer to be movie gold, all I asked for was cinematic ... and it wasn't even that. It looked like someone else's bad home videos. Badly acted, scripted and filled to the surface with the nudity of the most unnatractive people I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The movie's "plot" focuses on a low-class family choosing to go on "Jerry Farrelly Show" to discuss more issues between a mother, daughter, stiffer, and daughter's fiance. Then the film fizzles and develops into a unique experience: pornographic pornography. There are redneck sex, interacial sex, straight sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This movie encouraged me to run out of the theater and get another circumcision. At least it was mercifully short. Genuine and degrading. African Americans and the working class America should be offended. (Howard Stern, however, should be happy, he did not spread his attempt at film studios. He was smart, funny and entertaining) MY GRADE: F + (daughter was hot)
