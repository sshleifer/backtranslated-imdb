The British claymation series, which put "witty" conversations from "average" people in the mouth of "sweet" imaginative creatures, at least benefited non-British viewers of apparent droll and the kind of rare cultured humor you could not get on American TV. Someone made the mistake of putting it on American TV. <br /> <br /> Kind of like the unfortunately miscast US version of the sublime Brit-com COUPLING, which died in a month at NBC, as the same basic scripts did not "translate" from British English to American English, what Seemed droll and cultured (and just a BIT boring) in England, coming across in CREATURE COMFORTS, the American version, just boring with dolls. There is no through line, no sign, and after one and a half episodes (of the three ultimately aerated), no need to suffer more. The only positive thing to be said about the new summer series and the mercifully short round it has is that claymation is at least professionally finished and comes as a lineup for the only worst show on the CBS plan, The New Adventures of Old Christine (or "how to be a terrible mother - or person - in an infinite involuntary lesson"), children who wanted to stay up past their bedtime, happily went to bed instead of sitting through this show, and the adults could wait with to tune in until 9:00, when "two and a half men" (guilty pleasure) and "How I met your mother" (actual quality script) come on.
