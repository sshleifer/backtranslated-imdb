In 1976, the western one was an exhausted genre, and the film's makers knew it clearly. Still, instead of paying tribute to the project and saving us from seeing it, they went ahead and did it anyway. Apparently needing an interesting thread to get the audience to come and watch the movie, they decided to make it as blatantly violent and uncomfortable as possible. Hell, it worked for The Wild Bunch so why wouldn't it work here? Of course, The Wild Bunch had the benefits of a fantastic script, but The Last Hard Men's script is commonly old-fashioned waste. It's hard to figure out what attracted Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles. Heston plays a retired lawyer who goes after a fled mass of prisons led by a violent ban (Coburn). The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by the prisoners and subjected to sexual degradation. <br /> <br /> This is a bloodthirsty movie where every time someone dies, it appears in the upper detail. It's really disappointing really, because the star mating sounds like a mouth-watering view. There is also no sense of pace or urgency in the movie. It takes forever to get started, but when the action finally comes, it is horrified by the emphasis on nastiness. All in all, it can be the worst movie ever made by Heston. I'm sure it's one of the productions he's making to include on his famous resume.
