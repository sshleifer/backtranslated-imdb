I have always been fond of time dramas, an art form in which the BBC has distinguished itself in the past. This presentation of "Byron" was incredible. Incredibly bad! The scripture was horrible, the actress uninspired, and all the characters were grossly incomplete. It was obvious that Byron was "angry and dangerous to know" and put the ladies' hearts completely flat. Not in this production. Here he appeared as a foggy jumped little syringe instead of a female hero of women and the Greek struggle for independence. It is said that Byron went with a slack. This depiction of the man was just lame everywhere. <br /> <br /> I watched for two and a half hours waiting for something to sparkle in life. Not a splinter, not even a glimpse. It was complete tedium, if not boredom, from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Considering that nobody will ever improve Avard Bard, I also think that Byron's poetry is upset and that my mind must be thrown on the back burner, and this dramatization of his life must be given the same treatment. I think the BBC lost its noses with this one
