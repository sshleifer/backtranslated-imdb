My family and I screened Underdog the night before. And as bad as Underdog is (my four-year-old loved it), Hot Rod makes it an Oscar worthy material. The only thing that could have saved this movie was if Evel had come out of retirement to hit Samberg in the face to make this movie. However, I will admit that the soundtrack was good. I wasn't sure if the movie was set in the 80s, but with most of the music from Europe? Who knows. If I were you, I would take a passport. And just stay home and see the test pattern at your local TV station. Or if you're dead looking at this, people under the influence can enjoy it.
