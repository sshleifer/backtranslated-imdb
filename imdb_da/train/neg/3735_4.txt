The actor Patty Duke wrote an insightful, fun and rough book about her career as an actress, her crazy quilt love life and her manic depressive episodes and suicide attempts that almost gave her good. With this rich material to draw from (and Patty plays in the final act), one would believe in a crack television director that Gilbert Cates could bring everything on film, but "Call Me Anna" is a pale shadow of Duke's autobiography . For those who have not read the book, the sketchy story (leaping forward in time) is not absorbent, we never get our bearings with what happens, and the production seems to be disturbed by a low budget. The actors are miscast, and the value of having Duke himself finally appearing does not pay off - the film's false reality is so thick at this time that Patty cannot bring stability to the scenario. It appears that the producers were sincere (and mind-set) to scare the movie against Duke's ultimate diagnosis and mental freedom, but they left many dramatic opportunities in the process.
