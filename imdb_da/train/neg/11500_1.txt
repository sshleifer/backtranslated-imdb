This feature is slow, plodding, cold, dark and without plot or hope. It follows that the right European formula that they love to subsidize is never seen, but the critics believe it is an important point. The film is valuable if nothing but showing great difference in thinking between Americans and Europeans about employment. In this film, men are still caring for their wounds many years ago and feel it is the government's duty to give them work. While in the US we know that we have to go out there and create value for someone. <br /> <br /> Spain never looked back!
