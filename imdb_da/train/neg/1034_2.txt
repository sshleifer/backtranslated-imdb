After the success of Scooby-Doo, where you are, they decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their own show. But unfortunately, they added a new character that spoiled Scooby-Doo's success forever. They invented a new show with a new title, Scooby and Scrappy-Doo. It was Scrappy-Doo who made this show a complete mistake, probably for both adults and children together. Scrappy was the stupid brave puppy who always looked ready to beat anyone up. Scooby and Shaggy were scared of the villain and they also tried to stop him. Scooby-Doo doesn't need any annoying bastard puppies. If they wanted Scooby-Doo to be more successful, they should either have killed or never thought of Scrappy. This was just poor, maybe your kids would prefer it!
