This is a fair little show about the paranormal, although it feels like Art Bell and his ilk figured out how to cut a career out of the attitude Carl Kolchak exemplified. Of course, there would probably not be X files if this show hadn't marked this audience for it as well. Darren McGavin is not exactly the super-heroic type, but he is a likely (enough) guy to deliver heroic deeds. Check out his work on some of the old Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Here he is the main attraction that does not seem to be a girlfriend or wife who is a distraction. In fact, there is not much sex appeal to the show. One thing I notice so well is that the pacing is not particularly exciting in a typical way. There is a lot of humor to this show. Sometimes it's just to fight to get to the climax. There is a thread from this show that comes right up to today's MAD MEN show in style. Not that David Chase writes Mad Men, but the people who worked under him at The Sopranos have certainly emulated and inherited his serio-comic tone.
