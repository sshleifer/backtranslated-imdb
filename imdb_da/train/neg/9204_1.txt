I've seen this movie many times (and recently read the book on which the movie is based) and every time I see it, I'll just beat all four of them. The fact that they do not suggest that Tom Hank's character flips into his D&D (oops M & M) :) persona ("Oh, he only acts in character.") Outside the game session. That and the fact that after three months of therapy, let's just destroy everything and feed his delusions! These kinds of people are what gives RPGs a bad name. <br /> <br /> Also the corny 'love ballad' and the music done by 'cat on a piano' and 'stop us if we get too annoying' is almost enough to put your teeth on the edge!
