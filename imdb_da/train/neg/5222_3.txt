This is really a very bad movie. Why? First of all, the story is bad. It's an artificial story that combines all sorts of things that don't make sense. It just seems like a wrong experiment. Second, the actors cannot play in a realistic way. They can't even speak like an actor should. Why did I buy this movie? And what should I do about it now?
