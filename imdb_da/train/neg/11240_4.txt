Unashamedly ambitious sci-fi from Kerry Conran, for whom this is clearly a love work. Unfortunately, it's just not that good. It all starts well enough - with an epic but retained score, a mix of Lucas and Hitchcock style editing and the smooth movie image of a Spielberg. The film also refers to many pulp sci-fi novels, series and films as diverse as The Day The Earth Stand Still, Superman, Metropolis, The Apes Planet, The Iron Giant, Star Wars and The Spy Who Loved Me. The film, however, fails to be as good as any of them for several reasons: The main reason is that it is such a love force, so worried about throwing everything on the screen and creating a brave new world, Conran actually forgets to make a movie. There is little to no excitement, atmosphere or magic offered here despite air battles, dinosaurs and race-to-time set-pieces. Even the noir elements fall flat. This is a broad way to look at things - these elements fail mainly because nothing feels at all genuine and so obviously fake - the green screen just looks like a video game half the time, and it is obvious that the actors have been sticking on afterwards. The actors don't get much to do either - Jude Law is wood, Gwyneth Paltrow is annoying and stupid, Angelina Jolie is wasted - and that's all because of a horrible script - the kind to explain almost everything. It is a decent experience and some can get a nostalgia feel, but in the end this is a pointless step in the yeast's world. Nice ending though.
