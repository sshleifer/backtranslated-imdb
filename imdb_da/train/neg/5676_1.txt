This movie shows a clip of live animals mutilating an animal getting hacked by a machete and getting its skin ripped off. I know these horrible things happen in the world, but I see movies based on the fact that what I see does not actually happen on the screen. These live animal clips are not intended to be in film. They are meant to show people belonging to particular organizations to help the terrible things that humans need to do to other species. This should be banned and destroyed. I have also contacted Netflix and other resources to collaborate on getting this movie out of the market !! <br /> <br /> This movie must be removed from the public. The person who made this movie needs psychological help.
