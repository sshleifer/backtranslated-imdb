It's the only movie I've ever gone on. bad action - bad plot - poor casting - poor conducting - bad movie - if they had set out to make a bad picture, they could not have done a better job. I hope they are proud of their turkey. I am surprised that anyone associated with this movie was ever recruited in Hollywood. do not waste your time!
