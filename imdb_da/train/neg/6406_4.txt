An update of sketches and jokes you would have seen on a burlesque scene in the first half of the 20th century. It is a series of several jokes done. Some of them you can tell your grandmother, some of them, but it's a pretty safe bet she's heard them all before. For what it tries to be, it's not that bad. Before you rent it, keep in mind that it is an older type of entertainment and has more value as a story than comedy or titillation. Robin Williams has a few, but he is interchangeable with the other players.
