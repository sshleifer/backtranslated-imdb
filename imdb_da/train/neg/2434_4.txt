Realistic movie, surely, except the fact that the characters don't seem to be scared. When Billy Zane tries to kill someone, he feels bad ... but he doesn't seem to. Therefore, I do not like his performance in this movie. Tom Berenger again plays a soldier. No good excitement, realistic sequences. Not always shooting, that's a good thing. Well filmed. I hate the helicopter sequence because only one terrorist kills almost the entire seabed ... I give it ** and a half out of *****
