This movie does not age well. Maybe it's just the effective and artificial characterization, action and management we've seen with The Sopranos, but I've just seen Prizzi's Honor for the first time on DVD alone. <br /> <br /> The experience of seeing it with an audience 24 years ago must have been completely different, but I have to say I was just shaken to the end. Not just the violence in it, but just the idea that it would somehow be a satisfactory ending. I enjoy a good shocker, but it seemed so out of character ... Also, when was this movement supposed to be stated? The cars all looked as if they were from the 1960s, and yet the World Trade Center towers (completed in 1973) were clearly visible in many cityscapes. <br /> <br /> Another way in which the film has been older at age is just an idea that a passenger could travel coast to coast with a knife on his person. <br /> <br /> Somehow, the mid-1980s found the audience this movie charming and fun. In the mid-eighties, meet the late moves: Only of you can live.
