After watching a heavily censored version of this movie two years ago, I was curious to see the unedited version. I was surprised that it was more credible and well-acted than I remembered, but one thing really stood out. I think other reviewers have mentioned this too, namely what is the nature and motivation of Chris Sarandon's character? Has he raped other victims before? Is he totally psychotic or an "average" sociopath? How did he expect to get away with his attack on the younger sister? Is this character credible at all, or is it just a matter of more background being needed? At the same time, he seems to be an uncomfortably credible sign and too wild to actually hold onto a teacher's job that puts him in touch with young vulnerable girls. This seems to be the biggest complaint of the viewers in general. It has nothing to do with his performance, which is terribly convincing. The film occupies an uneasy attitude between pure exploitation and half-way serious treatment of the subject without completely familiarizing itself with both conditions. Not the worst movie ever made, but also not so good.
