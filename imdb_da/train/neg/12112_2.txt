I can't believe I wasted my time with this movie. I couldn't even call it a movie. It was so bad with nothing to recommend it. <br /> <br /> I like low budget movies and weird flicks, but this one saddened me. Poorly made and bad plays ruined it from being curious. You have to wonder what these people thought when they spent money producing this movie. I wonder what I was thinking of seeing it to the end. I recommend this movie to anyone. How did they release this? Was there an audience who likes this kind of movie? There must be because you can find this at almost any video store. But why? <br /> <br /> Deserves to be forgotten. <br /> <br /> If you like bad movies, then that's for you.
