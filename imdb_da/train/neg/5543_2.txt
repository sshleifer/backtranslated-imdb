Seriously, I absolutely love these old movies and their simplicity, but I just looked for the first time last night, and it struck me easily in my bottom five of all times. Was it supposed to be about the love story or the zombies ??? This movie was so bad that after it was merciful, all I could do was laugh at how ridiculous it was. Luckily, I'm for anal to turn off a movie without seeing the whole thing, or I wouldn't be able to brag about seeing this all the way through in a meeting! I like to think that something positive can be said about everything in life, so in accordance with this theory I will recognize the film's most positive asset, it was very short for a full-length movie.
