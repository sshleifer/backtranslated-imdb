Cybil Richards leads another full moon / surrender cinema masterpiece of eroticism. This time Jacqualine Lovell (dressed in the right pick up silver outfit) is tasked with destroying all signs of sexual activity. But she can't resist seeing the tapes, and she likes them. Gender scenes are well filmed and set to a great soundtrack (at least for this kind of movie). The cast is pretty much awful and mostly very average too. Jacqueline Lovell is her exceptionally attractive self and between watching the sex files, she manages to exhibit her breast and fumble a little downstairs. She also fits into a small lesbian activity. To be honest, Lovell deserves so much better than this kind of fare. Here she looks great naked, but is actually much more appealing in her silver cloth that tells the "drama. Absolutely nonsense film with Lovell and soundtrack are the only real redemption features. Mediocre even for Surrender's output and clearly a new budget low for them too.
