This remake of the original 1962 movie has some very good parts to praise it and some fine performances from some fine actors - but Scorsese chooses towards the end for the most formal plotings and an embarrassed overloaded shakespeare that had me watching clock. <br /> <br /> DeNiro is a great actor, dedicated to giving him everything in the work he does, but he needs direction to focus on his talent and it lacks much in the last five minutes of the movie . <br /> <br /> Gregory Peck's como is useful but nothing more, while Robert Michum is always fun to watch, even with as few lines as this. <br /> <br /> Nick Nolte gets better performance than Lorenzo's Oil, but is not in the same shape as "weeds". Joe Don Baker has some amazing lines, while Juliette Lewis once again shows that the talent sometimes skips a generation. <br /> <br /> Some good points? The starting credits (!), The first view of Cody is back when you make dips in prison, the scene where Cody is attacked with baseball bats, Sam Bowd's decent in full-fledged panic, Cody's outwardly quiet but unpleasant prescence. <br /> <br /> The worst? "Cleaning woman - BUT NOT REALLY !!!" part. Clinging just-handed to the underside of a car for a hundred miles at high speed. (Is there no speedhead in the US?) "He's dead - but not really !!!" partS and the above-mentioned wandering end. <br /> <br /> I can see the original again, but I have yet to tempt myself to see the remake of four years ago to watch it.
