The author describes an "exploration" of his "roots" in the southern tobacco industry because he believes that the (completely and deservedly forgotten) movie "Bright Leaf" is about an ancestor of his. It is not, and he actually does not discover any equally mild interest in this stupid and self-reliant glorious home video suitable for screening at the (director's) drunken family reunions, but certainly not for commercial or even non-commercial publishing. A good reminder of why most independent films are not fetched by major studies - because they are boring, irrelevant and without interest to anyone, but the director and his / her immediate circles. Avoid at all costs!
