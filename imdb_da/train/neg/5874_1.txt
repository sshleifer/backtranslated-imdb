one of the worst movies I've seen to date. Pathetic action scene and really bad acting also doesn't help. The only good point is Gary Busey's share, but it doesn't lift the movie much. It lives up to its B-movie ranking and delivers the flying color test. Wasting my money even though I found entertaining to begin with, it gets annoying after a couple of hours. I do not recommend this movie unless you see it for free or it is a gift. (A gift you can request for a receipt and return to a full refund). <br /> <br /> Really BAD. <br /> <br /> 1/10.
