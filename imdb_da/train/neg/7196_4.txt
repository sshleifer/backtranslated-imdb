Inspector GADGET (1999) ** <br /> <br /> Starring: Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Andy Dick, Dabney Coleman Director: David Kellogg 80 minutes Rated PG <br /> <br /> By Blake French : <br /> <br /> Disney's new movie, "Inspector Gadget" is about a politician named John, who survives a major accident and is rescued by a state-of-the-art experimental operation that makes him a robotic agent as an agent has tools and contradictions of all kinds built into his body when he uses when he says "Go Go" only to be called the Inspector Gadget! The actual film's structure is much like the body's formation of the Inspector Gadget himself. It is noisy, fragmented, energetic and consists of a bunch of half-hearted contraptions thrown together to do something that doesn't have much in common with anything else present. The film is basically a series of zany action sequences that are a bit sticky with characters and an uneven story that only children between 6 and 9 years old would enjoy. <br /> <br /> The dramatically reinvented police have been played by Matthew Broderick, who until the "Inspector Gadget" was successfully spree with movies like "Elections." His character becomes Inspector Gadget after a meeting with the movie's heavy hands called Claw. He is played by Rupert Everett, who has already experienced disaster this year with the terrible "William Shakespeare's Midsummer Night Dream." <br /> <br /> There is a romantic subplot in this movie as well as abundant amounts of scenes involving Inspector Gadget are crazy body parts and mechanical elements. It has the Gadget and Claw drooling over the attractive character Brenda, played by Joely Fisher, for both her appearance and her knowledge of a particular invention from her late father, who was previously killed by Claw. The competition is evolving into battle scenes and a reason for many happenings in the film. Also a big sign is the Gadget Mobile, a life like car that is designed for the Inspector Gadget itself. It is stated by D.L. Hughly from the sitcom comedy "The Hughly's." <br /> <br /> "Inspector Gadget" is a movie I found pretty bad. I know I'm not exactly a target audience for the filmmakers, but even my ten-year-old relative found the movie his disliking. The movie is full of various errors and obvious problems. I never found myself worried about the characters. There is no mood development beyond some nice opening credits, as opposed to the much worse 1997 movie, "Mr. Magoo," which was opened using clips of the original cartoon. Is it too much to ask for the same type of thing in this comedy - which is rarely fun and hardly convincing. The overall production design is nothing but a mess of incomplete syntax and consists of a joke: Inspector Gadget's bumbling goofiness. <br /> <br /> In movies like this, the audience wants borders - something to help find out what can happen and what can't. In "Inspector Gadget" there are no such limits. This is certainly no more than a party time for the actors, who surly had a lot of fun. I am reminded of another lack of comedy published some years ago called "Blankman", which again contained lots of props and energy, and the actors certainly had fun time with all the gizmos and props, but it also lacked something for every movie: audience participation . <br /> <br /> A sign that I found is omitted is Gadget's daughter, who at the end of the movie still has no idea what she's called. She used only as a plot unit - and I question how she was used to promoting the plot as well. For her presence, nothing relevant or productive brings to the film. We never know her reactions to her father's operation or accidents. Thus, it is a person who could be completely omitted and would not have affected the film a little. <br /> Finally, I would like to say that "Inspector Gadget" is a terrible, insufficient excuse for a children's comedy. And believe it or not, I find myself comparing this movie with last year's violent and very anti-young audience action picture "Blade." I say once again that I much preferred a movie where nothing happens than one where everything happens. "Inspector Gadget" had so much to do for it at the same time, it literally made me dizzy. <br /> <br />
