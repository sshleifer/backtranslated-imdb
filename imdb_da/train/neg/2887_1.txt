I just watched this movie today, and it's not only terrible and terrible, but it seems that the director just got some friends together to make a movie about a sick man. I also think this movie has the appearance of a porn video with the clear, sharp, just filmed view. <br /> <br /> Bring Sky I work in a video store and I didn't have to pay for it because this movie is crap x infinite .. DO NOT BUY OR CLEAN THIS MOVIE !!!!! You would have a better time watching Dude Where's my car than this piece of shit! And that doesn't say much for that movie either. <br /> <br /> The action is miserable and the movie is just very unwatchable. I watched this movie and I wanted to kill myself during and after the movie. <br /> <br /> I went home and threw up after seeing this piece of dirt film, I took a bath and burned my clothes. <br /> <br /> If I had a half mind, I would take the film outside and also burn it because no one would be exposed to it ... yes maybe members of Al Queda .. especially those we have in custody and also kills who are in prison on the outlook with out parole .... just make a set like a clock work Orange, and then force the cheese head to see it again and again.
