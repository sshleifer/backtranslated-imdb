This long wind movie turns out to be less about Berkowitz and his impact on NYC, but more about painting caricatures from a particular group of Italian-Americans, known locally as "Guidos". The problem is that "Guidos" is uninteresting, no matter what kind of story or setting they are immersed in. They are already living caricatures, so Lee only reinforces them, rather than just depicting them. <br /> <br /> When someone has caricature done by themselves, they don't go home and say, "Hey, let's make your ears and nose even bigger!" That's what Lee did in this movie. The most interesting characters in the movie are the two (Adrian Brody and Jennifer Esposito) who want to escape the "Guido" lifestyle. Top it with an uninteresting story for the characters, especially John Leguizamo, and you get a good movie to fall asleep at. Especially considering the long term. Another strike against it: For anyone who proclaims to be a Yankees fan and has grown up in New York, Spike Lee should know how to spell Phil Rizzuto, which is misspelled in closing credits.
