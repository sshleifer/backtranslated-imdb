Who ever wrote the two or three glowing reviews was either involved in the production of this movie, the term used loosely or bankroll, and if the latter were to be the case, I would have my seven dollars back! The actors, again terms used loosely, are horrible, in fact almost none of them ever did anything again, which is a relief. The landscape and all about this scream, we had 7 dollars to work with and a day to do it. Was this filmed in any backyard? Everything about this project says low budget. The players at best were the D list. Don't waste your time unless of course you will take it back and try to get the rent back. The leading bad guy is similar to the punk of the 70's show, which ended up getting married to his grandmother dummee moore. My local blockbuster video store lists this as the movie most returned with sad comment attached. Even as a 99 cent rent, this flick gathers dust. Someone must really have washed some favors. This is a super stinker and I give it 10 turds.
