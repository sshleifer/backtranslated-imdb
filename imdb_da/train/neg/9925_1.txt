This was on the 30th anniversary DVD for Blazing Saddles, even brilliant, but not this. Nowhere did I see Mel Brooks name here, and I can guess why, he has much more meaning not to be associated with this pilot. My gawd, who would find it fun. Sure there may be a running problem, but for me it just wasn't fun, because it simply isn't fun. It's as if the authors didn't even try to be fun, just to pay for being tied to Blazing Saddles. Do they expect this show to run in several seasons when they made this pilot? Flat out, they didn't care. It was a quick cash cow who thanked God not paid out. I think it's useful only for historical purposes, or only to demonstrate how stupid and imaginative Hollywood writers can be.
