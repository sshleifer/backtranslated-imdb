Not one of the better pokemon films. <br /> <br /> Two legendary pokemon come into history. You will see how strong Celebi can be, even if he becomes evil first. <br /> <br /> Suicune also looks like he wasn't that powerful. <br /> <br /> Didn't the Marauder do I don't have many strong pokemones, except for the taranitar? Some battle scenes with his pokemon may have made it better. Ash and Pikachu meet the much younger Professor Oak, even though they are not aware of it. Misty I thought had it in the end, but she didn't come close. I saw this in the credits. <br /> <br /> Don't expect much here, the worst of the series so far.
