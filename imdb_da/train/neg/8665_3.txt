This is a low budget Roger Corman horror / creature flick. A DinoCroc is created when manipulation of prehistoric genes runs amok. A manipulated croc first kills one of his own and gets the human taste and becomes a fast growing terror after escaping. None of the characters have any depth, but then they are not the focal point. We only get a few glimpse of the huge two-legged dinosaur descendant and some of the best "kill" scenes in a small budget film. My favorite scene is a moronic character trying to use three legged dogs for bait and become croc food itself. Nothing left on the pier, but ankle upper feet. With no real stand out: Jane Longendecker, Bruce Weitz and Charles Napier. Most pathetic is Matt Borlenghi and an unpleasant professional crookman Costas Mandylor. I was most impressed with the prolonged Joanna Pacula when the respectfully feared Dr. P. DINOCROC is redeeming like a crock of pickles.
