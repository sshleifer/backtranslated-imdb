This movie is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror movies that are simply not fully realized. There are two routes to take in horror movie: You don't really explain what is going on (or who the killer is like in Texas Chainsaw Massacre) or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so everything is explained (Halloween may be an example of this) . <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Creep fails in this area. I see absolutely no reason to give a little piece of back story to Craig without completely capturing the essence of his character or his motivation. No sign is fully realized, though the Catholic character of Kate's character in the movie is the most successful part of the story. Ultimately, this story is mostly unmotivated, and none of the performances gives it the necessary life to make it captivating or interesting enough to overcome the lack of coherence and empty film making that pulls down the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie will go down like another example of a movie (like most people) It could be so much better, even if it would never be good. The only thing that was used correctly in the film was the setting: the characters, the story, the direction and the general writing would have benefited from a serious facelift. Creep serves a purpose as a thoughtless, stupid horror movie without intellectual or emotional investment, but unfortunately it is about it ...
