Not exactly my genre, this straight-to-DVD street fight action is one I only encountered because of a friend putting it on while we had a few beers. I'm relatively open-minded, and quite a fan of Eamonn Walker, so I sat back ready to enjoy myself. <br /> <br /> Blood and Bone are the story of Isiah Bone, an ex-con who becomes a street fighter for blurry reasons that gradually unfold as the film progresses. Blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> What a dull movie. I understand that movies like this do not rely heavily on plot, but do they have in such stupid, predictable, and completely stupid history? It may not be important but by golly chewing gum it annoys me. Better no plot and pure action than a sound-ride fleabag mongrel of a story. Infused with completely unfounded and unachieving sentimental drivel, it is the cinematic equivalent of a thinly shiny turkey filled with rotten indards. At this point I should probably mention what is, of course, the film's drawing point: the fighting. Even in itself, the fighting is rather poor. Bone manages to get out of well-established hard street fighters in single punches (a big oaf or two is the filmmakers' wonderful attempt to rectify this inconsistency); fighters who never seem to conclude that attacking one by one is a foolish trick. Even this is repetitive and stupid, arms broken and faces kicked with a steady alacrity that we will see again and again. <br /> <br /> A run of the mill, movie-to-century movie, which fully deserves its equal to DVD status, does absolutely nothing new and everything we have seen over and over again. And not even very well.
