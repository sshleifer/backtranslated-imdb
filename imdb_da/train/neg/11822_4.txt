I thought Harvey Keitel, a young, fresh from Sex Pistol John Lydon, so a bonus, the music of Ennio Morricone. I was expecting an old-school, edgy, Italian cop thriller that was made in America. Instead, I got a mishmash story that never made sense and a movie that left me saying: WTF !!! Too many unanswered questions and not enough action. The result: A potential cult classic was flushed down the toilet. Keitel and Lydon work well together so maybe Quentin Tarantino can reunite these guys with better script. Oh, and the Morricone score: OK, but not memorable. <br /> <br /> All in all, don't waste time but not a "must see" unless you're a hardcore Keitel fan.
