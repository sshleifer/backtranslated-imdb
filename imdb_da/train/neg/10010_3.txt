Plot is not worth discussing, though it suggests corruption, murder, power and the rest of thriller-related issues. Characters are interesting, but sometimes. Not realistic, but interesting anyway. <br /> <br /> Development is slow as a tea ceremony. Visuals not anesthetic, but good enough to ease eye strain. Good movie to watch for dinner before going to bed - nothing shocking too much, nothing over-exploring. Movie sitcom style. <br /> <br /> I liked Woody - excellent performance. Had to fight for plot inadequacy and did the job pretty well. The rest is tolerable, but very predictable. The whole can be seen and better than most TV shows.
