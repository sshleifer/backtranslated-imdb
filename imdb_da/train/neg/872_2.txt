First of all, I expected "Caged Heat" to be the same as "Ilsa, The Wicked Warden". Boy, was I wrong! By no means is this movie's 70s exploitation, "chix in chains" or "women in prison". Of course, the plot consists of a bunch of women in the prison who wear street clothes btw (rather comic), but nothing happens. <br /> <br /> There are no strong rivals, no one is trying to seduce the guard or doctor to try to escape, and no inmates do. There are 2 shower scenes that I suppose are just recycled materials, but no fights break out / no one is seduced here - or anywhere for that matter! Aside from the lack of plot, unconvincing, unsympathetic and flat characters, a few inmates who manage to escape have actually returned to the prison to "release" their fellow prisoners ?? !! <br /> <br /> PUH-LEASE, the movie should just end with the escapees that ride out into the sunset ... as opposed to letting this mess continue! <br /> <br /> I feel scammed.
