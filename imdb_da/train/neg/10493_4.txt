A difficult movie to categorize. I never gave the 110% concentration and thus just as simple as the plot seemed. I couldn't quite say who did what among the American FBI characters and what their roles were. I also couldn't take Irwins seriously as movie characters, as their lines and scenes were similar to one of his shows, not done. <br /> <br /> This is nothing more than a glorified episode of the Discovery TV show, with a largely insignificant sub-drawing that just seemed to get in the way. But as any Irwin show is always worth seeing, this movie is also worth a visit, but not on Christmas Day. Talk about which I have better things to do than to be here. <br /> <br /> A high 4/10
