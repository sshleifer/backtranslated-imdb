Almost two people play, and as such, the dialogue and the notion of the leaders will be important. It is also not very good. This might have been stronger, in fact, if it had first been designed as a top-person game, and then worked into a movie. Anyway, an insidious vampire that seems a little autistic, gets horrified by a stripper (due to watching too much porn in his crappy home). He would like her to tell him about the daylight. He would have been better off finding someone with a day job or someone who distinguished himself by painting a picture with words like a poet, but then they cannot have a warm bid. When he gets her doing what he wants (and he's not terribly good at it), he intends to feed her at 6 o'clock, after which the sun rises. Much is made of this deadline, even though he also says he can go without feeding, it will just make him hungry. In addition, he claims that he cannot let the strip go when she knows about him, but he lets a number of other people go and learn what he is. There are many inconsistencies. Why this vampire chooses to live in a house so badly on board that the light from streetlamps and neighboring buildings closes as if it were daytime, I'm not sure. With all the time in the world, you think he would have done a better job, or fix the place up a bit. He is clearly not a wealthy vampire. This is apparently a remake, and I'm curious to see the original version of this, Dance of the Damned. Although it was directed by Cat Shea and the other films she directed to Corman (Stripped to Kill, StK II), it was pretty bad.
