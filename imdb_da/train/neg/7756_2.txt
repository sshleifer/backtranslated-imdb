I remember seeing ATTACK when it first came out and caught it again recently. The Sci channel has run poorer, but not much. A shameless ripoff of Jurassic Park, ATTACK replaces sabertooth cats for dinosaurs. And they are loose and devour as many extras as possible. CGI is pretty bad, and close-ups of prosthetic cat heads are ridiculous. We get a little gore, which helps a little. Wait until you see how the evil scientist who started this whole mess gets it. Apart from Robert Carradine, who has very little to do, is thrown unknown. Apparently this shot was in Fiji. Good work if you can get it. Reminds me of all the low-budget monster STVs that were popular in the 80s and 90s.
