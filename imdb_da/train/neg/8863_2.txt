Howling II (1985) was a complete 180 from the first film. While the first movie was campy and creepy. The other was limp and cheesy. The production values ​​of this are pretty bad, and the play is terrible. Anchor woman brother werewolf from part 1 wants to find out what has happened to his sis'. "Scene" from the first movie was poorly restored. A skinny plain looking woman accompanies the bridge '(Reb Brown) to the old country (Romania) to uncover the mystery of her sister's murder / transformation / death. Christopher Lee occasionally appears and disappears as a sage / guide to the two. Sybil Danning and her two largest assets appear as Stirba, Romania's overwhelming werewolf. She also suffers from a bad case of morning face, ewww! <br /> <br /> Bad movie. There is nothing good about this stink. I'm surprised Philippe Mora directed this picture because he is usually a good film producer. The movie is so dark that you need a flashlight to see it (no, not the content but the movie itself). To round out the movie, you get a miserable "punk" performance from a Damned wannabe "Babel". Maybe if they forked over a few extra bucks, they could get the right deal instead of an imitation. <br /> <br /> The best thing to avoid unless you are desperate or you lost the remote control and you're too lazy to change the channel.
