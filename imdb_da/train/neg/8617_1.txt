After seeing 10 minutes of this movie, I was confused after seeing for 30 minutes my toes were curling - I simply couldn't believe it: the movie is really awful. In fact, it's so awful that I had to see everything just to be convinced (!). During this I realized that it reminded me of a bunch of Danish so-called comedies from the 60s and 70s. The pattern is as follows: Take an extremely popular comedian, make a script that puts this comedian in as many grotesque situations as possible, adding a bunch of jokes (especially one-liners) and crossing it with a pair of beautiful young girls - film it, and you are successful! I didn't want to know if this movie was a success, but unlike the Danish tradition that died quietly (with a few fantastic comedians), it seems that there is a market for this kind of film in the US.
