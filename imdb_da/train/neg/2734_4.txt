But let's look at it ... It's got some nostalgic sugar out of me. The view is just so consistently great that it is allowed to get a few hiccups. I get a new season and just power through them as I have 2 days to live. I like the idea of ​​wrapping it up, but it was much more of a season ending that would explain the following: <br /> <br /> Dr.Cox shouldn't be bothered by a few more episodes, only explanation I can think of that they changed the rotation of the episode or had to resume the start. <br /> <br /> And my friends why hell cox is bald. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the show is amazing ... bring on the seventh season.
