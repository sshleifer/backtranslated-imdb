Annie's wig doesn't look good. she is not sweet and handsome enough to play annie Annie sticks out in the movie, as her outfits look like halloween costumes. horrible plays and terrible plots. This movie is such a change from the 1982 version. I think a younger and smaller girl should have played the lead. Ashley Johnson depicts a very boyish Annie. Not appealing at all. At least, the director played it right with Daddy Warbucks. Mrs. Hannigan was also mistaken. Camilla Belle played Molly okay. "Warning" this movie can offend your IQ so you can only show it to very young children. 8 and younger. Some of the plots are too fictitious and could hardly take place in the real world.
