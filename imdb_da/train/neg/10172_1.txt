When I saw that Noah Wyle and Ricky Schroder were in the same movie, I was like, scor! I admit I was eager to watch the movie. And I have to say that the first fifteen minutes or so was nostalgic in a way. Then it all went down the hill. I didn't expect to be a dump of politically correct civil rights mumbo jumbo. They took all sorts of controversial issues and threw it in a stupid story. I was appalled that Noah was involved in some of that kind, especially his role. No one with a fully functioning brain would actually accept all that shot at the Vietnam War. If anyone really wants to know how Communism was, sit down and read a book about it. And not one who praises it or opposes it, just the cold hard facts. I only saw a few scenes here and there just because I wanted to see Ricky's body, but that was all that interested me. Everything else about this movie annoyed me.
