This bomb is only an 'explosion' after another, without humor and only absurd situations. Really, pyrotechnics to the extreme. The reality is not one of its strong points. I give it a 1 out of 10. I would have made it a zero, but this option was not allowed. Sorry, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles. But then at times we all need money. And I still recoil by Tim Burton farce about Mars. Nicholson was brave enough to admit it was a turkey. But if it was a turkey, this movie is not even a sneak. I wish I could say, "Give me back my money". You can bet I would if I could. But this is the inconvenience of premium services, the subscription variety.
