For me, this movie just seemed to fall on the face. The biggest problem for me was the casting of Glover as a serial killer. I don't know if it comes out of castings or simply his behavior, but I doubt that Glover could ever portray a convincing villain. He is a good guy, and it is always evident in his beliefs. Apart from that, the movie is your driving of the mill's serial killer story. Nothing very innovative.
