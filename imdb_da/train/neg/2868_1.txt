This is actually an insult to the victims and their families of the BTK killer. The events in this movie are not even close to the truth. Why they couldn't make a movie of the real events makes no sense as the real events are more interesting as it made farce. Don't waste your time watching this for free. Low budget and a shameful depiction of the events that should not be made a joke, which really is what this film did. If they would allow me to give a -10 to this movie I would. The action sucked and it seems that it was shot on an old VHS video camera from the 80s. Save time and money by not watching this movie.
