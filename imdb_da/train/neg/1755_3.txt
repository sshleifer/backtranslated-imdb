This film is not devoid of charm and also shows a bit of warmth, but ultimately this effort is in vain and too strongly focused on the leaders. There is no doubt that Mary Tyler Moore knows what to do with her entire screen time, but she takes too much of the spotlight away from the rest of the casting. Another problem is overloading the script with clich√©s. The daughter, who secretly falls out of college, an elderly woman who finds it hard to get a good job (and only ends up with a just degrading work), the shabby network director with her executive toys that go for glitz over fabric the journalist who stands up for her beliefs, etc. There is nothing really wrong with any of these, ie. they are all firmly rooted in reality, but in combination they are just too much and leave us too much deja-vu and too few surprises.
