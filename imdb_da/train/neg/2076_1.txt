Now I have to say that this is probably the worst movie I've seen this year! The jokes were extremely raw (didn't expect it as PG movies) (Rated PG in Canada) and they weren't fun! With this big throw I had at least expected some good actors, but I didn't even get that. I am a great Rainn Wilson fan and this is the first time I was extremely disappointed with his performance. Neither Luke Wilosn nor Uma Thurman's characters are at least as good, and I could really have looked less, what happened to any of them. I didn't expect it at all as before, I've really seen other movies by this director (eg, six days, seven nights). This movie was not worth $ 10, it cost me, and I strongly encourage you not to watch this movie. I guarantee you will be like me and beg for this movie to be over.
