Well, EYEboy, I have to say that I'm glad no one stops when someone singles me out and tries to make fun of me, especially when someone is as intelligent as you do. My favorite part of your post was "But no big bang-bang good guy, bad here, kimosabe. I suggest you stick to movies with lota bang bang." <br /> <br /> Well said! I like action movies, especially if they are well done, but I also like movies that do not have many actions as long as they are well done. I'm sorry, but Secret's and Lies don't fit in this category and are simply a very bad movie. I really don't see many non-American movies, so maybe I was pampered and didn't understand how bad foreign films really were when I saw Secrets and Lies. Perhaps if I judge foreign films with a different standard, today I could see how Secrets and Lies might be one of the highest rated films on IMDB. Hmm ... If true, it's very scary. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Barger bits@midohio.net (new email)
