SCREAMING SKULL (1 out of 5 stars) This movie boasts some beautiful, cool opening credits (an offscreen narrator warns that movie classics will be offered a free funeral if they die of scare and watch this movie, a scary shot of a skull that comes out of a quiet pool and the ubiquitous scary music), but unfortunately the movie is downhill from there. A widowed man takes his new bride to his secluded mansion ... unites his servants and friends that the new wife has a very fragile disposition because of a tragedy in her past. Well, in no time does she begin to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can do. Her husband assures her that it is only in her thoughts and ... well, you can probably see where all this goes. You've figured out what's going on long before our unlucky heroine ... because you've probably seen the same plot in hundreds of other movie and TV shows (and done better too). To add to the film's countless violations, most cuts in this movie (on many cheap DVD compilations) seem to lack a few key scenes. You see the heroine slowly walking toward the window ... she goes to open it ... you know she's going to see something scary ... and then ... suddenly the scene cuts to her in her husband's arms. So what did she see ??? I think we never know.
