This is a horrid disaster of a movie. From the beginning to the end, it is filled with bad acting and even worse direction and editing. The only redeeming parts of the movie are a few songs by Streisand, because the Kristofferson parts are impossible to see or listen to. The main problem with this film is that we never see Kristofferson's character at his height or Streisand's character battle. The first one should be seen in decline and the second increase. The final Streisand number could have been one of the biggest finals in film if it was corrected and edited correctly. The single framed shot of her face in song duration was a terrible mistake. Had the band, audiences and wide-ranging shots from the scene appeared, this song could have been dynamic and interesting. This movie must have been edited and edited by a NYU movie school dropout. The only thing worse can be the miserable manuscript. The final musical number is the only redeeming part of this movie, and even that is totally hit by abused technical decisions.
