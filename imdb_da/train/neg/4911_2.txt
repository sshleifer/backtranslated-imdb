First to die 2003 <br /> <br /> I admit my mistake first: I didn't understand that this was a made for TV movie. I was "thrown away" by the "R" certification. The reason is strong, but the film is about 40 minutes too long. The direction and continuity were excellent. For the most part, the cast was unique and did a great job with their characters. The bottom of the movie is that it definitely falls into the "chick flick" genre. Although there are some violent scenes, none of the violence should require an "R" rating. There are no nudity or free sex scenes. In fact, there are no sex scenes. Ona Grauer (who is absolutely beautiful), Kristina Copeland, Sonya Salomaa and Glynis Davies were all guests of the SG-1 series, but this movie did nothing to promote their career as they were all used as low-entertaining actresses. Robert Patrick was great as he usually is, and Mitch Pileggi made me think of a modern Lee Marvin. The very talented Megan Gallagher, whom I came to respect as an actor during the millennium, got nothing challenging to show her range of abilities. The biggest disappointment with the cast was Tracy Pollan. Apart from being a below average actress and not very attractive, her voice is absolutely annoying. I found myself damping the TV during the dialogue. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the Lifetime TV program. I would not recommend paying any money to watch this movie though. Considering that I didn't find anything that would cause censorship, it's a movie worthy of watching only television, as nothing will be cut out. As a television movie I would rate this as a 5 out of 10. As a feature film with an "R" certification and as a strong cast, I rate it as 2 out of 10.
