I remember reading all the horrible, horrible reviews for this movie when it came out. I meant to see how terrible it was, but it was out of theaters in three weeks. The only other movie to handle is Gigli. <br /> <br /> When the movie came out on DVD, I bought it to see how awful it was. I couldn't think of the pure terrible attention that this movie was getting was possible. After seeing it, I can understand it. <br /> <br /> Let me first say that this movie is not without some great shots. There is a good shot in the beginning that shows a ball being fired from the gun, which I thought was nice. And the way the monsters in this movie die is so cool to look at; but it gets old after the first time you see it. <br /> <br /> Let me start with the worst in this movie: Tara Reid. If bad acting was a pity, Hell would have beaten Tara Reid right out of the way since she's so incredibly horrible in this movie, it is unthinkable. And of all roles she plays a curator. Now if she played a stupid, empty-headed sex toy, then I might forgive her for how she treats her character. Apparently, Uwe Boll didn't understand that even though he seemed to think that if she took her shirt from the movie, people would see it. He just didn't realize getting her doing it in the middle of the movie in the absolute wrong moment just made the movie even more hilarious. And is it a Mexican song or something during the dry humping? I couldn't tell. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to my next complaint: Uwe Boll shows some of the worst instructional skills you'll ever see in a movie. I think I would give House of the Dead an F (and I only do very few movies), but HotD would score at least one B in relation to this screwed piece of junk. The movie starts with a very, very long story that causes instant confusion (and is read by a terrible narrator) and from there, the cuts are really, really stupid. There is a point where Slater and Reid look around a building that has been destroyed and the screen darkens. When it comes back, Slater and Reid shoot everywhere, and suddenly an entire army has joined them. Huh? <br /> <br /> And anyone didn't disturb the error of this movie. At some point a team breaks through glass, but the glass breaks down before they touch it. Tara Reid's earrings change colors in the middle of a scene, and after Slater goes away from a dead buddy, you can see her start standing up. <br /> <br /> As for history ... I was really lost. Something about an old tribal publishing darkness and someone "opens the path" or something and all the evil monsters jump out. It's just an excuse to have many gun scenes (the technology is so advanced here that no character ever needs to be reloaded in this movie) that simply carries. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie and hoped to laugh at how incredibly stupid it was. I didn't laugh, but I still think it's stupid. Very, very, very stupid.
