I had always been a great Lynda Carter-Wonder Woman fan, so when the Sci-Fi Channel ran this movie, I had to watch it. I was bitterly disappointed. This is a Wonder Woman movie in the name. She doesn't wear real costume [she must have refused or had ordered big changes] and the plot runs like a poor man's James Bond. There is none of the things that made the cartoon heroine a success, ie. the superhuman strength or the determined will. It's just a long bad dream. I don't even think Cathy is all that attractive anyway. I wouldn't waste your time on this.
