A film about Harlem Renaissance and especially a writer. It contrasts it with a modern story of a young, gay, black artist. <br /> <br /> If that sounds vague, it's because the movie itself is. It is well-oriented, fairly well-written and (mostly) well-acted. Also the scenes in the past are shot in moody black and white. This is also one of the few films dealing with gay men who are not shy of sex scenes (not so explicit and no frontal). Yet I hated most of it. <br /> <br /> The movie is meander everywhere, full of unlikely characters (including the protagonist) and (this is the killer) moving at the snail's pace. Three times I considered leaving the theater because I was so bored. But the director was there so I stayed. <br /> <br /> His speech afterwords shows that this was a love work and took 6 years to complete. I really wish I liked this more (there are very few movies that deal honestly with gay blacks), but I can't. Unless you are very interested in the Harlem Renaissance, there is no need to see this.
