There's nothing new here. All standard romantic comedy scenes, even down to the taxi jump to the airport to stop the woman flying away. The only thing that saves this is Alison Eastwood's performance and some of the little characters (blink and you miss Gabrielle Anwar), which of course had fun. <br /> <br /> Turn it off when the couple are in bliss and you don't have to go through the inevitable plot pain.
