I just visited the Russian forum for our TV channel that had shown this movie. Well ... 99 percent of the active Russian audience is disappointed. We wanted to see more true facts about our room performance in this movie. But writers remembered something else ... :( We are big and beautiful country with intelligent people living here. We are proud of all our space dreams, real achievements on the one hand in this area and in science on the other hand. I would like to ask authors: Where is our LUNOHOD? And where, hell our MIR station? Ah? I am absolutely sure that the LUNOHOD events took place far earlier Armstrong's "walk on moon" and to comment on many technical and scientific error - I really have no time and space enough here!
