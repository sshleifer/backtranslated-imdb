I LOVED the apprentice for the first two seasons. <br /> <br /> But now with season 5? (or is it 6?) things just become commonplace for tiring. <br /> <br /> I used to like the show, but it became Donald Trump's own ego party. It went its business you want to work for, but come on! Some of the things saying "you are born" are just insulting. <br /> <br /> After looking at the show, I wouldn't work for him. not because he is arrogant, pompous or so. It's just that the show is unrealistic, and the way he handles things just makes me shatter. Good entertainment? Yeah, but tiring, as the back sticks out so tiring .. it's not teamwork, it's not personal, it's just business. see your backslash.
