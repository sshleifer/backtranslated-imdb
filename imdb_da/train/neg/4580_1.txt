I'm still trying to determine if it's really the worst movie I've ever seen. A very disturbing problem with this movie is that real researchers are interviewed, but their footage has been edited to make it look like they are supporting the ideas of the many Brazilians unfolding this movie. The BS signal ratio between interviews is approx. 10,000 to one - at the end, the interviewees seem to say, "We want you to think !!", but they are too lazy to do simple research on things they claim as facts. <br /> <br /> If you feel that you are open-minded and want to expand your awareness, you must be open-minded enough to read some real-life books on quantum orientation: "Einstein's Universe", Nigel Calder (a slim volume, not a challenge), "The Cosmic Code" by Heinz Pagels. If you can't bring yourself to read a book, don't complain to reviewers about being "open". <br /> <br /> To resume, this movie is just incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> Do you know what is a really good movie that questions reality? "Thirteenth Floor", directed by Roland Emmerich, with Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'onofrio. Smart, sexy, thoughtful.
