As a spiritualist and non-Christian. I thought I would really stick to my faith, but what a strain I see. I thought the movie would have great arguments but only got one-sided views from atheists and Jews ??? And who are all these street people, he interviews who don't know the back of their arm from the head. Where are the right theologians and priests and things he could have got arguments from. Not retired nuts who wrote books and completed their studies in 1970. Personally, this DVD was a waste of time and not worth investigating whether facts are right or wrong or if I should or should not believe because an antichrist told me so. Please believe he came to the conclusion that he did not find God because his own ego and demons got better from him. No, I don't want to say that the movie was great for helping atheists reading this feel better about themselves. But if you really want to show the world you care about us bad souls who believe in Jesus, we then entice you with your worth, not your blows from the drums.
