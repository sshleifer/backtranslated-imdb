This gives away some of the plot, by the way. A Charlie Brown Christmas is one of the timeless classics that teaches you the Christmas value and just enjoys the holidays. However, this does not. It tries to capture the feelings of A Charlie Brown Christmas, there is even another Christmas game, but fails with noisy and light jokes. Charlie Brown no longer wonders about Christmas spirit, but instead wants to buy a gift for Peggy Jean ($ 25 gloves ... what?). His sister Sally is the most annoying character in the movie. Here's one of her jokes: Sally wants to write a letter to Santa but doesn't know how to spell Charlie (for some reason he must be in his letter), so instead decide to call him Sam because she knows how to spell sam. Sally, Sally also plays an angel in the game with one word to day: "Hark!" Instead she says hockey stick (has has). If Sally says hark 12 times (oddly heard exactly the same) don't kill, nothing will. Peppermint Patty and Marcy are a big point of contact, but it hardly makes it any better. Marcy is funny with her answers to Patty, but Patty is another story. She sounds like a boy (who does not condemn the rumors) and becomes angry when she is to be the sheep in the play (horrible boss and all). Apparently, she is the sheep every year and is concerned that she will forget about her lines (lines she does not have). She is so worried she mentions it twice, one right after another and gets the same answer. I suppose she should have short-term memory loss or something. Lucy and Linus are more welcome (although Linus still has annoying advice), but hardly means much air time. I'm sure Schroeder isn't even in this. All in all, it tries to be a parasite to the original, but compromised the message for a few quick laughs.
