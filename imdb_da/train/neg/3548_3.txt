For those who like depressing movies with sleazy characters and a sordid story, this is for you! From the grim New York City atmosphere that comes across as an extremely cloudy and almost hopeless place, to two different lead people without a sense of morality, this movie is a real downer. <br /> <br /> Why it won the Academy Award was because it was so shocking at the time that Hollywood, brand new its freedom to show all the desire with all moral codes left, wanted to celebrate it fact. Filmmakers were like an immature six-year-old with an unlimited expense account with the local candy store. Thus, Hollywood theater viewers (probably for the first time) gave a dose of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, childhood, homeless existence and other such wonderful sights and sounds, only the winding brain would think, are appealing .... and then assigned their work. <br /> <br /> It also hoped I was sure to shock the mainstream audience. Now it succeeded at that level. The audience was stunned by what they say and heard, and the Academy, proud of itself to show dirt and make money at the same time, could not help giving credit to this gilded waste. <br /> <br /> Forty years ago, as a very young man, I also found this movie fascinating. But seeing it again in the 1990s left such a bad taste in my mouth, I never looked to see it again. <br /> <br /> The action was good, but what? Shopping is good in many films. No one has ever said Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight could not act. Hoffman was particularly good at his younger days playing wacked-out people. He was like Johnny Depp from his era, playing guys like "Ratso Rizzo" in this movie and then becoming "Rain Man" later. Yes, "Ratso" is a sign you will never forget, and "Joe Buck" (Voight) is one you will forget, but the story is so sordid, it overwhelms the fine actor. <br /> <br /> This movie is not "art" and it is not worthy of its many awards; It only pushes the envelope a great deal of time in 1969, and so it is so pleasantly remembered in the hearts of the film people and critics. It's two hours of profanity and ultra-sleazy, religious footage, glorious weirdos (Andy Warhol even comes to the record - no surprise) and generally despicable people. <br /> <br /> I liked the captivating song, "Everybody's Talking," which helped make Harry Nilsson famous, but even that was wild, because Fred Neil wrote the song and sang it better before Nilsson did it. ... and few people have ever heard of Neil (which is their loss). And as I said, the name "Ratso Rizzo" is kind of with you! <br /> <br /> The movie is a landmark, but in a negative sense, I fear: this marked it as "official" as Hollywood had gone down the toilet and it has been in the sewer ever since.
