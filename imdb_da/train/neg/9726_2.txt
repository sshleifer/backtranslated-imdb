This is a fascinating horrible movie. It makes little sense that it starts to make some kind of strange internal logic by itself. Well, if it did not continue darting off, it would eventually flounder under the weight of its own indecision. The movie can't think of whether it's a straight-forward 'Man Turns Into Monster' flick (like all the 1950's 'INCREDIBLE insert verb ING MAN' movie) or a horrible big business conspiracy theory movie or a mysterious survival contact story, or ... or what? Choose your choice. It's just a mess. Grotesque over the top and firing in all directions, leaving loose ends flapping everywhere. It was as if Tobe Hooper had taken David Lynch pills. Unfortunately, he did not take enough.
