As Steven Segal's movie, this one is the bottom of the barrel. His best was just feed for bored teenagers. This one speaks the weights and then falls down. The signs are all cardboard. The story is double lame. I can't spoil it by telling you the end. You already know how all Steven Segal movies end if you've seen one. Here goes. He is a super-dooper government agent who knows too much to turn away so they decide, instead of killing him, to dope his brain until he can't remember squats. Of course, he escapes being arrested and is placed by his old general who needs his one man in a million experience to return to a stealth aircraft that has been handed over to a terrorist gang in Afghan chastity by a rogue Air Force pilot who surprises, surprise, Segal trained. All the heroes, except Segal's character and his scary boyfriend, die heroically and Steve-Baby saves the whole world in a bulging jib, or fell. No matter what. Made with some excess Air Force and Navy flying movies. And many bombers. Get some Popeye cartoons instead.
