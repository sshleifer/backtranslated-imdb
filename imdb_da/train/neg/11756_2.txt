Only children under 12 should be allowed to watch this movie. The rest of us have to take a book, MP3 player, or just take a good nap to endure the experience of this event. This can best be summed up as a "blown-up" television movie distributed to theaters. Children would like to watch this movie and they will suffer and be entertained by the movie.
