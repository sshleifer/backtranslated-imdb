Don't care about the movie, the book was better. Does anyone know where it was filmed? *** This was my first visit to your site ... just found the answer to my question. so now i look like a dummy, but i think i will still send my comments. And yes, British Columbia is great *** Or why did it take from its southern Carolina coastal setting? (This question stands) The place was crucial for the substance in the book, and its change was part of my disappointment with the movie. Oh, I just read where to write at least ten lines. Here's my other main problem with the movie. Kim Bassinger was too vapid and not at all what I depicted from the book. I know the book was the book and the movie; well not so good. I found the character in the book much more empathetic. The book also produced rustic, almost primitive pictures of the monastery. While the "castle" in the film was much more visually impressive, it distorted the story and seemed unlike the characters.
