# 1 Vampires vs. People <br /> <br /> # 2 Military-rejecting roughneck squad who first responds to dangerous, unknown vampire attacks. <br /> <br /> # 3 Sexy female vampire on the side of "good guys". <br /> <br /> # 4 Lots of gore and action. <br /> <br /> There are four (4) large plot units that can help you decide if you want to watch this movie. If you want all four, the next plot unit can't deter you ... <br /> <br /> # 5 In outer space. <br /> <br /> The last one got me almost too, but I am glad I saw. In a pile of terribly direct-to-video scare that is the Sci-Fi channel Halloween marathon ... this movie is a breath of fresh air. It will be against any of the other Sci-Fi channel offers, and even against the other vampire movie, Natassia has entered (still giving Uwe Boll money?).
