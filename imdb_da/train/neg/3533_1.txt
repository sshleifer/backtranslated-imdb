Let this movie serve as the death knob for the "big twist" movies of the 1990s. Known in some circles as The Kyser Soze Syndrome, this biographical hand failure has now been made to the death of M. Night Shayamalan, and even Ron Howard used a variation in a beautiful minded. But in REVOLVER, director Guy Ritchie (known in some circles as "Mr. Madonna"), the Soze utilizes the subject in much more obsequious manner. <br /> <br /> Jason Statham (with a very dubious hairline) stars like Jack Green (known to everyone as "Mr. Green.") He may or may not be the criminal mastermind Mr. Gold. Or maybe Mr. Gold an irritable spirit that can possess members of the underworld. I'm not quite sure, but I don't care. REVOLVER is one of the most overwhelmed examples of film surplus, I have had the dissatisfaction to endure for quite some time. Witness the broken time structure, the painful cuts, the incessant inner monologues and the painfully pretentious animated sequence. This "all-kitchen sink" directive style makes Quentin Tarantino's oeuvre look soothing. The cinematic smoke and mirrors only lead me to believe that Ritchie was so boring telling this trite tale when I saw it. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of revelations that seem to be shocking, but they come only as news to Mr. Green. I would like Green as I always enjoy Stratham as a sign, there are two steps ahead of everyone else. Here, however, he fights together as a remedial reader in an English English literature class. His lack of humor is only matched by the lack of restraint shown by his nemesis, Macha (Ray Liotta). Feasting on scenery as a starving man on a smorgasbord, spits Liotta, cries and smokes through the movie in an embarrassing display of overactive and leopard print speedos. <br /> <br /> There are no redeeming qualities for REVOLVER. It is yet another cinematic faux pas from Ritchie and can even overcome his miserable remake of SWEPT AWAY as his worst movie yet.
