What exactly was there during World War II in New Zealand when US forces were there? <br /> <br /> This horrible story of 4 sisters was really pathetic to see. Can you imagine casting Joan Fontaine as Sandra Dee's older sister? Fontaine looked more like her mother. Even more fun was that Fontaine became pregnant in the movie. <br /> <br /> Piper Laurie and Paul Newman, who showed such big screen chemistry 4 years later in "The Hustler", have no scenes in this movie. Laurie plays another sister who goes out to Wellington to step around there, despite being married. Woe to her when her husband returns from the war. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons is a widow and finds romance with a very subdued Paul Newman. There is even romance for the young Miss Dee here. <br /> <br /> The picture has little or no meaning. Are they trying to say that everything is fair in love and war? If they are, they did a bad job of selling this. <br /> <br /> The conflict of interest with Newman and Simmons is quickly disposed of. That's what should have been done quickly on this terribly disappointing 1957 movie.
