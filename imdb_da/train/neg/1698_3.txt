Lynch. The man has some really good things! He knows how to disturb us, so reward us by making us think in different ways. However, this is completely different. Dumbland reward is 1% absurd comedy, earned by lasting 99% stupidity. I might have been due once, but somewhere around episode 4, I just started looking at fast forward. Do not miss a thing. I felt relieved when it ended, and that is part of the point of this series. It's an annoying series of annoying characters in annoying situations, rounded off with annoying animation, voices and sounds. But recognizing this and its other absurd qualities still fails to make Dumbland a value.
