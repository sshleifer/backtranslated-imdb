I didn't even know it was originally a movie for television when I saw it, but I guessed it through the run. It has the same lacquered colors, gentle characters and horribly synthesized music that I remember from the 80s, plus a "social platform" that almost screams "Afterschool special". Anyhoo. <br /> <br /> Rona Jaffe's (thank you) Mazes and Monsters were made in prisons by Dungeons & Dragons, a pen-and-paper RPG that took the hearts of millions of geeks around America. I count myself one of those geeks, because I've never played D&D specifically, I've dabbled in one of his brothers. M & M was also made in the great D & D's great controversy - that it was so exciting that people could lose touch with reality, be to worship Satan without knowing, blah. I suppose it was a legitimate concern at one time, if it is extremely rare, but it kills this movie terribly. <br /> <br /> We meet 4 young college students playing the well-known names of Mazes and Monsters, socializing and having some time away from everyday life. Except that M & M, as presented, is more boring than their worldly life. None of the excitement of games is presented here - and Jay Jay's request to take the M&M in 'the real world' comes out of nowhere. It's just an excuse to get one of the characters to be crazy too - but at that time we don't really like it. Jay Jay, Robbie, Kate and Daniel have to be different - but they are all rich WASPy prigs who have problems, nobody really has. <br /> <br /> But things just go on and get worse in more ways than one. The low budget comes terribly clear (I love the entrance sign and the cardboard cut for the forbidden caves) Robbie / Pardu shows why he's not a warrior in the immensely stabbing scene ever, and the payout on two towers is unintentionally hysterically fun. Tom Hanks 'blubbering' Jay Jay, what am I doing here? 'made me laugh in minutes at the end. Absolutely the lowest point of his career. Don't look at it as a cogent satire, just a ridiculous piece of 80s TV waste, and you'll still be fine. That is, if you can stay awake. The majority are mostly boring, but it is totally worthwhile for Pardu's collapse at the end. At least Tom Hanks has improved. Not that he could go much worse from here.
