I think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons I've ever seen. I would recommend this cartoon to people who are under 5. I used to like this show when I was 4 and 5, I still only saw it when there was nothing on it. Now I'm second 5 and I'd rather do my homework than see it. The comic used to be a little fun, but they weren't enough to make me jump out laughing. Now I'm older I'm interested in show witch is not rated us. I'm starting to see Doctor Who (12A), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventures (PG). I'm interested in things to do with Doctor Who, so I'm not interested in 5 year old cartoons. This cartoon didn't last very long, it only had 6 seasons, it was canceled because it was low on viewers, but some say it was because the authors ran out of ideas, but for most other shows they have at least 8 seasons.
