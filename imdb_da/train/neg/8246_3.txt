Pade's girls Florence Lawrence and Dorothy West receive some great news at the local post office, unaware that they are being disturbed by the theft of Charles Inslee. Meanwhile, father David Miles receives a message (from young Robert Harron) that necessitates father's return home; so when the young women return, they can be ?? home alone. When the vulnerable couple goes down to the evening, the local "Black Ball of the Black and Tans" gets on the way; and a dark-skinned beverage presents additional danger to D.W. Griffith's dynamic duo ?? <br /> <br /> Mr. Inslee has one of his better cinemas and steals the movie from "The Girls and Daddy". Ironically, director Griffith seems to be one of the black faces in the "Black and Tans" ball. "Biograph Girls" Lawrence and West are suggestions for later "Griffith Girls" Lillian and Dorothy Gish, especially in "Orphans of the Storm" (1921); and they are overly loving in bed! The racist tone is unfortunate as the story of a theft redeemed by saving its potential victims from a greater danger is exciting. <br /> <br /> *** Girls and Dad (2/1/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Florence Lawrence, Dorothy West, Charles Inslee
