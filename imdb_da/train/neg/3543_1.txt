Has been lurking for a couple of years or so. I've never been moved to send on here before, so maybe this movie is worth a star for it, but I doubt it. I just watched it on DVD, having missed it in the movies because of illness and never came around to see it so far. I hadn't read much about it, certainly not even thought about the movie in a few months. It was just what the buddy picked up in the store, so it was seen. <br /> <br /> Bad error. <br /> <br /> The shot I talked about in the summary at the top is in the trailer and on the poster. Right from the off, Jason has Statham hair. Like in no other GR movie. Or any JS movie I've seen. At least not in the quantities on the display here. And Ray Liotta in underpants should be warned. It's scary and fun, but not in a ha-ha-humor way. Its more in an almost-TheOffice-but-slightly-mutated-and-so-failing-black-of-humor way. They each say the same: "This movie is not something you expect this movie to be." <br /> <br /> Now, based on past, extensive movie viewing, I experienced this movie being a few things. As: <br /> <br /> () Continuous, <br /> <br /> () Interesting or engaging, <br /> <br /> () Not a complete and complete farrago of umbilical stirring, < br /> <br /> Something more substantive than a motley bunch of poorly realized fables from what is just a standard eastern mystic ideology dressed up as a "cool, modern, self-conscious art form" <br /> <br /> () Hopefully better than "The Idiots". <br /> <br /> As you may have guessed from my tone, it has not been thoroughly possible to check any box above. Instead, it was: <br /> <br /> (x) Poorly edited {pace across the store, 70s amateur high-8 style cuts, incomprehensible "plot" "twists !!!" delivered through hackneyed flash-back montages, i could continue ...}, <br /> <br /> (x) Shots as of a depressed 14 year old goth who had just spent the weekend and looked at Truffaut and Godard with the drapes the sign <br /> <br /> (x) Then put your own back with the whole "I'm really smart, me" motive / message that it feels determined to repeat it every 20 minutes or so just to make sure for the stupid people (ie anyone who does not like it) in the audience make sure they get points, <br /> <br /> (x) A real waste of my time. <br /> <br /> As for the undoubted ability of some people to "get" something from this, fine. I'm glad you enjoyed it. A poster said something that got my attention: under the 25s it probably better understood because of editing. Maybe, but editing needs to make your work more accessible, no less. Regarding "The Genius is only recognized by the enlightened" brigade out there, you suck an onion and grow up. There is nothing more presumptuous and self-serving than people who say why another person does not know great art because they do not understand "craft / materials / moon cycle / filaments of highest rational thought" as "author / poet / artist / palm reader / idiot savant 'uses to explain his or her vision / grand scheme / unit with Gaea / big big bucket of dog'. <br /> <br /> For me and many, many more people, its garbage. > <br /> Films, art, stories, poetry, everything that is designed to be seen by another human being must be engaging and moving, in one way or another it is metaphorical, spiritual, emotional or whatever you have . <br /> <br /> The only way this moved me was forward in time, two hours closer to my own inevitable transition. "The biggest trick he has ever drawn made you believe that any part of this movie meant something at all "<br /> <br /> And now, please sk eel my bowls for me.
