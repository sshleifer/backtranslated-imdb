A remake of the stunning 1972 movie of the scene play that throws Caine as the nemesis of his character from the first movie. But do nothing else at all. <br /> <br /> An under-par performance by actors, Law and Caine, is further diluted by weak self-satisfying direction. <br /> <br /> The heat in setting in the original is left to a super modern home. The subtle interplay between Oliver and Caine, who made the first movie so easy to see, is replaced by a horrid, brash arrogance that immediately discovers contempt in the viewer. But this is not the wise, that-and-froing of suffering one, so the other character the original fetus as well, it is an obvious OTT character murder of both characters from the word go. <br /> <br /> This version of Sleuth is not really worth seeing, see the original movie and dazzled from the opening act.
