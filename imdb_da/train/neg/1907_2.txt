This terribly bad piece of garbage manages to be racist, sexist, and homophobic at one time, while pretending to be terribly chic and sophisticated. Terrible notions, a clich√©-ridden manuscript and boring direction make this movie one to remove. Two scenes were particularly offensive - the one in which Schaech scrubs his tongue after being kissed by another man (could it really have been so rough) and the scene where Eastwood was kissed by Schaech's best friend who pretends to be Russian. When he leaves the room, she exclaims "foreigners"! So much for her to be a cultured artist who dreams of living in Paris!?! Jonathon Schaech can be a sympathetic actor on the screen and is amazingly beautiful. It is a pity that he did not learn more about working with the exciting gay director Gregg Araki on a previous film, and trying to save this movie from downward to a series of gay stereotypes and a moss of homophobia.
