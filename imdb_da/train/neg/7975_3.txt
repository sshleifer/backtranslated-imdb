When I sat in front of the TV in this movie, I thought, "Oh, what Alfred Hitchcock, or even Brian DePalma, could have done with this!" Chances are, you will too. It begins to be intriguing. A British park ranger living in Los Angeles (Collin Firth) marries a beautiful brunette woman (Lisa Zane), whom he only met in a park a short time ago. Then she disappears one day. The police cannot find any documentation she has ever existed, and Firth does its own search. So far so good. As he is about to give up, he turns to his female best friend (Billy Zane) and they stumble upon her past life in LA's sordid underground drugs, nightclubs and amethyst movie creation and then to her story of mental instability. At that time, Firth's life is in danger and the film is falling apart. None of the characters from Lisa Zane's past are extremely interesting. The movie moves slowly and there is very little action. There is a subplot regarding missing fabric money, but it's just a throwaway. No chases, no sounding sequences and no excitement. Just some dull strokes and a lot of chatting with boring characters. One thing worth noting, Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are brother and sister, but they never appear in a scene together. At the end of the movie you are torn between wondering what might have been and trying to stay awake.
