Phew - I don't do what to say. This is a movie that can be really good one with a bunch of rocky viewers. Some of the actors reminded me of John Waters' early offerings. Maybe I should take it back - I will not insult Waters ability as an instructor / narrator. <br /> <br /> I especially loved the lawyer to take over the full faith and credibility clause. It's "full faith and credit" by the way! <br /> <br /> This also reminds me of "The Conrad Boys", where the main actor is also the author, the director, the movie editor, etc. The kind of multi-involved company like it is probably best for highly experienced filmmakers who wanted it technical ability (albeit a stunt, some might say) to pull something like that.
