I don't want to take this movie to all the myriad technical f u | p | u | p | s, it would take two days to outline how it all is not even possible. Others have already pointed out all the relevant stupidity. <br /> <br /> Given all that, I could still have had it if they only included all the maudine, nauseating, annoying, Disneyesque sentimental crap that is out of place anywhere but nowhere else out in the room where the slightest mistake can mean immediate death. <br /> <br /> The "crew" as well as the "real" astronaut were just guilty of putting all their feduous nonsense in front of everything else. It completely destroyed any value that production might have left. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that NASA lets this waste out so that so many people get so much misinformation about something so important to them. If you haven't seen this yet, save yourself the irritation. See Apollo 13 again. At least it tried to be right.
