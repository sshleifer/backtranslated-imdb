If you want to try to build tension in a movie, it's always a good idea not to build it beyond the overall stage. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the butcher brothers have not yet understood it. <Br /> <br /> This movie, unlike most of its characters, sucks (if you didn't work, the vampires in the first few minutes, so shame you) preference extends the abundant supply of 'no know where I am cheerleader types and gay operators who wait comfortably and with a fast food swagger past their isolated door. The only little bit of originality in the plot is how these vampires are going to be vampires in the first place, but the rest of it is ridiculous and sloppy. Forced to keep sticks (as opposed to stakes) regularly because of their penchant to fill their basement with bloodless bodies, they are really no too bright. If they were feeding their victims, they could run their own little blood farm and it would reduce mortality so they could settle down and get chintzy. Why the producers felt it necessary to introduce incestuous twins and the homicidal gay elder brother I am not sure. It added zero to the plot, which was unfortunate as there wasn't much plot to begin with and had no shock value at all. <br /> <br /> It was never told why the parents were dead unless, of course, it was explained during one of my frequent tea breaks. It is clear that the social worker must have been aware of the family for some reason or another, but it was again for the viewer to write his own reason. The only well-rounded character was the youngest brother who looks like Pugsley from the Adams family. In fact, he was far too rounded and had a child's look that accidentally walked from a Weight Watchers class to a very bad horror movie. Oh heavens he had. Never any dear, have another donut with a yummy blood center.
