This is really the most horrible movie I've ever seen. I simply have no idea how anyone makes sense to put this on release. <br /> <br /> Production standards are terrible. There is no performance here on filmography. The camera's work, scripting, acting and sound are incredibly crass. I think there is a plot, but it could have been done in 10 minutes, so we save time to see it. The hysterical neurotic girls in the middle of this piece have no credibility at all. <br /> <br /> I would encourage anyone to avoid spending any time or money on this section. It's really terrible. <br /> <br /> JDD - December 14, 2008
