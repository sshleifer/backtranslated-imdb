Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen - yes she is related to Bruce), the killer from the first movie, is again to her old tricks again. She is one of the advisors at Camp Rolling Hills. As long as the girls in the camp are cozy and stay away from sex, drugs and swords are fine. But a few steps across the line and Angela kills them - cracks bad jokes all the way. <br /> <br /> The original "Sleepaway Camp" was a vicious and unpleasant splatter movie but had some good points to it. This is also malicious and unpleasant, but has no good points for it. The reason has been made to death, and this adds nothing new to the formula. There are lots of gory kittens in here (people are burnt alive, heads are cut off, neck slashed) but all gore is so obviously fake it actually gets comical. This also has the smallest amount of campers I've ever seen, and virtually everyone is too old for their roles (especially Higgins). As expected, there is the free female nudity (here provided by the incredibly untamed Valerie Hartman) and the obligatory good girl / good boy team (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins). With the only exception for Springsteen and Higgins, the play is miserable - even at slasher movie standards. There is also a cruel edge to this movie where a character is drowned in an outhouse! Drilling and sick with a stupid plot, meaningless nudity and bad doings. Skip it over.
