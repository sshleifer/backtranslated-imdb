When I look for new cars, I do not expect to be shown both. When I drink fountain Coke, I should expect the drink to contain cola. When I see a movie that adorns itself with an excellent researcher, I expect it to somehow be relevant to that person or their work. This could have been people who discussed my granny's diary. The covered material is only relevant because they guard the tide of science. I fell asleep the first time I tried to see it and the second time I stopped seeing it. <br /> <br /> I love science and documentaries. I'd rather see them over the latest blockbuster. But this is far from giving something worth your time ?? Avoid at all costs.
