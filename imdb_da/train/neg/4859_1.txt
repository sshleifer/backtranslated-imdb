You have to admire instructor Todd Sheets for his dedication, drive and enthusiasm for filmmaking: between 1985 and 2000 he made quite a few 34 films. Unfortunately, if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is something to pass by, they are probably all crap (and a quick look at their IMDb ratings seems to verify my feeling). Part 3 sees a group of obnoxious students find detention a little more eventful than usual after being attacked by hordes of the living dead escaped from a top secret army-based base just below their school. Director Sheets is working on a terrible writer by Brian Eklund, who is heavily dependent on the liberal use of the f-bomb. He delivers yet another embarrassingly amusing effort with some emotionally charged horrible performances from his talented cast, horrible visual effects (some crap CGI and what looks like the face of a huge cardboard spaceship) and his trademark shoddy gore (handful of offal pulled from his victims clothes). Finally, what seems like an eternity sees annoying characters running for their lives and convincing undead people directing animal entrances, ending Zombie Armageddon with a time travel / paradox twist end, forcing viewers to look again at more torture minutes from the start of the movie. Honestly ... once was enough, Mr. Sheets? What have we done to deserve to see it again?
