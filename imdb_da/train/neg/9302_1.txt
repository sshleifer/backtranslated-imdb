This movie is just awful. It's boring, it's low quality, the actors are just the worst actors I've ever seen, and the scenario is so bad it's fun. <br /> <br /> "Head" the actor must be the hot guy who gets all the girls, but he's ugly, overweight and looks like he's from the early 90s. <br /> <br /> All the characters are gone for the weekend to get together among friends but no one is actually friends! The couple have not seen the "main" guy for over 5 years, and even then they were not really friends. The main "date" knows him only from work, and than there is a girl they pick up in a bar. Now tell me you risk losing your job to spend a week-end in your cabin with people who aren't even your real friends. Because that's what he does at the start of the movie! Don't waste a minute of your time on this lemon. I have made home movies scary than this! <br /> <br />
