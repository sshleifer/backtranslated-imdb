As usual, I make a crazy dash to watch the movies I haven't seen yet in anticipation of the Oscar. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up in my alley. I can't understand for my life why this movie has got the buzz it has. There is no history !! A group of guys are jumping around in Iraq. One day, they are diffusing a bomb. Tomorrow, they are tools around the country, in themselves no less and begin to take sniper fire. No wait here they are back in Baghdad. There is no coherent story at all. The three main characters are so far characterized that they are only caricatures. Thus, I mean, we have the cute child who is afraid to die. We have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to come back safely. And then we have the daredevil cowboy who doesn't follow the rules, but has a soft spot for the perishable little Iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers DVDs. What do you think will happen ??? Well, do you think that the cowboy soldier who does not follow the rules will get the cute boy hurt with his dismissed ways ?? Why yes! Do you think the Iraqi child that the cowboy soldier has a soft spot for will be killed and make him crazy? Why yes! There is no story here. Scripture is young and predictable! The camera is shaken a lot to make it look like "artistic". And for all of you who think this is such a great war image, you need to hire "Full Metal Jacket", "Deerhunter" or "Platoon". Don't waste time or money on this boring movie!
