Finally, justice has the great Joe Don Baker running around Texas shooting people shooting people. Then he goes to Malta, where he shoots more people. He is unlocked many times to shoot people. Then he comes into a fight with the bad guy who is dressed as a monk. There is a boat chase and Joe Don returns to jail. Finally, with the help of Elaine from "Seinfeld", Joe Don kills the bad guy, blows a boat or two, and someone gets shot with a flare. All this and a catchy theme song, like Mitchell!
