I had some expectation for the movie as it had a nice star cast and it's the return of the doll Akshay and Saif. Well, I was reluctant to watch the movie because it was done by the same man who wrote the story of the Dhoom franchise because I hated Dhoom 2; but if Dhoom 2 is compared to Tashan, I would say Dhoom 2 is very realistic. <br /> <br /> When I saw the credits at the beginning, I felt good because it was put in a good way. Well, the very first scene in itself struck me off. Then, the biggest drawback of the movie is the action sequences. Me and my friends laughed our guts off to see these crappy battles. It was like Akshay against about 30 thugs, and everyone and the bullies even got machine guns! Phew ... you need to see this to understand how bad the action sequences are. <br /> <br /> The other thing about the movie is the overly predictable story. It reminded me of some of the early 80's movies. The only thing worth the film is sexy Kareena, who looked really hot in this. And for that I give a rating of 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Guys, please..please ... don't see this one thinking about it's a real gangster movie. Now you can see this for having a little laugh at the terrible battle scenes. That's all.
