A friend and I went through a phase for some (many years) to choose the sharpest horror movies in the video store for an evening entertainment. For some reason I ended up buying this (probably v. V. Cheap). <br /> <br /> The cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre. There are also some very entertaining scenes. Among them is a scene where a man is attacked and defends himself with a number of unlikely objects, which made me laugh at the time (it doesn't seem so fun in thought, but you go). <br /> <br /> Apart from that, it's totally crap, imagine. But probably worth seeing if you like movies like "Chopping Mall". Yes, I've seen it too.
