Squeamish 11-year-old Luke Benward (as Billy "Worm Boy" Forrester) moves to a new city. At his new school, young Benward is taken by the other boys. They put worms in his thermos. Benward throws his gag reflex under control and throws a worm on freckle-faced bully Adam Hicks (like Joe Guire). Benward bets he can eat 10 worms in a day - without blowing up! Hallie Kate Eisenberg (as Erika "Erk" Tansy) uses her archery to help Benward. Director and former SCTV writer Bob Dolman promises: "No worms were hurt in this movie." In a related tone, SCTV star Andrea Martin has a fun scene. "How to Eat Fried Worms" is loosely based on Thomas Rockwell's popular novel. Pre-teen kids in gross-outs should enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> **** Eating Fried Worms (8/25/06) Bob Dolman ~ Luke Benward, Adam Hicks, Hallie Kate Eisenberg, Alexander Gould
