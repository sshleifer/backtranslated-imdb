This excuse for a movie is about absolutely nothing! Rachel Griffiths needs the money. The film must have been made on a very low budget because the lighting did not exist. I made a promise if I ever see Pete Postlesumthingor others, I will commit suicide. I would be happy to know if there was 1) a plot or 2) a script. My biggest regret is that I wasted my time watching this nonsense.
