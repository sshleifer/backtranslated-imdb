Ca. halfway I realized that I didn't care about these signs at least; However, I saw a little more. Unfortunately I came back the next day and finished it. I shouldn't have bothered. <br /> <br /> If you know * something * about the movie in advance, you know that the protagonist will be a plane crash that survives - and the title gives you a good idea of ​​what's going to happen afterwards - He'll call the phone and call people about it! It was almost as bad as "Snakes on a Plane" (another bad aviation catastrophe). I am aware that this is an old movie, and the actingist style these days was much less naturalistic than today. But even by these standards, the play was embarrassing. These were not signs, they were stereotypes. I suppose this movie was more than anything, an attempt by Bette Davis to help her husband's (Gary Merrill) career. Since I haven't had it, I've seen egres more real feelings than he did. Davis plays the happy curl (ie, a non-glamorous role) was probably considered an edgy and courageous career movement. It wasn't. It was just boring. She was a kind of little Tim in the movie, which made Trask (Merrill's character) see the truth of love and forgiveness (although she was less wild than Tiny Tim), and imparted quiet wisdom of life and relationships without a hint that her beloved man had just died. <br /> <br /> The final scene in which Trask calls his wife back in Iowa to unite was so touched and the assault on both ends of the phone line, I almost nodded. I had to remind myself that these people actually got paid for what they did in this movie. <br /> <br /> I noticed that many people seem to have enjoyed this movie. If you found it uplifting then it is good. But honestly, I just found it bad. There are lots of old movies from Golden Age of Hollywood that were much better written and acted.
