It seems that more consideration has entered the IMDb reviews of this movie than entered the source. <br /> <br /> Here is a review without pretensions: <br /> <br /> Just when you think nothing is going to do it. <br /> <br /> Dress it as you like, it's a boring movie filled with unengaging characters that do very little of interest. <br /> <br /> One if you want to convince an exploitable emo chick that you are like, so deep, man. <br /> <br /> Nothing to look at even though the pleasure. <br /> <br /> Unless <br /> <br /> you are. <br /> <br /> Pretentious.
