I loved this movie, I admit it. This should be the best (right?) Video movie I've seen. Well ... I and my friend just decided for shits n 'giggles that we would rent this movie. We knew what to expect and we got exactly what we expected, plus more. When the red neck is turned up against the Sasquatch tree, we literally saw that part about three to four times, that was the amazing (hysterical of course). And why? Oh why should the protagonist roll so much? We honestly know that we know you are in danger and roll so much that it does not help all that much. But really, if this movie is in you are local video store RENT IT. It's worth the money and it's not even as bad as it is bad, but not incredibly bad. Overall, if you rent this movie, absolutely fantastic will be there for you.
