Don't be confused, it's neither a horror nor a movie. I strongly recommend that you do not see this 82 minute error. The only reason it was a star was the presence of Chris Pine. <br /> <br /> Nothing happens. You wait patiently in the hope that there may be a flickering of a twist, a surprising hint, a plot that will show up - but no. The people take erratic fluctuations in their actions and yet I do not have time to develop - thanks to the sparse editors and the shameful shameful writers - before returning to an idyllic and playful (bringing on the teen rock montage) state. The only thing that could have made it worse would be to add ethnic "companion" to the perishable token. Their encounter with obstacles (whether human or physical) is short, confusing and totally meaningless. <Br /> <br /> Chris Pine is struggling to stay above the surface while drowned by the misery of a lightweight casting. Lou Taylor Pucci could not tumble dry if he spent the summer with Keanu Reaves fighting the Navada desert. <br /> <br /> See 'The Road', see '28 days later ', watch daytime TV ... something But this; I beg you. Suffering from boredom, as opposed to being led to believe in the movie, this movie is not a cure.
