For the first time this year, I have felt the need to log in to IMDb today to clear this movie by writing a review because it was just such an easy to see. The plot sounded great when I read it, I expected a minimal mystery thriller, a claustrophobic phantom hunt. Unfortunately, the whole water gets so bad of an everyday, tiring love story and too many cops and teeth-gnashingly stupid "no-say-things-like-this-except-in-bad-movie" dialogues that it is here is a Rapid wear of the worst offenses of this piece of film: <br /> <br /> - The scripture is so dependent on coincidence and inexplicable and inexplicable stupidity of protagonists that it is just ridiculous. No, actually, it's anger. And lazy. <br /> <br /> - Related to: Cheap Voltage. A long parade "just in time" moments. <br /> <br /> - The main characters. Okay, it seems that the scriptwriter has never experienced actual people in real life, but instead got all his knowledge from bad movies. Thus, his characters are boring, lifeless second generation clich√©s. They are simply plot units, placeholders without the slightest bit of personality. They are "man and woman in break-up who still love each other". Never seen one before except in 100,000 movies and it will not be more realistic or enjoyable. Think of the sweetest two-dimensional Hollywood fare and you have it. There is not a sign in this movie that is even extremely fresh, charming or interesting. <br /> <br /> - The distant, vague resolution that swings very badly and only needs a button to topple, even though the word "resolution" can be scary here because the movie is a swamp that doesn't go anyway. But when you are through, you no longer break. The last third of the movie I just jump forward because it was just so unbearable to see. <br /> <br /> Okay, that's it. Regardless of what redemption features this movie has, it's all buried under incompetence. Don't see this turd.
