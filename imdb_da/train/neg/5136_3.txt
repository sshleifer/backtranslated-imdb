Dropped into the movie category "Too ridiculous in the dialogue and departmental departments to be taken seriously". How scared, if you know what I did last Friday, the thirteenth or my girlfriend is back that they are bad, do not do scarecrows. Evil Dead sets such a high standard for the comic horror on a budget genre that Scarecrows is simply not in place. <br /> <br /> Suspicion of inexperience is at stake immediately, as there are no signs of noise or vibration in the hull and cockpit of an airborne aircraft. The repeated display of a picture of 3 men just screams for a story arc, but nothing comes. Although the men are, of course, the scarecrows, there is no explanation. Knowing this movie is too serious because it's good, can produce some laughs. I can't remember if Joe Bob Briggs ever saw Scarecrows, but I think he wouldn't stop this low. But with an IMDb rating of over 6, many people disagree.
