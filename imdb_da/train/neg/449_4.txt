I admit that I've only seen a handful of episodes, but each one seemed quite different from the next one. It appears after the first season that the producers decided to completely convert the show, lose characters, introduce new ones, and rewrite the entire show dynamics. As you probably are convinced, the notion of quirky, unpredictable teenager Holly (Amanda Bynes) is moving in with her tall strong sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) in New York City. Decent enough premise: Odd pair + fish out of water + high jinx. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, while I miss sitcoms of yore, this show misses the lack of fun repeatedly and it is sad because they have a decent talent. <br /> <br /> On top of all, they insisted on changing the show (Val lived with a caste regularly for a season, so he was suddenly gone so she opens a bakery? what?) When things change so drastically you get the feeling that even * the show * knows it's bad. I mean brand new sets, characters written off and new show regulars! <br /> <br /> On a side note (it's just nitpicking), I know this is a TV show and not at all right, but Val and Holly end up living in a large loft duplex (there are stairs ) with a terrace ... in MANHATTAN! Are you serious!?
