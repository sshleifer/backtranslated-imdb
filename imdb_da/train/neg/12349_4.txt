A real disappointment from the great visual master Ridley Scott. G. I. Jane tells the story of a first woman ever going through the hell training on Navy SEALs. The training is the hardest and tough existence that the director says in the movie for the protagonist O'Neil, played by Demi Moore. There is no particular message or point in this movie, or I could not reach it properly. It may be a form of a statement on women's rights and abilities, but it is sinking completely during the tired scenes and stupid gunfight at the end of the movie. I really can't understand why Ridley spends so much zooming in that last gun battle in the desert? It looks so stupid and annoying and almost amateurish, so I really want to know what the director saw in that technique. Looking at his latest movie, Black Hawk Dawn, there is absolutely nothing wrong in the battle scenes (which are many) and they are very intense and controlled with skill. The entire finals of G.I. Jane looks ugly and is no more than stupid and brainless shooting and killing. <br /> <br /> This is Ridley Scott's worst movie in my opinion, and there are no significant details from which this amazing instructor is known. I'm still glad I saw this in widescreen format because there are still many great scenes and samples of Scott's capabilities, but they are very few in this movie. A disappointment and nothing compared to the classics (Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Alien and so on ..) of this talented director. So I have to give G.I. Jane 4/10.
