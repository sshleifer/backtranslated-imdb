This series had potential, but I suppose the budget wouldn't allow it to see that potential. An interesting setup that is no different from "lost" it falls flat after the 1st episode. The whole series, 6 episodes, could have made a convincing 90 minute movie, but the decision-making chose to pull it over and over again. Many of the scenes were unbearably slow and long without moving the action forward. The music was very annoying and didn't work together. There were few signs we used to, as their characters did not grow in the time frame --- yes, one grew slightly. The end was just as horrible as the rest of the series. The only kudos here is for the art dept and put the chests of drawers, they created an interesting look, for badly the author and the director lack the foresight to do something interesting with that element
