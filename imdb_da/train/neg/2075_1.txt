I must admit when I went to watch this movie, I didn't have very high expectations. But even with my low expectations, I was totally and completely disappointed ... <br /> <br /> Basically, Luke Wilson is a hot shot that tends to go out with a little crazy girlfriends. There is a little mention of a girl who stalks him, but it is pretty much that character. As I don't mind, it will probably be as underdeveloped as the rest of the movie. So at a metro station Rainn Wilson (which I actually liked before this movie) convinces him to talk to a "hot" girl, Uma Thurman. This is oddly mild, since everyone can clearly see that Uma Thurman does not belong to the "hot" category. <br /> <br /> Rainn Wilson's performance is also far from hot. Normally, I'm all for his acting, but even he couldn't save this movie. His character was jumping, unrealistic and rather annoying. You can never tell if the authors tried to make him the comical token closet gay guy or just desperate. It was almost painful. <br /> <br /> Yet, someone steals her purse as she goes to leave the subway, and Luke Wilson is the charming savior he runs after the robber. Now we all know that Uma Thurman is superhero, or "G-Girl" who they like to call her in the movie. It still hides me for what "G" stands for, but we leave it for the bulletin boards for debate. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes I assume must be fun, but I find myself asking who has sex like that? They almost throw the bed through the wall because of Uma Thurman's "passion" let's say. It makes my head hurt, but not in "I really think hard to understand this" way. <br /> <br /> When Uma insults Anna Faris and calls her a "whore", I had no debate with it. Apart from the fact that she can't choose movies properly, she can't act and trust that she's blonde and typical. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would have gone out of the theater if I hadn't paid $ 8.75 to see it. The characters are typical and have absolutely no chemistry, especially Uma Thurman. Someone should let her know that just because you are moving your head means that you are not acting. <br /> <br /> Also, the script and story could have used either much work or a fight and some lighter fluid. In fact, I began to be embarrassed by the actors and their dying careers. Overall, if you appreciate your money and your own respect does not waste your time with this pathetic attempt at a movie.
