I'm not a big fan of rooms / coms at best times. A couple have been quite good (check for Dream for a Insomniac), but this is just more of the same but less. <br /> <br /> With a maturity of 100 minutes, I expect more than 1 laugh every 30 minutes. . The only real stomach grin is when male strangers and friends instinctively help Lee's character. All I can say is avoid. I guarantee there are at least 10 other movies on the shelf that deserve you $$ <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (And only if I'm a big Lee fan)
