I have searched for the right words to describe this movie. First, I was inclined to simply skip to more important cases, as the film does not rise to a level that deserves comment. <br /> <br /> I wondered, however, how to describe such things and something fascinated by the challenge with the question: "What can you say about such a movie?" Nonsense? No, it's not a nonsense that can be reused for something useful. Greenhouse gas? No, it is not greenhouse gas, greenhouse gases help the plants grow large and healthy. Finally, I turned to "Not even bad", a recast of the phrase "Not even wrong", which is sometimes used in theoretical physics to describe a theory that is hopelessly flawless and not even worthy of correction. That's it, Georgia Rule: Not even bad.
