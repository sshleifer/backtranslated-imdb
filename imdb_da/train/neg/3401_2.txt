I rented this movie out after hearing about it if it wasn't set up for an Academy Award, but after seeing it, it's easy to see why it didn't. Despite the beautiful photography, the film is incredibly slow despite the fact that it has almost no plot. The plot is about a young boy trying to express his parents' death in what may or may not have been an accident (the film is never aware of this) and how his grandfather used to tell him fairy tales. The fairy tales contain the only points of interest in the plot, but they are very short and do not seem to have any meaning. <br /> <br /> The first adventure especially affects a boy trying to get a magical flower for his dying boyfriend to save his life, but the boy delays by tasting the flower first to make sure it is not poisonous, resulting in him being a few seconds late to save his girlfriend - says grandfather saw that morality is that the boy was too impatient, but it makes no sense because it was caution and slowness that resulted in his failure . Perfect metaphor for this movie really. <br /> <br /> The shooting of Skye is beautiful, but then Stardust, which was released this year, became another movie about fairy tales filmed in Skye and beautifully photographed - and it is infinitely better than this.
