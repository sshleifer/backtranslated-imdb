This is one of the "so bad it is good" movies that you always hear about but never see! Unlike Troma movies, which are deliberately bad and campy (and I'm not entertained), this 100% pure is serious. But with features like a presumably super-deadly killer robot, which prances as one of Solid Gold Dancers on an acid trip and a magical first mate who calls lightning strikes and turns into the good witch in the east, it takes seriously pushing it so far over the edge of the bad, making the whole circle back to entertaining. <br /> <br /> Watchable enough because of it.
