A very "pretty" nice old lady, desperate for money to save her house and belongings, grows "pot" in her house, smokes it with a few old biddy friends and then sells it. It is the story of this turnkey comedy, which emphasizes the absurdity of the situation and some of the humor that arises. Too much of the movie works. The mood is not of the ridiculous range, but it keeps you entertained for an hour and a half, so I think it serves its purpose. There are fun moments and Brenda Blethyn is fun to watch in the lead role. But the end really destroyed a "sweet" movie with insulting bad messages that only the ultra-liberals in the movie world would like to see happen. Like most people, I prefer a happy ending, too, but not everyone should be warm and unclear to those who blatantly break the law. Here too, the typical (1) children are out of wedlock, but it does not pose a problem and is considered okay; (2) performance portrayed as morally weak people; and (3) even a doctor who gets stoned too! <br /> <br /> Hey? And reviewers here blow up Hollywood? This shows A how a secular society has lowered standards in Britain and Europe in general. Hello people: At least you have a trace of morality instead of anything other than a Timothy Leary "If it feels good, do it" message.
