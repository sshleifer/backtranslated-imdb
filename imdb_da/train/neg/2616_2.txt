Remember the name Kevin Lime - and please, never let <br /> <br /> send him directly again. Timing, pacing, editing: Everything hopelessly wrong. <br /> <br /> Three or four decent professionals (next time boys go away <br /> <br />) can't do anything to save this movie from amateurs like Alice <br /> <br /> Evans and the kind of production standards you expect from teen-produced children's shows on British television. <br /> <br /> The Greatest Mystery: The Music. A score so inappropriate, inappropriate and <br /> <br /> badly matched with the tone of the movie, which one looks serious about whether it is a case of sabotage. Add an acoustic wave that seems to be unaffected by a single mike and a director who only <br /> <br /> remembers adding auditory action and we <br /> <br /> have what should be the biggest ratio of money to earnings of <br /> <br /> in recent years.
