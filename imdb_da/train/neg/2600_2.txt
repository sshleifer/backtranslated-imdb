Here we have a movie that fails in just about every way it is possible for a movie to fail. Terrible script, miserable acting, amateur director, ridiculous special effects ... it's just a horrible movie. Not to mention the fact that when you get to the end, you will realize that whole things don't give a lick of reason. After using the whole movie to wonder what the world is doing here when things are finally explained, you realize the story is built on a foundation that is ridiculously impossible. In one of these hideous "villains explaining the whole movie's" sequences, we are told that our villain has done something that simply cannot be done and which definitely does not make sense. Oh, and after that we also see that there is also a kind of jell-o-monster involved. I'm sure Drew Barrymore would like this movie to never have happened. If for some unnecessary reason you have been tempted to sit down and watch this movie, I suggest you instead take the time to head to a wall for 104 minutes. It would be a much more pleasant experience than sitting through this waste.
