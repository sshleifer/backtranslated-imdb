I have read the novel Reaper of Ben Mezrich a few years ago, and last night I came to see this adaptation. <br /> <br /> Although it has been years since I first read the story, the differences between the novel and the film are humongous. Very important elements that made it all likely are only printed or changed to bad. <br /> <br /> If the plot sounds interesting to you: go get the novel. It's much, much, much better. Still 4 out of 10, as it was hard to stop seeing because of Ben Mezrich's big basal plot.
