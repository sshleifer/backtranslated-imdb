This movie was so bad it was ridiculous. I couldn't resist seeing it though. The reason is standard, it is pretty awful (supports like the nutty neighbor and the lawyer's friend were better actors). It's fun if you have the time to waste and want to see the conclusion of a dramatic plot. The chief executive, who plays "Kathy", was just fascinating because I couldn't decide if her deadpan flat impact was the result of poor operation or simply poor acting (I decided it was both). This leaves the script to comment, which was pretty terrible. Pat comments, idiotic decisions and ruthless stupidity on the part of each character in the movie. Maybe that's what was so nifty; I do not know. I was just looking at how bad it could be. (In fact, the dialogue is not even qualified to be called "cliche"), but it is almost completely inane.) All in all, very poor, cheaply made film. The sets, the same scenes (a house, a building) were shown over and over without artistry or actual binding to the action; more like props that randomly fell into action in a bad game. A hunting scene could have been shot by any youth in a warehouse or an old school: poorly shot, cheap props, minimal action .... and I would still see the end. Go figure.
