54 is a film about a club with the right title in the setting of the 70's era. It has the classic great bartender. The sexy women. The high powered owner. The party. When all confused chaos follows, and the bartender (played by Phillipe) seems to be at the bottom of it all. I'm going to be as blunt and honest as possible while avoiding any direct or unreasonable comments (as it is an "ok" movie). I really find it a completely grim movie complimented by it's dire cast. Every time I sit down to watch a movie casting Salma Hayek, I always wait to see her beauty, brilliantly expressed with great performance, but the reality always reminds me of how completely talented she is. I really mean, what has she ever bequeathed the masses apart from her huge table dance in 'From Dusk To Dawn' ...? The same goes for Ryan Phillippe, another bad actor who doesn't give anything to the screen, but his good looks and insane boring facade otherwise known as 'acting'. Mike Myers is not quite as bad as these 2, at least he gives something worthy of film. Plays the 54-Club's tough, outgoing co-founder. The type that the majority view would hate (ie, job well done), he puts a somewhat convincing performance that gave me rare pleasure from the girl. But unfortunately it is not enough to save the movie from the basic and flat nothing. Most 'bad' bad movies I find something to take from the movie, but it really has nothing to do with it. Neve Campbell is not too bad, but she's just 'there'. The story is boring, it seems that the author was more bent on making a movie of this style and decorating and forgot to add something else. Any significance. Any class. Any. Because like most ornaments, they are just hollow meaningless objects that are just beautiful to look at, very akin to the basis of this catastrophic movie. Really an hour and a half I could have used better to do something much more exciting, like talking to 90 year old relatives on the phone about the weather.
