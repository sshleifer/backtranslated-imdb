I think it's possible that I've seen worse movies, but this one is a real stinker! the plot is unremarkable but it is not the worst of it. Directing is not how close to what you would expect from andy ching. He is capable of good work, but failed to draw this film together. <br /> <br /> Angie Harm plays the female leader as a journalist killing who is behind the president's murder, really slaughtered the role. There was no chemistry with goodness, her behavior was flat and wood, and the 5 inch nail he carried the whole movie was absurd. this outing for harmony places her firmly at the bottom of the "b" list. <br /> <br /> And what was Cuba candy thinking ??? He has a number of excellent performances, but this was far from what we expected from him. <br /> <br /> Poor James Woods and Away Reynolds. poor poor poor poor poor
