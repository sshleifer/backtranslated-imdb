I admit to being a fan of the original stage production. I have never seen the movie version to much lately on cable and saw it expecting to see my memories come alive again because I loved the original show. Imagine my dismay. <br /> <br /> This should be the worst translation of a Broadway show for movies ever made. They changed the story, they changed the songs, they lost the soul. I was expecting a ride down the memory court, singing to the extraordinarily touching music and the mirror, on the ballet and hello twelve, hey thirteen. Does not! Not only did they falsify the music to an almost unrecognizable point, but they destroyed the story, added songs and outer plotlines (hello Cassie and Michael Douglas) who were not present in the original, and injected "drama" where it was not needed. The origin probably had Patos alone. If you were a fan of the original Broadway show, don't bother. I'm sorry I wasted my time and diluted my memories and looked at this tripe.
