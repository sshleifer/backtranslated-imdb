I was duped to watch this movie after reading a positive review from another website and man I was p.o'd !!! It took me at least 15 minutes to pick it up from the shelf b / c I didn't want anyone to see me. So another 10 minutes to build the courage to take it to the counter and actually use real money to rent it. I thought all my stress would pay off when I came home and watched the movie b / c the review I read, said the movie was a pleasant surprise; What a joke! If you can handle it through the film's first hour then you are lucky! b / c it is not until then the movie tour is in a horror. don't bother with this one people, your better off watching "dankness falls"
