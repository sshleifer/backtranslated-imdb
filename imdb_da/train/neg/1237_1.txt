I had very low expectations for this alleged "re-imagining" of the original - and they were not even met! What did they think? (Answer: They weren't.) Don't waste your time on this Hollywood trash can. Cut your nails, balance your checkbook, do something besides seeing this. Remember: If you rent things like this, it will only ensure that they do more.
