The effect achieved in this story of a psychiatrist who becomes involved with con artists is such that I must assume that it was the desired intention. The sets are artificial and in no time did I not feel that I was watching a movie. It seemed as if the actors were just reading their lines, rather than reacting to each other. While the film has elements of early film noir (except that it is in color), the approach is so exaggerated that I almost have to conclude that it is a parody of the genre. <br /> <br /> Since the presentation had no appeal to me, at least I waited for an engaging story. Normally, I am pretty slow on recording when it comes to storytelling stories, but you could see what came here within the first fifteen minutes. At the time of "Gee, I forgot $ 80,000," moment, I thought myself this thing is really ridiculous. For a psychiatrist with enlightened experience in gambling addictions to behave so stupidly is convinced. If at any time she had behaved like a normal intelligent person, the whole story would have fallen apart. <br /> <br /> This wood production left me cold.
