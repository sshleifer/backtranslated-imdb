Cover art (containing a man with a scary pellet gun) would make it seem like a martial arts movie. (Hardly) <br /> <br /> I find it interesting that the real title of the movie is Trojan Warrior. (Trojan is a condom mark in the United States) This movie is full of homoerotism. If you like those things, then this movie is not that bad. But consider these points: <br /> <br /> There are many close-ups of the actors' lanterns and scales (A scene even includes every actor with an erection bouncing in his pants.) The movie is also bathed in joyous colors like lime peach and red. From the film-maker's point of view, this movie is a draw queen! Several scenes have characters that are extremely close to each other and sometimes touch while talking. Also the hero's cousin likes women, and every other guy in the movie tries to kill him. Is there a message here that the filmmakers want to convey? <br /> <br /> Should I go into the battle scene? (Yes, the private parts of others are caught in a fight.) The martial arts scene is short and imaginative. No fancy stuff here, just your standard moves you would see in an old Chuck Norris flick. There is also a car hunting scene that can be the first ever low speed hunt for movies.
