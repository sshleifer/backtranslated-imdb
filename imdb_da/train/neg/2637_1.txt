Seriously, I don't even know where to start. It's like someone gave a bazillion dollar budget for an autistic third degree and said 'make me a movie about the secret service'. The editing is ridiculous, the cinematography was random at best, each syllable of dialogue was completely retarded and the management ... yes, was there even a director there? Everything was just as pointless and lame and meaningless ... and random .... and lamb. <br /> <br /> Here is a SPOILER for you; This movie is the stupid thing you will ever see. <br /> <br /> But if you liked this piece, you will also enjoy it; Disgust, Dark Blue and a partial frontal lobotomy.
