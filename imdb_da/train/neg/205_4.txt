I jumped at the chance to watch this movie scary and uninterrupted, remember rahs and raves for it. But wherever it seemed to be slipping into being really scary, it supported and went somewhere else. The dripping water throughout the house dropped the black rain, the prophetic dreams that took the wrong deal in raw wastewater before they could work up to a scream. <br /> <br /> What a disappointment. Chamberlain's almost expressive mask of a face offered a little but confused disbelief, something I thought to mirror while the movie was on. What could have been scary Aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background was instead a cacophony apparently designed to strike terror in the head. The ideas that modern people can embody old gods, that the Aboriginal people believe red-haired white men, were the first priests, and many other options are passed more like a shopping list than a hint of another dimension (Dream). <br /> <br /> [SPOILER] In the final scene, it wasn't clear to me what the director was trying to tell. Is there a big wave? So what? How big? A tsunami? Yeah okay. It is devastating, but not apocalyptic. Is it the end of the world? From a wave? The last wave? It has to be a great big wave. Why? Was the world so bad somewhere? It didn't look so terrible in this movie. In fact, I didn't think the wave came when the shadow left Burton's face that had been thrown off the wave. Was it only Burton's apocalypse? Heck, it happens every day for people who lose it. It was no interest if it were only him. <br /> <br /> The most frightening scene and the one that gives the best indication of Weir's potential was in Charlie's apartment where Burton has gone to confront the old man to scare Burton's wife. Charlie still asks him: "Who are you?" And it gets really disturbing after a while. Unfortunately, the film never followed.
