There has been a lot of love put into Wes Anderson's "Fantastic Mr Fox", unfortunately, all love is for himself. Granted, much time and effort has been put into making this ever so self-conscious quirky universe, but if only the same time and effort had been put into the script to try to make it fun. The worrying thing is that I think it was, and that's what Wes Anderson could do. <br /> <br /> The animation is good in the animal's close-ups, but when the camera is farther away, everything gets really hard on the eyes, and to be honest, it looks like a little mess. There was nothing special about each other, with Wes choosing to choose his friends and big names over more specialized voice actors who could probably have made the movie better. I am pretty sure that George Clooney's voice resume consists of two cameo trees in South Park, one of which he played a dog. <br /> <br /> The movie is too slick and trying too hard to be clever and different and is typical, even though the movie is set in England, all the good animals are typical Americans playing baseball while the evil ones are stereotypical English with the most offensive English accents. I can't stress how much waste of time this movie is. I didn't even laugh.
