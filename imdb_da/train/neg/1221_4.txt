I remember the days when Kim Basinger was nothing but a beautiful face that adorned films with typical characters stupid Blondie, romantic interest or queen in danger. But everything changed when she won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress for her role in the excellent movie LA Confidential, and I don't think I was the only one surprised at her solid performance. But after that moment, his career did not follow the ideal path. Surely, the prestige she won thanks to that movie made her participate in moderately prestigious films (like people I know or the door in the floor), but we have never seen her again in a significant way. The movie while she was out doing nothing to put her in that situation; And it's not just that her character is not too tasty, but also that the movie is really crappy. The manuscript from this movie could not be more hollow and basic. But Basinger brings some conviction to her character, which makes this poor movie to win a few points. This movie is full of clich√©s and generic villains. The work of director Susan Montford is truly disastrous for many reasons, but mainly because the film never gets a good rhythm and tone. The end of this movie is extremely ridiculous. I do not recommend while she was out at all. This film commits the capital to being boring.
