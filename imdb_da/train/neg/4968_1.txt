I expected the movie based on Grendel, the book written by John Gardner in the late 1970s. It was based on Beowulf epic, but told from the monster. <br /> <br /> Whatever you might think of Gardner's book, a movie based on Beowulf epic shouldn't be right Grendel when it doesn't say anything more about the monster than the few pathetic scenes where the CG monster appears as nothing more than a modified Predator. <br /> In addition, the authors also have to be penalized for turning up the original story so badly and contributing to the continuing growing ignorance of lots of television audiences across the United States. <br /> <br /> Typically Hollywood to get it so wrong. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing and a waste of time.
