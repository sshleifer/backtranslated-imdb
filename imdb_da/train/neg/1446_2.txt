The film is an extra-long tale of a classic novel that completely fails to capture the spirit of the original fairy tale. The dreadful American Patrick Swayze is cast as British hero Allan Quatermain despite his nationality's openness. <br /> <br /> The movie continues all the time to the "Hollywood Ice" story by changing both the plot and the characters to fit more comfortably into the accepted mold. The film manages to be predictable everywhere, even for those who are unfamiliar with history and are plagued by some very bad plays and terribly disappointing fighting sequences. All in all, a horrible addition to the already rather poor collection of films is based on the legend of King Solomon's mines and Allan Quatermain.
