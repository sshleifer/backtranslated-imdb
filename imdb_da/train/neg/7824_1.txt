I watched the movie last night and I really wanted to like it. My expectations for the movie have gone up and down ever since I heard it was made. Some days I would see something spectacular and some days I would be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Yet the kind of fan I am, I had great hopes for this movie, but eventually I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> While I love the Richard Donner movies, I didn't like their sometimes campy nature or the changes they made to Superman's character and his powers. <br /> <br /> However, songs chose to take worst parts of the Donner movies and put them in their version. <br /> <br /> While his Lex Luthor is a little darker, he's still no more than a shyster, a conman and a common criminal. He is no more intelligent than when Gene Hackman played him. Kevin Spacey does his best to play Luthor well, but ultimately he becomes the victim of creepy writing and endless dialogue. <br /> <br /> His minions are more two-dimensional than even comics. Most of them have literally no dialogue in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** SPOILERS AHEAD **** Kitty Kowalski is almost exactly the same character as Mrs Tesmacher. She seems to be as vicious and cold as Lex Luthor, but she turns out to be just a wonder that melts after seeing Superman in trouble and probably confuses Luthor. <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment in the movie was Frank Langella as Perry White. I wasn't a big fan of the Supreme Perry White in the Donner movies, but at least he had a soul. After all, he was a veteran reporter who was concerned about the truth and a good story. Langella's Perry White is nothing but a corporate stooge. He wants everyone to concentrate on Superman-related stories because they sell papers, though all other papers do the same. He doesn't care about the real stories, the real mysteries that the blacks out and what Lex Luthor is so far that he's out of jail. The worst thing about Langella is that he is DULL! Some actors can be quiet and sober, yet have an undercurrent that lets you know that there is still water running deep. Frank Langella is sausage. <br /> <br /> Brandon Routh is not a bad actor. He is OK, but again there is not a single memorable line in the whole movie. Not the actor's fault. His movements are clearly meant to look graceful, as even the slightest movement of his fingers affects the way he flies. But it still looks choreographed and artificial. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane was poorly written surprisingly well-acted by Kate Bosworth. Unfortunately, she is again for a Pulitzer award winning journalist and writer, as eloquent as any teenager at Dawson's Creek. James Marsden was my favorite actor in the whole movie, mostly because he looks more like Superman than even Routh. Without superpowers, he manages to find out Lois Lane's message, flies a plane to the location, boarding Luthor's yacht and rescuing Lois and her son. <br /> <br /> The only moving moment in the movie is when they are all captured pantry, as it is flooded with water and the ship sinks. You see them slowly being immersed in the water. You know that Superman will come by at the last minute to save them, but you still can't help apologizing for them. <br /> <br /> As I said before, the plot is very random. Contrary to Singer, it has said this is not a superhero recurring movie trying to find its place in the world. As soon as he returns, he rejoices with open arms. Lois is the only one who is not happy to see him back. Even Luthor is happy to have Superman back because it gives him a chance to settle with the Superman. Superman is probably one of the stupid heroes in the universe. A large green piece of meteorite is stolen from a museum, Lex Luthor is out of jail, he now has knowledge of superman's powers and weaknesses and yet he is still unable to connect the dots enough to know that Luthor would use kryptonite against him. <br /> <br /> According to the film, the only thing Superman is good at is lifting really really heavy stuff. The action sequences are all incredibly predictable.
