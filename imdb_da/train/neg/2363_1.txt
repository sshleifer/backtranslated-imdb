This movie was just awful, the first movie wasn't that big, I mean, it's ridiculously stupid, if they didn't have enough with the first 5 movies you had to add another, why not make it a running one series like James Bond, I want to tell you exactly why the bondage films are really very good and these movies just stink, I do not understand, should this be a cross between genres like horror and comedy for goodness, my 1 year old niece would do Don't be afraid of such a ridiculous attempt at horror, a saliva on the face of people who will at least be scared at some point in a so-called horror movie. Please no more of these movies.
