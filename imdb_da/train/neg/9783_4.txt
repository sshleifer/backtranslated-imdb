Not the worst movie I've seen but definitely not very good either. I am even a paintball player who used to play airball a lot and going from forest to airball is quite a big change. The film shows similar quality. First of all, the film starts with this team, which apparently tries to shoot this "Phantom" guy or whatever, they seem to be a professional team and wear sweaters and shoot mags, autocockers. A guy sporting a bushy. Not very wrong with the movie, but more how it was perceived it was very cheesy. A bunch of kids, who are the good guys, are woodsball players who don't seem to have much money and have dreams of getting "better weapons". Another team constantly chooses them and insults them because they play forest and blah blah. Phantom helps these woodsball kids out and train them and all this shot, he makes them play airball and basically defeats all the teams, including "professionals". <br /> <br /> So what's wrong with the movie? Reaching the budget is a huge thing, a paintball movie wouldn't be bad, but the budget is pretty low, and the movie feels like it was made by an amateur. There are no big names in this movie and the play is very cheesy. The perception of paintball is also quite poor. They seem to mean that everyone comes to speedball and all this other crap. It was just a miserable movie in my opinion and does not give a real idea what paintball is. To be honest, real paintball is not all friends, it is very cussing and bonus balling not "respect" and playing by the rules. Don't watch this movie and then expect to go to a field that screams "4 is 1 !!"
