I saw this at the premiere in Melbourne <br /> <br /> It's low, two-dimensional, unaffected and hard to believe on the subject, boring. The actors are acceptable, but they don't have much to do with the very plodding and unimpressive script. For those who may have worried that Ned Kelly would be over-intellectualized, you may be comforted that this story of the story is completely without any literary depth whatsoever, told entirely on the surface and full of key casting standards. However, it doesn't seem like a popcorn movie either. Its pacing is for off-kilter and its craftsmanship is too lacking to satisfy even the level of everyday action. I doubt very much that Gregor Jordan could sit back and say to himself "This is the best thing I could have done with the material." <br /> Down Kelly is a fascinating figure and so is it national response to him. Possibly folk music, possibly class warriors, possibly psychopaths and probably all these things, he has dominated Australian true mythology for over 120 years. Once again his story has failed on the big screen. <br /> <br /> That's life.
