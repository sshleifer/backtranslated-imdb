This is one of the worst written movies I've ever had to sit through. <br /> <br /> The story is nothing new - but it's a cartoon, so who cares as long as it's beautiful and fun? <br /> <br /> I'm not going to go as deep as the characterization, or I'll be here all day (except saying no; the characters change personality when it's practical to plot), but who wrote the script and visual direction should be forbidden access to as much as pencil and paper. Thumbs down? I would vote to cut off their thumbs. <br /> <br /> "Narrow on an object / prop. Cut back to character close-up. Character gives a familiar look that the audience doesn't even understand far. Repeat it several times with different objects / props." <br /> <br /> "Do not make the characters aware of all the large clumps of stones floating around, colliding into each other, generally counting destruction everywhere, and who could kill them all at any time - but cause them to stop and grab in fear when they see a harmless appearance, almost pastoral green rock in the distance. "<br /> <br /> All is a variety of events, actions, and behaviors that are only there for the author's convenience, to save him to think or do something to write the story correctly. <br /> <br /> This is Plan 9 of CG cartoons, except that it doesn't have the Ed Wood moaning factor that makes it fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Make a Service: Spend your cartoon budget on Pixar movies.
