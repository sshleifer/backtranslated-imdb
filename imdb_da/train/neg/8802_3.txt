Look, I loved the PROPER Anchorman movie, but it was reaaaaallly bad. The kind of bad that makes you want you to get that time back in your life, the kind of bad that makes you think "what on earth did they think about filming this in the first place", the kind of bad, that makes you wish you had taken 50 minutes when you went into the kitchen to grab a snack under the movie, the kind of bad that makes leprosy look fun, the kind of bad that makes you believe You want you to rent a Pauly Shore movie instead ... I can't explain how bad it was. <br /> <br /> That said ... there were some half-entertaining laughs, but they are all so much less fun than Anchorman. Sure, they were trying to make it entertaining and fun, but the entire sub-plot left by Anchorman who did it here was really left out for a good reason ... it wasn't even a good deal. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor (or in the United States, a favor) and don't look at this DVD ... it will ruin the good movie that Anchorman is and you won't. <br /> <br /> Okay ... I'm okay now.
