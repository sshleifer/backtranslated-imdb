Until the last few minutes of the movie, I would have given the movie a score of 7 or 8 stars. But the end is so horrible and "Hollywoodized" that it undermines the first 80% of the film. <br /> <br /> The reason is about a submarine and the ability to get an order to fire their nuclear missiles. The captain, Gene Hackman, is all about to launch, while his first officer, Denzel Washington, advocates confirming the launch orders first. The problem is to launch both the captain and 1st officer while using their launch keys. Hackman is determined to start and Washington is stuck until it results in armed rebellion on board the base. Eventually, the error is discovered and the missiles are not launched. Cool. But here comes the part that just doesn't ring true. After getting back on land and going before a review card, Washington and Hackman (who have just spent half the movie trying to kill each other) have pushed their hands and are all companions! Huh? Too end one end to make the movie worth for me.
