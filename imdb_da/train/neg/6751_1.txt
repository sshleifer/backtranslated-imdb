My boyfriend and I rented this because we thought it could be a good 'Halloween' take-off. A killer terrorizes young people, a white mask ... you get my drift. We were dead wrong! No sayings are calculated. We have not only discovered one of the worst movies out there, but also that it is a cult classic! It is filled with plot holes and makes no sense. The actor who plays Maddy is beautiful, but it's about it. I give credit for being shot at a very low budget - I always support movies as such. Just not this one. <br /> <br /> This movie can be good to see if you are full or tall; otherwise not bother. Unless you want to lose your movie privileges like I did!
