I saw Cabin by the lake this afternoon in the US. Considering this movie was made for television is interesting enough to see the sequel. So I'm tuning for the aeration tonight and was very disappointed. I knew I didn't like the movie, but I didn't expect to get confused with DV (digital video). The movie would have been tolerable if it were not for those analogous digital images that seemed to come from nowhere. I expected the plot line to bind to these shots, but there seemed no logical explanation. (WARNING: THE FOLLOWING MAYS A SPOILER !!!!) The open end of the cabin by the lake was acceptable, but the open end of the sequel is ridiculous. I can only foresee the Return of Return to The Cabin by the Lake to look at is if the movie was shown against nothing but infomercials at 4 am.
