"The fallen" fall into the wastage of life (WOL) category. I'm sorry I am now two hours older, was not entertained. My other family members also looked at this movie and threw demeaning comments on the screen and messed up the mummy. I was sorry the actors (Wagner). I've read other negative reviews and can't add anything else to this movie than it could be reduced to 25 minutes so it could take a 30 minute slot on TV without a loss of plot. It reminds me of a bowl that has several good ingredients, but when served is bland without taste at all. In my humble opinion, the 42 foot mum should have been 8-10 feet and improved the plot by taking out the mystic and replacing him with more people who want to cushion the facts and want DNA samples for evil reasons. The heroes are discredited and thrown at the ear of their colleges. Later, everything was turned up by the evil people. The heroes would save the day and prove all wrong.
