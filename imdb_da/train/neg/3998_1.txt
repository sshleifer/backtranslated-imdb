Can you say "All shock, no plot?" There were so many unexplored directions in this movie. There was no story about the room other than the deaths. * WHY * was it bad? What did it do that way? Why an "hour" countdown? Then, the unexplored things were suggested; For example, we saw a camera in the air valve as he mentioned. But when he climbed the wait, there was no camera. <br /> <br /> What about the fact that all the ghosts looked "digital" and things "flashed out" before you hit the ground and made a static noise? Hmmm ... when you put all * these * things together, room 1408 looks like a high-tech haunted house. Except that there was no follow-up on it. <br /> <br /> Oh ... by the way ... the electronics don't work in 1408. Now, apart from the television ... the mobile phone has no signal, but wireless internet works fine. How many incontinities can you add? I'm sorry, but this movie was nothing more than "shock after shock". It has all been done before. Reflections in the mirror. Things just outside the place. Changing paintings. Bleeding walls. "Oh, it was just a dream ... no it wasn't." And if the room was "evil," why do our protagonist come to terms with his daughter's death if it were to keep him trapped there forever? It just didn't make sense. <br /> <br /> There was no background information on "The First Book" he wrote. Only some vague information about "Dad was a dunk" and so on. Talking about father, what was it about his father in a minute? "You're going to be in my place". <br /> <br /> All in all, a really horrible movie. It was 100% adrenaline shock factor without new or innovative effects, and certainly no back story, character development, etc. My overall impression is that the whole movie was made on "Cheap"; by virtue of a set and a few placement images, and was merely an action film of recycled, cheesy, set-to-before effects.
