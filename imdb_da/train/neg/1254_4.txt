I have seen and wanted the original movie, and expected more from a remake than this. GOOD: Effects and makeup are good. No complaints about scores and visuals, they are appropriate, and the performance was okay (Tim Roth was excellent, the other principles were fine, and a handful of "supportive support actors" did really well with extremely limited roles). The action scenes were exciting and fun. <br /> <br /> BATH: The trip from the monkey was horrible. The signs go in circles, then there is suddenly a place in the middle of the city that is tunnels to escape. Plus, which flight route leads through everyone's bedroom? <br /> <br /> The story was paired to include as much action as possible. I like action scenes, but the original movie had more meat for it and deserved more respect. Finally, the end was completely obscene as presented. Without seeing the inevitable successor, there is no justification for it. <br /> <br />
