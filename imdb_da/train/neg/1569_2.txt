Weak plot, unlikely car errors and helpless fumbling signs. First, I thought this movie was made during the seventies, as the picture quality as well as the big line and the drama seemed to be taken from an old Kojac episode. When I checked and found out that it was really made as late as -97, I was astonished. This is by far one of the worst and least (thriller) movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> If you read this, be aware that if you see it, you waste time when you could have done something more exciting, like seeing paint dry.
