I love Anthony Hopkins as an actor, so I was very interested in seeing how he would do as an author / instructor. I couldn't have been more disappointed with this step. The film was so uneven, and the cinematography was so finished to the point I wanted to pull the plug out of the wall. The actors were very good, but it was such a waste of talent. Not all actors are cut out to be writers or directors and clearly, Mr. Hopkins falls into this category. Of all the movies I've ever seen in my 50's, this is definitely the worst movie ever. Please make all of us a favor, Mr Hopkins, and stick to plays that you are excellent at and leave the writing and instruct those who are talented in those areas. If I could give this movie a rating less than one, I would have decided.
