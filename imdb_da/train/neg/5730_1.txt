Where to start? The terrible play? The obscene plot? Negotiate basement effects? The completely disgusting characters? The choppy editing? Headache causing Casio keyboard score ??? The embarrassing racist remarks ("Watch it, Charlie!", "Back off, Jackie Chan !!"? The constant misogyny ??? I am a lifelong horror fan, and I have no problem at all with the current "torture -The "The trend of movies. But this is a badly made waste. I think I have a little more pain in seeing this than the characters died in it! If you like girls who are forced to eat the shaken penis, the really bad soft core porn and thinking lines like "i find the b **** and staple her c *** close !!" is clever, LIVE FEED is for you. <br /> <br /> As for me , I feel it is necessary to wash my eyes out with the oven cleaner to prevent me from ever seeing this movie again!
