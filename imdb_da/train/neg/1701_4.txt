David Lynch's raw and rough excerpt at South Park presents us with a nightmare of disruptive suburban middle class clich√©s. The father is a fierce monster with three teeth, and a disproportionate circular mouth from which pronounced the most terrible guttural sounds, the son and mother are permanently terrible, incoherent creatures for whom terror is a lifestyle. Lynch is not famous for his comedies (ie on the air, aspects of Wild at Heart), and I'm not particularly fond of comedies in general. There were, however, a few scenes in Dumbland that made me laugh out loud. There are some clever pieces of animated filmography - where Lynch conveys wide response areas in his characters through a syntactic arrangement of shots as opposed to facial expressions (which never really vary in Dumbland). I think Lynch was really trying to give his audience a straight-forward, if disruptive, animated comedy here. Interestingly, he chose to keep up with the latest wave of ultra-low-brow humor (ie most Will Farrell films), while adding elements of vicious social criticism and classical comics and gross humor. Although the mix does not work really well here, it is not something if not Lynchian. Worth seeing Lynch fans.
