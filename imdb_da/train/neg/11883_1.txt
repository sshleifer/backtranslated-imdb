After waking at 3:30 in the morning and unable to sleep, I decided to be entertained while suffering from insomnia. This movie was on HBO and I decided to watch it. What a mistake! <br /> <br /> Here's the plot (potential spoilers if you even care): A neurotic man with an addiction to candy (Josh Kornbluth) seems like a temp to some ridiculous company. Suddenly he offered the chance to "go perm", which seems to be favorite movie from this movie. But with a secure job and a secure income within his understanding, Josh decides for whatever stupid reason he doesn't want to. He hopes hopelessly several minor tasks, and his laziness and lack of ambition fills me with contempt. His inability to send several "very important" letters within a given time is supposed to be fun, but is just stupid. Josh meets and cheats a lawyer's wife and they close together in bed together (of course, a fantasy of Josh's in real life, since such a thing would never happen). A lot of other things are happening, but it is too tired to go into now. Despite the fact that this movie is billed as a comedy, I shot only twice during that; The first time was Josh Kornbluth's opening shot (my first reaction was one of stifling fears) and the other was when he was in bed with the attractive woman (yes, right). Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the most scary look I've ever seen in my life. He is an unattractive, overweight, bald Jewish man whom I have to believe in having sex with beautiful women. I don't even sympathize with Josh's character at all. He is lazy and unmotivated, and I do not appreciate the failed attempts at humor. Skip it, even if your life depends on it.
