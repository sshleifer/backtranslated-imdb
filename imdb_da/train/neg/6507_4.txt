You know it will be a cheesy movie when: <br /> <br /> 1. It was made for the 50s 2. It is in black and white. 3. It has no names actors! 4. Screaming makes up for the lack of special effects! <br /> <br /> Well not to be obsolete - This movie brilliantly incorporated all four of the above elements to make this a real movie blunder. <br /> Okay - shhhhh but I'm going to discuss special effects here - or lack of them - <br /> <br /> Did you get the underwater scenes? It seems that it was poorly filmed through an aquarium - note the captain clapping the breeze. <br /> <br /> And the repeated reuse of Stock Footage (exterior home pictures, bridges scenes - greatly improved KRAF-Tiness of this movie - not since "PLAN 9" - I've seen such creative use of stock footage. <br> /> <br /> And hi, where special effects were missing - don't worry - scream the place for special effects in this movie too. Yes this movie even used the old hack trick. Get hold of popcorn - put your brain on the stun (More fermented drinks help DEFINITELY), sit back and wonder: Why the hell did they put this on film again? <br /> <br /> Wayno <br /> <br />
