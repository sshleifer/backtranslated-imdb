What a horrible movie. I love monster flicks, but I couldn't see even half of the horrible actors, cardboard characters and spooky special effects. There is nothing redeeming about this movie. The signs come from either an endless supply of suicidally stupid gun lining, or else they are vacuum, uninspiring socks. The reason is formal, cut and paste, standard science-run-amok drift. Even CGI is terrible. You know it's bad when you can't even depend on the movie to give some good eye light. No surprises here, just the same old same old one. This really is one of the worst movies ever made. Director Roger Corman should hang from a lamp so children can use him as a pinata.
