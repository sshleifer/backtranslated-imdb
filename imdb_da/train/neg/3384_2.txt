If you were judging from the movie alone, the committee that gave the stage musical "A Chorus Line" was a Pulitzer Prize and Broadway audience who held the war horse for 15 years, all on heavy drugs because a singular feeling this movie is certainly not. <br /> <br /> What had anyone think Richard Attenborough was the right kind of material mystifies me completely, but he does a musical, almost exclusively about motion, just sitting on the screen like a lump of clay . <br /> <br /> Not satisfied with the original score as it was originally written, someone decided that what the movie really needed was a brand new song to give the movie some zip. Thus, we are assaulted with the Oscar-nominated (!) "Surprise, Surprise." Good surprise, surprise, the song stinks, and the movie does. <br /> <br /> Degree: D
