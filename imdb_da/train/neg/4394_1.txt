The John Goodman program was pretty terrible, but it just stinks. The only thing in this mess that made me smile was to recognize Patrick Starfish's voice as Frosty. The story is hopeless, written by someone who has been reminiscent of childhood rebellion, but has never had any adult sense of perspective in the intervening years. Paranoia regulates the dark world that these characters reside. Everyone is unpleasant and without reason. The reason is predictable, but the show is lured from an inexplicable, unrelated scene to another in such a meaningless way, it's not fun to see it. The worst thing is that no one in the production crew seems to have seen snow!
