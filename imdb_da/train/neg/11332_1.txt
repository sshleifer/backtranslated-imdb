As big as a Texas prairie and just as boring. Even Liz Taylor, James Dean, Chill Wills and Dennis Hopper can't float this overbloated boat. Taylor actually seems bad - wrong wardrobe, wrong hair and wrong makeup - a unique achievement in her remarkable career. Hopper gives the only credible performance, and the dean of the climatic scene shows a remarkable talent as something we normally don't remember him for - a comic actor. Rock Hudson is his usual prototype of Barbie Doll Ken and makes one wonder what one says Redford could have done with the male management. There is no traceable plot that gives tension to the last 20 minutes, just a pastiche of milestones that have little relationship to each other. Apart from Hopper, there is no sign development, only a collection of cardboard cutouts that are regularly skipped without any notable reason as random targets in a shooting game. For its credit, the movie tackles racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo topics, and it has SIZE, making it an extreme choice to tear yourself away from unwelcome home guests. Those with the DVD version can save themselves some of the tea by starting with the other disc. You will not lack anything of interest.
