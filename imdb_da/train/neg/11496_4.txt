a traded / manipulated documentary about one of the darkest places in Guatemala. portrayed as a fun, safe ... but sad place where a lot of sex workers are going to play in a football team, gathered in what doesn't look like more than a week! The main focus of the documentary is to prove that society rejects this kind of "workers", although no solution is achieved for these poor women, except that the people who documented this made them a kind of "stars" (like the title says) in exchange for being exploited to make this reality show documentary. however, it has its own documented reality ... but unfortunately it has nothing to do with the main story. I would not accept seeing it again; but I would only recommend it for general cultural purposes.
