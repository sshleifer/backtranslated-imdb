The Wicker Man, starring Nicolas Cage, is by no means a good movie, but I can't really say it's one I regret to see. I could go on and on about the negative aspects of the movie, such as the horrible play and the long scenes where Cage is looking for the girl, has a hallucination followed by another hallucination followed by a dream sequence with hallucination, etc. ., but it's just not worth staying at when it comes to a movie like this. Instead, here are five reasons why you should see The Wicker Man, though it's bad: <br /> <br /> 5. It's hard to deny that it has some really scary ideas for it. The only problem is in its cheeses, unintentional fun execution. Otherwise, it is a movie that can inspire you to watch the original movie from 1973, or even read the short story on which it is based. <br /> <br /> 4. For a cheesy horror / thriller, it's really aesthetically pleasing. It is quite obvious that it was filmed on the spot instead of using green screen or elaborate sets, so we will see some very nice scenes. There are also many neatly composed shots. It's a very nice movie. <br /> <br /> 3. Nicolas Cage is not so much an actor as he is a natural force. Whether you are a fan of his or her, it seems impossible for Cage to play a "normal guy". There is always some kind of eccentricity or nerdiness he brings to the characters he plays, and I am always fascinated by seeing him in any movie he makes. Whether Nicolas Cage is big or awful, he always brings his unique energy to the game, and he is never boring to see. He is horrible in The Wicker Man, but in the most wonderful kind of way. <br /> <br /> 2. A student might write a hell of paper on this movie as it seems to be the strongest anti-feminist movie ever made. "See?" You could write, "This is what happens when women are allowed to run a community!" The similarities between this "Summersisle" community and a biocolony are also quite interesting and worth noting. <br /> <br /> 1. If you read this, there is probably a good chance that you may have seen a YouTube video that has become very popular: a collection of "highlights" from the movie, including Cage that runs around in a bear's clothes and of course the infamous "AAGHH !! THE BEES !! MY EYES !!!" line. These scenes are hilarious outside the context, and they are still quite fun while watching them in the film's entirety. <br /> <br /> I bought the used DVD at Blockbuster for about $ 5 ... when you work it out, it's about a dollar a. reason. It's a really good deal. NOTE: The unclassified version of the movie is the best to watch, and it is better to see the theatrical version just for its little addition to the epilogue, which includes a James Franco cameo.
