This movie sucked. It was really a waste of my life. The play was horrible, the plot totally incredible. Long, long story short, these people are "terrorized" by this pathetic "bile killer", but completely fail to fight back in any way. And it is after they take a fleet on a camping trip, without gear, and pop up at a campsite that is already assembled and filled with food and clothes and daughters headphones. In addition, after their boat disappears, they panic that they are stuck in the woods, but then daughters show their boyfriend just up, and they apparently never seem to just walk out of the forest as he did to get to them. As I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend talk to you to see it.
