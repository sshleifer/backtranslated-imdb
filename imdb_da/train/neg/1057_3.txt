I'm sorry I had great hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, it was too long, too thin and too weak to keep my attention. When I realized that the whole movie was only about an older guy who revived his dream, I felt cheated. It might have been a unit to bring us into something deeper, something more meaningful. <br /> <br /> Don't buy a big drink or run to the rest of the room. My kids didn't enjoy it either. Oh good.
