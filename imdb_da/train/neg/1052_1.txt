***** This review may have SPOILERS - but this provision would be negligible in such a classic and well-known story ***** <br /> <br /> The CINDERELLA story goes like my favorite adventure. The world will never have enough of this wonderful story. <br /> <br /> The problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the story. This may not work if the story deviates or tries to throw some interesting ideas along with some magical photographs and delicious looking designs with poor direction and editing. <br /> <br /> This Cinderella story is more like an Ugly Duckling who never breaks or rather gets converted into a swan. <br /> <br /> The production value that money can buy cannot buy good movie optimization and dramatic development - or good acting. <br /> <br /> The entry of Cinderella into the ball so badly made, there was no drama of expectation or excitement at the discovery. The scripture also made me very nervous. Prince Charming was the most unwanted memory. Why would a girl want to marry a boorish, self-absorbed prince who didn't like women? <br /> <br /> Turner's turn to the Stepmother role was an embarrassingly painful display that showed more than one acting act. <br /> <br /> Even the Cinderella section had little interest or sympathy. <br /> <br /> Maybe only one sentence will describe this experiment: So cheap '90s, <br /> <br /> What to mention and mention in shameful profits is the brilliant photography, math work and production design . It was a pleasure to browse through the landscapes, sets and settings that the story unfolded. <br /> <br /> For some Cinderella storytelling, go to two gems: <br /> <br /> 1) Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella Musical with Lesley Ann Warren. Even with the obvious stagey TV - 60s look for the sets, this is the best version on celluloid - bar none. An all star cast does everything to give the highest entertainment. Engaging, diverting and memorable writing and music. This is the classic one. <br /> <br /> 2) Ever Drew - this Drew Barrymore gem maintains the historical perspective, changing the story line, but not enough to track the effective development of the key points of this classic story. The letters and all the supporting roles were written smartly and acted well.
