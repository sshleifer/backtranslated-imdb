I would like to say that unlike many of the people who did not like this movie and found it impossible to understand, I was fully able to understand it for what it is. A very incoherent attempt at a plot. <br /> <br /> I don't like to throw this word around, but in this case it fits very well. The director first presents material in an extremely "arrogant" way and worse, extremely incoherent. It is incoherent because it presents the material in an eerily abandoned order, which makes us believe that the director was too full to remember which scenes come first and arrogantly in the 2 hours long they expect us, the viewer of CARE by the end of it. <br /> <br /> I respect the surreal cinema for what it is. (Creates a story about a more than real world that does not bind to real life). But there is nothing surrealistic about having a story placed in ordinary modern times and a modern earth setting, most importantly not able to engage the audience but additionally simply a repressed series of events that barely link. The most accurate way to describe the experience of watching this movie is like seeing a story; perhaps even a very good story as it was based on a book, but is frustrated by the fact that the camera does not seem to capture the necessary moments and link any kind of context. <br /> <br /> Let's compare the stylistic cinema. Compare Gaspar Noe's "Seul contre tous" to this. He gave us a coherent, extremely engaging and intellectually deep story. This film offers no intellectual inquiry, and although it is very stylistic in its fragmented presentation, the director has ultimately abandoned the essential art of good storytelling, and all we are left with is a mess of events that barely link. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's possible to make sense of things .... to a point. But as I said earlier, the viewer comes to a stage where they just say "Who cares." It looks like a boring everyday story of a man going to a supermarket and buying groceries in a chronological order. Even with murder, it is completely uninteresting and unengaging. For many people these days will give high marks to something they cannot understand or sense, simply for fear of looking foolish, and in any way PRESS this movie to make the viewer look stupid. <br /> <br /> If you have too much time on your hands, please watch this movie taking into account what I have said about it. It is a story based on a book that could have been presented in a much more effective way and that is my bottom line argument.
