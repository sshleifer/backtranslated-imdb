This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I had to get up and leave at Tape 4, but I put it out. I consider myself a masochist! Afghanistan? Come on, boys! Who is the idiot who forgot to hide Sanskrit billboards? I thought the main actor (George Calil) was extremely unlucky. Aside from the bad plays and over zealous camera shakes, I thought to use the events of 9/11 as a reason to make "Larson the Lunatic Implodes, over a screen near you" shameful and irreversible to the victims on the 9 / 11th Using a phone call from Larson's wife, Sarah, allegedly from one of the terrorist aircraft on that day, was scary. The camera's shaking didn't make me feel sick, the cold-hearted stunt did.
