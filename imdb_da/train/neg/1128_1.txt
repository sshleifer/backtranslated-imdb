This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen. Clean drivel. How someone could develop a connection with the hero or have empathy for her is beyond me. I felt I was looking at a case story of a schizoid person with borderline personality disorder. Just awful. <br /> <br /> In its most generous light, this can be seen as an attempt to produce and "art" films - unless I couldn't find any art at all. <br /> <br /> If this woman had lived in today's world, she would have been whisked out to a mental institution and given a few days of treatment with antipsychotic drugs. It, or simply allowed to walk around the streets and become a bag woman. Why other characters in this movie found something redeeming in her - and tried to help her in her quest to become an actress - speak more to their pathology than any convincing features she had that made her that value.
