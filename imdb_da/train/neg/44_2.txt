Not sure if I am referring to those who have marked this for a video nasty or for the director ... "Devil Hunter" is definitely a bizarre "horror movie". The plot is a loosey goosey combo of superior movies like "Cannibal Ferox" and "Cut and Run." Chick is kidnapped in the 'jungle' of a 'tribe' of 'savages'. The jungle looks more like a park somewhere in Mexico. The tribe is like a group of hippies that go around in Party City-style Halloween costume renderings of tribal garb. And the wilderness of race from white to Asian to black to Latin American. I suppose Franco just grabbed someone who even looked a bit ethnic for this drum. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, this movie ultimately does, no real scary and a lot of unnecessary penis. Not funny. I can find something to like in almost any sleazy Italian or Euro-trash movie; This one just fell way short. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 children.
