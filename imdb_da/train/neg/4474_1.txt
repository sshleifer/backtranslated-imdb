waste of my life .... the director must be embarrassed. Why people feel they need to make worthless movies will never make sense to me. when she died at the end, it made me laugh. I had to change the channel many times throughout the movie because I was embarrassed to see such bad deals. Hopefully the guy playing Heath will never work again. In addition, I hope the director will never make another movie and have his paycheck taken back to this crap. {.02 out of 10}
