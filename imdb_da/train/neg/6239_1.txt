Where was his criticism of democratic authorities and Republican ones? After all, he served 17+ years in a governmental body where his influence was unfathomable. Oh I forgot those 8 years, he was the 2nd command of the most powerful nation on earth. The movie is happy to show off a young senator Gore asks why a NASA scientist was forced to change a conclusion in his scientific paper but fails to ask Clinton / Gore's involvement in global warming. Probably too close to an election year, or maybe it would hurt the chances of Hillary in '08. No matter what he is a political sweep and partyman to the bitter end. He gives no criticism of consumerism, no criticism of capitalism, no way is the history of industrial development that has led us to this time in time. In the end, the film was much more about Mr. Do yourself than any real problems our environment faces. Mr. Gore, if you really wanted to make a campaign game - shorten it and call it what it really is.
