<br /> <br /> The movie starts out as a regular comic-hero movie. It's about the boy who is picked, has no parents and is in love with the school's # 1 girl. Nothing surprises in the movie, there is nothing that you can't guess in the movie. Toby Mcguire shows us that he is also not a good actor or that no actor in the world can save a script like this. Perhaps children around 10 can enjoy the movie, but it is a little violent for the youngest. You can't get away from thinking of movies like X-Men, Batman and Spawn. All these titles are better. I almost went out the last 20 minutes! One thing that could have been good was the computer animation, BUT not even that is something to put in the Christmas tree! So, my recommendation: Don't watch this movie, even if you get paid for it!
