I usually try to be professional and constructive when criticizing movies, but my GOD !!! This was the worst movie I've ever seen. Bad plays, bad effects, bad script, bad everything! <br /> <br /> The plot follows a group of teenage cliches on their way to a rave (going in broad daylight) on a remote island. But when the group arrives, all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes. Determined to find out what happened to the rest of the parties, the clan's set is on a mission through a zombie-infected forest. During this crusade, they are helped by a political chick and a sea captain who just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the children. They also meet with Jonathan Cherry and some other survivors. Basically, the rest of the movie is a collection of badly-directed action sequences, including a far too long shootout outside the "dead house". This match was complete with cheesy Hollywood violence, redundant clips from the HOTD video game and sloppy matrix-esque camera rotations. One of the character's regular volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others. Why? Not because he was noble and brave, but because part of his face was shaken by acid, a zombie jumped at him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been deactivated! I'm supposed to be sorry this guy?!? <br /> <br /> To sum it up, there is absolutely no point in watching this movie unless you want to see for yourself how terrible it is. The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I'm sure the money I wasted seeing this piece could easily cover the costs it took to do so. GRADE: F
