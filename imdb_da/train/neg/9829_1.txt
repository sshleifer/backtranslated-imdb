The premise sucked me in, but it was clear in 30 seconds that it was either David Lynch or something seriously terrible. Interesting to see just to run through the fundamentalist laundry list. I can be a sucker for a burgeoning spiritual piece (Romero comes to think), but there was nothing spiritual at all about this. The message seems to be that we all have to pretend we have an IQ of 80 (or just get a lobotomy - Jennifer, what happened to you?) And blindly follow the Bible without any self-examination whatsoever, or we triggers the second coming. It's the kind of attitude that makes people fly jumbo jets in 110 story buildings (I work around the corner from the site of the former WTC). I like to believe that God is a little bigger than that.
