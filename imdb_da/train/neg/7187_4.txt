Here we go with other slasher movies, Looking people and Handler from everyone was really good! Few kids play pranks phones calls and there parents are killed by the killer in front of the kids! 20 years after they are still friends, they go to big house, have fun, drugs and sex (no nudity) for at least half an hour in the movie! Again they start making prank phone calls all the time again! And then the killer comes back and kills them one by one, and the killer is in BIG BLACK COAT with ax just like Urban Legend movie, <br /> <br /> The death scene really weird, really odd times too. <br /> <br /> Nice slasher movies on this part would give 7/10, but the twist at the end of the movie made the whole movie a little meaningless <br /> <br /> The Twist killed the movie to me so I want to give it 4/10
