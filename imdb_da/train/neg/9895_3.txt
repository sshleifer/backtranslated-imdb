If this book remained true to the book, we can only assume that the author was unaware of the story. Mark Anthony never died of injuries achieved in battle as depicted. He died a coward's death by committing suicide, and even then he asked his slave to do it for him. The slave chose to kill himself instead. In the real story, Mark Anthony was ashamed of the slave's great dignity and decided to copy him. But even in death, Mark Anthony was a drunken failure and failed in his own suicide attempt. He shouted at Cleopatra and was taken to her, bleeding. She picked up her litter on rope and Mark Anthony died a while later. If you want history, don't watch this movie. If you want romantic drive then you will probably enjoy it!
