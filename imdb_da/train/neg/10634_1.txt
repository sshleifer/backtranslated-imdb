Writer / Director Bart Sibrel bases his work here on a movie box, which he says was mistakenly sent to him by NASA. He says it shows that the astronauts are failing the television footage of their trip to the moon by using the camera tricks. The astronauts were in low Earth circuits all the time, and ground editors composed this raw recording for just a few seconds of finished film. Unfortunately, Sibrel's research is so scary that he is unaware of his "backstage" recordings are really taken largely from the 30-minute live telecast (also on the coil) seen by millions, not hidden away in NASA vaults as he suggests. And we have to wonder why Sibrel puts his own conspiracy story of the astronauts' sound in the footage, because the astronauts in their own words make it clear that the astronauts just tested the camera and did not record. <br /> Finally, someone can see the raw material for himself without having to buy Sibrel's hacked-up version of it. (He shows you more of the Zapruder movie in JFK's murder than on his "smoking gun".) Sibrel thinks he's the only one to have seen it. What is more revealing is clips from the raw recordings that Sibrel chose NOT to use, such as those that clearly show that the appropriate remote Earth is obscured by the window frames, etc., which destroys his claim that matting and transparencies were placed in the spacecraft's windows to create the illusion of a distant land. <br /> <br /> As with most movies of this type, Sibrel relies on insinuation, inexperienced assumption, misleading commentary, and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer to accept a conclusion that is not a bunch of actual evidence.
