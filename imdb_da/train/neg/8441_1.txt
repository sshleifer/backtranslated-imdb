This movie was long and boring. Surprisingly, it was chosen for Cannes, although they tend to suffer pretentiousness. The point is that, unlike other Dutch stars of the artist like Kerkhof and Kruishoop, Guernsey feels completely empty. Even more, it has no cinematic quality at all. A long opening image does not mean cinematic depth, it is just a long boring shot. The story was not interesting, and the characters had problems I couldn't identify with at all. The actors did not shine under their direction and often seemed lost. Leopold tried, but she's not the talent I hoped she'd be. Where is Kerkhof and Kruishoop? They really made some waves in Dutch cinema. Leopold did just another attempt.
