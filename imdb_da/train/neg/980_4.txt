My first full Heston movie. The movie, as already at the end of. A "Sci Fi Thriller". The campy factor. Everything that goes with this movie was sprayed in my head when I rented it, and in the morning I saw it, it was the perfect movie to watch in the mood I was in (Don't want to move. hide in carpets). And even though I tried to understand what happened to lead to the end, which will be forever destroyed by the pop culture, it just didn't. Everything was everywhere, relationships had no backbone, the end had no joints in. Everything was just kind of there in a bit freakish manner, and the guard has no choice but to leave partially dumbfounded in the end that it comes to because even though we all Knowing that they are people is the quick answer to why people are making a serious attempt to enjoy the movie for something other than silliness thrown out of the window.
