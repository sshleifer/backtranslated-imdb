I couldn't believe it when I put this movie in my DVD player. I thought I would have a good laugh as I played D&D for half my life. I had to turn it off when I had a business, and they wondered what shit I saw. <br /> <br /> Finished it later, and I should have just left it at the soft core gay clown at the beginning. No, they run for speeding, cum jokes, incest, racism, dressing up like KKK ... This movie is flat means everyone who has ever played D & D. No wonder it looks like Real D & D would Don't let them use their games. Who wants their name attached to this?
