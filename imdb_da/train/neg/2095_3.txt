Battlestar Gallactica was so big because it had tight writing, good looks, excellent actors and interesting stories ... AND yes, the hot men and women ran around in and out of uniform. <br /> <br /> Caprica was just lazy. Lazy writing. Actors smoke up a storm to give them "character". Outdoor sequences that destroy the feeling of being somewhere else (yes it is a Ford Focus meeting in the background). Lots of teenage anxiety. Lots of gyrating naked women (but in the background. As I'm sure will be cut to the series) and a token image of some men in towels. None of the players, except Polly Walker, took my attention at all. In an hour and a half, I was still wondering when it should be over. So what's the matter of bringing me back? Science fiction? It's terrible light on it. The actors? Besides Polly Walker's nice trip, there is not much interesting to be done here. There is not even any "hotties" in the cast, except perhaps Esai, but for the younger set he is quite old as he is over 25. <br /> <br /> I loved BSG. I was skeptical when I heard about Caprica, and unfortunately I think I'm right. I foresee a very short period of time as a series unless they really sharpen their pencils on SciFi and are going to do this more than The OC on another planet.
