This probably doesn't fit in the bottom of the barrel of mediocre Slasher movies, but it's certainly a damn bad movie. The holiday award made it interesting, but after the first scenes, the film demonstrates that it is poor production values ​​and stupid plot. I believe that the subgenre is currently about an invisible lunatic who scares teenagers for no apparent reason, but this took it too far. There is absolutely no connection in the events or nothing else to add. <br /> <br /> Cliches are more than boring, gore is minimal and so does the mystery. <br /> <br /> This is a rather mediocre slasher entry that should not be hyped even though it has a video nastie label. <br /> <br /> I'm really disappointed with this overvalued piece of waste.
