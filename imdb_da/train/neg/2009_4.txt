This is not a bad movie. The reason (new house built next door seems to be haunted) is not bad, the atmosphere is scary enough, and the play is okay. The big problem I had is to be familiar with Lara Flynn Boyle (from Twin Peaks and other shows), I couldn't get over how different she looks with her seemingly new big lips. I kept staring at them. They look so out of place on her face! They make her look completely different (and not better). Mark-Paul Gosselaar, the actor who plays Kim the architect, who designs and leans his heart and soul into the house, does a good job. And Lara (as Col) is also pretty good (but they lips!) As the owner of the house next door. Her husband, Walker (Colin Ferguson) is the appropriate tree. The various characters living in the house were also fine. I especially liked Pie (Charlotte Sullivan) and her husband, Buddy (Stephen Amell), the first people to move into the house. Unfortunately, the attempt to get involved in the overall neighborhood meeting fails because the other neighbors are not particularly sympathetic. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the director was unable to make the "haunted" house particularly scary. Other movies (such as Amityville Horror, The Legend of Hell House) are able to achieve the eerie feeling, but it just doesn't happen here. The closest is when Col paints a depiction of the house. Another thing that didn't work for me is the plot twist that arises with Kim, the architect. Initially, he appears to be the victim of the house like the others (it has sucked him dry with inspiration), but later he seems to have merged with it in evil. Overall, not bad movies for horror fans if you can take your eyes off the big lips!
