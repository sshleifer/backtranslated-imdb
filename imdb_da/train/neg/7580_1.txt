This was a horrible movie. Basically, Jane March was a half Korean North Korean spy sent by Kim Jong Il to do something terrible to the US forces in South Korea. She becomes a girl for an American military family, they consider all her as Korean even though she looks more white (I think the actress is either 1/4 or 1/8 Southeast Asia, not Korean at all) and the teenage girl of the household starts hating her and end up sleeping with her. The way Korea and the US military in Korea are depicted is absolutely crazy. Of course, the screenwriter and director were, of course, white men who have never spent a day in Korea before this movie and did not intend to show any real insight into life in Korea for either Koreans or American GIs and instead tried to fulfill their pathetic Asiaphile fantasies irrespective of how amazingly it made the film. Anyone who has ever been to Korea will know that this is complete garbage. In the end, the North Korean honhyol spy girl is killed, in a blatantly "paying for her sins" way. Very poor movie with a television feels like it.
