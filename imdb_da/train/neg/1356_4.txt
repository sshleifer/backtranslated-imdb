First and foremost, I totally disagree with the user who calls this a "spoof". Crispin Glover is very serious about his film. He personally introduced the film to the screening I saw in Chicago. He had been working on the film for years, and it is the first in a particular trilogy. "What is it?" is Crispin Glover's attempt at an art film in the vein of those he idolizes by Herzog, Lynch, etc. <br /> <br /> I had heard rumors about this movie many years ago "epic porn movie with all down syndrome cast directed by crispin glover ". When it finally came out, I saw the trailer online and read the synopsis, and I foamed in the mouth with expectation. ... I went to Chicago to see it and it was a big disappointment. If he took out the bitch sh * t, like the pot smoker and the dancing dolls, he would be left with something much better, but only about. 10 minutes long. <br /> <br /> In other words, just watch the trailer, be entertained, and let it be. There are some striking images and amazing juxtapositions and phrases, but its lack of focus is disappointment.
