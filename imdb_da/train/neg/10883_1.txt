This movie was not programmed on Italian cinemas, I have seen it on a manifestation called "fanta festival". I find it horrible because some scenes seem like music videos chaotic and dark, the use of fluorescent colors is ridiculed and there is no suspension in movies. Music is completely out of the story, and I have no words to describe the visual effects. If you look at the first scene, the movie looks interesting, but a few minutes later it gets busy. The story is interesting, but the development needs a complete review.
