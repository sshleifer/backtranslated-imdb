The heart of this movie was in the right place, no matter where the brain was. <br /> <br /> "Attack" is basically a spoof of la "Airplane!" (two years before the facts - good time.) of what happens when vegetables or in this case fruits attack. <br /> <br /> Through all kinds of movie magic (stop motion, papier-mache tomatoes on skateboards, reverse filming, people watching tomatoes on the screen, people throwing tomatoes with basketball size on the screen actors), the tomatoes are all attacking in their green grip. <br /> <br /> Then it's up to Mason Dixon (Miller) and a group of spies I wouldn't want on any government side to save the day. Of course, there is a reporting reporter (Taylor) who enters the worst times, dances and sings army soldiers, Japanese scientists with encoded voices, a guy pulling around a parachute and a samurai sword ... and oh yes, San Diego Chicken before he made it big. <br /> <br /> The gags here are not that big. In fact, you can do better even after seeing these. Some of the dialogue is extremely bad ("Beware of the ketchup" - nothing to say in front of tomatoes.) And as far as "Puberty Love" goes ... well, I can't blame the tomatoes for shrinking to hear it. <br /> <br /> What's good about it? Well, I liked the theme song and the beginning credits, and there was a scene with four people on the phone at once, it was pretty well executed. ... it's about it. <br /> <br /> Three stars. Not a "Killer" comedy, but it tries. <br /> <br /> Rock on, Peace.
