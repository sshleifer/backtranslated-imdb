I found this movie to be a good idea that didn't deliver. It appears that they have found a way to build excitement, but could not bestow their payouts very well. In one case, the police are around the clock to find the hideout for the kidnappers. They go carefully from the dentist to the dentist to match a dental record. At the same time, the kidnapped man (Mason) escapes through the elevator shaft. After all, the police come at the same time as he gets free, which is largely anti-climatic. There are also great narrative scenes that take us "in the thought" of the terrorized man and wife who detract from the tension instead of adding it. We are fully aware of their tensions, and voice-over is an insult and deprives the viewer of any chance of a personal experience with the fear that Hitchcock showed over and over is far more effective. The biggest disappointment is to sit through the entire movie and get the fast, rather gentle end. I mean it just ... "ends" in a string.
