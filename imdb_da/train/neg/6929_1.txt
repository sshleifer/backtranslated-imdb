I read reviews on this movie and decided to give it a shot. I'm an open minded guy, and I've given good reviews to some pretty bad flicks. When the final credits rolled on this, I searched for meaning and something nice to say. Here goes: "This movie was mercifully short." That's all I have. <br /> <br /> Okay, okay. The sets and pictures were well finished, and the music helped live up to the mood of the asylum scene, but the movie was painful to watch, and the endless dialogue took away the good bits. I found myself laughing at this movie, but the way you laugh at your best friend who just embarrassed a large crowd. <br /> <br /> At the time of the "chicken dance" in the final, I had decided to just poke and roll the movie and let the bodies fall where they fall. I don't know what could have saved this movie. The play was not bad, and it looked like it had a budget, but there was just no way to make it look. not even the presence of beautiful bare breasts. Maybe I should have kicked a doobie or drank a lot of beer to get the movie's full experience. Either way, I don't see the movie again unless I'm really depressed. Then I can tell myself "At least I wasn't in" Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon. "I'm better than the guys."
