This mess is so bad that it doesn't even qualify as horror. <br /> <br /> Debbie Rochon's talent is totally wasted in this movie. She's not even the villain. The rest of the actors look like porn wannabes and the plot is so paralyzing, I won't even mention it. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a favor and jump to the final credits to hear the upcoming band TwoMarlowe performing "Better than Sex" it's a total of 80's Disco candy song. Nice up tempo song about Gambleing & Sex. The road more entertaining than "Bleed". Put it this way: When you have the equipment to copy videos, but decide to only record the song at the end of the movie, you have a real "BAD" movie.
