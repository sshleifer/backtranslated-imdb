If he wanted to be precise, he should have chosen some Frisco natives and not a bunch of NY players who don't know anything about Sucka Free (not Sucker Free). I have lived in SF all my life, and people here do not speak or act like these actors did. Everything was over-rammed, and the only cat I saw from the bay was JT Bigga Figga with his little cameo as rapper. No shock that he was the only one in the movie who really dressed as cats in addition (ie his Warriors jersey). Not even did I notice that someone had any Giants or 9ers gear; Instead, he mounted them in some cheesy made-up SF or Oakland jerseys that aren't even sold here. HP has no bowling lanes, black and asian gangbands do NOT wear head or bracelets with the colors of Africa or China's Olympic teams, and neither Chinese gangster wear a Yao Ming jersey and try to sound black while shooting hoops. Further, while there is now a significant yuppie community that has invaded the mission, everything that turned out was a white-and-self-proclaimed "100% West Coast Boriqua". This is not New York! Puerto Rican's here are few and far between, and Latinos in Mission is very, very different from the one shown here, which was undoubtedly from NY. HP is also not the only black neighborhood in town. An exact depiction would have shown the drama between HP sets in their own hood as well as vs. Fillmore, Sunnydale, Lakeview etc. This movie could have been much better if Lee had done some more homework and had a better story to work with.
