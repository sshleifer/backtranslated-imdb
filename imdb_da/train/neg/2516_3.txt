Unfortunately, I don't remember the book anymore, but I remember being fascinated by the stories from Edgar Wallace. This film represents a typical German production of low quality. It doesn't keep my attention - even though the story itself is good, it's just badly adapted. In the center of misery are the signs that are all too simple and exaggerated - they have no nuances in their performances. Even the well-known and happy German actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy Are cannot save this poor play. But there is hope ... I've been told that the movies that follow this are getting better and better. In conclusion, I must say that this film does not deserve the biographical screen, but may be enough for a lazy afternoon.
