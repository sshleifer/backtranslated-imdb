This guy has no idea about the cinema. Okay, it seems like he made a few interesting theater performances in his youth and about two acceptable films that were successful for several political reasons because they cheated the Communist censorship. All this is very good, but beware: He doesn't know his job! The scenes are unbalanced, without proper start and and with a disordered content and full of emptiness. He has nothing to say on the subject, so he is over-licensed with violence, nudity and language. How is it possible to hold such a mess that never understood film and professional art? Why don't they break him?
