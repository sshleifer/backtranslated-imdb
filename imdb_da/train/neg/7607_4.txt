- When the local sheriff is killed, his wife takes over and is determined to clean up the city. Not everyone in the city is happy with what she does. When the sheriff orders a curfew in the city, the local salesperson (also a woman) hires a killer to take care of the sheriff. There is no way the salon owner could know that the sheriff and killer would fall in love. - Gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a rather interesting concept and combine it with poor execution. There is a good movie here somewhere to try to get out. In more skilled hands or with a larger budget, Gunslinger could have been an entertaining look at the role of women in the old west. As it is, Gunslinger is a sloppy mess on a movie. <br /> <br /> - There are just so many things wrong with the movie: A supportive non-functional, stolen and unnatural dialogue, and sets the look like-like. But the biggest offender is editing. I was amazed at how many times a scene would begin with the actors (and horses for that matter), of course waiting for Corman to shout "Action". The best thing is the stage for two riders on horseback and standing next to a building. Suddenly they go out and drive around the corner, as they had been driving hard for several miles. Or take the example of people who seem to be able to transport themselves all over the city. We see a man coming into a building and another later coming up over the city to mount his horse. It's not as if Corman didn't have a few decent actors to work with. While none were great stars, Beverly Garland, John Ireland and Allison Hayes were all able to make a good performance. But in Gunslinger they do not get much to work with. <br /> <br /> - I've seen both MST3K and non-MST3K versions of the movie. I strongly recommend going the MST3K route.
