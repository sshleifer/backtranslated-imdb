It was almost inconceivable to me that this movie would be a bust, but I was really disappointed. Having been a familiar to the Pekinpah cinema for years, I found this DVD, drastically reduced, for sale and thought it was worth a shot. The open few credits, which are iconic to Pekinpah fans, have sharpness between men and animals, but here we have non-dietetic ambient noise from children playing on a school ground while a bomb is being planted. Great excitement. So when the Caan and Duval perks travel for their next mission, the Duval bomb at Cann releases his date last night with an STD found only by snooping through her bag while Cann was intimate with her. The subsequent laughter is amazing and is clearly paid out in Brian Depalmas Dressed to Kill, in the short term for Angle Dickenson. The problem with The Killer Elite is that after opening, the film orbits the flat. Even bringing me Alfredo Garcas boss has a stronger production value, a bold call to everyone who knows what I'm talking about. I use Pekinpah's credits as a supplementary lecture material, but when they are finished, turn off The Killer Elite.
