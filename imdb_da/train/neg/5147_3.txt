'Blue Desert' may have had the potential to be just as half-plausible and more enjoyable thriller had the protagonist, Lisa Roberts (Courtney Cox) was not so stupid. When she is the victim of another attack on the streets of New York, the cartoonist Roberts moves to a small town out west. In her first days, she meets the suspiciously crazy Randall Atkins (Craig Sheffer plays this part well), who eventually won't leave her side. Fear of her security after having been in the situation twice before, she discovers a friendship and relationship with the suspiciously reminded urban politician, Steve Smith (DB Sweeny, whose characters do not seem convincing enough and leave dissatisfaction among viewers who would otherwise have about the red herbs thrown by the authors). Smith needs Robert's collaboration because, as he tells her, Atkins is an ex-con and guilty of sexual assault. But the police have lacked evidence to get him off before. <br /> <br /> The movie had enough to make an interesting movie, because soon enough there is such confusion that Roberts should trust. But much of the intended excitement seems to be forced because Robert's character never seems to respond to simple things that we think every reasonable person might have. And her delayed reactions allow much of this excitement to appear light and invincible, especially in the final. Perhaps Sweeny was the wrong choice for this role; also baby face in ways that kind of recall Kevin Anderson's persona clearly in his character in "Sleeping With the Enemy." Or if Lisa Roberts was written as a stronger character, it might also be enough. Meanwhile, the film is not that big, even as a low budget B thriller.
