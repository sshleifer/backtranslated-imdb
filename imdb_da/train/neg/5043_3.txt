I am a great Ziyi Zhang fan and want to go to any movie to see her, which is what took me to Purple Butterfly. As much as I would like this movie, I agree with many others who have commented on it. It is very confusing and also extremely slow. Because the entire movie appears to have been shot with a handheld camera, significant portions of it are out of focus. <br /> <br /> The movie has very little dialogue and what's there doesn't tell you much. There are endless scenes of people just standing around smoking cigarettes or sitting in a room staring at each other without conversations. The way the movie time changes is also very confusing and difficult to follow. Even having read a number of reviews in advance and having a general idea of ​​what the movie was about, I still had a difficult time understanding what was going on. <br /> <br /> I knew beforehand that the movie was not similar to the previous Ziyi Zhang's feature film, but I was looking forward to seeing her in another, but unfortunately I was finally disappointed. She never smiles in this movie, though most of the time it has nothing to smile about. I could have done without the sex scenes they were around as sexless and without any obvious feeling between the participants that you could hope to find.
