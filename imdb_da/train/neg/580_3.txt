Really bad movie, the story is too simple and predictable and bad as a supplement. <br /> <br /> This vampire hunter's story is the worst I have seen so far, Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi) travels to Mexico in search of some bloodsuckers! He uses some interesting weapons (but nothing compared to Blade), and is part of some Van Helig vampire hunters' net? OK, but he works alone. He has been tasked with a powerful vampire queen seeking a black crucifix to perform a ritual that allows her to be harmless to sunlight (is almost a successor of vampires (1998) directed by John Carpenter and starring of James Woods) Derek begins his quest for the Queen's search with some new friends: Sancho (Diego Luna, really bad actor also) a teenager without experience, a Catholic priest, Zoey (Natasha Wagner) a special vampire, Cristian De la Fuente and Ray Collins ( Darius McCrary) another expert vampire hunter. So of course in this adventure he is not alone. <br /> <br /> You can start to feel how this movie would just look at his main actor (Jon Bon Jovi); is a big difference in the working quality of James Woods, and so if you see the movie (I do not recommend this part), you will be involved in one of the simpler stories, completely predictable with horrible appearances, really bad special effects and incoherent events!. I highly recommend not watching this movie !, rent another movie, watch another channel, go out with your friends, etc. <br /> <br /> 3/10
