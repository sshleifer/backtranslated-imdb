I still can't believe this movie. They have so many incredible things in it that it's hard to believe anyone would. The story is a joke, but in the sense of being fun, but more like no story at all. How can you mix a slapstick comedy with a towering, a prison movie, city conspiracies, sex jokes and an FBI agent? You can not. <br /> <br /> Besides the scary rule, the most noticeable thing is the actors. I saw this movie and thought, "Is it really Marlon Brando? No, it can't be. (5 minutes later) Is this Charlie Sheen? Wow, maybe Brando is true. (5 minutes later) This can't be Donald Sutherland. (5 minutes later) No, not Mira Sorvino. This movie is too bad for all of them. (At the end.) No no no, it can't absolutely be Martin Sheen !!! Not for 10 seconds of such a movie. It was over and I was down with my nerves, so many good, Oscar-winning, usually convincing actors in such a stupid, stupid, horrible movie, I would rarely know so much about how they came to act in this. get as much money. <br /> <br /> Just an incredibly stupid idiotic movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
