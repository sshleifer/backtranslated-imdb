This is a really stupid movie. It can be fun with the cool foreigners and the landscape, but it just isn't. <br /> <br /> Some aliens hear the broadcast of World of War when a small land station plays it on Halloween. They come to Earth to kill people, but instead of killing, they make people their slaves and act greasy. The front of the movie shows these foreigners riding surfboards in space ... not really what they do. These are not party-foreigners, they are stupid cartoon-like idiots with annoyingly high pitched modulated voices. The alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be Jack Nicholson's rip-off stranger, who always wears the sunglasses. Other than foreigners, the play is terrible. The script is of course intended for children, because each character is written as a child. <br /> <br /> This is a silly movie that only children will appreciate, perhaps. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 100 minutes. PG for mild language.
