Daphne Zuniga is the only light that shines in this sleepy slasher, and the light fades quickly. If not she, than any other reason to see this. Five college kids are enrolled to prepare an old dorm for their demolition due date. Problems arise automatically when a strange homeless man seeks, and the group is short of people. Then a killer is loose. I would honestly say I should enjoy this one. It had a fair set up, or maybe it was just Daphne Zuniga in it. The movie is too slow and almost as quiet as a library. Most of the action is below average, and the "point-of-view" elements are so old news. The renowned composer Christopher Young of such films as "Hellraiser" and "Entrapment" scored this in a repeating cue line that was better made for a television movie. Yet it seems higher than the film deserves. So, except for Young and Zuniga, this scraper scratches the bottom of the barrel.
