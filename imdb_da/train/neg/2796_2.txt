On Demand mostly delivers some pretty horrible horror movies and offers only other horror movies that everyone has already seen, and already has an opinion on. It was either this or Invinicible (I like the Mark Wahlberg movie), which I have not seen, and I was actually in a movie that looked at mood, which often does not happen anymore because I have already seen all the movies I own a million times, and it's a lot of movies, and I don't have much interest in new movies and boy, this movie made me regret it. I'm not going to put in any spoilers, I just need to tell you that only some of the very FEW actors in this movie are half decent. I think the head girl, the dead who kills everyone, is very annoying, but convincing; I would take her to psycho bitch anyday so she fits well with her roll even though it is paralyzed. The blood is not that big, just a few of the killings, or may I say "wounds" are okay, but you don't see much, and there are no body parts in the film to make the damage more convincing. At the end of the movie, I asked my boyfriend to turn it off, and being a band member was not "very interesting", but what happened would really happen when you went on recording. I'm done if you want to see this, suit yourself.
