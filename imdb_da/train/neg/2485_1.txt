There is only one need for a movie like Bulletproof: it reminds you how bad it can be. We often see movies that we describe as "pretty awful" or "not very good", but then you come across a movie like this and you can see that even though all the other movies are not "good", they are none way as smelly bad as Bulletproof. This was a birthday present from a person who spent less than two seconds accommodating through the DVD purchase in our local supermarket to fulfill a commitment (ie giving me a gift). It could have been a serendipitous find, but it wasn't: this is so completely clich√©d, so badly written, so badly directed, so badly acted that I'm surprised that everyone involved has not been arrested and sent down for 10 years . God, it's terrible. I suspected so much from about 30 seconds in, but continued because sometimes - sometimes - bad movies are so bad that they can be fun. This is not one of them. It's simply bad. I stopped looking after 45 minutes, and tomorrow I'll throw it in the box.
