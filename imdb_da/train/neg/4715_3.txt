I had recently seen Johnny Test in an attempt to find humor in it. I failed, terribly. Cartoon Network usually tends to make their shows enjoyable for all audiences, but Johnny Test is "entertainment" in its lowest form. The script is incredibly predictable and the running gags are not very gags at all. Kids will love it and it's about it. <br /> <br /> Now, don't say it's all bad. The original opening theme was actually quite captivating, but for some reason they skeletoned it and threw it figuratively with a figurative aluminum bat. It's a shame because it was really one of the best things it was going to do. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters could be very interesting, theoretically. With a little work, the characters could work well together, but they are too one-dimensional. So again it makes it easy for the kids to follow. <br /> <br /> The pace is also a bit too fast. The sections are too busy and leave little time for smart writing. This is a shame because there are so many interesting concepts that the show produces. On the top side, however, the fast pace will stop the kids from losing interest and it is really the entire audience. <br /> <br /> Overall, the exhibition looks good on paper, but it does not succeed in being fun or interesting. This is a show I would like, but I am unable to do so. There is just as much potential that is not realized. Children will enjoy it, but it's about it.
