Chances are, if I saw this again, I might be physically ill, the movie is so annoying ..... unless you believe in psychology, reincarnation, and the other hocus focus that this promotes great time. "Cycling of Souls", they call it here. Puh-leeze. <br /> <br /> This story has been done several times before with such films as "Heaven Can Wait." It has also been done much better. Too bad they had to waste the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson. At least it is a rather tame movie, linguistic. It's about the only redeeming quality of this movie.
