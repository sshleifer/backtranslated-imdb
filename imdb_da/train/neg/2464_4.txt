Beloved Part One, The Impossible Planet, but whoops, what a disappointment part two 'Satan Pit' is. The cliffhanger of something apparently rising out of the pit was - nothing comes out of the pit. Then, ages spent searching for air fans to cover the story, the animal was a burning thing that was out of intelligence, so I hadn't foreseen a doctor / scourge. TARDIS is somehow in the pit despite the fact that the pit is not open until long after TARDIS fell through the crust. And finally another ready-made solution that didn't exist logically - I mean, why not dive the beast in the cave as soon as the Grubet opened? Why not skip him all those years ago instead of captivating him anyway. Why not - I could go on, but I lost interest ...
