well after seeing this i can say it's not the worst movie ever made ,, yes people are worse than this, there are some good points on the movie, you are going to see drowning teens, have horrible deaths, , and sweet beautiful rats eating some science experiment, and become grotesque, the drunk caretaker, the rubbish doctor, and even a girl in thong underwear who is absolutely not ashamed, stupid jocker, I couldn't wait for the rat to eat these drunken fools ,, i rowed for the rat the ntire time ,, it had a good premise ,, the first part of the movie ,, was interesting though with the scientific exploration of the rats ,, and the little back story, but I think it ruined when the stupid, drunk, teens come into play ,, The rate in my opinion, the one who gets lost, she is called Brenda, was so false, must have been a cGi rat, , a guy dressed in a robe looked like this was temmeli g schlocky, lame ,, but not completely horribble ,,
