There's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you away from the streets. It's just that some are better than others. This is very poor. The action is horrible, the manuscript crooked; and the special effects are overstated. <br /> <br /> Why does Hollywood treat that audience with such contempt? And why did they make a sequel?
