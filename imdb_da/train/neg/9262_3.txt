On the surface, the idea of ​​Omen 4 was good. It's nice to see that the devil's child could be a girl. In fact, in some cases, as in the exorcist, when the girls possess or are diabolical, they are very effective. But in Omen 4 it stuck. <br /> <br /> Delia doesn't make me think she could be a devil's child, but rather she's a kid with trouble. Problems like maybe only a therapist, rather than a priest could help. She doesn't look scary or devil. Rather, she looks scary and moody. <br /> <br /> This movie had potential, and if it was made by the same people who had made the three previous films, it could work. But it is quite insulting to really make a sequel to one of the most favored horror trilogies, as one made for television movies special. On so many levels it is down. It looks cheap, the play is hammering and the effects are typical of a television drama. The characters give no sympathy and you do not route for them. I have recently seen it again after someone has brought it to me for Christmas and it is dated sharply. <br /> <br /> If you are thinking of seeing this, then I suggest you not. Look at one of the others, or look at the exorcist or see the good son. Don't waste your time on this drive!
