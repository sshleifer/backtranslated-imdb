Pretty standard B-movie stuff. Seriously, anyone who sees "Dragon Fighter" with Dean Cain and a lot of people making their first movie should know better than expecting real quality or even moderate intelligence. B movies exist to recreate popular formulas. If you give them a token analysis yourself you will destroy the movie for yourself (and perhaps write some self-meaning, counterfeit notification on IMDb). <br /> <br /> I liked the female manager, Kristine Byers. She had charisma, and I thought she was very attractive. It was a memorable B-movie look. Unfortunately, I don't see where she made any movies since. I'll keep an eye on her again.
