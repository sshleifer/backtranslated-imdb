Here's one you can see with a straight face, with a script so bad, even Will Ferrell won't be in it. <br /> <br /> There are two laughs in HOT ROD. <br /> <br /> 1. The Punch-Dance. Rod "must go to his quiet place" and before anyone can say Kevin Bacon, he feeds a passionate overwhelmed bodyswerve to the tribes of a band wishing they had Europe's big hair faux metal chops. <Br /> <br /> 2. John Farnham is you are the voice. In one of the epic sequences where the star and his cohorts make Slomo Walk down Main Street and the townspeople follow their heels for support, the soundtrack is the gag. How did the filmmakers cross this Aussie recording artist? A great Australian vocalist (and a real talent) who fought in the early 70s covering raindrops, falling on my head, disappeared until 1986 for The Big Comeback with You're the Voice, John Farnham's anthem is such a breathtaking cheesy, the smoothed mountain in Switzerland. <br /> <br /> In addition to these two high points in the movie - generally ruined with slipshod writing - the rest of the movie is like choking on the vomit of others. <br /> Andy Samberg is Rod, a failed stunt jumper who has never made a leap. Maybe it has something to do with running a moped in the heart of the dark. Or his fake mustache. Yeh, somebody actually thought it was fun. Without a leap under his starring belt, he plans a 15-bus extravaganza - which would surely kill a lesser-than-bad comedian, like Jason Biggs or Rob Schneider - to win the day and save his grandfather while destroying cancer and whatever ... who sees These movies to plot anyway? Along the way (as usual for moronic leads in these comedies), he scores a salubrious chick (Isla Fisher) who must surely be retarded to consider switching chromosomes with this loser. <br /> <br /> Sissy Spacek (CARRIE, 1976) has so little to do that she almost called into her performance - then her thoughts changed and just hung up. Ian McShane must have lost a bet to be here.
