Any "National Lampoon" movie in the title is definitely guaranteed to die a death in London, England, Paris, France, Rome, Italy and anywhere in Germany. It may be an institution in the United States, but it is almost unknown in Europe to the wider audience. The "National Lampoon European Holiday" is unlikely to rectify this situation. The awful Griswalds are just that - awful. They are not funny. Clearly, Chevy Chase thinks he's fun, despite Mrs Bdi Angelo laughing a lot at her jokes, but she gets paid for it and didn't have to throw out $ 2.50 for the privilege. The section in England is typical. The same old same old television performers, gentlemen Idle, Smith, Coltrane, Miss M.Lippman, drew the same old same old tired clich√©s, Mr. Chase lost in the hotel corridor .... swings, gab, yawn .. Bucking - ham Palace, Big Ben ...... I feel cheated that we have never seen bobbies on bicycles two-to-two ......... rosie red cheeks on the little chil - Dren, should I continue? The English are buffoons, the French vicious Yank haters. The Germans are pompous and inflated (not mentioning the war, Clark), and the Italians have lecherous bottom-pinchers. Have I forgotten something? All possible "comic" situations are killed, Mr Chase gurner desperately, Miss Di Angelo confuses sweetly, the kids are embarrassingly bad. The fact that this franchise runs as long as it did must bring comfort to those who tell you that you never lose money by underestimating public taste.
