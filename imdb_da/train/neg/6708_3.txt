Turn your back away or you come back in big trouble out of my loved ones! Only a happy end can blossom your innocence, full of gloomy and stupid the moment you see it here. It's safe to say that the whole movie is falling apart, with a sarcastic approach and tribute to zombie shows that challenge nonsense to the maximum. We get a name like "Johnny" so often and this "Johnny" has nowhere to go. There is no particular reason why our "dead body" crawls out of his grave to survive until prom night, so it makes the movie completely useless. Without a sense of grief, his mother is convinced to tell the doctor that he is dead. Johnny takes a bite out of Eddie's arm afterwards. The viewer is asked a hard question: Why should the movie be this cornball? There is an answer. Any resemblance to all living or dead is purely coincidental. "Living" is a case. "Dead" has nothing in common with the movie. Show this to your boyfriend and she will skip the top prom that makes life a desolate ruin. Blah !!!
