Oh, Lucio Fulci, rest in peace. This infamous Italian is most famous for "Zombie" and the absolutely unmatched "The Psychic" and "Manhattan Baby." Well, add this to the invisible <br /> <br /> list. <br /> <br /> The reason is about a necklace woman wearing a gold <br /> <br /> mask and a G string. She wants the power of a young dubbed <br /> <br /> stud that has a set of magic arrows and a bow. They are magic <br /> <br /> because they light up. The arrow boy joins a guy in a bad wig, <br /> <br /> and they use most of the movie to save each other from flat <br /> <br /> action sequences. In the end, nekkid-chicken is defeated, but not <br /> <br /> before you take off the mask and remind me why I broke up with <br /> <br /> my high school boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Fulci bathed every shot in an orange glow and filled the screen with <br /> <br /> smoke. Nothing like a smoky orange action sequence to make you <br /> <br /> crave Sunny Delight and a cigarette. The special effects are <br /> <br /> ridiculous. In one order, our ambiguous homosexual duo is attacked by dozens of arrows that clearly cut scratches on their own <br /> <br /> the movie itself. Most of the impact budget must have been <br /> <br /> used on Fulci-licious Gore, which consists exclusively of germination <br /> <br /> wounds. Hello, we can all use a good sprinkling wound once in a <br /> <br /> while, but when you ask overkill wounds, it becomes boring. <br /> <br /> I needed to play with the brightness setting on my TV just to see what had happened. <br /> <br /> There is plenty of talk about fulfilling omens and prophecies, so let me <br /> <br /> see the future ... If you find this movie and see it, you will regret the. The scene on the video box (at Media) is not displayed <br /> <br /> in the movie, whatever context. "Conquest" is a vacant job. What MST3K could have done with this! <br /> <br /> This is characterized by (R) strong physical violence, strong gore, female nudity, short male nudity and mild sexual content. <br /> <br />
