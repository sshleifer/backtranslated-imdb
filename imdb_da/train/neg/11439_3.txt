It was obvious that this movie was designed to appeal to the Chick Flick audience, which I have spent a great deal and enjoyed the most. However, this was a very annoying attempt by Heather Graham to become the next Meg Ryan (who became annoying as hell in itself). Her performance was overdone and it turned out that she was overworked compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles. This movie could have been more, as there was appropriate budget for settings, actors and a decent storyline. My wife and I both agreed that this was 'Muck' at the end when the movie ended on a painful embarrassing high! Better luck next time hopes Miss Graham sticks to the type of movie she belongs to like hell.
