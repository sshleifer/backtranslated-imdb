One of them, "Why was it made?" movie. Romance is very difficult to swallow. It is one of those romances that suddenly "clicks" - they are in love. The movie is full of long breaks and unpleasant moments - the decor restaurant is the most remarkable one. Charles Grodin does a credible job, but most of the film is just him and Louise Lasser. Ask yourself, would you like to see Grodin with his neurosis and Lose with his neurosis together for an hour and a half?
