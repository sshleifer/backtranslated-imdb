I was lying on my bed with a really bad cold or flu or anything. I might expect that I would spend some time watching some horror movies my mom bought for me a little while ago. I wish I never picked this movie! After I looked at it, I felt even more sick and I wanted to vomit. Afterwords (when I got better of course) I did some research on Dennis L.Rader, and I noticed that Dennis in the movie was nothing like the real one. I hope no one ever watches this movie, but if they don't, they won't eat or you will feel the way I felt when I first saw it. I think you would have a better time looking at Santa Claus 3. At least the movie had better reviews on this site.
