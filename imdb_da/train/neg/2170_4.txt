This movie breeches the fine line between satire and silliness. Although a bridge system that has no rules can promote marital harmony, it certainly cannot promote winning bridges, so satire did not work for me. But there were some things I found entertaining anyway, especially with the big bridge fight between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk near the end of the movie. It is treated as much as a championship boxing match. Not only is the arena of the competition shouting out in a square area like a boxing ring, there is a judge floating between the participants, and the radio transmitter Roscoe Karns provides uninterrupted chats on the events. At one point he even lists "One ... Two ... Three ... Four ..." as if a four-diamond bid was a knockdown event. And people were glued to their radios for the whole, a common event for the championship boxing matches. The spoof worked really well. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, few of the actors provide the comedy needed to maintain the intended satire. Paul Lukas does not have much of a flair for comedy and is miscast; lovely Loretta Young and the usual cartoon Frank McHugh were not given good enough lines; Glenda Farrell has a nice cartoon as a forgetful blonde at the start of the movie, but she virtually disappears. What a waste of talent!
