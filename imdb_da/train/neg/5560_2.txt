It seems to be true to form, any movie with Dolph Lundgren is bad! I don't know if the story is full of holes or that Dolph is such a bad actor. No spoiler here, he seems to disappear pushing and shoving and grabbing and touching things in this movie. In my opinion, it is strange that some of these projects find venture capital to get in the can and to the theater.
