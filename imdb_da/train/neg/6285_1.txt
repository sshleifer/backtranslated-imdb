Horror movie ?? really ???? I can't believe how bad this movie was, what is the meaning of this movie ??? the movie almost 1 hour and 30 minutes and the first 70 minutes of it is just lena walking around with this stupid look on her face after she had an accident .... not much to talk at all, not even much actions at all .. i must say tho, the last 20 minuets got that little bit of action .. and was still stupid ....... and end oh my god, i don't know where to start, it also ends with this stupid look at lena face lol .. don't understand me, i love Lena Headey, i think she is great actress, but i don't know what came into her to make this movie. Don't waste your time and watch it because this movie has no story, has no action ... and has no meaning ... not to mention how slow this movie goes, and it feels like you've seen it forever.
