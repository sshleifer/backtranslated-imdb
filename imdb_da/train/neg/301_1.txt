This is the worst documentary to get out of Canada ever !!!! I'm glad to see the boys have not made another movie. All they want to do is make a movie and it doesn't have to be the one they wrote. They continue to switch the script to the person they are pitching. I couldn't get out of the theater soon enough when I saw it at the same year's Toronto Film Festival. Please never see this movie.
