Just bought VHS on this movie for two bucks, I wasted my money! Hi, I'm digging Adam "Batman" West and Tina "Giligan's Island" Louise, but hey! This triple production is a rehash of a dozen other biker movies; bile bunch of cyclists psychosis runs into a hickby, beats all and everything, and then defeated in the man with a bursting hero. Adam West sees the part as a hero, but he lacks cape and his Batman uniform. Sorry, it's just not the same. Tina L. looks really nervous and frightened the whole show, but at least we know what happened to "Ginger" when she was rescued from the island ... LOL! The bikers are a motley group, and known to them ever acted again or at least shouldn't have. Hell Riders are hell to see!
