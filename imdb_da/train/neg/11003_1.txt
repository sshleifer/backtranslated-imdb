How do I begin? This movie is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It has no redeemable qualities. I sat right through this movie and it was a fight. I couldn't get another smile on my face. I find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible movie. I felt that this movie was a failed attempt at unpleasant humor. The only thing about this movie was the soundtrack, I'm pretty sure that was why I wanted to see this movie in the first place. I will unpack it as I will try to forget the time I just wasted with this piece of crap. I will leave you with this warning. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE, THE SUCCESS.
