They changed the title of this cruelty to an unexpected love. The only thing worse is the movie itself. The script contains dialogue that would be laughed at by a third class game. At a time when the wife leaves the man, a bad cover of All by Myself plays over the soundtrack! You do not say. The actors try, but are defeated by the scary, incredibly horrible script. The direction is staggeringly bad. No wonder Lifetime has such a bad reputation. How are such things done? I turn off the TV before it's over!
