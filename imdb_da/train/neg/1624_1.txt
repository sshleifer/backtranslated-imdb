I watched this movie a few years back. I couldn't sleep and there was nothing on it. So I looked at it. What really gets me is it makes no sense and therefore it is disruptive. Richard gets tied up in chicken wire and Jarvis starts out with Richard's girl while she is unconscious. Then Jarvis's friend Troubador plays a silly song on his guitar. The next morning, it shows Rig's girl talking to Jarvis and Trouby and then goes back to Richard and looks at him while still tied. Then they play a good music and the movie is finished. I mean what happened? Did they slow down? And what did she say to the two guys (Trouby and Jarvis)? It is disturbing and too poor to. I can't keep movies that are disturbing and don't make sense. This was the worst movie I've ever seen since the 90's version of the Lord of the Flies.
