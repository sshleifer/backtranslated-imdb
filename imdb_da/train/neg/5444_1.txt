It was 1974 and the star Martin Sheen. <br /> <br /> That alone says what to expect from this movie. <br /> <br /> And it was a movie. According to the film, Slovik had reformed, got a good woman and did not want to fight. <br /> <br /> In fact, Slovik may have been a naive innocent, or he may just have wanted to manipulate the system. <br /> <br /> The one to whom Slovik was or was not, had the story to decide, but it was a film about intelligence at a time when a country asked why it was fighting and the film took off Regarding soldiers who were in Vietnam either in 1974 (as Willie Nelson would say, let's tell the truth, it was about the Vietnam war, not WWII), EoES was as propagandist as Gung Ho was in the eighties. <br /> <br /> According to this film, Slovik expressed his position, clean and simple. He had a nervous problem. Heck, I have a clinically nervous condition and trust me, if I had done military duty, it would not have been a problem for me to just let my nerves go and fail in my duties and have a breakdown or take on the KP duty or latrine duty without problem. <br /> <br /> If we believe in the fax, Slovik did not have that opportunity, no doubt because of his criminal history. <br /> <br /> Whatever the viewer wants to believe is up to the viewer. I have learned that movies from this decade or decade, in connection with service or military duty, will largely take the same attitude over and over again. <br /> <br /> The 1940s and 1950s serve your country. <br /> <br /> It was the story. <br /> <br /> The whole movie seemed predictably Hollywood to me. He refused to serve and only when he was strapped to be executed, he shows emotions. Such an emotional outburst could easily have worked to its advantage in his statement of his nervous state, but of course the film wanted to show him as a human being and only when he is dying will he be carefree. I am not Catholic, but I thought the view from the hail Mary of Ned Beatty and Sheen at the end of the Lord's prayer was fun, as it sounded like they were trying to see who could say it faster. I can't see how this movie could be seen without realizing it was aimed at Tricky Dick Nixon and the Vietnam War. I hope it was all worth it for Slovik and anyone who chose to follow his example.
