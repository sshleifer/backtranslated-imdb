The fact that this movie has been entitled to the most successful film in Switzerland's film history makes me shake my head! It's true, but pathetic at the same time. A flick about the Swiss army could be a lot better. The story sounds interesting, in the beginning: Antonio Carrera (Michael Koch) is forced to solve his military training of the army while he is in the Church, wedding his love Laura Moretti (Mia Aegerter). That action somehow does not really differ from just a few recruits who become full and stoned in reality. Melanie Winiger plays her role as the powerful Michelle Bluntschi mediocre, personally I found her rather annoying. <br /> <br /> The story features a comedy combined with a romance that doesn't work as expected. The romance part is too sad, and the comedy part is not fun at all, it's just a cheap trial and doesn't change the whole movie at all. It is fun for preadolescent 12-13 year olds, but not for those seeking an entertaining comedy. The mood is weak except for some shots. <br /> <br /> Dope? Cool! To steal? Cool! If you want a proper comedy about the Swiss RS, make sure you haven't released your military training yet, and even then don't expect too much! I give it 4 out of 10 stars because Marco Rima is quite fun during his screenplay. Not a hell of a lot of screen time though
