This movie was positively the worst movie I've ever seen. I couldn't sit through it all. I also think the author should have some weird fetishes for women throwing puking and crapping ... I mean what it was about! I can't believe this was made by itself and is horrified to have #ingwasted a rental price of Â£ 4. The quality of both picture and sound is terrible, the actor ... well does not exist. It was a bad excuse for a movie, and the scenes of pee, shed and puke reminiscent of 2 girls 1 cup. Urghh ....... AVOID ALL COSTS! The girls looked as if they had been picked out of the street and only got that part because they would be willing to take off their peaks. While these girls have fine bodies, it certainly did not mean that their screams were terribly convincing and painful to my ears. <br /> <br /> It was like (possibly worse) than an ammateur school production without any real direction and hi there is no need for a set, as it all seems to turn around a car? <br /> <br /> Definatey not one to buy people. Sorry if my first comment is terribly negative, but I couldn't find anything positive to say, and I want to believe I can save someone else wasting their money as I have.
