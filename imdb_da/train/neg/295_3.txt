I got this movie because I worked in a movie store so I got free rentals. It came in, and the cover did well. Hot chick carrying a weapon, okay, I'll check it out. <br /> <br /> Oh man, poor movement. This was so horrible that I spent half of the film fast ahead to get to the nudity, which was minimal. I think there may be three scenes with partial nudity. Cheesy dialogue, crazy violence, bad excuses for characters. I feel bad putting this movie down because I know it was made on a cheap budget but it was also "Clerks" and it became a cult classic and a franchise. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
