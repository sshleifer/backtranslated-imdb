Seriously. This is one of the most stupid family shows of all time. <br /> <br /> Plot A family without mother and 3 "dads" raises 3 little girls in San Francisco, California. <br /> <br /> Characters-Nice freak Danny, cartoon loving Joey, hair obsessed Jesse, spoiled abruptly Michelle, stupid DJ, and almost normal Stephanie. The creators of this show really want you to hate the characters, right? <br /> <br /> Therefore, I don't think anyone should see this show. I just talked for a moment in the show's entire run, and I think that instead of deadly injection, all criminals should be forced to see this show, a torture far worse than anything else. 1.5 / 10 or: D
