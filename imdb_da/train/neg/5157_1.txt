I really despised this movie when I saw it at the age of approx. 6 or 7 when I was a big fan of Robin Williams and nothing he could do was bad. Until then. This complete waste destroyed Robin for a long time. I'm just coming back with his funny but serious part in Father's Day, but then he went on to make another mistake, Bicenntinial Man, I think it was called, but the point is. Robin had to get much better jobs now and now he has returned to perform the slime derived from this 'classic'.
