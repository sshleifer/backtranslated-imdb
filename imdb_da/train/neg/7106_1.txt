I'm not a big fan of horror movies and have only seen a handful of them (and none of "Halloween" s or "Friday the Thirteenth" s) - but I appreciate a scary horror movie, not because of do. And I'm pretty sure this isn't scary. What's so scary about a little plastic skull that pops up everywhere? In all its looks, there are far-established shots, so there is no real surprise in any of this movie. (Not that a skull in itself is so scary anyway, but ...). The plot relates to Claus Von Bulow's third cousin (John Hudson), who marries a Donna-reed look-a-like (Peggey Webber, who gives one of the worst performances ever) that begins to see skulls and hear the mysterious screaming of a group of peacocks on her husband's mansion. Did I mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning event? Ooooh !!!! Wonder, who did it! <br /> <br /> This is the same old plot of a rich boy trying to kill and / or drive their wife crazy. If you want to see a well-functioning version of these things, try "Returning Fortune". And BTW, Jeremy Irons is a hundred times more talented than John Hudson. <br /> <br /> The MSTing was okay but nothing special; paired with "Gumby" cards, but it does provide good viewing. <br /> <br /> Two stars for "The Screaming Skull"; eight stars for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> And now rephrase Mr. Von Bulow himself: "How bad is this movie?" "You have no idea!"
