Instead of long dance sequences and close-ups of the characters who made the film move - the movie would have been better served by explaining the characters of history and motivation. The marginalization of Nubo, the minister, aunt, mother - and the dumb down of the dynamic and IMPORTANT rivalry between hatsumo and mameha and hatsumo and sayuri made the film lack of any real depth. If you hadn't read the book, you wouldn't really understand why Sayuri loved the president and why Mameha became her mentor at all. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie was amazing - and the actors did the best with the C rate script they were given, but that was all that was good about this movie.
