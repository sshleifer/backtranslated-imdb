It's a great movie for kids who love dogs. It runs a little slowly early, but ends if a flurry of gooped up De Vil. The base plot is the same as the first movie. The bright side of the adult movie is the talking bird who thinks it's a dog. The bird speaks like a human (Eric Idle of Monty Python) and bends like a dog. It's the comedy that the movie needed more of. See it in the matinee so you don't have to pay full price or wait for it to appear at Disney.
