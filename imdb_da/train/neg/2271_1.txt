Someone might make a great documentary about the Jerry Springer Show, but this fictionalized version only succeeds in draining something authentic and interesting out of the waste TV phenomenon. There are dozens of infamous bad movies (eg "Manos: The Hands of Fate") that show more creativity and spirit than this boring, unimaginable waste of film. <br /> <br /> Seriously, why not a Jerry Springer Show documentary that would start answering some of the real questions like: Who are these people? What happens to their lives after they appear on this show? How did the Mayor of Cincinatti find himself here? <br /> <br /> A good line: During an orientation session for guests: "People, I can't stress it enough: No weapons!"
