It's a bad movie, but I have to give it to the leading actress in this .... Francine Forbes. She seemed to be the smallest, and I personally thought she was sweet. Too bad, she only appears in another movie in the database. In addition, the film is full of ridiculous gore and fake death scenes. People are stabbed and the GUSH like 2 gallons of blood! But if you like to see bad horror movies, I highly recommend this.
