: Spoilers: <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed with Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it, and I finally got the chance when it traveled on Thursday night at Hallmark. I love the first three "Love" movies, but this was not something I thought it should be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, it was way to many goofs, and editing was very poor - to many scenes outside the context. I also think that Kathy's baby's death happened long, and Clark's appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It didn't seem as if any of the players would really be there - they lacked all the feelings. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all. <br /> <br /> I think the scriptwriters should have gone more of the book. It seems that every movie made so far just glides farther and farther away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie, they never mentioned anything about the mine, and the two boys or Clark are hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willie's reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard. <br /> <br /> Of the four films that have been made so far, I have to say that the Abiding Joy of love is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book has been followed and if Clark's character is in them, I hope he has a bigger role and I hope his part is not so boring. I also hope there are more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty, but who knows what the scriptwriters want in the store next.
