I can see many people like this movie. For me, it was a movie made to write 101, and the person failed the class. From the time Lindsey Price shows the videographer until the end the movie was very predictable. I continued to see to see if it was coming. <br /> <br /> First, we have the widowed young father. Cliché # 1 movie / TV always kills the grandparents if the child is a girl or a kitten of boys, so the single father can get spongy over his dead wife and work out of his element that takes care of the children. Starting from my 3 sons to 2 1/2 dads. These movies are usually dramas and comedies are TV shows. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 2 When a squeezed woman has a video camera in her hand, she will play a major role in the movie. And will always have solutions or even if the person is an airhead <br /> Cliché # 3 If the person at risk is a foreigner, they must be of latino origin. And they must be illegal. Apparently, there are no legal Latino and illegal Europeans unless there is an IRA element involved. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 4 The Latino mentioned must be highly educated in his home country. In this case, he was a professor who made 200 pr. Month. And the highly educated Latino must now act as if he didn't have the brain in his head now and let the head tip take over. <br /> <br /> Cliché # 5 The crime the person really committed was not a crime but an accident. But because in this case he has lost all the sensation he had when he crossed the table, he now seems like a blithering idiot and has now put his own daughter in danger by taking her together on a fruitless quest to the border with the foolish side kick . <br /> <br /> Cliché # 6 Never run over a hoodl run from a crime, but some poor little cute kids. This is because the child's parents have to play a large part of the film, and because the person who has accidentally killed the child can have ridiculous interaction with the parents. Cliché # 7 Name me one movie where a policeman is not the evil vet and they are mated with a rookie. Although they are homicide detectives, they must be the most experienced police in a police force. Sev7n and Copy cat and Law and Order come to mind immediately. And the vet, even though gruff on the outside has a heart of gold. Cliché # 8 Let's go around with some unemployed soap stars. Now I like Lindsey Price. But Susan Haskell IMO can't get out of a paper bag, and when she uses to be on One Life To Live like Marty, he swung right to left every time she opened her mouth. It is used to get me sea sick. She can be anchored on land better now, but she still can't act. <br /> <br /> The movie could have been more insightful if it wasn't full of clichés. I don't think a movie should be animal or cerebral to be good. But this was just bad. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER **** Now I do not have to spoil the end. Oh, I want to, because I feel it will be a misunderstanding for mankind to let someone waste time, they will never look at this movie again. It involves Cliché # 6 and # 7. Unless a person has never seen a movie before you had to see what had come. The father even makes a stupid mistake running from the police at the end and is shot by the angry veteran who is suddenly very sad. You'd think she thought the poor guy was innocent all over the movie and she accidentally shot him. When she didn't. Now for the little girl the father brought with him. Guess what happens to her? Time up, she ends up living with the family whose child was killed by his father !! Come on! You all knew it was going to happen because she is a replacement child !! Therefore, she did not go with the Lindey Price grade. <br /> <br /> This movie was an insult as far as I was concerned. Because there were so many roads, this movie could be explored and went down, but it chose to take the cliché one. The 2 stars are for 2 of the stars, the little girl I thought was very good and Lindsey Price, which character was annoying, but she did what she could with it. My advice is to take a vice and push your head with it instead of looking at this boy
