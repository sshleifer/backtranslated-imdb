Now I like sci-fi cartoons. But when "Robotboy" appeared in Canada in late 2006, I looked at the premiere and was inevitably horrified. The characters are generic and stereotypical (Do they really need to make an African-American man wearing tiger-stripe print clothes and speak in a Jamacian accent? Why are all the Asian characters living yellow and trembling? Does the mother have big thighs and chest and constant complaints?) to the point where things become unrealistic, predictable, brutal and sometimes disruptive. There are heavy similarities with, even sticking, at Astro Boy. Allow me to explain (dub names for the young): Robotboy / Astro, Kamikaze / Tenma, Constantine / Shadow, Gus / Abercrombie, Tommy / Alejo, Lola / Zoran + Kennedy, Moshimo / O'Shay, and so on. Similarities to "My Life As A Teenage Robot", "Star Wars", "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", "Kamen Riders", "Sailor Moon" and co. on the way. Not to mention the abundant race / sex stereotyping. Don't even get me started on innuendos. I just want to say they are hidden and pretty dirty. But seriously. Don't even try to see this. Especially if you like Astro Boy.
