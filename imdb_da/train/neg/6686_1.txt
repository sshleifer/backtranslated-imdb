There is no entertainment throughout this movie. There is not a scary, fun or even interesting scene in this movie. It announces itself as a horror, and continues to call itself a comedy. It's not even ATTEMPT humor. It also doesn't try to be scary. <br /> <br /> To be bored of this movie, you must be one of the easiest people on earth. If you like this movie even a little bit than you have no standard for what you see at all. I have a very difficult time trying to understand what the filmmakers were trying to achieve with this. It's not fun, scary, shocking or exciting. So would it be a drama? Because it really wasn't dramatic either. <br /> <br /> Just do yourself a favor and don't see this movie. Life is too expensive to waste 90 minutes of seeing it here.
