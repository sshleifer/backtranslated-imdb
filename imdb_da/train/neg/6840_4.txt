While this excursion certainly does not live up to its predecessor, it has more than its share of memorable moments. My personal favorite, just after putting waste to a city block with his "Video Disc Cannon", we see a close-up of Nimoy's face. As a single tear from his left eye, we know at the time that Nimoy is more than just a killer. The viewer cannot help but be drawn into his emotional turmoil, and we understand that his earlier flat influence was only a facade. Absolute shine !!! Sex scenes show a good balance, carnal, but not pornographic. Subsequently, I felt that I had a pretty good understanding of how to work Magnavision Video Disc Player. Too bad they have not produced them for over 25 years.
