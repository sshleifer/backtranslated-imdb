I went in to see the D war on a whim and with very low expectations. The movie failed to meet them. <br /> <br /> I don't mind stories that stretch credibility - remember Reign of Fire? - But I expect them to be internally consistent. This movie jumped from shelf to shelf without pausing for breathing, all with special effects far behind LOTR or even Godzilla. <br /> <br /> A shifting mysterious warrior from Korea, curious metamorphosed into a Caucasian antique dealer and emerging as deus ex machina to get the rude protagonists out of their latest mess. A special agent from the FBI who seems to be completely boned at ancient Korean folklore because of Fed's excellent "paranormal division" - which has gone unnoticed to this point. Lovers kissing on deserted beaches where one exclaims "I never meant this to happen". A reincarnated couple of long dead choristers who "died as star-crossed lovers." Mysterious pendants, faceless hordes of robot soldiers (who owe much to Peter Jackson's orcs) and a snake that wastes so much time that every time the chosen prey is within reach comes something to distract it. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is appalling, the acting tree and the impact of the whole was, to be honest, boring. But for me the moment of war was at the end, after the finals, when the music for the final credits was - Arirang! It's rather like Akira Kurosawa closes "Ran" with the karaoke release of My Way - and let me realize that I am by no means comparing director Shim with Kurosawa. In short, an obviously indulgent, lacking collection of clich√©s and narrative non-sequitives that can appeal to the melodramatic feeling so prevalent in the Koran folk culture, but should not be the price of the ticket to any serious movie goer - or even one not so serious movie gangs. I would suggest that this bypass the cinema's theater in general and go straight to video, but I'm not even sure it's so much worth it.
