Unfortunately, this movie is so bad. The original Out of Towners was manic and very fun, of course they used the script written by Neil Simon. For some reason, Neil Simon's script is not used in this movie so it falls flat time and again. Even the audience I was with never laughed. The direction is very slow and dull, and when there is a joke, it is given away, so the joke dies, ie. The couple have sex in the park. They announce that it is a New York lighting ceremony and we all know that the lights are going to move on and we will be able to see sweet and crushing. Goldie & Steve do a little patchwork. The whole movie wins out as such ... a joke is set up and given away. Why isn't Goldie's hair ever destroyed in the movie. You will also notice all the closeness of Goldie (they use a very intense soft lens). I suggest you rent the original with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, if you want to laugh.
