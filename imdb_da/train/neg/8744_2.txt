I accidentally ended up watching this movie. I'm still not sure if I regret it or not. I felt that I saw the film made by the group of film school students who didn't do the right thing. It plays up to all Hollywood clich√©s that are conceivable while constantly throwing us 'the message is the ultimate evil' message. The subtlety of this movie does not know. As far as it goes, it even manages to deliver its own spoilers. <br /> <br /> The story seems to be the world of fantasy of a computer that becomes reality. The protagonist is an attractive teenage boy with a girlfriend, but is a programming genius and apparently hacker (I think) among many other nerd-fantasy-come-true elements that you will have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I should also have known that it would be a z-movie when I saw Ned Bellamy ... he tends to be a good tip-off. <br /> <br /> Can't recommend this one, I'm afraid.
