Personally, even though I'm able to appreciate really good movies, I also have a strange ability to enjoy a little even the most crappiest crap. You know the times when you just want to sit there and watch some horrible cookie-cutter action movies to kill time. This is the only movie I can remember, actually turning off in the middle, and I have absolutely no intention of going back to finish it. The reason was so constructed and predictable, I call out what the next scene would be easy (and I'm usually not very good at this). The actors were horrible, I have seen better performing in middle school games. Even the stage interruptions were bad, the power was wrong. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a parody that forgot about the fun.
