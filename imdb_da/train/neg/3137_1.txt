I, like many people, saw this movie in the theater when it first appeared in '97. It was at best a below average movie, defiantly not the "masterpiece" that all these "Titanic" fanboys like to make it look like. First, DiCaprio is a terrible actor, no matter which way you look at it. People just like him because of his appearance. His play "skills" essentially consists of saying many cheesy lines and trying to act sexually. Secondly, the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot: Girl falls in love with guy, ship, they are on drain, many crazy love scenes then. Anyone with an IQ over 50 will realize that this is not brilliant in any way whatsoever. It is also not original. Plus the instructor felt the need to pull it out in 3+ hours. I could compress it in a 1 hour block without losing any of the plot. In conclusion, the "Titanic" is the most overrated movie to date. Why it got so much attention and money is beyond me.
