The original Lensman series of novels is a classic of the genre. It's pure adventure SF with some stuff (here and there), and I've always wondered why Hollywood hasn't properly filmed it because it's just the kind of stuff they love: massive explosions, super weapons, uber-heroics, hero gets girl, foreigners (great CGI potential), good at evil in the purest form, etc. Instead (and remember, I am a Japan-o-phile and anime lover) we get this horrible kiddie's movie that blushes the guts out of history blends in Star Wars (ironically like the latter torn by the books occasionally) pastiches and dumbs all over to the 'Thundercats' level. To see Kimball Kinnison is the epitome of the galactic patrol officer and the second stage Lensman portrayed as a little boy pitiful (etc.). I just can't understand why the decision makers did this because of course they had the rights to the story and could have made much more money (FAR!) By telling straight. It makes no sense.
