Even for a tired movie model like the nature against the man cycle that dominated so predominantly in the 1970s, ants fall sharply short to be even effective (though entertaining for reasons it was not appropriate). It's so scary. Apparently, these ants, which bulldozes near an inn, eat toxic waste for decades and have now adapted to the issue of poisonous bites - hundreds of these bites are lethal. Looking at actors of some fame that is wise to fall in the midst of small black spots is painfully fun in a not so good but very bad way. So many scenes just look ridiculous: a boy trying to fall into a dumpster while being attacked, Suzanne Sommer's crying in horror while lounging in bed, Robert Foxworth and Lynda George pulling through the wallpaper, Bernie Casey fails. the gambe and that list goes on and on. The danger shown ranges from ants that creep from a drain to black ants of ants above walls. The cast for the film is not bad on paper, but none of these actors seem to believe in the material. Poor Myrna Loy must sit in a wheelchair through this horror. I hope she found a good need for the money, for it is obvious that this was the only reason why a woman in her pedigree would be in this rubbish. While it's a pretty bad movie, it is in sight - once for me, and has many of the seventies bad movie qualities - start-studded actors embarrassed themselves, the TV-to-TV feeling, and the dreaded creatures in nature that reeking revenge on man. This time, one has to push the hand in a pile of ants to be affected. Really quite awful.
