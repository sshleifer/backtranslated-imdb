The Hills Har Eyes II is what you expect to be and no more. Of course, it won't be an Oscar nominated movie, it's just plain entertainment that you can only lose yourself in 90 minutes. Basically, the plot is about a group of National Guard trainees who find their fight against the infamous mutated hillbillies on their last training day in the desert. It's just those who fight back in the whole movie, which contains a lot of violence (which is pretty much the whole movie), as blood and intestines are constantly flying all over, and also another graphical rape scene that is meaninglessly thrown in the shock crowd. <br /> <br /> I would give Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment and the only thing. Even though I myself looked at my watch more and more as the film went on as it began to pull because it continued to try to shock the audience with graphical and occasional jumping scene just to make the audience stay awake The Hills have Eyes II is just decent entertainment, something to pass time if you get bored, and nothing else. <br /> <br /> 4/10
