The final mating of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald is basically a complete misfire. Scripture is weak and has been presented poorly. The movie has no life in it. Eddy and MacDonald would have been better off making a movie recording for their final mating. There's nothing wrong with their song, it's just everything else in this turkey that's overcooked.
