Everyone notes that Tommy has only 3 facial expressions. <br /> <br /> 1. The angry eyes look like he gives each enemy. 2. Holding the hands to the face, mouth agape and scared eyes. 3. The smiling Tommy Turnbull. I have to say that I mostly hate this show, I'm not looking at it, but it's like Code Lyoko, we've all seen at least one, I have to say that this show is racist, uninteresting and meaningless. <br /> <br /> Each episode ends with robotboy wins, except for one exception, as robotboy basically lets this over-geeky freakazoid fly away on a jetpack. The wit is pretty raw too, I think it's mostly people who say the word "Suck" or farting, I think the waves on the show are pretty shocking too. Is there not one who hides a bowling ball under his hatred, and the other uses a chain, for god's sake, what kind of school he should go to. Not to mention his older brother, who is psychologically cross-border and has no other characteristics. <br /> <br /> The whole show I feel is ripping off megas XLR and Fosters. As you could say trio coop, jamie and kiva as well as robotboy resembles megas where he beats everyone no matter what the odds are and he is free spirited despite being a robot. <br /> <br /> there is simply no appeal for this show, I'm surprised it's still running.
