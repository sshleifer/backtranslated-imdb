On his birthday, a little boy tells his mother that he is not her son and that he wants to go home to his real mother. In some ways, Comedy De L'Innocence looks like it comes from another time for filmmaking, perhaps the 60s or 70s. It definitely reminded me of Losey's secret ceremony (1968) and Richard Loncraine's Full Circle (1977), both of which deal with the loss, grief and relationship between parents and "lost" children (curiously both movie stars Mia Farrow). <Br /> <br /> All three films are populated with unsympathetic characters that behave in strange and inexplicable ways. All three films have a cool feel, both emotionally and literally. All three films focus on mother-child relationships, and ultimately, all three films ask the question - 'what is genuine, what is imagined?' <br /> <br /> Beautiful but flawless, it gives no easy answer and leaves much hanging, inexplicable and strange.
