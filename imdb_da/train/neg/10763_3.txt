First of all, what's good in the movie? Any beautiful actress? the exotic background? the fact that the actors do not laugh while acting (I would have if I had been in their situation)? I do not know. The story is simple: A Catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who (another abstract painter) killed his little brother, a male prostitute (raped by another priest when he was young ...). I'm afraid there's nothing here to learn or to think about serial killers, art or religion. Dennis Hopper is not very good here. This is the worst episode of the worst season of "profiles" (series) with substitute actors and incredible coincidences (uncle is the policeman who the girl living in another victim's house could have a baby with the priest, etc. etc).
