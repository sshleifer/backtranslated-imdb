The protagonist Lance Barton is killed and sent to heaven before his time. When heaven learns about the error, he gets the body of just dead rich old and white Mr. Wellington. <br /> <br /> A young black guy in an old white man's body still behaving like the young black man is perhaps fun if you see it done by an old white actor. In this movie I ended up reminding myself several times: "Chris Rock must be an old white guy." <br /> <br /> The whole concept does not play as intended: "Illusion" is not well transported and love story is not credible at all. The fact that all you see is Chris Rock, who plays a young black guy, because the old white person, all to see, appears only in small scenes, is too much of a challenge to the viewers "suspension or disbelief".
