This is the kind of movie that will be good but sucks. First thing, what the hell are the punk trying to do with the school? I think the kids don't seem to realize the situation. Dive guy tells the girl that under his responsibility when she asks why he wants to go back to them, but right after that, he gives a gun to the wheelchair and wants him to go alone, repairing the phone line. Where is the responsibility there? I understand that poor actors have to pay their food, but why not just give them the money to make a silly movie or give the money to a charity. Oh yes, none of them know how to aim. The stupid punk guy shoots in the cafeteria nowhere like a crazy one. They all want to look professional, but they all suck. One more thing, I do not think there is no emergency exit at school, the children try several doors, but they are all locked. What happens if there is fire and dumass the security guard is dead? It is illegal not to have an emergency exit at school. Still, there is much more to say, but it would be too long. I spent a lot of time in my life looking at a boy.
