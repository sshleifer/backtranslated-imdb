Eh, not a particularly good slasher flick. So acting, effects, decent but well-known and unexpected soundtrack. <br /> <br /> There are three sequential deaths near the beginning of the movie, which gives a pretty good scene where it seems that something goes. Apart from that, there are many signs wandering around, not aware of what is going on or hunting for red herring more dead of time than people. There are other deaths and the killer is an equal opportunity killer, not partial to any implementation. The killer also wants to put other people up to kill innocent people too. The identity is not revealed at the end, and the subject is rather thin and we don't care. <br /> <br /> Probably the movie is going on around Christmas, but it's not an important factor. A scene is lit with Christmas lights, it's about it. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty dark with a muddy image most of the time, at least on the videotape I watched. Some of the dialogue was lost in some of the open scenes. The ending should have been stronger than it was. We think we realize what happened, even though there is a chance something else did.
