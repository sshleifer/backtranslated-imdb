On a distant planet, a psychopath is rescued from performing a rummonk. He releases a couple of colleagues and breaks out of prison in a spaceship. They dock on a ridiculously huge spacecraft that orbits a supernova star. This massive craft is populated by only three people, presumably because the film's budget did not show up to employ many players. At least to cut a long story short, the three treats end in a game of cat and mouse with the evil ones. <br /> <br /> The psychopath of this movie is curious because he is annoying. 'Annoying' is generally not an expression you would use to describe a lunatic - monster, scary, dangerous, but not 'annoying', but he is. The three people manned by the giant ship are seriously convincing as guaranteeing such important roles - this ship is practically the size of a city! Given that the film is set about 50 years in the future, it is somewhat optimistic that such a great craft could exist, never remembering the fact that it is used for such a relatively everyday task. Despite the large size of the spaceship, the crew has all terribly kitted out, small rooms, and the dining room consists of what appears to be a plastic table and chairs. But there are many corridors. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty well-acted and it acts as an average sci-fi thriller. But nothing good.
