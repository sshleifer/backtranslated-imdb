OK, so Mr. Agrama's company (involved in a dubious business with former Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi) produced a horrible mish-mash by a Mr Carl Macek. What is this horrible mish-mash I'm talking about? Now, Macek took three completely independent Japanese sci-fi animated series (namely Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada), added the TONS of dialogue - stating that the American audience is too stupid to understand the narrative and artistic virtue of silence - heavily edited for violent content, added some metaphysical mumbo jumbo, dubbed it by some of the worst voice actors this side of acting hell (Reba West's song was - and still is - unbearable and a total rebellion, especially in relation to Mrs Mari Iijima) .. And the result was an 85 episode series of hundreds of continuity issues and plot holes. Of course, mecha was cool to look at (especially those in "Macross Saga") and the plot parts that were rude were good. But what was good about Robotech was not the result of Macek's work or the "talent number" he recruited. It was because of the hardnesses and endeavors that they (uncredited - why? Would I be too bold to accuse HG of plagiarism here?) Japanese creators. Those of us who eventually got wind of the real deal and compared the originals to Robotech now want us to have never been exposed to Robotech. The originals are so much better, of course, and give much more meaning. <br /> <br /> However, Robotech made something worthwhile: it prompted the legendary anime creator Leiji Matsumoto to launch a campaign to protect Japanese anime creators' intellectual property from such unauthorized and uninvited - for recasting as talented people like Carl Macek produces.
