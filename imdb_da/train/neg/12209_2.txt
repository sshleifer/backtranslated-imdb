Many years ago, when I was a bad teenager, my best friend and brother both had a policy to pay for the person who chose the movie. And while I would never pay to see some of the shed they took me with, I couldn't resist a free movie tour! That was how I came to see the crap as the other Conan movie and never say again! Now it is despite being a miserable movie that is entertaining to watch - in brain-dead kind. And technically, the stunters and camera work are good, so it raises my rating all the way to a 2! So why is the movie so bad? Well, unlike the first Rambo movie, this has virtually no plot, Rambo himself says only about 3 words (except grunts and yells), which is a redundant and completely irrelevant and undeveloped "romance" and the movie is a giant stupid) special effect. And what arises terrible special effects. While 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are shot at Rambo, no one has any effect on him and almost any bullet or arrow Rambo shot hits his mark! And while the evil guys use AK-47s, helicopters and rockets, Rambo has in some scenes a bow and arrows with what looks like nuclear-powered tips !! The scene where one bad guy shoots at him when he slowly and quietly launches one of these exploding arrows is especially made for stupid viewers! It was wonderfully parodyed in the UHF with the lead role Weird Al. Plus, HOT SHOTS, PART DEUX also makes a fun parody of the genre - not just this stupid scene. <br /> <br /> All in all, a movie so stupid and pointless, it's almost like self-pity!
