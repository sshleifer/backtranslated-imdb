First of all, the big named actors need the money ... The surgical scenes were ridiculous .... and surely they must know that people who have little knowledge of medicine will find this quite absurd ..... Anesthesiologists do not leave the room during a heart transplant .... nor do they operate in a small room with no instruments, heart lung equipment and sterile techniques ... just a joke ... could not concentrate on the story line because of all the stupid operational scenes ... no blood, no staff and then the hero doc comes in and takes over ... it's not a movie to think adults .... Also, the budget must have been limited ... street scene was OK but who was a technical advisor .... Seems it was ruled by a total idiot. Save your money and wait until it comes out on DVD and not rent it ..
