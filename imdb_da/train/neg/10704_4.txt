It's Die Hard meets Cliffhanger when a ski resort is besieged by terrorists, and it's up to a policeman, Jack (Crackerjack) to stop this. <br /> <br /> A B-Action movie borrowing from other movies and quite good with pretty good action, a ridiculous plot (as always in these movies) and three fine stars. Thomas Ian Griffith as policeman and Nastasja Kinski and Christopher Plummer as terrorists. If you don't like stupid B-action movies, it's not for you.
