Camp Blood III is a great improvement on Camp Blood II as it sounds mostly in the right places and a rudimentary plot. This time, they have ventured a little further away from the parking lot, the other two films were filmed, where there is a good move as you can no longer hear cars driving past what should be a remote wilderness. <br /> <br /> This time there is a reality TV show and a fake clown to scare participants. This is hardly a new idea, I have seen at least three other horror movies with exactly the same premise where the real killer appears, but at least this one has a plot instead of people being randomly stabbed with a knife. <Br /> <br /> Unlike the other two in the series, this one is certainly good for a couple of laughs. I liked how there is a shooting effect when someone gets stuck early and the way in which Mike floats behind people like a phantom. <br /> <br /> I don't know why anyone would like to make a third Camp Blood movie, I would have thought it would be better to start from scratch, but at least they've tried it. The half naked deformed woman was a little to me, it seems they were trying to maintain continuity by hiring some freaks who would get her clothes off for $ 5 like they did in other movies. They still haven't figured out that a machete is used to cut, not stick, but oh it's a Camp Blood movie, what do you expect? If you like crap movies, you get some fun out of this.
