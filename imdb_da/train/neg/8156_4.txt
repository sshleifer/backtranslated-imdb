Prom Night 2 is an OK horror movie, but prom night is much better, and this film about how prom queen Mary Lou in 1957 is killed by her boyfriend and returns 30 years later for revenge. The best actor in this movie is Micheal Ironside and the movie stars other OK actors and actresses such as Justin Louis (I), Wendy Lyon, Lisa Schrage and Richard Monette (I). And there are some good acting scenes like when Mary Lou kills the girl trying to hide in her closet by crushing the lockers together and how one of the students is on the computer, and Mary Lou electrocuts him to death. Over all this is an ok / good horror movie and my rating is 4 out of 10.
