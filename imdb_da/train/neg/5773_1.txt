Another great effort from the United States most underrated film maker. His knowledge of racism is STAGGERING, and IMPRESSES me on more than one level. The accusations that Lee is really just a scary little racist, a poisonous dwarf who opportunistically exploits Hollywood's affirmative action system to make inferior quality movies are completely non-unusual, straightforward right propaganda. The notion that Lee would resort to abusing the current climate of political correctness in America to produce hate-filled anti-white films is simply extraordinary and malicious. <br /> <br /> Some of Lee's detractors even go so far as to suggest that GOTB exhorts African Americans as they lay down other races: of course, another FALSEHOOD is mediated by people who are against peaceful co-existence between different races in America. and other places. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene in the movie is a long dialogue early between the rich black republican and the others in the bus. The views presented by that man are simply wrong - everywhere. 100% UNTRUE. He's LACKS training, unlike the brilliantly lit boys who definitely throw him away from the bus. <br /> <br /> TERRIFIC shows, and an INTELLIGENT script provide a viewing experience that has been rivaled by political films made since. <br /> <br /> I would also like to point out the incessant LIES that the Million-Man March only had 80,000 people participating in it! <br /> <br /> (And now all you have to do is take the antonyms of all the words in capital letters ...) <br /> <br /> So what does Lee send here? If someone does not agree with your political views, simply use violence and throw him off the bus. I thought the movie said "get on the bus" ...? Sir. Apparently Mr.Lee for bus segregation is after all, it is no different than the CCL lunatics before him: the bus is only for the blacks that are in line with the democratic party's thinking. So much to "liberate the slaves" ... The final credits: "This movie was fully funded by black people." And distributed and marketed by a large Hollywood studio run by Jews and whites, which Farrakhan despises ...
