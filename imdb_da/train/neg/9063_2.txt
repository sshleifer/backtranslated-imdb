The fact that most of the budget for this presumably went on the strong cast list should not matter if it had been created with flair and imagination and a little sympathy for the original satirical intention. Instead, we get the risk of bad song and dance sequences with picturesque beggars and whores, and the final alienation is achieved by pulling back to reveal that the action has taken place at a musical stage enough for a production that is more Lionel 'Oliver' Blair than Brecht. The actor is shamefully abused: Migens and Walters are good, but do not have to try very hard: The girls have at least a good voice and some feel for the material. Julia looks perfect like Mack, but struggles with the character, straitjacketed by a fake plummy accent. Harris's Peachum is embarrassed and Polly is horrible. The adaptations of lyrics, writings, and music are often awkward: it was a bad step to base the movie on Marc Blitzstein's bowlerized Broadway version, but at least his words were singable, unlike most of what has been interpolated in creeds . And the attempt to overcome the low budget by filming at claustrophobic angles on foggy sets is turned on in garish blues and oranges, as if some of Vittorio Storaro's cellars fail completely - the movie just seems to be cheap, scary and thoughtlessly made. Degrading.
