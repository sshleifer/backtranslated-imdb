Well done You can't get used to it, just the reason for a big star throw .. I think all I can see is a bunch of talents wasting their time on a big screen with some pathetic humor that will appeal to I don't know who? some pathetic songs that will be heard by whom? some pathetic sudden trips justified by whom? race against time? Do you mean waste in time? OK so first you pamper your child, then you teach him a lesson, wow we are so ignorant of who said it is an excellent new concept, probably some other species than people okay, let me comment As humans, movies have a good message to be given, but it might well have been given by a stranger sitting beside you in the bus, rather than going for such a waste film to learn it. Hindi movies have shown it a lot already, and neither can I waste my time writing about waste anyway!
