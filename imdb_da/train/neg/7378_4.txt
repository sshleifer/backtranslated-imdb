Steven's mate, remember when you said this: <br /> <br /> "Try to find the way of least resistance and use it without harming others. Live with integrity and morals, not just with people but with all beings . " <br /> <br /> You haven't done it, you have mortally wounded your fans and their morals with these "movies" I wouldn't even bother if I didn't know you're so much better than this I have seen videos of you teaching, you are so much better than this why why brother why ... steamroller productions have been steam-rolled i promise bro, i'm not afraid of you, i'll tell you the truth in your face so we can fix it . well I like some others dropped in 90% but to be fair I was tired and had a big meal just an hour before the hand Sensai, what are you doing. 12 million? really? Do you have any idea what we could have done with $ 12,000,000? It could have been in the theaters and a bump if you wished we could have donated money from the big profits to a homeless shelter or something. These post-producing people rip you off man, the choreography was non-existent, we can do better man, the blinking eye was from the men in black movie, I half expected the blacksmith to show up or inch Lee Jones to tell them they were does not apply to eyelids. <br /> <br /> Seagal you are an Aikido champion, why do you make it to yourself for us? When you got on the stage, you had such a fresh direct style, and it was obvious you are a teacher because your movement was so clear and sharp that you saw your first three movies, I felt like you taught me something, now I feel as if you are just being torn down or something I want to save your buddy, this time you are the one who was killed and I will avenge you by helping you make the best movie ever. bro, I know who you really are, I know the truth about the Nico movie. let us talk. <br /> <br /> Contact me man, I have some fresh ideas. I'm a nit picker. I swear that you will not be disappointed with my attention to detail and we will do it to the fan man, your fans deserve better, we hang on, but the string is about to catch. I swear I won't let your movie out of the door with a single flaw in it. I'm still trying to find out if it was the worst copy ever, or you have laryngitis, but I promise you, I can make a better impression of your voice than lama **** who didn't even try. I hope you kicked him in the nuts as his payment. I can come up with a story and a plot that can be matched with your devotion by your student / daughter / wife / dog / house plant niche and I promise you that we will bring you back, I promise, I will also go in that direction that makes people think, if you allow me to promise, we will make a movie that people will go away and discuss it, a serious thought-provoking experience that changes the experience. <br /> <br /> Steven Seagal This is my official written consent to IMDb to release my contact information to you in order to revive one of the best martial arts heroes I've ever seen, for the record not Italian, her Irish and Jew so you call it bad, I call it great trader because you have believed for 20 years that Seagal is Italian :) little change your perception does not.
