Burt Kennedy used to be a very good instructor, but you would never know about this carpentry mess. This movie doesn't just look like it's cheap - most of the fighting scenes are lifted from the far superior "The Last Command" from 1955, and the footage shot 32 years earlier looks more modern than anything in this picture. The few action scenes that were actually shot at this movie are disorganized, confused and incompetent, and look just as lukewarm as the rest of the picture. This has the look of a poor student movie (and the budget didn't seem to be much more). It moves like molasses, and it's mostly either over-the-top ham or under-the-top comatose - although Raul Julia comes out better than most of the rest - and it's got annoying historical inaccuracies. On top of that, it's too long. If you are going to make a boring movie, do it in an hour or so and overcome it - don't stretch it for three hours, as it does. If you want to watch a good movie about the Alamo, check out John Wayne's 1960 version or even the 1955 movie, from which this movie stole its action scenes. Hard to believe it took six producers to make a movie this miserable. Skip it over.
