California is disturbing. I think there is no reason to tell this story. It is neither entertaining nor social in value. Technically, the film is very good, the performance is top rate and first class. The story evolves in an exciting way that is of interest. But in the end, this movie is sick and is detestable to decency. I recommend California to none.
