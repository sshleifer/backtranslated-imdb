I totally agree with the review by a Variety reviewer that the film is never as fun, lively or insight into the creative process as its premise seems to warrant. Narrative is the mess and the lighting is really problematic. If the film is supposed to be character-driven, poor lighting does not improve the play, and it is sometimes difficult to observe the actors' facial expressions. Many non-South Africans find it difficult to follow the spoken English in the movie, and some of the local humor will be lost in the process. I watched movies at the Cape Town World Cinema festival last year. Comments and reactions to the film ranged from unwatchable and sloppy to a successful departure from the films of our painful past. Unfortunately, Bunny Chow will not be remembered as one of the bright lights of the South African new wave, but some of the remarkable films about our apartheid story will actually be judged among our best in our 110-year film history. Not surprisingly, the movie from cinemas in Cape Town disappeared only two weeks after its release and from most of the movie theaters in Durban and Gauteng. It has clearly limited appeal among South African audiences.
