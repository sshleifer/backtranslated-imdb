Doppelganger has its moments, but they are few and far between. <br /> <br /> Basically, this is a class B blend of pop-psych thriller, ghost story and horror. Drew Barrymore plays a young woman haunted by her pastor's demons (most of her family has been murdered and she was at least one of the main abuser), or does she just have a really bad case of multiple personalities illness? George Newbern is her new roommate, and most of it is about him. <br /> <br /> Newber's character is quite sympathetic and both he and Barrymore do decent work (but not exactly well). The mediocre to (at times) utterly horrible script and the unimpressive directing seem to have combined to sink the rest of the notion into oblivion. Leslie Hope's character is memorable, but so annoying that you will forget her. <br /> <br /> The reason dissolves into a bifurcated (a history arc is psychological realism, the other is supernatural horror) so poorly conceived, acted and photographed that it effectively counteracts most of the value the film had previously achieved. <br /> Overall, the movie has the feel of what can be expected to be the result of M. Knight Shamalyan's first undergraduate film class. The action and the script for the two leaders are just good enough to make you a little bit about them - at least until the movie runs out completely. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - send your doppelgangs but avoid a first-person meetings.
