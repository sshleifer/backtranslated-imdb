102 Dalmatians (2000, Dir. Kevin Lima) <br /> <br /> Thinking about being healed, Cruella de Vil (Close) is released from prison and sets out to get a fresh start in life. Cruella is doing well, helping busy homeless dogs away from the street. When the clock hits Big Ben, things get bad. The hypnotic cure is the reverse, and Cruella is back, and this time she is determined to get the spotted coat she always wanted. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close represents his role as Cruella de Vil and again is the highlight of movies. Each scene with her is worth seeing in this boring sequel, which feels more a repetition of the previous movie, rather than a new story. She's changed. ?? Ken Sheperd (Ioan Gruffudd)
