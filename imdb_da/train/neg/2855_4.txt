"Mad Dog Time" ... "Trigger Happy" whatever you want to call it ... simply does not hit the mark. Maybe it's just me, maybe I just don't like Gangster comedies (which I thought Oscar, Johney Dangerously and Mafia also sucked) It's probably more "witty sharp play" than all out Comedy, only it's not so witty and sharp as it (or the other reviewers) makes it to be. <br /> <br /> Rick, Mick, Vic Thing was old at first making it a regular gag, sometimes it was painful to watch. <br /> <br /> There wasn't enough room changes or feelings for the period they were supposed to be in. The majority of the movie was either put in "Dreyfus's Club" or a number of offices / dim rooms. .. (what was going on in the gun) Goldblum continued to win?) The support material was ... on the paper excellent (good to see Silva & Drago), but characters were killed before they had time to develop themselves. and Richard Pryor's cameo was a joke! Romance and love element in the movie also bogged it down. <br /> <br /> 4/10 I don't think I'll be back to it anytime soon.
