As a child, my friends and I all thought that Gymkata was the most violent, bloody movie ever made. I'm not sure who started this rumor. It was probably born out of the frustration of 10-year-olds who were not allowed to see it for some reason. Years after Gymkata was released, it became a multi-year sennate cable film, and as a result, I have been able to make up for lost time. I must have seen scenes from this horrible excuse for a movie over a dozen times, and I can always see it from 1-2 seconds off the screen. Apart from the forced coupling of gymnastics and martial arts, the bad dubbing, the rigid dialogue and the eerie difficult line of story, the film does have some things on the other hand. With all that is bad about the film visually, the sound is actually quite entertaining. Never before has a stroke or kick the country with so little power and so much volume! The preserved Kung-Fu sounds are naughty but the slow and dimmed music, and the nearly 5 minute slow motion scene is really weird. Chase through the city demented, bloodthirsty villagers are not really excited as much as it is annoying, and there are probably bad wigs and extras that everyone looks into the camera and waves to make this train wreck a little fun. Could it be on the way to cult-classical status? Where is MST3K when we need it?
