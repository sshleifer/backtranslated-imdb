It is one of the fun things to be young that one can easily be fooled by advertising. I've talked before on another movie, where commercially for (comedy) movies makes it seem more fun than it is. Seeing the ad for this in 1981 made me think it was a wildly fun movie. What I and my brother and I saw with me did not know that the scene used in the TV ad was the very first scene in the movie! <br /> <br /> Since this scene is the end result of everything that came before in the movie, I can only guess that there was nothing else fun to use! The last scene, thanks to a youth drink, is Dr. Fu Manchu turns from a long-crooked old man to a bright young Asia / Elvis as a rock star! (With back up singers no less!) <br /> <br /> Set without any real ground in the 1930s, Peter Sellers does his best with the material that is present, but he doesn't get any good reason for his "Comic" moments. The rest of the actors were simply boring, and my brother and I were constantly laughing at nothing. It was only natural that we expect a "Pink Panther" type comedy, Peter Sellers was so good at it. <br /> <br /> It's a pitiful shame, it was his last movie before he died. His appearance at the Muppet Show was more entertaining than this unimaginable flop. Yet I do not fail him. I mistake everyone else involved for not trying to make a better movie of this. 2 stars is generous !!
