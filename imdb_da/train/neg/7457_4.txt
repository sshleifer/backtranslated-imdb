Chris Kattan is a great actor on Saturday Night Live ... but he'll probably leave the film industry alone unless he gets some sort of creative control. He plays an annoying peppy character who basically comes out as mildly delayed and at speed. Want to know the only fun parts? The things they showed in the previews. Yes, his reproduction of taking on me is fun. Nothing else is. Especially when you can tell, he tries very hard to be a physical comedian whom he should not try because he is one. And yet his "demolition of the vet's office" comes out a little like swelling badly. This movie made me develop an eye job. Avoid it at all costs and watch out for SNL.
