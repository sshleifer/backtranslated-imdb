Plot of the 'House of Games' is the strongest thing about it: a successful writer and psychologist is confused by a gang of writers, but when she discovers the evil part of herself who enjoys the excitement of what they do, she finally gets her. It is about the course: but someone must take responsibility for ensuring that it comes across as being traded by puppets. It must be director Mamet: Lindsay Crouse has had a varied and fairly stable TV and movie career so she can't do this badly all the time. She had to go from upward, cool, controlled professional to calculate, vicious, fast-paced lady who's having fun, as evidenced by the change from beige trousers (which she seems to have for three days, including underwear) to floppy flowering. But everyone seems to speak their lines in the same clipped, precise manner; I imagine Mamet wanted to make sure that not a syllable of his scintillating script was missing. The effect is disturbing and destroys the atmosphere of mystery and excitement, which he is probably trying to create. Sometimes "House of Games" loses any connection to how people actually behave or talk, and just become a mechanism to spin out of the plot. The lumpy vibes'n'oboe faux-jazz soundtrack doesn't help either. The ultimate result is that the only entertainment that needs to be is guessing the outcome, and the sooner you do it, the faster you will be bored with the robotic, two-dimensional notions. And they smoke too much !!!
