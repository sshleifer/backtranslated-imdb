The long list of "big" names in this flick (including ubiquitous John Mills) didn't shoot me to the extent that I couldn't judge the movie on its actual profits. It is FULL of stereotypes, caricatures and standard, set scenes, from the humble air-ace hero to the loud mouth of the yank flyer. The music track was such that at some point about an hour before the end I thought the movie was over: loud, rising crescendo, grand blossoming and then ending silence, but then the movie continued! I found no real story, random writing, but beautifully pressed uniforms and the beautiful Jean Simmons (prenose job) with a bursting little digy. I can't say that this picture has some of the ingredients that make a movie great. I found it maudlin, mawkish and less.
