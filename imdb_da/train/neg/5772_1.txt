I just need to add if someone actually reads this and hasn't quite got the point yet. These other reviewers are not joking around, it is really the worst color film you will probably ever see. When the movie started, I couldn't believe that something like this actually made it look to the world. <br /> <br /> They don't just say that when they said it looked like a home video. It really does. Like the "director" the family took the hi8 camcorder (before DV cameras and computer non-linear editing), no other equipment (lights, audio equipment, etc.), grabbed some decent-looking actors and went out to shoot a movie. No script, just make it up as he went along. <br /> <br /> When I saw it, it was on my mono TV so I only have one audio channel (left of right speaker). At first I thought I had hooked it up wrong. The movie was silent until someone spoke for a few minutes. I got up and switched over to the other channel and suddenly I could hear music and sound effects, but then could not hear the dialogue. They recorded the sound of various bloody channels! I think there are movies that can be fun to watch, so bad, they are good, kind of things. I'm not sure this is one of them. I mean, I admit to being a bit of a budding movie producer. And when you see bad movies, you just want to go out there and prove that you can do better, you know. But observing this just made me sad for anyone who did it. <br /> <br /> As bad as they were, the actors are the only good thing about this. I thought the chicken was hot and was disappointed with the shortness of shortness. A bit of T and A from her would have raised the score from nothing to maybe a 3 or 4. But unfortunately no. If you want to make a movie, but it turns out bad, throw in some accurate nudity. Work for Roger Corman.
