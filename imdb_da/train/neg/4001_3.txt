After hearing so much about the 1990s Cracker series without seeing any of them, I looked forward to this eagerly. The combination of Jimmie McGovern and Robbie Coltrane couldn't go wrong. How wrong I was! <br /> <br /> Polemics, supported by frequent, repetitive and violent flashbacks, were overwhelming. The production tried to be super modern, but the flashing boxes and even the childish writing irritated. Robbie Coltrane slept through the two hours and came up with inexplicable and unlikely "insights" and police were portrayed as one-dimensional bumbling idiots. As a result, the excitement that was never built up and the next to the last scene (no details of fear of spoilers) was so scary a piece of TV drama that I have seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> No, I don't want to see more of these, but I will go back to the DVDs in the 1990s series to see if they match their reputation.
