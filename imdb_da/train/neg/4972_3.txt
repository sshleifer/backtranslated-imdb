It's hard to say what was the worst thing about this show: the bad plays, poor acoustics of various portions, poor CGI, wrong sets for the period, the poor script. It would have been nice if the manuscript followed the original story a little closer - there is enough excitement and good material in Beowulf to give a lot of good material and a better storyline than the scriptwriters could come up with. /> And why introduce a strange new weapon like an armband burning explosive bolts? <br /> <br /> I see that this movie was made in "only" 21 days. It shows in the absence of quality. I start to believe that this is the general (bad) attitude taken by Sci-Fi channel (and others) when it comes to making movies out of classic stories over the past few years. !
