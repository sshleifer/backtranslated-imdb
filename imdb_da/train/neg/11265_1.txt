There have been some low moments in my life when I have been confused and depressed. Sitting through Rancid Aluminum was one of these. <br /> <br /> Warning signs were there. No premiere (even the stars didn't want to attend) and no reviews in magazines. The only reason I sat through the movie was hoping I could get some sleep. Nothing in the movie was explained. The story was idiotic. I cheered at a time when the film's management seemed to have been shot, so to my growing despair, it was revealed that he had not really been shot subdued my joy. I sincerely hope that everyone involved in the movie is hanged by this cruelty. <br /> <br /> There were some positive aspects, primarily accidental moments of humor. For example, the scene where the main character of some unknown reason feels need to relieve himself in a toilet room while telling the person in the next dresser is putting his fingers in the ears. <br /> <br /> My words cannot explain the anger I feel, so I must conclude. <br /> <br /> Rancid Aluminum: For sadists, blasts and regressors who want to torture themselves.
