I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating when I checked it on IMDb after watching it. This is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen many bad movies. It looks like a good movie at first, but when he gets into surgery, I couldn't believe how bad it was. This voice-over destroys everything! Imagine being cut open like that and then listening to what he says. I watched the movie in German so I don't really know what he said in English, but ironic things like "Yes, it doesn't hurt .."? What is this? Count yourself "Think about something else" and then forget about your pain by just thinking about your girlfriend's just ... stupid. And his mother ... how in hell is she counting something like that? Someone will tell her that the son died in the operation (what she had to expect). Plus she found some letters in Jessica Alba's bag. plus that "she knows the hospital" thing ... and then takes her "a second" to find out? What the hell? ^^ And the end ... why does the police break them? The patient died in the operation, that was all that happened. The drunk doctor also knows nothing else ... and then they break all of them, even the girlfriend ??? Why??? Despite everything I think, Christensen did a bad job, but it doesn't really matter to me ... the mistakes and stupid things I wrote above are the problem. I watched this movie with some friends and we all were very disappointed ... As I said, one of the worst movies I've ever seen ... Just don't look at it;)
