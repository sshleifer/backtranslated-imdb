Even worse than the worst David Lynch "confusathon", "Brain Dead" makes no sense at all. Shamefully wasted talent (Bill Pullman, Bill Paxton), jumping around as if they are in a "Tom and Jerry" cartoon on acid. There is negligible character development. It simply begins to climb on the "strange scale" until the climax in total chaos. Do not suck in this because of the above fine actors. They don't get anything to work with, and you'll wonder what happens throughout the unbearable 85 minutes. I strongly recommend avoiding "Brain Dead" at all costs unless you are spreading your brain into total nonsense. - NOTE
