We capture down <br /> <br /> Picture format: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: Silent <br /> <br /> (Black and white - Short film) <br /> <br /> Stan 'n' Ollie is mixed with a few floozies (Kay Deslys and Vera White) after choosing to visit a theater that is burning down in their absence! Needless to say, their tyrannical wives (Vivien Oakland and Bess Flowers) are not amused ... Leo McCarey's OK comedy laid the narrative frame of William Seiter's masterpiece SONS OF THE DESERT (1934) with L & H playing fur-folded victims of circumstances forced to to tell a monstrous lie that recovers in a spectacular way. Much of it is very fun, especially the scene where Stan is teased by Deslys, leading to a violent game of push and shove. Some of the fun, however, is obsessed with Oakland and Flowers, who play their roles quite evenly, adding an element of discomfort to the 'henpecked husband' scenario.
