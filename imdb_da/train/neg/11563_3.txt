This Italian semi-horror movie starts out much like a soft core porn movie and turns into a mystery that has few to many loose ends to be good, and that it's pretty boring, making this movie just unavailable to my taste. The only thing really worth seeing is the many breasts scattered throughout the film. The story has a guy who, at the beginning of the movie, lures girls to his castle, where he continues to take them to his dungeon, set on fire and apparently kill them. They show nudity, but they never really show the murders at this time in the movie. Then the guy finds a nice red head at a party and continues to cope with her and marry her. He has one thing for red heads that you see when his beloved former wife Evelyn was also one she died also in circumstances that may not have been the spectator's business. After many numerous scenes, murder begins to take place with snakes, foxes and so on. At this point, it is easy enough to find out who is responsible for the murders, and what the subject is, then you have an indecent end, where everything breaks, not so nicely. This movie just didn't work for me, it gave me many questions, and the last third of the movie just didn't have the first two thirds of the movie. Explaining Evelyn's death would have helped the film, which would have some sort of end, where Evelyn got up from the grave. Granted the title is not completely misleading as she supposed to leave the grave, just not under her own power. Gore is very bright for the most part, as there is a scene with the foxes and a scene at the end with also some blood. I mostly thought this movie was a bit boring.
