This is a weak movie with a troubled history of cuts and names. It doesn't work at all. First, the dramaturgy is all wrong. It goes very slowly in the first place and goes so fast and unsatisfactory to an end. But there is (and may have to do with the cuts) an unpleasant movement between genres. It starts with being a thriller that needs to be taken at face value and then degenerating into a father's rather than satire. The ending can be fun, but it is also so silly that I almost felt it offended my intelligence (how small there is). So the film tries to be everything, but it does not succeed at all at all. You can also see it in the very unstable character development. You almost get the impression Connery plays three roles instead of one.
