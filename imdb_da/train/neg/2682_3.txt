I was looking forward to watching this movie for a long time after seeing "Return to Paradise" which I thought was gritty. I was so disappointed. The most realistic thing about it was the unpredictable end that I think was partially stolen from "Return to Paradise". <br /> <br /> Maybe I was expecting too much. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, Danes, Beckinsale and Pullman were great in their roles. Although I did not like the Danes' character and first and found her very annoying. <br /> <br /> I couldn't see anything realistic about the movie. It could have been done so much better, for example, there could have been more emphasis on prison conditions and the sheer horror. It was too cheery a movie to be realistic. There could also have been more action and excitement <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the "tragic" end. I couldn't predict it. But then I really didn't care what happened to them. <br /> <br /> 3/10
