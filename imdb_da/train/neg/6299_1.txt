This inappropriate adaptation of yet another of Martin Ami's weaker novels even fails to create comparisons with other druggy oeuvres as Requiem For A Dream or something written by Irvine Walsh as it struggles to determine whether it is a slack stick cartoon or a hyperrealistic hallucination. <br /> <br /> Competition law by William Marsh in supersaturated shades converges a group of public school kills in a mansion waiting for three American friends for a weekend of decadent drug abuse. And that's it. Apart from the ridiculous part-plot, which is soon to be the biggest plot of nonsense about an extremist cult group that expresses itself with the violent killings of the world's elite characters, whether political or spoiled. Within the first coil you know exactly where it goes. <br /> <br /> What is a talented actor Paul Bettany doing in this tiring, poorly written bore? Made before his rebellion for fame and Jennifer Connelly one can be sure that if he had been offered this waste now he had immediately changed agents! Avoid.
