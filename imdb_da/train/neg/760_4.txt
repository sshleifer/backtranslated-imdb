An uninspired and unforgettable "new" Columbo who sees man-in-the-mac attend his nephew's wedding just for his bride to disappear on their wedding night. Columbo examines ... <br /> <br /> And it's about it: indifferently plotted and surprisingly charged with a flat script, written by Robert Van Scoyk, who wrote the very pleasant Columbo story "Murder Under Glass "in the glare of the detective; There is not even a murder to speak of, and the greatest amount of ingenuity Columbo gives by the scriptwriter is the dulling of suspects through the pictures taken at the wedding, which includes everyone there! <br /> <br /> Devoid of any Columbo move possible, I thought I saw an episode of Hill Street Blues. An insult to the series' history, with appropriate soap opera style that works. Very avoidable things.
