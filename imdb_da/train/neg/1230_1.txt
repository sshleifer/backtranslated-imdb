Words cannot describe how totally stupid this story is (and therefore badly this movie)! Basinger, Del Toro ... what did you think? So there is a mall and its parking lot is full. Basinger character advocates buying a cup of tea and some packaging paper. When she comes out, the whole square is so empty that no one hears two shots shot nearby ?? Even though she lives there when she drives away from evil, she goes to the furthest and godly place instead of the nearest police station or at least a crowded place? COME ON !!! I don't even want to go into the infamous red toolbox as other people have done it before. Don't see how she kills the moronic thugs one by one. <br /> <br /> It's so silly, without the slightest logic, I can only warn you to see it, it's a total waste of time, honestly !!
