This 1974 Naschy Outing is directed by Leon Klimovsky, and a clear look at the advertising images and packaging can make you think that this medieval drum is somewhere between "Inquisition" and "Sadomania". Unfortunately not. <br /> <br /> This is a strict PG affair with tame torture sequences, no nudity and little edge at all. Naschy (as I am a fan of) supports his stuff like Gilles de Lancre, "Antiguo Mariscal de la nacion". Unfortunately, he is more pantomime villain than anything else. You get the feeling of this movie that we've seen him (and it) done before. Therefore strictly alone for Naschy.
