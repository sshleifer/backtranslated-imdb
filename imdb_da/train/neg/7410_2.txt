I love horror movies that bring out a real amount of mysteries such as. "Quiet hill" (which I found to be quite good but still lacking) and movies that keep you guessing, I thought was one of those movies. In the beginning, the film starts with a really good tension and builds a good starting point for a good horror scene, but after that it just rolls down the hill and from there it only goes faster and faster. I first mentioned the quiet tray of a reason because I can see many "stolen" themes from that movie in here .. All in all, I want to say, quietly look instead of this, it's better, it's more scary it has a lot more excitement and also the end is much better .. And best of all, you will not feel ripped as I did with this one. This just seems to be one of them "I like the movie so I'm going to restore it in my own really bad version" kinda movie .. Oh and one more thing ... Lordi .. in a horror movie ... it is like trying to scare a child with a foster carriage who has "hug me and I will love you forever" written on the stomach of it.
