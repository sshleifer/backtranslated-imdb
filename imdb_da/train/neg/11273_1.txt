How can you collect this respectable cast of young British actors and come up with such a pile of cinematic fertilizer? Horrible script, annoying hectic camera, horribly edited, gruesomely badly acted. Only Rhys Ifans is trying to fill his role with life. Another painful proof that "different" sometimes corresponds to "drunk". Why is the money missing before reading scripts beforehand? Do yourself a favor: save yourself and do something else - like hitting a fence on your knees. It is less painful and more fun than this movie!
