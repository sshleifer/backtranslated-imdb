I was dissatisfied with watching this movie with my boyfriend, who, like me, is a fan of the first. This movie down really sucked! It lacked the first magic. You could actually understand every word the mice said, the animation is crazy, the palace is very different from the first movie, there are new characters that were never mentioned before and were horrible, luckily the prince did not have many lines that kept him from sounding silly . Basically, it's like The Lion King 1 1/2 except its various stories that everyone tells of the mice. The reason I give this a 2 out of 10 is because the songs aren't sung by the characters were the most comfortable.
