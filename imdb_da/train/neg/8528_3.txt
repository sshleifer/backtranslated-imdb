What is written on the poster is: "At birth, he got 6 years to live ... By 34 he takes life out of life." Ami is an American born Israeli who was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy at the age of one. At age 34, after the love of his 22-year-old caregiver did not go well, he decided to come to the US to meet the doctor who said he would only have 6 years to live. He wanted to show the doctor that he is still alive and weighs 39 pounds. Why? Your guess is as good as mine, even I have seen this movie. Of course, it is courageous to live when all he can move is his left index finger, but why does he have so much anger at the doctor who diagnosed his illness 34 years ago? His doctor just told his mother that based on medical history, people with their illness will not live long. What is the meaning of him dying on the old doctor's die? Why is tracking down this old doctor in the United States a journey of his lifetime? There are so many things we may be interested in Ami's life: how can he make these animations with the movement of just one finger? How can he go through daily life while it depends entirely on others? How did he live out of his doctor's prediction? How does he act emotionally when others look at him as looking at a strange being? The film didn't tell us anything about it. Instead, the filmmaker got a van and set up a ride to let Ami come up on his old doctor's door to show him that he is still alive. I thought it was a joke.
