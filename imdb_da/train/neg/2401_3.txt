I have seen better teenage werewolf movies in my time, but it does take the cake. More comedy than horror, "Full Moon High" puts "c" in the cheese party. Star quality in this movie is not bad. Just as it was made, it is just being sent downhill downhill. Adam Arkin plays Tony, an all-American high school footballer of the 50s who does not cease to age due to a werewolf bite in Transylvania. The most annoying part of the movie was the violin player. He drove all batty! Ed McMahon plays his ultra-conservative father who met his end of his own ball. Adam's father Alan plays a shrink, which doesn't seem to be top of his game. After all these years, Tony seems to be very out of place because of the attack, and then he gets the chance to catch in his state. More grin than bloodshed, this movie is just a start of the 80s, "Teen Wolf" was an improvement from this! 1 out of 5 stars.
