All the fun things that happen in this sitcom are based on the protagonist Jim being either a bad father, a poor man or generally just hugely selfish. How can it be fun? Of course, a character in a sitcom must be flawless, but Jim's character is mistaken in an extremely unsympathetic way. And why? My guess is that it is because "he should now be better". Jim is not a stupid guy, he can take care of things, and he has opportunities to do so. But he does not choose to. It is a deliberate choice he makes when he chooses not to play with his children, does not shop because he does not want to buy "lady products" and it is a choice he makes when he puts his relatives. <br /> <br /> The other characters seem to be only in the series, so Jim can make someone a shake. If the Cheryl character was a real person, she would have left him many years ago and not stay with deadbeat for 8 years. But unfortunately she is just a catalyst for Jim's quirky middle class extreme selfishness.
