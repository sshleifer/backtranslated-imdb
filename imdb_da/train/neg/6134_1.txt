If I could say it was better than Gymkata, at least I felt my money was not completely wasted. <br /> <br /> Then I saw Steven Segal's deadly soil. <br /> <br /> This movie was supposed to see a resurrection on the MST 3K. If Santa Claus conquers the Martians can make Tom Servo's head explode, wondering what chaos this movie can cause. <br /> <br /> There is a very good reason why Kurt Thomas never had a movie career. <br /> <The writers of this boy must be forced to wear posters every day in their lives, saying "Bitch let me down! I was a writer at Gymkata."
