** Possible front spoiler ** <br /> <br /> Jason (a.c.a. Herb) Evers is a brilliant brain surgeon who, along with wife Virginia Leith, is involved in the most easy-to-use screen crash ever. Leith is beheaded, and the doctor takes her cut back noggin back to his mansion and rejuvenates her head in his lab. The exterior of the mansion was allegedly filmed in Tarrytown's Lyndhurst estate; The Labes scenes were apparently shot in a person's basement. The bandage head is kept alive on "lab equipment" that is almost cheap enough for Ed Wood. Some of the library's music? The highlight of the movie? Later appeared in Andy Milligan's BODY BENED. Leith's head has some heavy metaphysical discourses with another of Ever's misfires, a mutant chained in the closet. Meanwhile, the good doctor knits joints for a body worthy of his wife's gabby noodle. The end, in unwritten prints, contains some spears and splits at the tip when the zucchini-headed monster comes out of the closet to bring the film into a welcome close. This thing took three years to be released, and the audience gave it the bad reception it really deserved. Between this, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE and a few others, 1959, should have been declared The Year Of The Turkey.
