First, I'm not here to grow this movie. I find it quite fun despite the poor production quality. The action here is about as scary as the monster stalking them, even though the monster itself is quite well done ... impressively well done on it. He actually looks like another world war as a family of foreigners on vacation landing in the Himalayas, and while Dad was out taking a ... participant in nature's call, Spot got loose and they just didn't have time to chase him. That, or he's Wishmaster's Caucasian brother. I haven't decided which one. <br /> <br /> In fact, this seems to have been filmed somewhere in snowy land, yes, but more likely Canada somewhere than China everywhere. The trees and prospects say Canada to me, and it's okay that the set area never takes the look or feel of the uber cold one might expect to find in the Himalayas of China. It's a Sci-Fi Channel movie so we can forgive the lack of location. Further, apparently (as we have just established), Sci-Fi executives do not often travel as they do not realize that commercial aircraft are flying over the weather as mentioned here, and the subsequent crash would not actually have happened. But as I said, it's a Sci-Fi Channel movie so we have to forgive some things. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty graphic at times and rotates between "Alive" about the Donner Party, "Predator" about the alien in the forest and any bad wushu movie where they fly around on wires. The Yeti may seem to be jumping around like Spiderman ... or Super Mario ... remember? "Run faster! Hop higher! Live longer!" <br /> <br /> Yeti has also missed his teddy bear. He has searched high and low for it, but cannot seem to do a carcass work. Bad Yeti! You can't help but apologize. It has survived and evolved for thousands of years to undermine severe teddy bears. He has missed his bear. Or maybe it will mate, but the thinking is BANISHED! Do you hear me? Well, it seems to be an unmanned man. REBANISHED! <br /> <br /> And it's superhuman. Well, it's not human ... it's super-Yeti! But then again, what is the normal Yeti? I don't know, but he has a certain Michael Meyer's quality, which is totally disturbing. And he has this great way to clean his coat. FABulous Dahlink! It is spotless white at times when it should not. He's fast super-super super Yeti. Overall? This was very fun to watch, has some good killings and a couple of honest record elements. Despite the horrible gravel-like production style, it is actually quite entertaining. I can't wonder if they are planning on another? <br /> <br /> It ranks a 6.0 / 10 on the M4TV Scale. It ranks a 4.4 / 10 at Movie Scale from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
