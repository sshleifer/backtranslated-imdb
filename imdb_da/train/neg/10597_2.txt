This movie was absolutely horrible. I can't think of one thing good about it. The plot holes were so large you could run a lobster through them. The action was so disgusting that even Jean Claude should be ashamed and it says a lot !!! And dialogue, what dialogue? To think that I was a fan of the first (I use this comment loosely, it's more like a guilty pleasure than anything else). This movie had Goldberg in it to cry aloud !! Nothing good can come from this movie. What makes this movie even worse is that it's so bad that you can't even see it with a bunch of friends to make it fun !!! This must be in my top five worst movies all the time. 2/10 because it's so hard for me to give a 1.
