I watched the Malaysian film "Boeing Boeing" made in 1985 (which is probably inspired by an English film of the same name) long back. The basic story of garam masala is the same - but it is told in a pathetic way, the classic jokes replaced by routine ones found in normal Hindi movies (probably the director did this to suit the taste of the Hindi audience) .. . <br /> <br /> I haven't seen the English original. But had really enjoyed the Malayalam movie (made by Priyadarshan himself), which was a leaping comedy then. Of course, Mohanlal, Mukesh and Sukumari (who made the chef's role) were acting so naturally and spontaneously. I'm probably for the infection of the Malayalam film that I can't tolerate even the minor errors in its Hindi remake. But I still feel that Akshay Kumar and John Abraham have exaggerated. Paresh Rawal has done a decent job - but doesn't reach anywhere near Sukumari. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's okay to compare it to other recent Hindi comedy movies.
