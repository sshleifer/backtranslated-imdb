The story: Young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She ends up in a mental institution after she begins to believe she is actually a cyborg. In the institution she meets Park Il-Sun, a young man who develops a bond with her. <br /> <br /> If you read this, you probably already know how talented Chan-wook Park is. But 'I am a Cyborg ...' is a great departure from familiar and (unfortunately) stronger territory. I'm a big fan of any movie or story trying to do something different. God knows we are all exposed to enough crap at our local cinemas. The main point about the movie I need to say is that it doesn't say anything about mental illness or creates a sign that you care about. <br /> <br /> This story must be one of the weird things I have seen this year ... but weird is not enough. There's no heart to the movie ... just surrealism and confusion. Confusion seems to be the movie's main theme. The characters all try to make sense of their own problems, but it is Chan-wook Park itself that turns out to be the most confused of them all.
