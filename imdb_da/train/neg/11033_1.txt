The latest Rumor goes around is that Vh1 starts casting calls to I love New York 3 mid 2008. So does that mean Budah or Tailor dumped New York or does it mean that New York dumped the winner? <br /> <br /> I know Flavor of Love is coming up to the 3rd season, so now with a Flavor of Love 3 and one I love New York 3 ..... there will ever be a true winner ??? <br /> <br /> I've also heard a few rumors that Chance will be brought back to 3rd season, I love New York !!!! I have also heard rumors that New York will be specially highlighted on the Flavor of Love 3. Hopefully it wasn't too much of a spoiler for the end of I love New York 2 .... I 'I just say the latest rumor.
