This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only lacks a play, but the script is incredibly low and low. You actually hear serious dialogue going: "I love you more." "No I love you more." I stopped watching the movie (online) after the first half hour, I couldn't take it anymore. Her "southern girl charm" just doesn't work and is really quite annoying; her attempt at slapstick humor falls flat and she delivers lines as if she is reading the script just outside the page. Bad Luke Wilson. Had he not read the manuscript before he went in to do it, or did he promise Papa Joe's (Jessica's father and also the film producer) the promise of great profits? Hopefully he now knows better than logging on to another movie like this. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - I hate to see the painful look on his face as he suffers from the bad dialogue. Also, I think the previous commentator who gave this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably either involved in the movie somehow or employed by Papa Joe to give the movie a better rating. No one in their real mind would actually find this movie engaging. <br /> <br /> Jessica has lots of money, right? Maybe buy some plays?
