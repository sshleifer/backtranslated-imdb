The relationship and report between Grace and Matthew is well-placed, and Brenda Blethyn gets the viewer emotionally involved in her sympathetic character - you can really feel what she is going through. <br /> <br /> The cast of the smaller roles is excellent, although some of them are quite incredibly eccentric.
