This movie has a beautiful brunette named Danielle Petty. She has amazing green eyes and is in the first few scenes and the last scene. She is the only thing about this movie that is not repulsive. She must not have a future as an actress, because this kind of movie is the kind of offensive catastrophe that kills career. <br /> <br /> The movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend it. It's not a good scary movie, or a good fake journalistic report or externally well done. There is no ability in its production. It's like a bad student movie. The horrible elements of history do not make you sick, it is the fact that it is so badly done that makes you sick. I would give this movie ZERO stars if I could.
