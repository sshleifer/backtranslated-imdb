Generally, I do not care much about violence in film or a great philosophy, symbolism or psychology. All of this is very good to me, and the film brings much of the above to us. There are beautiful pictures especially of the lake and nature, a good setting of signs, a good direction. This movie could be a good movie. However, it is spoiled for two reasons, and both of these reasons make this movie simply disgusting. First of all, there is violence against living creatures to make this film. Not movie violence, I'm talking about real violence. This violence alone might be justified if not, and that is the reason for second; The message from the film was not only introspection about the director's distorted relationship with women. Not that we all do not have real terms with women. (Men respectively). But the end of the movie destroys it all. <br /> <br /> * spoiler * Our "heroine" finally dies (here is his own hand, if I remember correctly, I saw this movie many years ago and it scared me, now the guy is out with a new one film witch I'm definitely not seeing) and is now even more clearly depicted as a kind of natural demon, nature growing over her, especially her sex. It is of course the director who "kills" the woman's heroine. Women must die, especially if men are attracted to their sexuality. It seems to be the final conclusion. ** End spoiler * <br /> Oh well, it would be fine with me if the director would have kept his view on himself. But using large images, artistic directions cruelty to living beings, just to say that men can be afraid of women, and men are cruel to women. It's just not enough. I knew when I saw this movie, it would be good critics for "philosophical, eastern and artistic" and anything. But for me, this movie is absolutely horrible.
