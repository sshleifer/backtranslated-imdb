I never saw a comedy that was so much of a task to sit thru ... not a laugh in it. Okay, maybe a little chuckle for Michael Clarke Duncan bit like the big, black, bald gay virgin. But the rest of it was shockingly fun. On top of being empty of something laughing, "skits" go forever! Avoid this if you appreciate your time and money. TERRIBLE!!! The worst!!!
