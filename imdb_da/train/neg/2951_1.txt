Don't watch this movie if you appreciate your mind. At the end of our collective show, I and my friends and I considered that we each lost 5% of our brains during the course. The only person involved in making it was not clinically insane, was the nominee designer. <br /> <br /> Most movies leave a bad taste in the mouth. I now realize that instead of a feeling of disgust, this movie is a deep hatred in me. I hate this movie so much, much. <br /> Some may say that this movie is not meant to be taken seriously. If only it took itself seriously. But it does. The reason is a heated over version of the Blade Runner-esque universe melded with the cheap rubber suits so widespread in bad dinosaur films. The dialogue is not only puerile and meaningless, but often literally painful. Whoopee Goldberg doesn't even try, but George Newbern as Theodore Rex's voice is like nails on the soul. And if Juliet Landua with her again on British accent or Richard Roundtree (aka Shaft) as the blustering commissioner, you will sink into an ever-growing sense of infidelity and disillusionment. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie only to anyone who wants to see the depth of stupidity that humanity can fall.
