This movie, I will not call it a "movie", was about nothing and worked mostly for the popular acts of the time. yes the war was in full swing (pun), and this movie gave the troops and our audience a treat. <br /> <br /> But let's have something with a little more fabric. <br /> <br /> loved watching a young Buddy Rich on the drums. the music was good all the time. <br /> <br /> But a cameo after another gets old fast. I didn't even recognize Zero Mostel! so if you are one of the "greatest generation" as they say, you will definitely enjoy this ... <br /> <br /> movie.
