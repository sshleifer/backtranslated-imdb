This movie was the most clever Mormon movie ever made. It made RM & Sons of Provo look like well-finished movies! It should be fun from what I was told. The best was the best actor in the movie Travis Eberhard - if he wasn't in the movie, it probably wouldn't have been made! He ruled! <br /> <br /> 10. It wasn't fun 9. It was beat 8. It had Thurl Big T Bailey, whose character didn't make sense 7. It was made in Provo 6. It didn't make fun with Brokeback 5. It had Larry H. Miller in the 4th. It was the first movie Clint Howard was not fun in 3. Gary Coleman chose the perfect movie 4 a comeback 2. They should have thrown on Surreal Life auditions 1. It was made by Halestorm Entertainment !!
