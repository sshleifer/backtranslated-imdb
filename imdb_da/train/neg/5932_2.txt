What kind of documentary about a musician fails to include a single trace of the artist himself? Unlike "Ray" or countless other movies about music artists, half the fun in the theater (or on the couch) relives the great songs themselves. Here, all the tracks are covered by uninteresting characters, and these reproductions fail to capture Coh's slow jazzy style. More often, they cover covered poor folk music versions. Yuck. <br /> <br /> The interviews are so much or more with other musicians and characters rather than with Cohen himself. Only rarely does the film draw that Cohen reads his own work (never sings) - like letters, poems, etc. The film has really not taken much of the artist's life story, or his development over the years. A big disappointment for a great Cohen fan.
