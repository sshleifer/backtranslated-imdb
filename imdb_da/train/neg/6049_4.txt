First and foremost, anyone who believes that this successor to William Friedkins "The French Connection" is superior is certainly insane or moronic or both. The problem with reviewing this movie is, a.) It is a sequel to a brilliant movie that always makes it objectively difficult to see and b.) It is directed by John Frankenhimer, one of the best US executives ever, so i would like it. William Friendkin was the perfect person to lead a drug trafficking movie in New York City overdue. However, due to his documentary approach to action and history, Frankenhimer is one of the most stylish directors ever, ie. "The Manchurian Candidate" and "Seconds", and with his "French Connection 2", it feels as if someone is trying to be gritty and not having the true understanding to pull it off. The fact that Frankenhimer was chosen to lead the successor of Gene Hackman himself, really tells a lot about Hackman's understanding of the original film as well. It is well known that Hackman hated Friedkin on the set and promised to never work with him again, it is also known that he imagined that the character should be more dimensional, lose weight and try to play him as an equal character. It shows you Hackman, although he was a great actor, had no idea who was going to make the movie and the story great. The place for Doyle becomes an addict is interesting but does not guarantee the rest of the movie. An unfortunate low point in Frankenhim's filmography.
