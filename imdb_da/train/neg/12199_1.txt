- But and my sister right now see that movie. We have a laugh at deaf people. can you imagine on covers there is nomination for Oscar ?? - first the musician has mixed about 4-5 different styles ... and the music is not synchronized with the scenes, and the character moves ... --- the main character Silvester does not fit in there. he looks like mexican tarzan. <br /> <br /> ---- Russian soldiers are anything but Russian faces :-) ----- ok, the main points: 1. aircraft called charter painted in black ... <br /> <br /> 2. What is an idea when Rambo jumps from the plane, but he is stuck? rope mix 3. and girl? The best scene is when she dies. She means a lot to him. He knows her for years? he cries for her ... o my god samurai 4. how many arrows does he have? his arrow bag is always full of arrows? I haven't noticed a scene where he gathers them - but I've seen the scene where the arrow stays in Vietnam solder - it's very important 5. how many rockets helicopters can hold ??? (right) I've seen 4. But Rambos has hit about 20 of them. <br /> <br /> 6. The body. what do the russian special army helicopters in Vietnam ????????? after the war? 7. First scene when he entered Vietnam's camp ... his first idea was to free the refuge standing on the tree in the open space "wow what an idea than then: 1. with the knife you can cut iron wire ? Maybe just made in Vietnam? 2. Mortar - Need a running man? O My god, your Americans really need to learn about the weapons! Do you know how much it takes to calibrate the mortar (I think the author has looked at many World War II movie)
