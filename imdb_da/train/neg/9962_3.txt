Uta Hagen 'Respect for action' is the standard textbook on many college theater courses. In the book, Hagen presents two fundamentally different approaches to developing a character as an actor: the presentation method and the representation method. In the presentation method, the actor focuses on realizing the character as honestly as possible by introducing emotional elements from the actor's own life. In the representative approach, the actor tries to produce the feeling of a feeling through a high degree of control of movement and sound. The representative approach to action was still partly in fashion when this Hamlet was made. The British theater has a long history of this style, and Olivier could be said to be the ultimate king of the school of representation. <br /> <br /> The time has not been friendly for this play or in this movie. Almost every employee now uses a presentation. For the modern eye, Olivier's heavily enunciated stylized delivery is stodgy, stiff and stalked. Instead of creating an internally conflicting Hamlet, Olivier made a declaiming, self-meaning bullhorn out of the melancholy Dane - a play style that would have carried well to the back of the larger London theaters, but is far too starchy to carry one modern hamlet. <br /> <br /> And then the movie laughs with innocent today. Olivier's tendency to e-nun-ci-ate makes some of Hamlet's lines unintentionally fun: "Instead, get yourself and get a tem-purr ance that can give it ... Smoothness!" Instead of crying to meet his father's ghost (like any real actor could), bright filled lights in Oliviers students give us the impression. <br /> <br /> Eileen Herlie is the only other actor in this Hamlet a good essay at the Queen, despite the painfully obvious age differences (he was 41; she was 26). The other actors in this movie have no chance of getting anything else important, as Olivier's tendency to help keep! camera! on him! at all! times! <br /> <br /> Sixty years later, you feel the uncertainty of Shakespeare's stage actor, who lacked the confidence to portray a devastating, flawless Hamlet, and instead chose to portray a kind of Elizabethan bullhorn. Final analysis: "I would have such a whip to do thermagant, that's Herod Herod: Pray, avoid it."
