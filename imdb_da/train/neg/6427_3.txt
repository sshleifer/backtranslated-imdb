so on the whole I found this documentary to be strange and really meaningless. I know it got prices and things, but I personally did not enjoy it too much. There was no humor or drama in it to keep you interested, just a lot of wierdos and their jobs. some of the people are a little different, which is not a bad thing, it just didn't give a good impression on me. I was deeply saddened by this movie, no offense to my creative writer. the circus theme throughout the movie was pretty cool but i didn't get it, and robotics and lion taming are definitely not my thing. The green animal was something nice, I really liked the garden many colorful flowers, but how did these four jobs connect? It didn't make much sense to me why someone wanted to make a movie about it. But if you're into things like this, you like it. who should i stand in your way I warn only about possible suffering.
