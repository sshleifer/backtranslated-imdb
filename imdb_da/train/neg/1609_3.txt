The first part, Che in Cuba, is about that part of his life. It contains too many undeniable battles and Che serves too many rude wounds (remember Che was a doctor). It ends up as Castro wins the revolution; Che never comes to Havana. The second part, Che in Bolivia, is about guessing what. It contains too many undeniable battles, and Che serves many inevitable wounds. When I realized this was going to be an "epic" (I never knew * anything * but the title before it started) I naturally thought of the greatest epic of them all, David Leans Lawrence of Arabia. More of that later. <br /> <br /> Not to be racist, but apart from what I have already mentioned, the fact that there are too many signs is well-distinguished - unknown Spanish actors who look alike, especially in considering that they all carry "Che" beard and everyone uses Che fatigues. This results in the viewer being unable to identify with anyone other than Che, Benicio del Toro (even Fidel has a much smaller role). While del Toro is amazing, think of "Lawrence" with Peter O'Toole as the only distinguishing character: no Alec Guinness, no Omar Sharif, no Anthony Quinn, etc. You get the idea. <br /> <br /> Because other characters are interchangeable, resulting in a loss of reference. When the top aides of Che are killed, you feel nothing remorse since you do not know who they are. Even when Che is killed (I don't think it's a spoiler), there's no public empathy - he's just killed. <br /> <br /> He is too one-dimensional to relate to as a human. Apart from being a revolutionary and second only to Jesus in moral justice, the only thing we learn about Che is that he is married to five children (he tells another sign that is close to the end). What was his motivation? A complete riddle. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Soderbergh is willing to lean. Like Soderbergh's Che, Lean never lets us know anything about Lawrence, the mystery man in Arabia. But at least Lawrence had a friend (Sharif) and colleagues (Guinness, Quinn). He was so brave when he was uncertain - ie. had human qualities. Che is like a machine, as hot as Terminator. <br /> <br /> Earlier this year there was another war epic, Mongolian. Che makes mongol look like it's a wonderful life.
