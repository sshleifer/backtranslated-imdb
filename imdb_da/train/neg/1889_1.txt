This movie is by no means entertainment, but more of a look deep into the depth of the darkest side of human behavior. Loose half a dozen stories of the worst form of corruption, perverted sex, greed, violence, and intolerance. All actions are played beyond some very hot and sticky days during a heat wave in Vienna, and the heat may be responsible for some of the anger and hate in the movie. For me, the treatment of the delayed girl by the security equipment dealer was about the worst episode, closely followed by the scene of drunkenness and perversion in the "slag" plane. You get caught and I hope the horror of this movie. I hated it, but I felt compelled to see it through. 1/10 for 'fun' 8/10 to show 'man' as he is sometimes.
