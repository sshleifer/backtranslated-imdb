The school's geek Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and is then in a lab explosion (there are also them) where his face is cleansed of acid. Years later, all jerks are invited back to high school (then closed) for a reunion. What they didn't know is that Marty invites them back to kill them. Then a storm starts, they are locked in school, and Marty begins to revenge. <br /> <br /> Pretty stupid. The murders are ingenious and gory, and there are some eerie atmospheric shots of the desolate school - but it's about it. The humiliations inflicted on Scuddamore are more than cruel (he is stripped, dunked in a toilet and burned) and is just uncomfortable to see. Given that Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after this was released, they make almost impossible to see. Also this movie goes out of its way to have nudity. There is full front of Scuddamore (surprising for any movie), but a girl decides to take a bath alone ... After they know, a killer is fighting for them! And then there is the couple who must have sex. This is the type of movie where the killer seems to know where everyone is going to be and can teleport to them. It ends with a twist that had moaned me and rolled my eyes so another twist who wanted me to throw something heavy on the TV! The action is tolerable - not good but tolerable. Caroline Munro is also in this. She is a very beautiful woman, but not much of an actress. <br /> <br /> This gets a 3 to some really gory murder and atmosphere. Otherwise it is run by the mill and forgettable. Scuddamore's tragic suicide has given this movie more attention than it deserves.
