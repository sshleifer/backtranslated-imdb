Manmohan Desai made some entertaining though illogical films like AAA, PARVARISH and NASEEB, but he made some craps as COOLIE and MARD and then GJS <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst movies ever made by him the disc became famous Mard ko dard nahin threatened, but the film is so bad you scratch <br /> <br /> The British are made caricatures and the film looks so strange. The scene in the British hotel is astonishingly stupid <br /> <br /> movies have many stupidity as Amrita attacked Amitabh and so the whole scene plus towards the climax becomes even worse. There are several gems that the horse statue gets the life, the masks of Amitabh haha ​​and more. <br /> <br /> Direction of Manmohan Desai is bad Music is okay Amitabh does his part in style, nothing but COOLIE, LAAWARIS type roles Amrita Singh is okay Satyen Kapuu is okay Prem Chopra is as usual, Nirupa Roy is again her usual self Dara Singh is also as usual
