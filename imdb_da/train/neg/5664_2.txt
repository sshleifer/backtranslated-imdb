I liked Boyle's performance, but it's about the only positive I can say. Everything was exaggerated to the point of absurdity. Most of the actors spoke as if you were expecting your 9-year-old nephew to speak if he seemed to be a dull, stony policeman or a vicious villain. The raspy voice-overs seemed amateur to me. I could go and buy a cheap synthesizer and screw out better opening music. And what about the whole 1984 police torture thing? It was completely redundant and had nothing to do with the actual events of history. Cox added many things, in fact, he apparently thought would be really cool, but had nothing to do with the story. It's a big disappointment because one of the things that make Borges' stories so good is his minimalism - they are tightly bound, with no superfluous details. This film is just the opposite. I stopped looking for the scene where Lonnrot questioned the guy from Yidische Zaitung, or so. I wasted $ 4 to rent this, but at least I can get some satisfaction by writing this review and hopefully save others from making the same mistake.
