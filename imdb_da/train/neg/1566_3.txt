For the savvy Beatles fan, the main value of this movie is simply to sit back and select the errors, inaccuracies, combined events, omitted events, wildly exaggerated events, omitted persons, timeline errors, mis-attributes, incorrect clothes, out of place songs, and (shame) shame) wrong instruments and other boners I just can't think of right now. The shortcomings come fast and furious, so you have to be on your toes. I did not give this a "1", mainly because it is recorded in Liverpool and the actors (the band rain) give it all to them (Lennon character is credible and does a good job). Also the song "Cry for a Shadow" is heard at some point and it counts for something. <br /> <br /> So, watch it for fun, but don't take it as historically accurate.
