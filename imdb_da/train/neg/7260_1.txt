"A Town Called Hell" (also called "A Town Called Bastard"), a British / Spanish co-production, was made on the heels of Clint Eastwood's success in the Italian "Man With No Name" trilogy. The template used in most of these films was to employ recognizable American actors whose career was largely declining and doubling their voices. This film is no exception except that they also used some British actors. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to summarize the plot, but here it goes. The story opens with rebels or anything, led by Robert Shaw and Marin Landau, raiding a church and killing everyone inside, including the priest. Fast forward to the subject city a few years later, where the Shaw character is masquerading as a priest. The city's mayor (Telly Savalas) is a brutal leader who doesn't seem to measure out with his gun. <br /> <br /> Throw in the mix a grieving widow Alvira (Stella Stevens), searching for her husband's killer. To this is added the fact that she walks around in an armchair lying dead as in a coffin, for God knows why. After the mayor has been murdered by his hands La Bomba (Al Lettieri), the city is invaded by a federal colonel (Landau) in search of a rebel leader (sorry but the name escapes me). The Colonel takes over the city and begins to implement the urban population to force them to reveal the leader's identity. <br /> <br /> Although they open the film side by side, it is hard to tell from the dialogue that Landau and Shaw characters know about each other. A blind man (Fernando Rey) claims he can identify the rebel leader by touching his face. He does it and .............................................. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the protagonists are sorry to make this movie. It's just awful and deserving of my dreaded "1" rating. Shaw spends most of the film fixing his trademark, staring at who is practical. Even Landau can't save this movie. The beautiful wife Stevens is also wasted here too. Having just made Peckinpah's "The Ballad of Cable Hogue" the previous year, I found it odd that she would look at this mess of a movie. Savalas made several of these pictures ("Pancho Villa" and "Horror Express" come to mind) in his pre-Kojak period. Michael Craig is also somewhere as a sign called "Paco". <br /> <br /> Fernando Rey appeared in many of these "westerns", though he would come out to play the villain in the two "French Connection" films. Al Lettieri would also come up with a role in "The Godfather" (1972) and continue with other memorable roles before his incredible death in 1975. <br /> <br /> In all fairness, the version I was looking at was only 88 minutes rather than the longer maturities of 95 or 97 minutes set on IMDb, but I can't see where an extra 7 or 8 minutes would make much difference. <br /> <br /> Avoid this.
