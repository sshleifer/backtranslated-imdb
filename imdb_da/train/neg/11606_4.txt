Decent enough with some stylish pictures, but the little budget hampers things. <br /> <br /> I also get the impression they were trying to shock you with some of the graphic web stuffs by Weirdo Perv. <br /> <br /> If you like anime in special things like cyber city and AD police then this might be up your street. <br /> <br /> But basically its low budget matrix cash, though not entirely without its own style. <br /> <br /> Fantastic soundtracks of some unheard of grunge / punk / post grunge bands. Worth checking if only for the soundtrack.
