I love Dracula, but this movie was a complete disappointment! I remember Lee from other Dracula movies from when I was younger, and I thought he was great, but this movie was really bad. I don't know if it was my youth who fooled me into believing that Lee was the ultimate Dracula, with style, appearance, attraction and evil beneath it. Or maybe it was just this movie that disappointed me. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine Dracula with a snobbish English accent and body language to follow? Do you like when a plot contains unrealistic characters and is boring and lacks any kind of excitement ..? Then this is a movie for you! <br /> <br /> Otherwise - don't see it! I've only given it a 2 because I managed to keep myself awake throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry but if you liked this movie then you must have been sleep deprived and at home alone in a dark room with lots of unpacked space behind you. Maybe alone in your parents' home or in a foreign home. Because not even the characters in this flick seemed to be scared, and I think it sums it all up! <br /> <br /> Or maybe you like this movie because of the place in the Dracula movie story, perhaps being fascinated by how Dracula's history has evolved from Nosferatu to what it is today. Because as a movie it is not so appealing, it does not pull you into the suggestive mystery which makes the Vampire myth so fascinating. <br /> <br /> And so much of the sticky 70ies feel about it. The landscape looks like cheap theater. And I'm not saying rejecting everything made in the 70s. Because I can love old movies as well as new ones.
