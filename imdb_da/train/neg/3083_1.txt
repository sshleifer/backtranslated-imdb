... Bad to be intentionally bad ... <br /> <br /> This little gem shot right into the MST3k big screen. Though obvious, the film doesn't try to be taken seriously (hopefully their goal, anyway ...), the movie is still pretty bad. Hell, it makes Leprechaun In Space look great budgeted ... In short: Paint my muscle car pruned colored!
