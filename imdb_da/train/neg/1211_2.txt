The only redeeming qualities that this film has are the rather original death scenes. Other than that, this movie is a great DUD. We have Kim Basinger, the besieged housewife slowly meandering through the local mall for the first 30 minutes. of the movie which did not add anything. Then the movie picks up a bit as she has a confrontation with 4 punks that picked up 2 parking spaces on this busy Christmas Eve. They start chasing her after offing the local security guard who tried to help her. From there, this movie gets worse, worse. I only know a movie and you have to go with the flow, but she has approx. 5 min. headstart and she can't hide or find someone to help her. Instead, she drives to a half-built subdivision next to a forest. Typically, she does everything she can to give her successors easy access to her. But now she becomes a hard mofu. You get points. Under no circumstances should you buy or rent this movie, no matter how much you like this type. It's so illogical that you want to question each scene. It's embarrassing for Basinger and Craig Sheffer and the rest of the player, as well as consumers.
