The beginning of this movie was good. It started to be really stupid after he told the people he wanted to kill himself. I think if I came from a small town as such, I would be offended after watching this movie. They made many of these people look stupid and crazy. How could these people have so little to do that they follow him around all day. Many times, these people told him ways to kill themselves as they urged him to do so. How can so many people have little respect for other people? I also think they could have made a much better end to this movie. There were also some good parts for this movie. Some people like it, but I would not recommend it to anyone.
