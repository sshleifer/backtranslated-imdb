Bela Lugosi is not typecast in this amazing twelfth-century adventure series, as leader like Frank Chandler / Chandu The Magician, who enjoys his role as representative of the White Magic forces, pushed toward Blacks while showing a strong martial art, successfully awaiting a young Egyptian princess and cut a lean and bubbly figure in angling, complete with nautical cap. The somewhat lumpy plot engages Chandler / Chandu in an ongoing series of escapades pointing to the salvation of his fiancee, Princess Nadji (Maria Alba) and others from the link of the idol-worshiping sect of Ubasti who crave Nadii's blood to revive an old mummified princess entombed on the mysterious island of Lemuria. Director Ray Taylor, an old hand on such entertainment, keeps the events moving fast, but repeated scenes and footage, some of which can be found in the previous year's Skull Island setting from KING KONG and the port site of SON OF KONG, reduces the original Action for less than 60 minutes from the serial run length of over two and a half hours, and if seen at a meeting, it actually lacks for most viewers unless it is failing.
