(Some possible spoilers) <br /> <br /> I'm not quite sure what Dreamworks was thinking when they decided to plunk $ 80 million down on this extremely tired and lame animated flick. They probably thought that the spectacular animation would be more than enough to bring the audience (mostly families) into cuddling. Now it seemed to work for the opening weekend, it made $ 26 miles, pretty much and made $ 38.1 miles. overall (an estimate for this weekend). But I think the audience that came on the weekend looked pretty much the same thing I did when I saw and they spread the word. This is a majorly lame movie, except for the animation everything else, most of the script seems to be done by a three year old. The movie is only about 80 minutes. long, but it feels like a three hour epic. A couple of points for me are, well the annoying story is one of them, and it's so clearly written. At some point, he escapes from some prisoners, and even though you can see the horse clearly scared, the narrator (the talented Matt Damon's voice) pops up to remove any misunderstandings (which would only happen in the simplest way of thinking. <Br /> < br /> Another is the constant pop up of Bryan Adam's songs, now I am a fan of his music, I think he is good but come on, Dreamworks really thinks the audience could handle 8-9 of his songs through such a card movie I could definitely not. Finally and here is a spoiler, a horse is shot on a blank area by a member of the calf, no less, she (the horse) then falls into a raging river, Spirit (the film's focus) trying to save her but they both go over a waterfall that must have at least a 50 foot drop, well later in the film near the end we see that this horse is alive and well, I know this is a kids movie but even The small amount of realism is unacceptable, to summarize this is a real lame mo devote, I am not saying that the children do not enjoy it, but someone else will check their watches, just waiting for this triptime to end. Definitely on my top 10 worst list of this year. - ** out of 4 stars. <br /> <br />
