I've seen Dolemite and also (Avenging) Disco Godfather, two other fine works from the blaxploitation canon from our friend Rudy Ray Moore. But this film, The Human Tornado (aka Dolemite 2) will always hold a special place in my heart. For pure joy, lack of skills in film production and absolute enthusiasm (frankly a little too much), Human Tornado cannot be topped. <br /> <br /> The opening scene sets the tone. Our old pal Dolemite throws up with a white woman when some racist local police raided the house for no good reason and you wouldn't know! The woman in bed with ol 'Dole is none other than the sheriff's wife. Her cry when she sees him: "He made me do it!" Dolomiten's cry: "& $ * @ $ are you for real ???" Subtle was never his strong point. <br /> <br /> Highlights? The cameo of a very young Ernie Hudson (of Ghostbuster's fame), the continuity errors (somehow a shot and another in the next, Dolemite's costume changing colors in each shot of his night club act) and Queen Bee's demonic eyes in her first scene. <br /> <br /> But the real joy here is Rudy Ray Moore herself. Does the man really think he was watching this movie? I certainly do not know why, but you must admire the sheer enthusiasm he has. Whether it jumps completely naked out of a rock or barking orders to its gang in the rhyme (eg: Fast! In the cave! I have a plan to leave the mother $ * @ (% & dig his own grave!) The man surely commits He goes overboard, never more than ever he drives kung fu. The climactic battle is filmed at high speed, but occassionaly slows down to let Rudy silence and grin his teeth. the movie as an effect, or if they really wanted us to think he was so fast. In any case, "The Matrix" is not. <br /> <br /> Human Tornado, like the original Dolemite, is an incompetent movie of enormous proportions, but at least it is fun, and certainly you have to give credits to these people for the effort, just not so much, enjoy with my cordial recommendations.
