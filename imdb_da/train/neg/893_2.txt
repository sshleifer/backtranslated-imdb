When I bought this DVD, I said, "It looks like a lovely comedy about love and relationships built up in Portuguese standards, let's give it a try?" I was completely wrong! What a disappointing movie! First, it is not a comedy; It's a cheap drama that can be so melodramatic that it's even worse than many Portuguese soap operas! Secondly, the plot is so boring and leads nowhere ?? It has no structure, it just flows like the wind in one direction or another ?? Production is also poor! The sound mix is ​​terrible because the voices are sometimes interrupted. It reminded me of some old Portuguese films from the 80s? The action should have been better too ?? Well, to sum up, it's not with movies like this that Portuguese cinema will improve! In fact, it was one of the worst Portuguese movies I've seen in recent years! Bad argument, bad acting, poor production ?? I didn't have great hopes for this movie, but it was much worse than I ever imagined! Just forget it!
