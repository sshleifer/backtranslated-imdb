The corridors of the times. The movie you can see if you are looking for a sophisticated way of suicide. Some use cannons, ropes or gas, but you want to destroy your brains? Don't wait any longer! Time corridors are probably one of the biggest possible mistakes: thinking Christian Clavier is able to act and bring you fun. I do not miss the 45 francs, this bad thing cost me: sometimes you have to reset its evaluation system and look at the absolute zero. This movie deserves a 2/10, but that's just because I like Jean Reno. Too bad for him, he also stars in Ronin. I think I don't like him ...
