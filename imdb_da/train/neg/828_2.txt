Let's see. In the "St. Elsewhere" final, we found out that there was no hospital and that everything had been in the mind of an autistic child. "Newhart" ended up telling us that it was all a dream. And "Roseanne" ended up telling us that it had all taken place in her mind. Very "creative". Annoying was more like that. Yes, it was just a TV show and was not the reality at all. It's just that when you get caught in a big movie or TV show, you at least end up believing that it's all right. At least as far as reality portrays it on the screen. This type of serial finale had been done twice before and was old hat, frustrating and simply not fun to watch. Now, "Newhart" is a dream? At least done in a creative way that far exceeded the expectations of everyone who loved the show. The idea in itself was not too engaging, but it was so brilliantly made that it was probably the best serial ever. Roseanne left me feeling cheated after being such a loyal fan.
