This movie showed more racist hatred for Jews by David Mamet than I have ever experienced in an American movie. The straw types are so over the top that my ability to continue to look dead. I was so disappointed with Joe <br /> <br /> Mantegna called a bunch of men sitting in a Jewish center in New York, cleaning weapons, heroes who had common sense, and I stopped. I deeply <br /> <br /> disturbed the notion that Jews are not Americans and "different". I suggest Mr. Mamet is one of the reasons for hatred, not a healer of the same.
