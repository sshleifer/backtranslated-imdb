I didn't like this Bill Murray vehicle when it was originally released in the 80s so I tried to see it again to see if my taste for this movie was down to my cinematic tastes in the 80s or was it "Stripes" is simply a bad movie. Now the verdict is in, and "Stripes" is a bad movie. "Stripes" may have been innovative comedy in the early 80's and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are Bill Murray fans, but it's still a bad movie. <br /> <br /> Why is it bad? Mostly because "Stripes" should be a comedy, but it's just not that fun. There are some laughs, but they are few and far between. Most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly horrified and not very interesting. This lack of comedy is especially noticeable if you are used to more modern comedies such as "Anchorman", which strives to laugh at every part of the movie. <br /> <br /> "Stripes" further suffer from Bill Murray's and Harold Rami's inability to act. Bill Murray is a great comedian, but he was not a very convincing dramatic actor at this time in his career, and Harold Ramis plays Harold Ramis. These two are just not as good as actors to carry the film's dramatic bow. Finally, most of the comedy found in "Stripes" revolves around Bill Murray's self-centered, smart-alec human character, so if you don't find the fun fun (as I didn't), you won't find most of the little comedy, there are also in "Stripes". <br /> <br /> "Stripes" is very much a movie in its era, it does not age well and is not worth seeing. If you want to see an early 80's "buddy" comedy, I would recommend "Stir Crazy." As "Stripes", humor in "Stir Crazy" is not as fast as in contemporary comedies, but unlike "Stripes", that age has much better and as a result still can be seen.
