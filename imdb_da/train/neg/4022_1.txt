This movie was horrible. I saw it three times, and not even the whole grip. It's just impossible to see, the line of history sucks, it's depressing and completely disgusting. I'm not writing spoilers for anything, so if you want to know why it's so disgusting, see for yourself. The only good thing about this movie was John Savage, his early dialogue and some funny parts in the movie. The baby in this movie is annoying and the whole situation is stifling. I watched this movie at movie stores around America, so I assumed it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ, I was wrong !!!! The play is all terrible and the nakedness is obvious and unpleasant. Another thing is, Starr Andreef, the other protagonist, has not been in such bad movies in the past, in fact she was in some very good ones. Same with John Savage. This movie SUCKS!
