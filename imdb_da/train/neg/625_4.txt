With all the violent violence in this movie, it could have been NC-17. But gore could have been pg-13, and there were a lot of swords, as the mother had the original jackass bath hairy boys. There was a lot of character development that made the movie better to watch, and when the child returned to life as a scarecrow, there was a thoughtless hour and ten minutes of killing people. Violence was excessively excessive, and I think the body number was higher than twelve, which is a large number for movies like this. Almost all the characters in the film are stuck or have their head chopped off, but the teacher who called him "white waste" and "hoodlum" (although the lester sign is anything but a hoodlum, not even close, I know hoods and is part hood, they do not pull in the class, they sit there and throw things at the teacher). The teacher deserved a more cruel death than any of the characters, but was just stabbed in the back. There were two exciting scenes in the movie, but didn't last long enough to be scary at all. As I said, the killings were exaggerated, and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the story have their heads cut off. If gore was actually fun to watch then it would have been nc-17. Two children describe a body they find in the cornfields, they describe it as a lot of gurus than it really was, they explained to the chief of police that there were stomach cribs that crawled around in the intestine. His stomach was not even cut open, so there was no way the stomachs were in the stomach, even though I would have seen it. The action was pathetic, characters were losers, and scarecrows could do a lot of gymnastic stunts. I suggest renting this movie to death scenes, I won't see it again anytime soon, but I enjoyed the exaggerated violence. Also, do not bother with the successor, I looked for five minutes and bored to death, it sounds good, but it is not. In fact, the original scarecrow kept me interested.
