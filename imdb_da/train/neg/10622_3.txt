I actually have a love for Christopher Lee, but it was just not his other performances ... and he was one of the best actors. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't live up to its premise. It's not that scary, it's too melodramatic, and it's about. Every time I thought, "Oh, here's the good part," the good part has never arrived. The evil ones are not convincing at all. Most of the other characters also lacked depth. <br /> <br /> Perhaps if I had been in the right mindset, I might have had some MSTie fication at this movie expense, but .... Naaahhh ... Didn't really seem to be worth the effort. It wasn't very good, it wasn't really bad, it was just mediocre.
