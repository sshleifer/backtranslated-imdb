I think Croc Hunter is a beautiful cool guy! I know I wouldn't have the nerve to walk even 5 feet away from a hook. <br /> <br /> But everything in this movie is bad. Capturing jokes, people being eaten and rubbing the president makes every movie one of the worst of all times. It's a really bad movie that you have to keep away from. All the "jokes" are so young that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid. The reason is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that Croc Hunter doesn't ask the crocodile to eat him after he saw this.
