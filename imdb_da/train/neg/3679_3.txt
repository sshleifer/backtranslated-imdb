This is a Japanese movie, but there are also some English here. It is a beautiful movie with great pictures featuring Hawaii's beautiful beauty. <br /> <br /> But that was the only redeeming quality for me. The story was generally boring. Who wants to see a young woman like 90 percent of the movie because her "picture" man is much older than he announced he was? Permitted, it could be a bummer ...... but go over it! <br /> <br /> Only in the last 10 minutes does she make a face and be happy with him. Then it was too late for most viewers. We had fallen asleep then.
