I must admit that I am very disappointed. <br /> <br /> This version can in no way compete with the 1995 version. The reason I saw it was that I wasn't quite happy with Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth and thought that Rupert Penry-Jones looked much more like the captain I had imagined when I read the book. And he was too. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's the only redeeming quality of the movie. The rest is as un-Austen-like as possible. <br /> <br /> Miss Elliot would NEVER have driven through the streets of Bath like this. It was not in her character and it was just not made by a lady of those times. Anne Elliot of the book was a lady and she had dignity. There is other painful anachronism, but it was the worst. Although there are 3 important quotes from the book, they are completely inappropriate moments and warnings to those who know the book that another important part of the book will either be missing or completely changed. <br /> <br /> And although this version is not much shorter than the other, it feels like everything is rushed. Very little care was taken to introduce the characters, display their dispositions and motives. Important scenes were omitted. How could they possibly have slaughtered the last scenes this way? A disaster! And it was by far not as beautifully photographed as the other. <br /> <br /> No, no, no. If you love Austen, don't waste your time with this.
