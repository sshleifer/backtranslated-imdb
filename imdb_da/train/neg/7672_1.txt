Of course, many talented behind scenes crewmembers worked on this movie, so don't even look at the credits at the end, you will only hold it against them. No one seemed interested in watching this movie, only 3 were in the theater; two went out after 10 minutes and they were lucky. "Monsters" was the unemployed worm from Star Trek 2, The Wrath of Khan, and rejected designs for the aliens in the alien. The creators of the filmmakers, of course, did not want to overshadow the three-dimensional film monsters, so they hired actors who apparently did not remember their lines, or in some cases learn to pronounce the words before the movie began. Some scenes are incredibly inappropriate in communicating what needs to happen if there is anything. If you are unlucky enough to be in a theater where this movie shows and you are not passing by, you will laugh at what should be scary or exciting moments in the movie. The inconvenience of several scenes will only disturb you, and Stephen Dorff's regular spear of "Queen Mary of Curse words" gives the feeling of anyone who pays to see this. If you have to watch this movie, do yourself a favor and wait until it is purchased in the video store. If there is any justice in the film industry, one of the main players will be there to hire it for you.
