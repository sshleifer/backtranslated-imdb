I remember when THE GOLDEN CHILD was released in 1986, it was universally panned by the critics, and I talked so much that it more or less ended Eddie Murphy's glittering career, so I suppose this movie has something to do for it. /> <br /> It's going to be a bad start, where Buddhist monks kneel in front of a child with a shiny expression on his face. Bad guys enter the temple <br /> <br /> Children sit with blank expressions <br /> <br /> Bad guys chop the monks <br /> <br /> Children sit with blank expressions <br /> <br /> Bad guys pull out giant bird cage and keep the baby inside, now sitting with ... Are you guessing? You get the impression that even though they took him to sleep in Michael Jackson's wonderland ranch, he still gives the same shiny expression. This movie would be better known as THE WOODEN CHILD <br /> <br /> The title sequence starts and is a movie from the 1980s a pop soundtrack features heavily. It may have been cool and funky at the time, but now in 2004 it seems very dated. Not only that, but it jars completely with the somewhat bloody opening. In fact, it's the main problem (And it's a serious boy) with this movie. The whole mood seems to change from stage to stage so much that it sometimes likes to watch scenes from completely different movies spliced ​​together. I blame the director personally, but it should also be pointed out that both the writer and the producer should have the same blame. Did anyone know before recording started what type of movie this should be? It's part fantasy, part martial arts, share buddy movies, part comedy and that's all shit
