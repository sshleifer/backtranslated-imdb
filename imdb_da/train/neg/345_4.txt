This can't be Mandy Schaffer's last movie. Someone, do something! : - (<br /> <br /> Argh. <br /> <br /> The little life this could have had, the management ended. Don't blame, they did it OK. and he didn't even come into the movie halfway through. And please put Mandy in some more movies! She's too beautiful to bury her career at such a young age. Hi .... <br /> <br / > Two specific criticisms, if anyone cares (apparently no one liked this movie much). First, Traci held up the right melodramatic moment to see what she was supposed to see, and it was never seen in return, was very annoying. Hollywood: Don't stop giving bad guys the perfect timing luck that runs out exactly when the climax comes in. It's stupid. Write better scripts so you don't have to use the lame plot device anymore. To stand up without it, it doesn't produce. <br /> <br /> Second, Carmen wouldn't fall for it fake damages that Traci drew. She already had the Traci finger. More bad to write / manage there. <br /> <br /> I could ruin this movie any longer, but mercy forbids it. In fact, I didn't hate it as much as the others seem to have. It just didn't have a big reason to be made unless it was just a vehicle to show the lovely Mandy. Oh, and to the one who didn't think she was sexy ... the sign wasn't so well written, but how can you say she wasn't sexy?!? One or the other of us needs glasses, and I don't think it's me. <br/> <br /> MORE MANDY. (Not to be confused with "Moore, Mandy" - although I also want to see her again. ;-) <br /> <br /> P.S. Did I mention I hope that Mandy gets me more movies? <: - D
