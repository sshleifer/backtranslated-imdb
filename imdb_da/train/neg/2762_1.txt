... no one else sees the movie. My husband and I went to see it last night. It's just a small theater, but there is usually a decent amount of people there. Not this time! My husband and I were the only ones to watch Dragon Wars last night! Now we know why. <br /> <br /> The movie was by far the worst I have ever seen. Yes, CG was good, but it was. The action, script & dialogue, directing, editing, etc. were terrifying! When we were alone in the room we felt free to talk during the movie. That's how we talked about how bad it was that reminded us of The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Godzilla, Mortal Combat, and Lord of the Rings. It was as if we were expecting to see Rita and Lord Zed portray commands from the Sauron army. <br /> <br /> The creatures were ridiculous. You can not just introduce legions of dino / dragon / lizard things loaded down with guns without explanation. The Lord of the Rings has a wide spectrum of characters, but it introduces and develops them over 3 movies, not an hour and a half. <br /> <br /> The scene transitions are terrible. I did not fall asleep under the film, but even though it was too simple a plot, I found myself getting lost in the plot holes. The characters were Caucasian Americans, but spoke almost with broken English because of the poorly written dialogue in the script. <br /> <br /> The final scene that could have redeemed the value of the movie ... failed. Ethan did not cry when Sarah died ... even though he had not known her much during this life anyway. He did not seem so sad to be left in "Mordor" without knowing where he was or how to get back. We couldn't find out where he was or where he came from for God's love, but if he wasn't sad, we shouldn't be either. <br /> <br /> Why, and why did Sarah's spirit look like she was borrowing it from Queen Elizabeth? One more thing ... all 3 of the main characters were reincarnations brought back to finish the job. Sarah completes her task and goes on to the afterlife. Jack does it too. So why is Ethan screwed? He is alone, without the girl, without a card / compass / helicopter to help him get back. What should he do? Send smoke signals? And if he comes home again, does he just go back to his job? He should have been given the same mercy to be knocked out of the movie that the other heroes had. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money on this movie. We only stayed to the end because we had paid for it but as soon as the credits hit we were out of the door.
