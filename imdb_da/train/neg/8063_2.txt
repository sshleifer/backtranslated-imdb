I expected the different Sci-fi and thriller type movies this summer, but were so disappointed with this movie. While some people went out of the movie, I decided to stay, just laughing with the other movie gamers on the play, lack of excitement, ridiculous ending and difficult to follow the story. I was as confused as the main character in the movie. The only redeeming quality of the movie was the soundtrack. This is one of the emerging star films that they later regret doing. In retrospect, I wouldn't even rent this, let alone pay more than $ 5 to see.
