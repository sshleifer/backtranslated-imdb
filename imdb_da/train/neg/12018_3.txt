- A little time hood tricks the local mob boss out of a lot of money. Of course, the bully wants his money back and doesn't care who to kill to get it. The punk listens to his friend and an old mobster to help him save his life. <br /> <br /> - If that sounds ridiculous, it is. The whole idea that this Izod wear, dune buggy driving punk could hold one of the most powerful mobs in Rome is simply stupid. His friend can be good with a gun, but he is up against a group trained killed. The old mobster is a little more than comic relief and no real help when it comes to the face with the mob. There is also a sub-point about how the friend's father was killed many years ago by the bully but there is a little bit of it, and that doesn't help the film at all. <br /> <br /> - The mob boss, Mister Scarface, is played by Jack Palance. I suppose he got the name because he has what looks like a shaving nickel on his cheek. Palance is as ineffective as the rest of the throw, doing what he needs to get a paycheck. <br /> <br /> - I've seen some very good Italian crimes / cop-flicks recently, but Mister Scarface is not one of them. Check out Syndicate Sadists or Revolvers instead.
