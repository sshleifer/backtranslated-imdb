I like keeping my reviews short and simple, but it sums it up pretty much. You can't beat the original two for a number of reasons, one of which includes the leading talent of Chris Columbous. <br /> <br /> This movie had terrible control covered by even more horrible plays. I can't even believe these people are considered actors. <br /> <br /> Painful to sit through and see. The story was a complete joke about a secret chip and Russian terrorists on a careful mission to get it back. Terrible, rent one of the original features and enjoy yourself! <br /> <br /> The movie was not even set for Christmas as the original. Home Alone was transformed from an excellent Christmas family comedy movie into a joke without morals or plot!
