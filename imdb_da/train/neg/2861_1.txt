I can't believe I wasted my money to rent this movie. I thought it was a porn flick when it started and it never got better. The actor, the music drowns out the actors. Terrible. Save your money! You must read the film all the way through b they knew the music would drown the talking lines. I have never learned about the slaughterhouse or the need to continue showing cows and pigs being slaughtered. What does it have to do with the "real" BTK killer? I understand why there were no famous actors / actresses in this movie. The scripture would have knocked me off within the first page of reading. You would be better to see paint dry.
