In his short 40 years on Earth, author Jack London managed to grab as much adventure and event as it might seem possible. This 90-minute film, allegedly a biography of human life but patented fictionalized, does not even cut the surface and is still a story that is very mature for a modern story. Here, Michael depicts O'Shea in one of his first roles London, and his performance is both robust and sympathetic. He's not the problem here. Nor is there a young and very handsome Susan Hayward who plays her future wife, Charmian, whose biography on London is the "foundation" of this movie. London's life has here been divided into a series of episodes, which the film jumps through easily. So we have short events with London as an oyster pirate, a sealer in the Bering Sea, a gold prospector in Yukon and a correspondent during the Russian-Japanese war ... colorful events, but it is hardly given anything as an in-depth treatment. And Alfred Santell's direction (he also ruled one of Susan's first film, "Our Leading Citizen" in 1939) at best in short. Doing things harder here is a very poor quality DVD, with a cranky print source and hissy sound. Perhaps the best thing about this movie rental, for me, was to be one of the extra features of the DVD: a catalog of all the Alpha Video movies containing hundreds and hundreds of full-color movie posters. Let's just hope these movies are in better shape than "Jack London"!
