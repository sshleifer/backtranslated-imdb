what a prehistoric story, murder extortion, child sex allegations, gays and the catholic church ..... absolute tripe. How is it that most British TV dramas, sit coms, etc. Include the obligatory Gay, it gets really tiring now. Everyone accepts that there are gay people in the community, just having other minority groups, but we do not want the ramming down in our throats (I will pass this on) in each show. Apart from the above, drama went from what could have been an interesting little story to a pantomime, the pastor was a pedophile, and there are gay men running around everywhere, oh yes just to be completely PC, one of homosexuals the couple were black. I'm surprised by C ecclestone to consider this when reading the script.
