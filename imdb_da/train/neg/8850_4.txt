Now this movie will not scare anyone, but it was interesting for two reasons - two major reasons and one minor - well, these are three reasons, it is not. The first reason for this It is interesting that the special effects are. I found them to be quite interesting and something spectacular. To see the hair grow on Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning were unsafe, especially when they participated in a ménage à trois. Of interest is the fact that this Marsha Hunt is the famous "Brown Sugar" of the Rolling Stones song and that she was in the infamous naked scene in London's cast of rock music Hair. <br /> <br /> In addition to the special effects, there were two other points in this movie and they were repeatedly repeated during final credits. I lost count, but I swear that Sybil Danning brought these points for us in closing credits at least a dozen times and maybe many more. They were the most outstanding feature of the movie.
