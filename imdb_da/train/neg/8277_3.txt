This can be incredible, but this movie has a total of $ 878,138 in Russia! It is shown in almost all cinemas and still runs! Well, I have no idea why distributors were watching this particular uh "movie" that hardly had any screening around the world. It's a kind of enigma! Haha! Perhaps it was based on the fact that another movie, "Pledge This" with Paris Hilton, which was just as well just released DVD almost everywhere, had large screenings in Russia and amounted to more than 1mln. In addition, both films had a great promotion, as if there were banners all over the city, TV commercials and the like. I'm talking about movies, I want to say it's boring and boring. It could be better, really. Although it has Jessica Simpson.
