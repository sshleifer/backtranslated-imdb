was kind of enjoying this movie until the editions of Ed Norton's facial hair. Without revealing any plot details - in one afternoon he played a light beard, but the same evening the beard was gone and a very lush mustache was in place. It was much fuller than the overshadowed that went with the beard. Later on, during a dark night in the open, the goose was gone and he seemed to clean the garden. This was on an occasion where stopping to shave would not be an option. These differences of continuity disturbed me completely from the rest of the film and destroyed any credibility that it had previously had. I also found the long scene of cowboy alone in his bedroom also to remind you of De Niro in the taxi driver. Although it was supposed to be a tribute, it was too thick for this viewer.
