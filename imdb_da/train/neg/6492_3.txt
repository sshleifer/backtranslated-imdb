I wasn't quite sure what to expect from a comedy, drama, fantasy, sci-fi genre, but considering the actors involved I was thinking of giving it a spin. The tone of the film felt awkward and went through patches of each genre, but never felt completely balanced. So eventually I stopped trying and concentrating on movies and individual performances that I thought were good at all considering each character had little depth due to the nature of history (will not give anything away here). I have to say it felt much longer than its 96 minute driving time and not in a good way. Eventually, I sought closure, some degree of satisfaction, but it turned out not to be the clever or brilliant piece I had hoped it would be. I think Tony mistakenly thought what he was doing at the end of the movie gave us that ... but it was a tragic mistake to try to validate the last 95 minutes with the unimaginable conclusion. In the end, I feel cheated. The IMO would have been better to leave it without the "end" as a work of art ... just. Or ... I may have missed the point altogether :)
