this movie is really bad ....... no i really mean really bad. Tony Scott is a terrible instructor. Out of all the movies he has made I only as the enemy of the state, besides that he is one of the worst directors at all times. What enchanted me most is Richard Kelly (director of Donnie Darko) made the manuscript for this. Now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes, but to be involved in that, hope he has learned his lesson. <br /> <br /> Now, I love Mickey Rourke's new roles, but I don't even like him in this because of the horrible story and look at it. Don't understand me, I still love Mickey Rourke, but he has made a few cases in his time and that is one of them. I don't know what to say about Keira knightly, I think she's a little overvalued. I just can't feel for her in movies. All in all, this movie is bad. that is it ....... 1/10 ....... j.d Seaton
