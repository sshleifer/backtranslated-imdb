I was also intrigued by the high (8.5) rating for this movie and was very disappointed. I had just watched some good foreign films and was looking forward to doing it three in a row, but it shouldn't be. I went with a Spanish speaking friend who felt the same. There's not much of a plot, if any. I don't necessarily need it in a movie, but it must somehow entertain or bring me in. The best thing I could say would be that it strives to be an Altman-esque movie, albeit with an extremely small ensemble. Sure there are moments, but a few moments are easily thin out of 97 slowly minutes of nothing. I don't understand the high rating for this movie. I give it a 3. <br /> <br />
