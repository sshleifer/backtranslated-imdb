Hi, Must be because I'm not a theater major or a sophisticated movie watcher ... I think this movie is "Boring" and "Dumb". I rented this movie because of Charles Bronson and it's title ... but boy, waste of time ... just watching 2 guys sitting in a vault and talking ... The movie on this DVD was so "DARK" .. I had a hard time watching the Darn movie ... I realize it's a 1968 movie ... but they put it on a DVD to do some digital remastering. I was also totally surprised to see these high marks on IMDb for this movie ... as I said before I am not as sophisticated as the others who commented on this movie earlier.
