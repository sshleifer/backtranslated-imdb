OK, I've seen the original French version. But I can't imagine it being better with subtitles. All I have to say is that this is the most boring movie I've seen for a long time. There are almost no redeeming qualities for this movie. Therefore, I cannot understand all the positive reviews. It can be realistic in some way, but some real stories are best left behind. <br /> <br /> I usually like slow-paced movies as long as it serves the purpose of the movie. Tarkovsky's Solaris is extremely slow, but it allows introspection and, for example, sets the mood in the movie. But in this case, the film is just filed with thoughtless dialogue that manages to tell us a little about the characters. No one I could identify with or take care of. In many scenes I found myself thinking: "When should they open?" The action was pretty bad. Not in an overly obvious kind of way. But it seems that none of the actors cared about their characters, and they all looked as if they wanted to be elsewhere in most scenes. This may be due to the uninspired dialogue they were given. The whole stream of the film also felt quite mechanical. Going from one scene to the next. It seems that this movie is just written (bad) but never fixed. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies I can say, not generating any emotional response from any of the scenes. No excitement, no fear, no expectation, no grief, introspection, no intellectual stimulation, no interest whatsoever. <br /> <br /> A perfect example of what I call an anti-movie.
