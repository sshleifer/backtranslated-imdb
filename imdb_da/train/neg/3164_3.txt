Obnoxious Eva Longoria dies on her wedding day when an ice sculpture of an angel (without wings) falls on her out of a truck and kills her. She then tries to destroy the relationship between her ex-boyfriend with her new boyfriend, a psychic who can see her. Of course, unoriginal movies would not be bad in a clich√©d kind of way, except that Longoria's character is hateful and unpleasant that she drains all the fun out of the movie. It's like having your ears cleaned with sandpaper. To be fair Longoria, or anyone else in the cast or crew, is not the problem, it is the god horrible script that sinks the procedure. It's just really really stupid.
