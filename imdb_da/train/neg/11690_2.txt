It is a waist to pamper such amazing actors in such a weak and boring movie. Besides all the unanswered questions written in the other comments, what's so hard to catch the robbers? Just remove the bankers, see who was at the bank - from all the cameras' shooting angles - before the robber's entry, and you have the extra 4 remaining robbers among the hostages. Where is the excitement that every body speaks of? It was so obvious that the hostages were asked to switch to this uniform uniform that they should all go out of the front door ... seen it many times. At least Mr. Spike Lee could have spiced the movie with a good music score and artistic shooting. The movie is not worth it. Pronto!
