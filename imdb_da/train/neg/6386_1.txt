I really wanted to like this movie, but it was just imposable. The action was ultra hammy, the plot was annoying, and the pace was slow, sooo slow. All the time in the theater I wanted the movie to end. Twenty minuets into a movie and I ask for an end. Sure some of the visuals were good, but I'm boys, I really mean! And for a movie about a guy tuning magic instruments there really wasn't much music to talk about. The music there was annoying and boring. There was also loud loud sounds at times too, it was also annoying. Mostly this movie managed to bore me and crawl out at the same time. <br /> <br /> I'm happy about it all. I'll see "Tideland" and wash this bad taste out of my mouth.
