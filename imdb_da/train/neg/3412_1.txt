First, IFC City and Country are running, and now this is. The difference between the stinker and this Pink Panther rip-off is that the city and the country were visible. This is not it. <br /> <br /> I can only convince myself that the cast subscribed to this so that they could leave Europe in the dime of others. Belushi is especially annoying. His scene with Candy (makes a Z-grade Dom DeLuise) was torture. Speaking of torture, five minutes of the talentless shepherd, and I bet the prisoners at Gitmo would break like walnuts! The real "Crime" (besides being greenish) is Shepherd's character: a mousy wife who takes a Monte Carlo casino for half a million dollars! If you buy it, I have some oceanfront property in Arizona you might be interested in!
