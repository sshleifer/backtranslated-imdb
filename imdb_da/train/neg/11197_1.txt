What was the worst movie in 2003? "Cat in the hat?" "Gigli?" Mais non! I suggest it was this terrible little movie from earlier this year. Badly written, poorly edited, and (if I can be so brave) badly acted, "The Order" is the movie's black hole - a movie that is so close, not even the smallest portion of entertainment could escape from its event horizon. It's not even random fun, as (for example) "Showgirls." <br /> <br /> You know the manufacturers assume their audience won't be very smart. They renamed the movie, originally referred to as "The Sin Eaters", because they figured the Americans were too stupid to understand what a sin-eater was, even though they go a long way to explaining what a sinner's sister is in the movie. Instead, they discover a completely generic title, and a picture of Heath Ledger who sees the sullen is more than enough to get you in. <br /> <br /> And, what do you know they were right! My ex-boyfriend saw the picture of Heath and dragged me in. Congratulations, producers you've met your target market. She also liked "Fat II" so you're in good company. <br /> <br /> Back on the subject, Heath plays a Catholic monk from a certain (you guessed it) order trying to investigate the murder of his mentor. He has celibatic problems, possibly because no one in their right mind would believe that he knew the least of religion, much less a celibate monk. The only other member of this order is a fun alcoholic fat guy. As much as I wanted to see the return of the fun alcoholic to the big screen, his attempt at humor reminded me of all the dorks in my high school who imitated Monty Python and thought that if they just said the lines as Pythons would automatically be fun. You know the kind of people I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> If I say more, I would be in danger of generating spoilers. Frankly, what pampered this movie for me was that it was created.
