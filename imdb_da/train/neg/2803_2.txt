Considering the limits of this movie (the whole movie in a setting - a music studio - only about 5 or 6 players in total), it should have been much better made. If you have these limits by making a movie, how could the lighting be so bad? And the actors were horrible, spoke a hair under the actor, except it was an enjoyable movie, it had no substance. Well tried it but it really fails. <br /> <br /> It makes attempts to be self-referenced in a few parts, but the lines were delivered so badly by the actors that it was just bad. And the protagonist Neal guy, what a pathetic looser. Clearly as 10 people did in all this 'movie' and they all knew each other, and it was probably a real rock band they had, but unfortunately these people have no idea how awful they are all around. This was made in 2005, but they all look so naive, it just tastes before the grunge era. Fortunately, I didn't pay to see this (Starz on Demand delivers again!), But it was under the title "The Possessed" not Studio 666, it doesn't matter what you do for the title, it can't help this. This could have been a much better made movie - there is no excuse for this bad movie production when you have the obvious limited parameters the filmmakers had when they did this. Working within these limits, you must do the things you can control and things you can work with the best you can. Instead, they expected mediocrity would be good enough. And the music video wow it was bad, I quickly got it through. <br /> <br /> So 2/10 is fair if you're in the whole b movie crap, I guess you want to go see this.
