If anyone really wants to understand Hitler, WWI's history does not read WWII history. Find out what happened during this war, how soldiers had to live around dead bodies all the time. How so many soldiers became insane, from what they saw during WWI, when they called it "shellshocked" now call it post-traumatic stress disorder. If you learn WWI's true horrors, you will begin to understand Hitler. You will understand how a human being can be desensitized to death, not because of their evil, but simply because it was the only way for them to handle horrors around them. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie misses what so many others do. Read some books on the subject and you should see the movie "The Paths of Honesty", the only good WWI movie ever made. You will see the soldiers' frustration in that movie, the feeling of helplessness and a complete devaluation of human life as nothing more than bullfights. That's what this movie misses, it's really the key point to understanding Germany. A lost war, where millions and millions of Germans lost their lives without any real reason. Then comes a complete economic collapse after the war. These are the factors that create extremism. <br /> <br /> The loss of family members and massive poverty will always lead to extremism. Unfortunately, this film ignored these factors and has just become another smooth piece of shed to throw on the pile. With really no real value, there are fictitious films based on fictional characters that can give you a better idea of ​​Hitler than it does. They just threw Hitler's name on this, so it would sell more.
