The plot line for No One Sleeps is not a bad idea, and the subject is of a great interest. But throughout the film, we said out loud: "These filmmakers are in the trouble of finding good places, the lighting is good, makeup and hair are good ... why is the sound so bad?" Throughout the film, the sound was echoing, distorted and much of the dialogue was incomprehensible. <br /> <br /> There are some good actors in this movie and I think Jim Thalman is really a good actor. This story, with some of the same actors, would have been worth doing as a high budget movie. <br /> <br /> I just can't repeat enough - if you have a limited budget, you dedicate more to good sound. Sound is as much a part of a movie as the picture, and it is worth doing right. Could have earned a 6.
