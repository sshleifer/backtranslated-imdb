This movie is horrible. CGI is the very cheap gray blob CGI. The crocodile resembles a large gray soil. The worst thing is that nothing has been done to make it go or look like it is alive. It is mostly a photo-traded CGI that is placed in scenes and you almost expect to see the hand that moves the CGI smudge over the screen. This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects I've ever seen, and I've seen many of the very bad Sci-Fi Channel movies. <br /> <br /> Apart from the horrible lack of special effects, the typical low cost players are likely to work as waiters / waitresses at local diners while waiting for their big breaks. Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the evil guys trying to sexually attack Kate and the giant crocodile jumps right out of the water to the second floor of Villain's headquarters and through the balcony and pulls the bad guy Kate and Instead of throwing straight down through the building (and crushing Kate), Croc just flies backwards at the same angle in the water. No physical laws can apply to this movie or the special effects. In any case, crocodiles are honored.
