This movie really tries to hard. If you're going to make a horror movie, at least give it a reason to believe in hooking the viewer. <br /> <br /> You wait and wait through the movie, expecting a great explanation, but it doesn't. instead, it tries to be too clever and not reveal anything. <br /> <br /> What was the meaning of the movie? where does it actually go? and more importantly what happened in hell. . . <br /> <br /> Why were they there and how does it work? just another weak sci-fi horror. I love the fake reviews on IMDb and say how big it is by related press releases to bump the movie (whether it or people have low horizons). it is not worth your 2 hours at all. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying that the movie is better than the fragile, but at least it gave you reasoning and why things happened and have an end result. It doesn't, and it's just waffle with lots of padding to make everything feel scary. This movie is about as low as when a stranger calls. god there was also lamb. <br /> <br /> Great tip if you want to make a horror, credible with reasoning and explain the viewer what is going on so they have a hook in your story. Because if there is no justification or credibility, then there is nothing hold on to something, and it cannot be scary. no respect for the cast or the crew because they did a good job. It's just the bad writing.
