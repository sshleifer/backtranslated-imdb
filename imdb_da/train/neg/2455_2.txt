I remember watching the movie in the summer of '78 with my parents, and I'm pretty much into it at that time. Of course I was seven at the time. <br /> <br /> Just before the Jackson movies came out, my wife and I rented this movie when she had never seen it, and I felt nostalgic. <br /> Ralph Bakshi ran out of money midway through the animation process for this movie and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production. Since this film was made primarily with rotoscoping, the animation technique for people on a budget, this says something. Much of this movie is animation only in the very easy meaning of the word. There are some scenes that are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen, with perhaps some animation effects superimposed on them. Due to budgetary constraints, the film - already compression of the "Rings Collection" and part of "The Two Towers" - is even more mated. What you get is like a movie-strip version of Cliff Notes by the books. <br /> <br /> It's not too bad, but the animation brings a warmth to what I found lacking in Jackson movie. It is great to imagine how it could have been with decent funding. <br /> <br /> This movie is also remarkable for having the sequel that never came. Several years later, a half-hearted half-hour television special was broadcast, which was supposed to pack things up. All I want to say about it is that it was a musical.
