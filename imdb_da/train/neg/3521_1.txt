I still shake the thought that I ever see this movie again. <br /> <br /> I've seen action movies, I've even seen some of them, but this one goes over the top. <br /> <br /> Not only has the worst male actor ever (Sly Stallone) starred, but the movie is so stupid from the beginning (why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground, would be hell much easier) that it requires a person with IQ less than his shoen number to believe in it. <br /> <br /> Also, the plot has no real terms at all, a three-year-old child could guess what's coming next. It is a set of clich√©s (of action genre) where Sly performs even worse than his other films (he was better even in Rambo III, if you watch the movie as a comedy rather than action movie). Now there's an actor who can't act A) B) Surprised sadly C) something other than his basic face. <br /> <br /> I would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that can cause some people to suffer. Explosions are excellent, but then you can look better on July 4th. Landscapes are magnificent, but then there are documentaries about the Alps and the Himalayas so you can see better sights that way, rather than wasting time on this flick. <br /> <br /> Watch another movie instead, there are hundreds, even thousands, better action movies.
