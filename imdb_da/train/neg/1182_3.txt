This movie is a little more than badly made, fetish porn, and it says a lot about the similar crap that was made in that era. This was recommended to me by a friend as a "unique movie experience." He was right. I suppose he meant it as a joke. Not disgusting, not even the shocking. Just mediocre plays and bad attempts at shock art. A little bit of camp value, though I don't think the film's makers intend this. And yes, as a previous reviewer mentioned, it is sex with a guy in a bear outfit. Don't spend much money on this. Try to borrow it to see it. Or contact me, I will be happy to sell you my copy at half price. <br /> <br /> I may have to see another of this director's movie as he seems to have a particular consequence. But if it is something like this, I will again regret another 2 hours in my life forever.
