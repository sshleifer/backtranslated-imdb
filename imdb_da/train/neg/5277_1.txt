I caught this on Showtime tonight and was amazed at how a movie with such an interesting premise could end up being so incredibly horrible. WHO IS YOUR FATHER? stars Brandon Davis as an adopted high school senior Chris Hughes, a geek who inherits the heir to a porn empire left him of his biological parents. Although the premise sounds like the movie can be a lot of fun, it is ruined by inappropriate director from first-time director Andy Fickman, a clich√© and predictable manuscript, and even bad at video standards. Even the normally fun Charlie Talbert turns in a surprisingly bleak performance as the best friend. Ali Landry is the only good part of this lame and unfunny dud. 1.10
