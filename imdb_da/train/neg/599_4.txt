Okay, I have to say it before revealed by the "monster." says he really doesn't fit into that category, just some weird stuff that had an annoying screech! And personally, I think a grandmother could have run away from that thing, yet. In fact, I had come into this movie, even though the protagonist was a full and a heroine addiction, not coming as an appeal. But such scenes as when she runs away from the train and you can see the figure at the door were a little scary, even where the guard had just been killed and the "monster" took his hand on the screen. <br /> <br /> But then the disaster is fixed when it was revealed, it just became your average horror, with limited tension or scare. Slowly I became more bored and wanted to close the case. I like that most people have said was to calm the homeless to do it, especially the guy, he gave me a few cheap laughs here and there. I think this movie could really have been something special instead of being like any other horror today! Just boring and not worth the money. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a cheap scare here and there, or a mindless gore party (which is limited, hardly anyone actually), give it to everyone to go, but for all you see serious horror watchers see one elsewhere, much better movies out there.
