The First Power (1990) was a horrible movie that came out in the late 80s / early 90s with cheap horror movies. I found this movie very boring, but extremely fun in some parts. This movie lacks so much meaning and credibility that it is not even fun. The fast legal system in this movie makes Texas look weak in comparison. Lou Diamond Phillips is heading over the head with this role (playing a hard-boiled policeman) and Tracey Griffith (Melanie's more attractive sister) plays a psychic. Don't waste your time with this because it's bad. How little I take it back. This movie makes a good movie. Check out the switchblade crucifix packing nun, she has the best legs I've ever seen on a non that wasn't in a Jesus Franco nunsploitation flick. Yeow! <br /> <br /> This marked a conclusion to an era for L.D.P. His star was tarnished and he couldn't draw flies to a dung high. It was D.T.V. for him until his "resurction" a few years later. <br /> <br /> Not recommended unless you are desperate.
