Although you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed all the important moments of the 1960s (okay, Katie didn't come with the Manson family, and no one died at Altamont), this movie was still incredibly horrible. I got the impression that "authors" just locked themselves in a room and looked at "Forrest Gump", "The Wonder Years" and Oliver Stone's 60s movie over and over and called it research. A Canadian television critic called the conclusion of the first episode "head spinning". He was right.
