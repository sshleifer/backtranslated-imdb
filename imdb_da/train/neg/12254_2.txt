Some may scoff, but there is actually a real art of making extremely bad movies. This misses all fronts. <br /> <br /> A bunch of young people - women with elevated breasts and continuously wet T-shirts, of course - go to movie "blood surfing" and end up running into a 31 foot crocodile. Not only was the hook obviously false, but some of the props [note the boat hitting the reef in particular] look like they have come out of thunderbirds! <br /> <br /> Not good, from start to finish. Don't see it!
