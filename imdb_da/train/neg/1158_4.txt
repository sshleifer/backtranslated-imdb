Tenants Two authors struggle to complete their books in anything but empty apartment house. They initially help each other and so slowly the tension between them begins to build. <br /> <br /> This is based on a Bernard Malamud novel and unfortunately everyone speaks as if they are in the novel. Very little of the dialogue is natural, it is purple and filled with nuances of importance. It is as if a college English head with a head filled with performance wrote the script. It's terrible, and I instantly found myself immune to everything the movie had to say, which is a shame as the film is populated with great performances from top to bottom. Snoop Dog downstairs is fine form, unfortunately none of them can get over the forgery of the words and premise. I can't really recommend this movie. Although it is not really bad, it is very predictive and pretentious to make you want to go away. I lost interest less than a third of the way in and had to fight to get to the end. If you are interested, I would try it on cable, but I wouldn't put good money into seeing it.
