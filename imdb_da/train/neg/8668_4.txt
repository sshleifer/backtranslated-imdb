I have never read the Bradbury short story that this movie is based on, but from what I have gathered, it will be interesting (when I finally read it and I will). My comments will be based solely on the movie. As soon as I saw the trailer, I knew I had to see it and was so excited, but when I finally did, I was so disappointed with the evil. This is because the film itself felt so amateurish. The actors were not well thrown (though Robards and Pryce are both good actors - just not here). The children's actors just seemed to come up, get into the character's clothes, say the lines and make the faces. The set and props were cheap and unrealistic. The direction was surprisingly poor. I was so surprised at the horror that I had to go online and check who instructed it to just see the work he had done. The editing was cut and inserted, and the plot (manuscript) was as good (although the author had been involved in himself, irony?). The build-up of tension, fear and excitement was so mild that it was ineffective when the climax finally came. <br /> <br /> I've read some of the comments on this movie and have difficulty believing that people actually like it. What hurts most is that the content is interesting and fun and exciting. It had so much potential. Unfortunately, the film was so technically bad that it takes away from the glory of history.
