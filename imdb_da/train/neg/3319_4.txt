I was surprised when I saw this movie. I had heard that it was the best ever filmed by the novel. How disappointed I was. How any true Jane Austen fan can judge this adaptation is a mystery to my eyes. The scriptwriters have decided to break down ridiculous humor that is embarrassing at best times, but also destroys the feeling of the period. Regarding the cast: Gwyneth Paltrow does a pretty shallow heroine (but then any "hot" American star would be questionable in the role), Toni Collette is in disrepute and poor Ewan McGregor is made to look ridiculous! <br /> <br /> I really couldn't say a good thing about this movie. I seem to be among the few who don't judge it, but if you want my advice, see the television production with Kate Beckinsale instead - believe me, it's far better than this superficial waste.
