this is not one of those movies, it is one of the biggest pieces of tripe i ever have the scene, the camera's work is trying to be flashy, but it is just just the whole thing looks like the red shoe diaries but without sexy, the only reason i bought this was that i wanted to try dvd and it was the cheapest i could find, possibly the worst purchase of my life and could have turned off dvd forever, the soundtrack is really sticky and most of the movie is made up of endless repetitions of clips from the first two movies, why anyone will make a movie so horrible as this is beyond me if they had really tried to make an original movie and failed to be nicer in this review, but they do not have equal rights to reproduce things from the first two and then edit it and repeat it in this movie with about maybe under 1 third original footage that is up to the standards of film school students, k b NOT this film. The only entertainment this DVD can offer is if you keep it in the microwave and watch the flashing lights! WITHOUT OUTSIDE EXTERNAL EXTRAS GARBAGE! 0/10 if only the voting system allows.
