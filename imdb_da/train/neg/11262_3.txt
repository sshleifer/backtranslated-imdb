Adrian has just left asylum, is rich and without parents, his life seems empty. One day he meets Gonzalo, a poor boy, whose mother is a prostitute. Desperate to make some money, Gonzalo Adrian helps to apply for his life and who his parents are. This is a movie from a new director, and it is clearly in most of the movie: scenes that are not properly corrected, dialogues a little forced, some in-script layouts. Regardless, the end is unexpectedly well done (well, just a little) and it saves a bit of the movie. Actors are known and of great quality, nevertheless they are not inspired enough to make the film interesting; everyone has made better papers in other films. The movie results in boring and probably you will spend most of the time thinking about how much time it will take until it ends. Of course, there are many worse movies, but there are probably many many better.
