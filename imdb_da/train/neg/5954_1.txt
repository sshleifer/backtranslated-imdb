This show comes up with interesting places as fast as the travel channel. It is billed as reality, but in reality it is pure prime time-open operation. It tries to use exotic sites as a facade to bring people into a fake competition and then continue to hook viewers on contestant's soap opera style. It also borrows from an early CBS game show pioneer-Beat The Ur - by inventing situations for its participants to try and overcome. Then it rewards the winning money. If they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters, even better. While the game format is in slow motion versus Beat The Clock - the real implementation of this series is to escape the reality. <br /> <br /> This show features elements of several types of successful past programs. Reality TV, hardly, but if your hooked on the participants, locale or contest, this is your cup of tea. If you are not, this whole series as I say is driving dripping with sauce. It is another show that hides behind the reality label, which it started in 2000. <br /> <br /> It is smooth and well-produced, so it can take a while yet. After all, Gilligan's Island, Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies & The Brady Bunch also do again. This just doesn't use professional players. The intelligence level is about the same.
