National Lampoon was once a fun magazine. Whether you liked the stoner hippie days at the end of the sixties or in the seventies (when the comedy was fortified with lots of naked babies), they were very small on the birthday, but everyone agreed that in the early eighties had the Middle Ages killed by the remaining sparks of anarchist humor that the fabrics did not have, and offers like this movie and the increasingly terrible spin-off records shot further holes in the hull. Outside of a nicely illustrated title sequence, there is absolutely nothing to recommend this singularly depressing stink bug. Doing so through the enchanting opening segment, 'Growing Myself', hopes things will get better, good luck - they don't. Anyone who believed the idea of ​​a woman raped with a butterfly was comedy gold deserved to have his hands back to him on a plate of dog jewelry. If there is ever a global shortage of guitar picks, the negatives of this apt, incoherent ragbag of crummy ideas and expensive performances may well serve some purpose.
