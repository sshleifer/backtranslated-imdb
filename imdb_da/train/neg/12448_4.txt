Clint Eastwood is Bronco Billy, the leader of a Wild West troupe, one of six regular misfits that includes a huge-to-break-even touring show. The seventh member of the group is a woman, Billy's assistant, but such women never last long and the position is chronically open. Enter Antoinette Lilly (Sandra Locke Eastwood's boyfriend at the time). It seems as if Miss Lilly, as Doc (Scatman Crothers) calls her, is a wild heir who will only receive his deceased father's property if she is married when she turns 30, so she gets hitched on the birthday of the comic Geoffrey's birthday Lewis. <br /> <br /> So what is the plot of this movie? It's hard to say. There is the romantic excitement between Billy and Miss Lilly, but the problem is that in the first half of the movie she is so haughty obscene and abominable that when she suddenly becomes "one of the troops" halfway through the movie, it is not only incredible but the audience is well past her carefully. There is the chronic lack of funds behind the Wild West show, but this issue is not enough to really be the movie's raison d'etre. There is Miss Lilly's hassle of being stranded in the rural west, cut off from the means that burns her spoiled life of luxury (she mistakenly believed to be the death of her family and the press). But do we really have to believe she couldn't go back to New York and wait for her luck if she made a little effort? <br /> <br /> No, the point of this movie seems to be Billy is the head of a family, a gracious mass of losers, connected through thick and thin. This is a hot, fuzzy movie ?? or at least try to be. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Clint shows us his skills with a gun, even during a bank robbery in a shooting grotesque out of place in an otherwise relatively non-violent movie. One of the gangs is arrested on an old draft evasion. Billy bribes the local sheriff. The tent of fire is burning down; an orphanage makes them a new one. But many earthly pitfalls do not make a plot. <br /> <br /> The connection of the problem is the play or lack thereof. Apart from Scatman Crothers, the support aids are quite amateurish. Eastwood is also not on top of his game, even though he looks better just because of being surrounded by such a sharp bunch. <br /> <br /> And for all this, the movie goes for 116 minutes. To what point? Good question ?? <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10
