I can't believe that the Indian film industry still makes such three-dimensional dross like Waqt out. For starters, the story is amazing ?? Pampered son is thrown out of the family home to teach him self-sufficiency. So what does he do? He immediately goes on to win some national talent competitions by making some star leaps ahead of a panel of judges (I honestly don't fool here). Meanwhile, his father is dying of lung cancer, but keeps it secret from his son, but he survives long enough to see his son become famous for seeing his new grandchild and also making a new toy giraffe with his own hands. <br /> <br /> The play is cringe worthy of its hamminess ?? Nothing was done to try to act in any convincing way by any of the most important players in this movie. As usual for Indian movies, the family lived in a large mansion and seemed relatively untouched by the real world worries. To be honest, the biggest losers when such animal films are made are the intelligent viewers. who made the mistake of seeing such a movie. The actors, like Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar, will still be honored as the god of the people who have only blind faith in Bollywood.
