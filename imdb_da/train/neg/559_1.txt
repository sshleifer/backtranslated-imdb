I watched this movie in London Premiere and I have to say - I didn't expect much, but I expected something that was at least mildly entertaining. <br /> <br /> The original "Basic Instinct" was no big movie and is still something of a "smut classic", but it was entertaining. I remember countless times flipping through channels on television on a late Friday or Saturday night that has come across the movie and found myself starting to actually pay attention to it. <br /> <br /> But this lame brain, waaay-delayed sequel has nothing. Is Sharon Stone Still Beautiful? Well, let's say that - for a 47-year-old she's pretty hot. Is she as beautiful as she was in the original? No. She also clearly had plastic surgery on her face, and her hairdresser in this movie is somewhat uncomfortable. She doesn't look like soft or genuine or innocent, as she did in the original - which makes sense to be an evil seductive and not. The rest of the shows range from bad to awful - and Michael Caton-Jones (a typical safe director - one who doesn't always do good work but manages to make valuable films) has officially delivered his first real turkey; a movie so bad people laughed at certain moments that should be serious. <br /> <br /> I hear the movie went through several editing sessions, and it is clear from the start. Nothing makes much sense. The whole plot is a cosmic mess and the end - oh my! Talk about stupid and incredible. (I can still see it). I saw "Gigli", I saw "the mask's son" - and although I do not want to "smear" this movie, I can say with my own authority (which you do not agree with you in general that I prefer both movies over this catastrophic failure. <br /> <br /> By the way, Stone stood five minutes before the movie began, and people in the theater started throwing things on the screen under a very scandalous and insulting scene inside an orgy-type nightclub. br /> <br /> "Basic Instinct 2" - basically it stinks too.
