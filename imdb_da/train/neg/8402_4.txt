The Three Stooges in a feature length western comedy musical? Perhaps "Rockin" in the Rockies was meant to combine Stooges comedy cards with the Western musical, in a matinee; If so, it was a good way to break up on a Saturday afternoon. Jay Kirby (like Rusty) is a beautiful young hero; and Mary Beth Hughes (like the blonde June) and Gladys Blake (as brunette Betty) are beautiful women. Hoosier Hotshots is a harmonious group; their songs are quite tuneful; However, it is the 1940s, not the 1950s, so the film is not exactly "rock". There are a few laughs; But Stooges' humor is more subdued than usual. The talking horse is also underutilized. <br /> <br /> **** Rockin 'in the Rockies (4/17/45) Vernon Keays ~ Moe Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard, Mary Beth Hughes
