Wow. I've seen some really bad movies in my time, but this one really takes the cake. It's the worst movie I've seen over the last decade - no exaggeration. As an American Army veteran of the war in Afghanistan, I found it almost impossible to finish looking at this ridiculous movie, not because it brought back memories - far from it - but because there was absolutely no attempt to be "authenticity" that is found everywhere in the film. Not as much as the smallest shed. It looked like it was written by an 8 year old child who got all his concepts of war (and solitary behavior) right out of comics. The film was made in Honduras, which should have been a little, but even it cannot fully explain the terrible production values ​​of this cliché-ridden waste. <br /> <br /> I could try to list all the endless technical errors, but it would take almost forever. From the old unit shoulder spots, which have not been seen or worn since World War II, and the character's name tags, as "ColCollins" (borne by the "Colonel Collins" sign), which were actually spelled by the inverted mirror image "N" of the Russian The alphabet (not the American alphabet) list goes on and on again. The uniforms, the equipment, the plot and especially the characters themselves - every scene was just full of ridiculous errors, inaccuracies and completely thoughtless clichés. Neither the story itself nor the characters were at least credible or credible. It was all ridiculously childish in the extreme. This was, of course, a movie designed to appeal strictly to pre-pubescent boys, and I have some doubts that even they would find this movie quite absurd. <br /> In short, this movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities at all. It's a total waste of time. I would highly recommend anyone reading this to pass this waste by; It's really not worth wasting a moment of your time.
