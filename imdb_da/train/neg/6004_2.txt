The best thing about camp films in general is that you know what to expect. It's like watching a professional wrestling match or a daytime opera or a Jerry Springer show: You can immediately follow the skimpy plot, identify the cardboard characters and look at satisfaction while all the clich√©s are met. But at times, the director does something really unexpected. It can be something extraordinarily stupid, or something strange or somewhat insightful. The director Makinen is up there with the best camp directors, and that is his best film. <br /> <br /> In Yon saalistajat everything is coming together. There is nothing good for it, but still manages to be a coherent whole. Not even does the film fall slowly - the action continues and blows continue. <br /> <br /> The strangest thing is that there is no view of time: some characters seem to take months to do something, while other characters have spent only one hour in a bar. This is partly due to the Finnish summer, where the sun never sets, so you do not experience the day, which turns into a night at all. <br /> <br /> Finally: There is a plot that, somewhere. You may need to watch the movie three times before you realize it.
