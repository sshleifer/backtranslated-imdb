I watched this movie last weekend and it's stupid and thoughtless. An old curse makes a man a mummy in his pajamas? The victims are afraid of meaningless and cannot run from a slowly moving old man. They release their flashlights and shake instead of trying to stave off him or burn him. Quentin alias Hr. Fabersham of the Honeymooners is married to Diane Brewster aka Miss Canfield of Leave it to Beaver fame, who is unhappy in marriage. Wow, love plot. The rest of the casting follows only one another in the tombs and waits for screams to react and run to their aid. The Egyptian girl doesn't look bad, but doesn't lock much for the movie. Where's the mummy? Really just a curse loosened. This does not hold the flashlight for Universal Mummy movies at least. Watch this movie if you need sleep because you want to dose.
