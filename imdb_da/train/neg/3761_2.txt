Foywonder's review of this cheap STV hits the nail all the way up. Make sure you read it. If you don't, a group of scientists head out into the Pacific Northwest's deep forest to fumble around with a bunch of bones in an expensive cemetery. The Big Foot family does not kindly greet this, and continues to pick up the team one by one, largely offscreen. Big Foot itself has a distinctly monkey-like face, but is less scary in general than Harry from HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS. Most of the movie has the tree, generic actors pretend to be scientists who thrash around in the woods and glance away. This is a non-budget film where very little happens, at least on the screen. We see to see the sexy of the females take a bath while one of her male companions looks but nothing comes of this.
