This movie has received several important errors. The first and most significant is the clear lack of a good plot! Unfortunately, it makes the movie not only difficult to see, but also sends the viewer some feelings of hopelessness, as if he or she is wasting valuable time of their short life. That means the movie can't catch that audience, but it encourages the public to become disdainful of the movie and everything associated with it! In short, it is really very very very very very very very BAD! Do yourself a favor and chew on a great rubber shoe you find it much more interesting and enjoyable than seeing Terminator Woman.
