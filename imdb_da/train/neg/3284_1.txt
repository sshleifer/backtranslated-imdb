Have I seen a worse movie? Maybe only "Manos: The hands of fate" pulled more than "Dukes". I had more fun poking on the giant plot holes than the movie gave me at any time. Let's touch a few ... There was a noticeable script death and rebirth when Sheev speaks to the dukes and they don't respond. He moves on and moves, since neither Knoxville nor Scott knows what he is talking about (nor). It was as if the engine died and was restarted. <br /> <br /> The few times General Lee flew through the air was not even so exciting. Nothing I haven't seen on the TV series. <br /> <br /> Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scott. The best part was when Bo is sad Luke to steal the girl he liked. The only reason this works is that the script actually shaded it (though roughly). The rest of the time it seems distant and forced. <br /> <br /> Seann William Scott is horrible, horrible accent (or lack thereof). <br /> <br /> I hated Willie Nelson's performance. Should bad jokes be lovers? I wanted him to disappear. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson is looking great on the big screen. She actually felt like one of the best actors in the movie. It tells you how horrible this movie is. She's a goddess. During the climax of the film, I am rowing for Boss Hogg and the evil ones to merge all of Hazzard County, starting with Willie Nelson and his accomplices. A nuclear weapon would have been sufficient. <br /> <br /> This is not supposed to be a coherent disassembly of the movie, but a release of frustration at the immense writing and performance of what could have been a truly heartwarming movie. br /> <br /> If we could only delete and start over ...
