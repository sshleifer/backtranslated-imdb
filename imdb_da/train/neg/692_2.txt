One of the many slashers that emerged in the early eighties is Prank's remarkable only for an early performance by Daphne Zuniga (The Sure Thing, The Fly 2); Her character dies pretty early and the rest of the movie is completely forgettable. <br /> <br /> During their Christmas holidays, a group of students volunteer to clear a condemned university building of their furniture. However, a crazy killer throws a key in the works by stealing the young ones one by one in a number of cruel ways. <br /> <br /> Utilizing every stem 'n' slash clich√© in the book, director Jeffrey Obrow delivers a dull and unexciting horror that prompted me for the characters to be killed so that I could continue to see something worth more. . The majority of deaths (which let us see it is why we generally see this kind of film) are short and not so gory; The only real pork image comes right at the end when the victims' discoveries are discovered by the remaining survivor (there is a particularly bloody dismembered corpse - the movie could have done more). <br /> <br /> At the last minute, the movie rescues itself from the quarrel by receiving the lowest possible score from me by having a nice unexpected downbeat ending, but it is only one for slasher finishers.
