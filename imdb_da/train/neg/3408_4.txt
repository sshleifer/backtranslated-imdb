I was in second class 12 years ago. I remember it clearly. We learned about space. All young children want to go to the room, right? Well, after I saw this, I was so afraid of death that I would accidentally be thrown into the space of a psychotic robot with a track in a track. I didn't know it was a movie. I thought it was a news program or something. I think it was my own version of when people were freaked out of the radio program 'World of War'. So recently, I get this movie again to see, realize my favorite actor, Joaquin Phoenix was in it (as known as Leaf Phoenix). I can tell you, I laughed at the dramatic parts and laughed even harder at the actor. I mean, when Andy is in the room, she goes into slow motion, have you ever noticed it? I don't think being in the room makes you talk so slowly or think so slowly. <br /> <br /> The best part is when Andy is unknowingly turned off the oxygen tank and begins to float backwards when the security doors are closed. Little Max tries to pull her in. Suddenly we get a big close-up on Max's face when he shouts (in slow motion) "Whaaaaattttssssss happpeniiiinngggg?!?!?" I had no idea.
