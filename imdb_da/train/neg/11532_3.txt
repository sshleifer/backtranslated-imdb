I rented this movie the second night because neither my boyfriend nor myself had ever seen it, even though we had heard from a common friend how "it was good". <br /> <br /> Now I am quite conservative in my views, but I knew to go in, it would be quite liberal if anyone instructed it. I figured before the movie started, Michael Douglas would play massive compassionate popular liberal loved ones, and there would be a stodgy conservative opponent as his antagonist. But I thought it was where the political statement would begin and end. <br /> <br /> OK, the plot was solid: Any president falls for a lobbyist. OK, this has potential, I thought to be quite entertaining as the plot was unique. But then the film became a liberal infomercial. The film became more about gun control and environmental problems than it did about the relationship between the president and Sydney (Annette Bening). There were several ridiculous rooms in this movie: 1) The character Sydney plays this six figure lobbyist who is a "closer". Could she have been more volatile? She was constantly disorganized and seemed in awe of everything. Hardly a "closer". I'm a sale and she couldn't "close" to sell a glass of water to a man who dies of thirst. <br /> <br /> 2) Secondly, is there anything more ridiculous than Richard Dreyfuss playing a right wing fanatic? This is the most liberal man in Hollywood and she plays some right-wing ideologues. Give me a break. I liked how he took his conservative character and made him as scary as possible. <br /> <br /> 3) The speech at the end was simply ridiculous. The line about "I am a proudly card-bearing member of the ACLU" was a joke. First, no president would ever admit anything like that to be an active member of an ultra fringe group. Second, why even bring something like this. You have just alienated over half of the film's audience, which is moderate or conservative. I thought the plot was amazing and unique. I thought Michael Douglas was a good choice as president. But the film went from being a movie to a left-wing political statement, so the movie failed. It is a shame to see a good piece of ruin by Hollywood, forcing their political views on the audience
