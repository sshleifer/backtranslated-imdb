There is no doubt who has the cadet training command in this movie: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer who complies with military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets - the bomber. But he is not so stiff to be unfair or unfriendly. In fact, he even changes his mind about the value of women working in the military. He is tough when he needs to be, but at other times he is a clear mix of coach and priest, roles he perfected in other films. His character is the basis of the action that is all about. O'Brien works naturally in the role and plays it in a good way. Two things help this movie: O'Brien's performance and the spectacular special effects end.
