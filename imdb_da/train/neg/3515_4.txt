Basically a typical propaganda movie for the last good war. But there were a few things that struck me. First, the use of mouthed epithets was. In two cases, Scott opens the character once at the beginning when he releases his bomb off target during bomb-off ("dammit") and once when he tries to swing a bombardier to be a pilot ("s *% t") . I could be wrong about another instance, but I played it several times, and that's what it looks like to me. The third case is when the Anne Shirley character wants the O'Brien character goodbye and good luck ("Give them hell") over the roar of the engine. She must have thought it was for unladylike because she clearly says "heck". I also found the character interesting to have moral problems with bombing, especially bombing civilians. The overall superior officer assures him that only military targets will be hit due to the accuracy of the bomb security applied. Considering what we know about LeMay's later strategy of burning Japanese cities in oblivion, this scene does not play a little irony. I can remember McNamara's quote by LeMay in "The Fog of War", which means that if the United States didn't win the conflict, he would be tried as a war criminal. The finish is overwhelmed in accordance with the movie. It reminded me a little about the end of the White Heat (I don't compare the movies, just the end!). Maybe it's just because he's blown up. Blowing really good !!!
