Horrible movie with a bit of Ramones shattered. Your worse than average 1970s / 80s comedy format of cool kids takes over the school with a whimsical plan. This movie is horrible. The plot consists of a girl who enjoys ramones and a school bent on fighting their repressive administration. Forget about this movie and watch something like Wild Zero with Guitar Wolf if you want an entertaining B movie. Terrible play, horrible writing, horrible reason with the stamp of approval of Ramones, who probably needed some money fast so they said yes to this movie. That's the only logical thing I can think of because this movie is blowing.
