You know you're in trouble when John Cassavetes works at half speed instead of full throttle in a movie, and "The Incubus" is a terribly worst scenario of a big actor going through the moves to pay the bills. In fact, one can observe the hammy script and John Hough's 'baroque' artistic direction, he can hardly blame him. The film has something to do with a number of rapes that take place in a small town with many supernatural hokum mixed in. Somehow, the direction manages to suck tensions and interests out of all the scenes, and Cassavete's seemingly PO 'at times. The incubus itself, which is not shown to the last scene, is a well-written creation, but it is not worth waiting for. <br /> <br /> 1/10
