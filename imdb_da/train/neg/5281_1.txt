The humor of Who's Your Daddy is so bad taste that I actually closed my eyes in certain scenes. Close-ups of semen are not fun! No one thinks they are. People get nervous when they see something so rough and hide their nervousness they laugh. Seeing who is your father gave me a disgusting nervous feeling.
