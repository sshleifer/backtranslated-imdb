I think this movie should be shocking. But the only way it really is shocking is how shockingly bad it has been done ... and simply is. It's one and a half hours of trouble. Even more for the viewer than for the characters in the movie (the five girls). Sure the protagonists get their bloody piece in a bad way, which is basically fine as it is a horror movie. And I (normally) like horror movies. I have no problem with violence in these types of movies in themselves. But all the violence in this movie does not end at all. It is no other play than that, it is simply grotesque. It's so boring that it even gets boring and really fast too. The worst thing (if the above was not bad enough for you) about this movie is that they have tried to copy Blair Whitch Project by recording with cheap handheld cameras. But (again, this too) serves no end at all. In "Blair Which" there is another explanation, namely that they are their with a camera looking for blairheksen. In this movie there is no other explanation than: "Hi, we want this to look like Blair Whitch !!" The sound in the movie is also something to get depressed. The girls shout so hysterically that many times you can't figure out what they say. Moreover, nothing has been done to do anything better, soundly or otherwise. Finally, there is the soundtrack, which is as bad as the rest, and varies from cheap euro house to the worst grungy hard rock ... My advice: Don't see this under ANY circumstances.
