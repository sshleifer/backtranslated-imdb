* spoliers * no longer read if you haven't seen this movie <br /> <br /> Picking up after the depressing "Phantasm II" ended; The big man kidnaps Mike while Reggie and the new kid Tim spend most of the rest of the movie trying to get him back and not end up as slaves at Tall Man's "Red Planet". This gets really stupid: The trio's trio in the pink lamp was only there for comic relief, and the black karatechick (can't remember her name) was so annoying, I couldn't wait to see if the long man killed her character. This sets it up to look almost as if it would be Tim's character who comes late and ultimately is the hero, but ... it doesn't quite work that way. At the end of this story, Liz is beheaded by the killer, Mike gets a silver ball implanted in his skull, the balls get Reggie and the dwarves get Tim, and no one is left to stop The Tall Man. The bad guy wins - now how's the surprise at the end? <br /> <br /> This was filmed in 1993 and released until '95, and the end of it was finally at that time, and although disappointing and anticlimactic it was also an appropriate and appropriate end for this weird little series. But the fourth changes this end and adds nothing new but more bad jokes, and an even worse and more indecent ending ... <br/> <br /> * 1/2 out of ****
