It's almost like two films - a literary and engaging, the other stupid and clich√©. It's really a shame all the issues were not drafted with the writing, but considering how fast most B movies were written and produced, it's not that unusual. However, it is a shame as it could have been a very good movie. First the good. The movie is original and involves WWII code breakers. This is quite fascinating and I liked watching the leading man (Lee Bowman) go through his steps as a master code breaker. In fact, the first two thirds of the movie was very good. But now for the bad, the movie just went too long and lost steam in about 50 minutes. In addition, Jean Rogers role as "boiling boyfriend" must be one of the worst writing and distracting roles in film history !! For any smart move made by Bowman, Idiot Rogers went in to turn up as a misunderstood "comedy aid". If her role had been intelligently written, the overall movie would have improved tremendously! Instead, see her, it's hard to understand how we actually won World War II !!
