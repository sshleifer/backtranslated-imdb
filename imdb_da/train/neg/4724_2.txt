This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw it at the premiere of SXSW and was very disappointed. The director knew a little about John Lennon and even said so much at the premiere. This is a drama, but people laughed at how crazy the movie was. It is never a good sign. The only survivors were Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as Livia's roommates / bandmates. They were funny, while the rest of the film took itself seriously. The Cheesy Drop of Beatles lyrics were just absurd. The soundtrack, however, was excellent and that was probably the best part of the movie. Unless you are one of the crazy racial Dominic Monaghan fans, don't bother with this one.
