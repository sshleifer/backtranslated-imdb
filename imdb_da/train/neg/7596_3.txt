A movie starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented actors, sounds like a good idea. An independent movie sounds even better. The studies will lessen the content, giving actors and writers and director more creativity. <br /> <br /> So why is this movie so bland? Ask the dust. <br /> <br /> This movie, from bats, assumes that we are deeply invested in the characters. No one gets a proper back story, so we never know why the characters work the way they do. <br /> <br /> Explanations of physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination if you still have a left at the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> I told a friend that I was going to watch this movie and that I thought it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Her question: "Not even Colin Farrell could save it?" My answer: "Not even Colin Farrell's ass could save it."
