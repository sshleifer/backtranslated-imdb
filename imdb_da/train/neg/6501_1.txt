Once again, this film is one of the films that anyone thinks or tries to make others believe they understood. Anyone trying to make sense of this is a MORON! My advice was to take two not one, but two hits of very strong acid and at least you get a visual excitement out of it !! Although at the end you can kill yourself to waste your acid !!!! Being that this comment requires 10 lines of info, let me write something to those who will try to defend the movie. Unintelligble. Trash. Schitzoid. Waste of talent. Film is ice, with paper on destination with ringing clouds, on a sunny dive in pudding .... Sounds like lion in red light watching hair. Explain it now to me !!!!
