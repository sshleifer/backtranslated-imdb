It would help to know why it took so long for a book to be movie-ready 'like' The House Next Door 'to be adapted to film or television. The book was copyright protected in 1978. One reason could be trouble designing the 'house'. The house in this Lifetime movie is really so ugly that I can't imagine anyone buying it. In fact, it is so ugly that someone would probably have come and destroyed it as soon as it was built. I'm not crazy about horror genre books, but it was hard to put down when I came across it about ten years ago. The main characters are not the kind of people searching for something occult in life, and that is one of the book's strengths. They are not people who would conclude that the architect was a kind of demon ... (or the devil personified) without witnessing and analyzing the described events as well in the book. However, it is a downbeat book for the most part, and I don't think it appeals to the people who are running Lifetime. Maybe someone will come up with another version of the book in the coming years. A better house .. better music .. a better script and darker lighting ... would definitely help.
