I was looking forward to seeing this as it was in production. But it turned out to be the biggest disappointment. Far from the victorious world of Dr. Seuss. It was vulgar and uncomfortable. I don't think Dr. Seuss would have approved. How Grinch stole Christmas was much better. I understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it, but my kids haven't yet caught up. While the cat in the hat screamed vulgarity, they caught much more than I would have liked. Breed with Dr. Seuss It really disturbed me to see how this timeless classic got the waste on the big screen. Let's see what they do with Horton hears who. I hope this makes Dr. Seuss a little justice.
