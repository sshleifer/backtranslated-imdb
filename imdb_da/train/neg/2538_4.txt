Between 1937 and 1939, Twentieth Century-Fox produced a ton of Mr. Moto films. But at the end of the series it was obvious that the studio had "jumped in the shark" so to speak. This sentence indicates that a television program has passed its prime and the responsible leaders decided to refresh the show by fundamentally changing the formula. For example, with "The Brady Bunch" they introduced the annoying 'Cousin Oliver' and with 'Family Ties', they introduced a freak baby that grew up in six years in just one season! With the Moto films, they would skip the shark by introducing comic relief because they thought these intelligent movies should be reused. In the previous movie, Warren Hymer played an annoying wrestler. And in this movie the character Archibald Featherstone is shown. Featherstone might just be one of the most annoying examples of comic relief ever that you hoped someone (preferably Moto) would kill him just to shut him down! Although he was to work for the famous Scotland Yard, he shows all the intelligence and fate of a brain-damaged beak. Again and again his scenes were boorish and unnecessary, and Peter Lorre just looks painful as he stands there and sees this buffoon "action". It's so bad that it really destroys what might have been one of the better Moto movies because of its clever plot. <br /> <br /> With regard to the plot, the crown of the Queen of Sheba is discovered in the opening scene. Moto, now more of an international policeman than the amoral character he was originally, is available to protect the precious item from being stolen. In a big twist, several thieves try to steal the crown independently. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie can be seen, but there is also ample evidence that the Moto series should be completed here. As WWII approaches, the movies could not have survived much longer anyway, as having a sympathetic Japanese leading character simply would not have been accepted in the United States or in allied countries.
