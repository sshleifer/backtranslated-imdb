I have recently seen this again and there is another version that is shorter in 1999. I understand that they are the same movie, but I would like to know the difference. One is Japanese and no pikachu card is all I can come up with. Ohtherwise why vote for the same movie twice ?? <br /> <br /> Prof Ivy was a bit boring. She sounded like she almost fell asleep, not at all with the few lines she had. <br /> <br /> It was comfortable enough, but there wasn't much at all. <br /> <br /> A collector (there after Lugia, he has no plans to destroy the world) and the usual characters trying to stop him because you are trying to catch Lugia, causes a lot of destruction. <br /> <br /> The pokemon films that follow are a bit better, deoxys (poke 7) are good, with no. 8 almost here.
