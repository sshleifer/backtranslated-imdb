I thank God, I didn't go to the movies for this movie. I would be very sorry for the money I gave. I saw it on television, and I couldn't believe my eyes. I wonder if any movie could be worse than this one. They didn't spend millions of dollars for this movie. terrible acting and terrible scenario. I think the other people who wrote comments are the man who works from the movie company;) It is very big failure! in the year 2000 can they still laugh at this kind of movie? embarassing ...
