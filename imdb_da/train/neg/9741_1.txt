(spoilers) The one truly memorable part of this otherwise rather dull and tiny bit of British cuisine is Steiner's henna rinse, one of the worst dye jobs ever. That and the magnificent caterpillar eyebrows on the old evil guy who tried to steal Steiner's invention. MST3K does an admirable job of making a miserable boring and gray movie fun. I especially like it when Crow kills Mike with his 'touch of death', and when he revives him in the theater, Mike cries "Guys, I died, I saw eternal truth and beauty! Oh, this is the movie ... "It would be a letdown coming back from the afterlife to see the rest of The Projected Man. The movie could make a fortune to be sold as a sleep aid. Some of the proverbs in the movie were evil: police officer - "electricity!" Crow - "Shocking, isn't it?" police inspector - "It's OK, okay" Tom Servo "Very low, just down the floor!" Police Inspector - "Can I move on?" Tom Servo "He's Dead But Get Out" MST3K is definitely the only way to see this snoozer.
