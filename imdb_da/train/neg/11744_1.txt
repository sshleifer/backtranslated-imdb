After finally watching this movie in its entirety, I am completely mystified by the worship it has received by critics and online users. Is it the worst Western ever? No, I wouldn't say that. But "the last great American Western", a phrase I saw more than once? Not even close. <br /> <br /> A movie trying to tell a story like this requires credible signs that speak credible dialogues, and the dialogue in this movie is among the most chopped and clich√©s I've ever seen. The film can be measured in groaners per. Minute; as in how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human would say in real life? There are so many cases of this that are distracting. Cheesy lines come to you in waves; predictable, unoriginal and often. <br /> <br /> If poor dialogue doesn't bother you, then what about bad weapons fighting? Few Westerns can show you combat birds that are incredible, while desperately trying to get you to take action seriously. It is okay if there is a comical edge to such a prisoner of war as in Silverado, but in Tombstone, the very staged and very rigid choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie out of the list of good westerns. The final showdown gives something to the director on this score, but then I was so uninterested in the movie that it was without saving. <br /> <br /> Apart from the shortcomings, I can say that the pictures are amazing - movies are well shot and the settings look good. The action is acceptable, especially considering what the actors got to work with. But if you are looking for the last great American Western, do yourself a favor - just go for unforgettable. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
