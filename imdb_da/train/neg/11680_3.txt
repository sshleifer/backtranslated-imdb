This film had so much potential - a strong cast, a reasonably strong idea and clearly a decent budget. I'm not sure where everything went wrong, but each of these items was wasted. The story went nowhere, the signs were hollow to say the least, and the result was a very boring, pointless, waste of a movie. I hated it. Judging by the other voices I am in the minority here and must be a kind of freak. But I thought this movie was horrible. I had great hopes but was very disappointed. One particular disappointment was the character of Jody Foster. A very cocky "fixer" of a kind makes a good idea. Jody was safe and sexy, but the character did nothing and went nowhere. Denzel Washington played the same character he always plays - fun but not new.
