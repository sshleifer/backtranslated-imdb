Randall "Memphis" Raines is a retired master car thief who is forced back to the "game" when his younger brother faces death not to fill out an order for British criminal chief Raymond Calitri. The job involves lifting 50 cars in 24 hours, or Calitri will be punishing. So Raines quickly picks up a crewman, who can trust and set up the task at hand. But the police are on him and some of the cars on the list are not easy. It seems to be an almost impossible job to complete. <br /> <br /> It's got a huge game that has gone on for 60 seconds, Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Vinnie Jones, Giovanni Ribisi, Christopher Ecclestone, Scott Caan & Timothy Olyphant . All of them deserve better. Sufficiently functioning horsepower there to drive a Porsche 998 Turbo. The problem is that this is very much the case with too many cars that exceed the parking lot, many signs, not enough space. From the off, we have no doubt that this is a Bruckheimer / Simpson production, bonkerscript twisted with loud sounds and lashings of cheese, scattergun editing and aimed at sledges subtly by Dominic Sena. It is essentially a large budget remake of H.B. Halicki's 1974 movie with the same name, where the premise gives the potential for an adrenaline-burned car-based movie. Potential that unfortunately is never realized. There are one or two high impact moments, daft safe, but fun anyway. But if you apologize for the pun, the movie never comes out of the first gear, it is more satisfying to work with its shame of characters struggling to try to make the work of the boring manuscript {Scott Rosenberg}. <br /> <br /> Car fans will get something from it (cars are ace on the eye), like fans of accidental comedy films {check Ecclestone's caresses}. But no, it's really pretty bad everything said. 4.10
