Thanks G_d it bombarded, or we can be treated to such delights as "Skate Fu" where we can see that Brian Boitano is performing a triple lutz and frightening evil guys with his razor-sharp skates, but I go down. One thing that could have helped this turkey would have been a little T & A from Mrs Agbayani. It's not like the world would have seen anything new (at least the part of the world that saw her Playboy spread.) I really think that porn would have looked after her talents much better, though Aubrey Hepburn couldn't have been in the water in this sewer. An explanation of Kurt Thomas's presence may be a traumatic brain injury, possibly coming up short too often when dismantling. It is good that the IOC was not so diligent in "doping" as they are now, or Kurt would certainly have been cut off from his medals. Avoid at all costs.
