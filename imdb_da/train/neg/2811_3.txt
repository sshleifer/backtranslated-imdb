Will they ever make movies without nudity and sex? This happened at. 3:00 pm Sunday afternoon and I couldn't believe what they showed. Thank goodness my son was outside or I would have been freaked out if he had seen soft / medium porn! Do people who make movies do not know who they are insulting or corrupting? The kids could have looked after the church and that's what they show ??? !!! The action was good and I enjoyed the thrill but GEE! There were violence and evil guys, but one can expect in a Western movie. Randy Travis was really good at her role. If the authors, directors and producers would just stop putting so much unsolicited sex scenes. What should happen to get them to stop going in that direction? Where can I complain?
