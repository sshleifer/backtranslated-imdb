TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the United States in the 20s during the admission of DeMille's first version of the 10 bids and being rediscovered when DeMille's set sets in the desert. <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> The question is where the filmmakers are serious or funny when making this movie? If this is serious it is a scary bad movie and a good movie to choose for for its badness. If it's a comedy, it's less good, but fun for all the wrong reasons. You will laugh long and hard in this movie, probably more than many other Hollywood comedies.
