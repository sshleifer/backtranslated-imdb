This was a popular movie, probably because of humor in it, the fast-paced story, an underdog character that closes all the speakers, etc. It's fun that you probably couldn't make a movie with this title if you replaced someone but "white "as something else would be considered racist by the PC police. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Woody Harrleson is the white guy who turns out to be as good as not better than any of the black basketball players, interestingly, as is his biggest counterpart Wesley Snipes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Snipes had a lot of fun set lines that provided a lot of humor. The bad part of the movie - which does not bother many people - is the extreme profanity in it and the veil of all the characters. It includes Woody's boyfriend, played by Rosie Perez. There are not really clean, nice people in this movie. For that reason, I can't honestly recommend the movie, at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lot of enemies
