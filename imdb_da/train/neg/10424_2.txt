I should love this movie. the actor is very good, and Barbara Stanwyck is great, but the movie has always seemed very tired to me. The movie makes the working class people look low and cheap. The fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above it has always made me a little uneasy. Barbara Stanwyck as mother worships her daughter, but her daughter renounces a mother's love of finding happiness with her well-to-do fathers family. I wonder how many others have seen this movie feel like it. It was the actor who was very very good and worth seeing. I really don't like the story. just a personal preference
