Well that's the first post that ever comments on IMDb., If you get it, this movie has made me come and warn all the good souls who will stop experimenting with movies. As most of them have commented, I was thinking of watching this movie because it seemed to have some decent actors (although they had read the worst critics against this movie) I was thinking of experimenting with assuming it was some comedy girl. Well it all started well with some ahem. comedies .... so it all began to go pathetic ... man you can believe in yourself, you will feel like going and breaking your head every time the pathetic-looking woman called heroine in the movie is made helpless. ..Huh ~ ~ Well, how much can a person digest a sick all POSSESSIVE witch friendly ghost tries to do everything she can to annoy you and stop you from what you do. <br /> <br /> The next worst thing about the movie is, "ZOMBIE" Hero, yes when he loses his fiance, he walks around like a goat with black marks on his eyes. .. you bleed from head to toe if you tried and managed to completely see this movie ~!
