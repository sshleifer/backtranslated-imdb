Whatever assessment I give to BOOM, it is only because of the fantastic location photography of Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, this is only for hardcore addicts of ELIZABETH TAYLOR (her downward phase) and RICHARD BURTON (his failure phase). Tennessee Williams wrote "The milk tree doesn't stop here again" and is supposed to be very happy about this adaptation of its game - but he was apparently the only one. Taylor had reportedly hated it and Burton needed the money. No matter what it was for a prayer hen with Taylor standing and fuming in her scolding way, exploding on the servants and exchanging bad baby talk with no less than NOEL COWARD, who seems to be a visitor from another movie when he finally comes forward. <br /> <br /> It's so campy that among Taylor fans it's probably considered a "must see" kind of thing. But if you can sit through this without a drink in your hand, you are far in front of me. Unfortunately, it is the movie that meant Taylor was taken seriously as a movie actress, even after winning two Oscars. For Burton, it was just as disastrous, and the critics called it a BOMB. Judge for yourself if you dare.
