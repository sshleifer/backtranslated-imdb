This movie is complete crap! Avoid this celluloid waste at all costs, it is migratory and incoherent. I trust the plumbing depth of the 70s sleaze cinema from everything from Salo to Salon Kitty. I like being shocked, but I need a coherent story. But if you look at horses, comrades get you off, this movie is for you. The saddest part was the lame werewolf dress with the functional cheek. I think it's just hard to get through, not to mention the play is terrible, and the soundtrack is badly named. I know the cover is interesting (what looks like a gorilla's hands that reaches a woman's bare ass), but don't waste your time or money as you don't get back.
