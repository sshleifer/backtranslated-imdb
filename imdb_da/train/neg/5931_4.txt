This movie should have been only 10 minutes. I think there really is only 10 minutes worth of watchable content in this thing (I also hesitate to call it a movie). The film's opening credits were somehow promising. As the film begins with brief comments from the man himself, you really rub your hands and are set for more footage from Cohen's life. Well, Nick Cave does a fair job covering one of Coh's famous songs. The length of the cave's performance makes you even more eager to see more of Cohen, whose white and eloquent words have already petted your fancy. But as it turns out Cave's performance is just the start of long super boring performances by literally a bunch of nobody who doesn't even have a minimal attraction to keep you in your place. I mean what filmmaker really means? Five minutes close-up of will be singers in a fake concert in Australia !!! What does the filmmaker really seem to insult the audience by adding "false applause" to these endless ugly performances. The movie is a perfect torture that shows you very little of what you came to see. There is no single recording of Cohen's past. In fact, apart from a few pictures of his early days as a singer / poet, there is absolutely nothing! If you add all the minutes that Cohen talks about, it can't even reach 10 minutes. But these 10 minutes are tortuously presented bit by bit between catastrophic camera work that captures some of the most incredible people screaming Coh's texts. If you've ever decided to waste your money on this movie, don't! just throw it in the garbage and at least save time.
