Summer Holiday is the forgotten musical version of Eugene O'Neill's Ah Wilderness and deservedly so with Broadway musical adaptation of Take Me Along. With the exception of the Stanley Steamer song, none of the other Harry Warren-Ralph Blane songs is worth remembering and even one is questionable. <br /> <br /> It was just after the release of this movie that MGM let Mickey Rooney go and I don't think it was a case. The film was made in 1946 and released in 1948, so Mickey was 26 playing an Andy Hardy as a teenager. He was just too old for the 17-year-old who hit radical ideas in a spirit of youthful rebellion. <br /> <br /> Rooney made four movies for the MGM from 1946 to 1948, this one, Killer McCoy, a remake of Robert Taylor's A Crowd Roars, Love Laughs on Andy Hardy and Words and Music. In all of them, Rooney played an adult. Even in Andy Hardy movies, Mickey played an adult Andy Hardy back from World War II. Why he was in this Louis B. Mayer only knows. <br /> <br /> Rooney's poor casting makes the summer vacation worse, because in the original Ah Wilderness, emphasis is placed on the father's character played here by Walter Huston. And in the Broadway show Take Me Along, which won a Tony Award for Jackie Gleason, the Great One played the inbred brother-in-law Uncle Sid, played by Frank Morgan, and that is the central character. <br /> <br /> Gloria DeHaven enters Judy Garland when Rooney's sweet and sweet girl friend and Marilyn Maxwell play the show girl, giving Rooney an adult education. In the original game, O'Neill has her as a prostitute, but this was the Hollywood code, so all Marilyn makes her become young Rooney soused. <br /> <br /> Many really talented people have a hand in this one and they do their best, but the summer holidays fall quite quickly into a cool fall.
