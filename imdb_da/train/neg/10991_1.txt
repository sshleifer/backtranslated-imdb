My brother is an avid DVD collector. He took a look at the cover (two models in the toilets) and had to add it to his collection. I stopped him to see what turned out to be probably the most cringeable movie (I use this phrase loosely) I've felt obliged to pass through. I didn't dare make eye contact with my brother, quite sure he must have cursed the receipt in his fist. The biggest name in the entire movie is Michael Clark Duncan, who appears on a scene that the "filmmaker" decided to show each slice of (about four in total) throughout the movie. In fact, the whole movie follows almost this dress. The DVD contained erased recordings was a shock. (I went to bed without seeing it though). To no surprise, I found this disk without its case behind the TV in a week later.
