They constructed this as a kind of fantasy man From Snowy River meets Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and just for a romantic touch, Ned and Joe can play with high class talent, the boring young wives of wealthy older men. OK, there are many myths about Ned Kelly, but there are also many well-documented facts that still provide room for artistic creativity to produce a good historical dramatization. I mean, this is not the Robin Hood story, not the Arturian legends, not Beowulf, not anyone whose life is so shrouded for many centuries of fog that any restoration of their lives and times is 99% guesswork. It's just a few lifetimes ago. My own grandparents were already in school age when Ned was hanged. <br /> <br /> So, it is silly for me imaginative to imagine this movie was a serious attempt to tell the Kelly story. Having read Peter Carey's excellent novel "The True History of the Kelly Gang", I had eagerly anticipated that this would be in similar vein. But no, the fact is that Mick Jagger is very foolish in 1970 Kelly was probably far closer to reality and a better movie overall, which doesn't say much about it. Glad it only cost me two bucks to hire the DVD! I give it 3/10, and that's just because some of the beautiful shots from the Australian bush make me feel generous.
