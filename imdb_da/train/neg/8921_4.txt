The pastor of an African-American woman Scrooge in the modern fighting city was inspired, but nothing else in this movie is. Here, Mrs Scrooge is a miserable banker who exploits the employees and customers in the largely poor and black neighborhood in which it is located. There is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved. Part of the problem is that history's roots do not exceed the urban setting of this movie, and the script fails to do the update work. Also, the constant message of sharing and giving is repeated so infinitely, the audience gets tired of it well before the film reaches its familiar end. This is a message movie that does not know when to end. In the title role, the talented Cicely Tyson gives too much performance, and sometimes lines are difficult to understand. Charles Dickens novel has been adapted so many times, it is a struggle to adapt it in a way that makes it fresh and relevant, despite its highly relevant message.
