This is one of the worst movies I've seen recently. When a man says he wants him to have a superpower to be able to verbally enjoy, I am pretty much thinking that the film is in the wealth of childish 14-year-old male fantasies. The bed room scene was over the top and reduced an intimate moment into a farce of biological functions akin to passing gas in public. From the first every second scene was a discussion of how little sex they were getting, how long ago it was when they got something when their next sexual relationship would be and who it was going to be with. On top of that, the dialogue and action were very poor and very forced, not felt, and they filled their lack of content with blurry sex scenes. This could have been really fun because the concept is actually interesting, but it is poorly executed here. Please consider not taking anyone under 16 if you need to go see it.
