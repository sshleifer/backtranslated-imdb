During the first 20 minutes, each cliché was possible by the hack author and the director. There was NTSB's primary investigator with the tortured family life; the politically tortured NTSB board member played by [I Can Kill Any TV] Ted McGinley; the tortured father of an accident victim; and the tortured, stupid ambulance-hunting lawyer. <br /> <br /> Hollywood still does not have a concept of aircraft fragility. The crashed aircraft was a 737, and it was mostly on the ground like a hippo that decided to take a nap. The first third of the hull was intact, the rear half of the aircraft was intact, and the waste area showed no wings or engines. Most of the people should have gone away in the light of how many people survived the plane that was shaken in Iowa after it had lost its hydraulics. Most of this television plan was not even burned. It reminded me of the scene in "Air Force One" where 747 hits the water and then jumps together as it is made of empty thick steel. <br /> <br /> The show was so bad it was impossible to see. Even my wife, who accepts more than I, commented on technical errors. What had stunned me was how this POS could ever be made. Are the producers of these things so accustomed to clichés that they can't even recognize them? Someone reads this script and said: Yes, I want to spend a million bucks making this a reality. I wish I was the guy's next deal. I have a wonderful bridge title in New York that I would sell cheaply.
