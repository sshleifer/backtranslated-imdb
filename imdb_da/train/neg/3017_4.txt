Now I had the best intentions when I looked at this. I like some of Tony Scott's work, and a friend of mine told me it was a good movie, even though I heard from other people. But it was simply hopeless. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, Tony Scott was trying too hard. It was way too much. Allow me to elaborate. <br /> <br /> Miss Knightley was overactive and not in a good way. The people who did well were Mickey Rourke, Edgar Ramirez and Christopher Walken, but their screen time just couldn't save the movie. <br /> <br /> There were a couple of scenes that jumped out in their originality, but somehow they felt like they were written by someone other than the lead author. A particular tune was used about 4 times, which really started to fail after the second time. I am firmly convinced not to use the same melody more than once. <br /> <br /> The editing also really went on this, as the cutting speed is quite high. Oh, and the repeated echo of some of the Keiris lines simply sounded cheesy after hearing it for the second, third and fourth times, etc. <br /> <br /> Basically, my opinion is that if you want to see an action flick, there is high tempo and "something" fun, and you don't care about everything i mentioned above, you might like it. <br /> <br /> (On a side note: I'm not a Keira Knightley fan.)
