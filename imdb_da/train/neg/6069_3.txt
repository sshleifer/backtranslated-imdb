It never ceases to amaze me how you can take an excellent actor and put him into play in a movie like this. Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars all the time, but he himself could not save this movie. In fact, his character is much the same as the one he played in Cape Fear, which was actually pretty good, but I can't hold it when actors make the same move over more than one movie. I think it's getting old, and that's the case here. <br /> <br /> There is nothing surprising in this movie, but history has been told a million times before. Wesley Snipes is your typical baseball player, and his image appears in his characterization. De Niro plays the obsessed fan, but his role in this movie is less than entertaining. <br /> <br /> But because you Niro is in this movie, it's a tie if you're a fan who sees everything he does, no matter how bad. But to see De Niro in his best, see "Midnight Run", "Goodfellas" or "Cop Land", or even go far back and check out "Taxi Driver" or "Godfather II". Don't waste your time with this drive. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3/10
