Frank Sinatra was far from the ideal actress for westerns. He was a great actor, from here to eternity, and the man with the golden arm is proof of that, but he didn't have a Western hero's body, you identified him as an urban guy. But he tried to do his job well in Johnny Concho. It was not his fault that the film was a mistake at the cashier's office. I blame it on two factors: a) the story was too unusual, especially in the fact that Sinatra behaves more like a villain than as a hero in the film. In a genre where people kind of expected a particular pattern to break away from it, the film must be very good. b) The story is not convincing, it is hard to believe that a whole city will allow Sinatra to do everything he wants just because they are afraid of his brother. Also, when a man shows him a special holster that opens sideways so he can't draw the gun, you wonder if that makes him invincible, why hasn't all the guns adopted it? I think this movie should not have been withdrawn because any movie with Sinatra is worth watching, and despite the shortcomings it is still fun
