When you have a disembodied skull, throw an empty mansion, a schizophrenic wife, a scheming cad and a nutzo gardener into a minister and his wife - what do you have? <br /> <br /> AIP's response to insomnia. </ br /> <br /> "The Screaming Skull" gets daring points and offers free caps to anyone who dies of scare from watching the movie. Exactly safe bet when you lull into a stupor of people who think they are in a production of "Suspense for Dummies". <br /> <br /> But Peggy Webber was a sweet one anyway. She had a couple of good moments shopping here and there (especially when trying to communicate with the gardener), and no one else fills a nightgown like her. But the frightened face she does - scary in itself. Whoa. As a whole, however, there is little excitement here, and everything is telegraphed as a blow thrown by a mime. You can't be afraid of this movie, it's impossible. It has its moments, but not enough of them. <br /> <br /> But thanks to a particular Mike Nelson and his two robot pals, there are several moments of pure joy, especially in the copy they got ("The movie jumped and it was really scary!"). One star for "The Screaming Skull", eight and a half for the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Talk about a "screaming" bar ....
