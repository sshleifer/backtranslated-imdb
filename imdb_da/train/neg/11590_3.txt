It gets worse, the series is on a serious fallout. The first two successors were acceptable, and since then we have seen a buch of really, really horrible movies. Robert Englund gives another great achievement as Freddy, but the rest of the player cannot act. The story is Alice, after surviving the previous part of the nightmare series, finds the deadly dreams of Freddy Krueger starting again. This time, the scary killer is striking through Alice's unborn child's sleeping mind. His intention is to be "born again" in the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice release her spirit in time to save her own son? Check out the first three, miss the next three and then see the last one.
