Believe it or not, I have my own DVD copy of this "movie" that I bought from Walgreens for a big big dollar. I'm still not sure if it was a dollar spent or a dollar badly wasted. <br /> <br /> Beautiful amazing set of designs and costumes. Apparently, much thought and effort went into their presentation. The set designs are very Mexican in stylization. I liked them very much. And Santa is impressive. One of the more impressive Santas in moviedom. I guess the original intention and purpose of this movie was to be something uplifting and cheerful for a children's audience. But somehow it comes across quite horrified. In fact, I'm back stunned at how worried it is. Maybe it's the English dubbing that makes it seem so scary and bizarre. One of the reasons I prefer to experience movies in the original language, they were made, and the use of English subtitles as duplicates often gives an unintentional oddity. The children's voices were at least called with actual children's voices as opposed to women pretending to be children who tend to sound very, very strange. Did you know that demons in hell spend their free time and dance around the ball in their longjohns? No you did not? I didn't even do until I saw this movie. You learn something new every day. <br /> <br /> Is this movie worth seeing? Now it's a tossup. I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone, as it is rather disturbing in its own bizarre way. Yet its unintentional bizarreness is what makes it worth seeing. You decide what to do. I dunno ... for myself it made me uncomfortable to see demons constantly making cutesy ballet movements. Now it's just wrong ...
