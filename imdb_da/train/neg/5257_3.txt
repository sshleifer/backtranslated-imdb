For a "horror" movie made for television, the movie started out very interesting. I was really fascinated by the story and the mystery of the movie. But the end was a total disappointment. The film went fast and built up, but it looked like a very climatic end. But guess what is no end. The movie is just over and after almost an hour and a half, the audience is just wondering what happened. Why were all unanswered questions in the film unanswered. There was no explanation at all for some of the key points in the plot. This movie is like watching a murder mystery and then never finding out who did it. Very dissappointed. This movie looks like the producers just run out of money and have never finished the movie. A real BOMB!
