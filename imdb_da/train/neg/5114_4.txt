This movie was bad. Poor acting, poor conducting, poor writing. But it wasn't bad in a fun way. It was bad in a boring way. I saw "Surface to Air" because I thought it might be a laugh. It wasn't. Don't make the mistake I did. There are plenty of fun ways to spend an hour and a half, for example, to see paint dry or read the dictionary. Seriously.
