I just finished "Dark Chamber" aka "Under Surveillance" and I'm stunned. Stunned, not by the movie, but by some of the rave reviews I perused that affected my seeing it. The story was so devastated by plot holes, and the majority of it so flat appears, categorizing it as a comedy, seems appropriate. Seriously, I found myself shaking my head and laughing at confusion as I endured this movie. Justin leaves the borders of living at home with a pain-reliant mother to live with her copfather despite mother's warnings that Dad is not good. When a young woman is found murdered, Justin becomes suspicious of the tenants living in the adjacent apartments. Using a few friends, he introduces hidden cameras to keep tabs on these people. As the truth begins to rave up, Justin discovers an unexpected secret. <br /> <br /> A positive point is that Felissa Rose is HOT! I would have generously knocked an extra star or two in here she had peeled a little but not so lucky. It would have been the film's potential saving grace. Eric Conley played Justin very skillfully, I thought, and I would not be surprised at all to see more of him in the future. <br /> <br /> The general premise of the movie, although plagued by clich√©s, might have worked, had it not been for the ridiculously hollow "performances" of the main cast members, especially Alexandra Eitel (Kayla) and David H Rigg (Justin's father). Fears! (excuse the pun). <br /> <br /> I have nothing against low budget film. Indeed, I think independent films are our only hope for decent filmmaking in the coming days. I want to cut the low budget movies a bit limp when it comes to special effects, lighting, even musical scores and the overall picture quality. However, I do not provide allowances for stick figures and a Swiss cheese maker's script. There are a large number of competent low-cost films out there. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. I can't help but suspect that at least some of the reviewers who have praised "Dark Chamber" here are somehow associated with their production.
