Unfortunate, boring and incoherent supernatural "thriller" in which college student Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) is the constant victim of hallucinations and nightmares after a car accident claims the life of his boyfriend Sean (Casey Affleck). <br /> <br /> I can't start telling you how bad this is ... Nothing of any significance ever happens and there's no real entertainment value either. I did not like this cast in this movie - they are all unfortunately unconvincing (so again their roles are not good). Promoting this as a horror movie is a joke. Where are the scares? There is no sense or excitement - there are some good songs, but it's about it. <br /> <br /> How on earth did this project get the green light? Writer Director Steve Carpenter has no visible vision or talent that I can feel. Worst of all, the conclusion really makes the whole movie meaningless. <br /> <br /> The alleged "killer cut", which I looked at, is 86 minutes pure tedium. <br /> <br /> 1/10
