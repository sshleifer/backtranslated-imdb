Many people say here that this show is only for children. Hm, when I was a child (about 7-9 years old) I first saw this show. It was disgusting to me. I talked to other kids about this and probably other shows and know what? This was the disguise of the action when we wanted to emphasize some silliness (either on TV or something else), we said "Uh, like Power Rangers" and laughed. <br /> <br /> And before I visited this site, I couldn't imagine that there are actually MMPR fans. It was so strange to me that I decided to see it again and try to understand why people like it. I didn't enjoy that view. But it started on me: Maybe I don't have enough imagination? It could be. But this argument is not enough for me to judge it more than 1 star.
