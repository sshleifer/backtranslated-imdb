Hollywood does it again. Lots of money, no creativity. I'm sure the authors were on something other than oxygen when they wrote this. Based on the previews, I thought this would be a fun movie. But if you're not up to the latest stupid pop culture then you lose most of the stupid humor in this movie. Why waste your time. You can sit on a log that does nothing and has more fun than this movie will give. <br /> <br />
