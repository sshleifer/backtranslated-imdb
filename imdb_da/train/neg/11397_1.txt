This was really awful! It had a terrible story, was badly acted and was like an amateur recording of evil dead, but not so good. It took me all the rest to do it through this, it's a good job I didn't need to visit the toilet otherwise I doubt I would have come back! This makes Hammer House of Horror look like a big screen Hollywood epic. <br /> <br /> The only value for this movie was the endless supply of beautiful women. Not a bad one among them! <br /> <br /> If you want to salmon with your friends after an evening of beer then this is for you ... otherwise avoid it like the plague!
