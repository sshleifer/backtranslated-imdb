Unfortunately, one of the best efforts yet to be made in special effects has been rendered completely useless by being placed with a rumbling, silly and equally meaningless plot and an insufficient cliché of plays. Hollow Man is a pretty useless movie. Virtually everything here has been done to death - the characters, the idea and the action sequences (especially the lifting axle!) - with the only real exciting element in the movie are the impressive special effects. But it is just the same special effect that is done over and over again, and at the end of the movie that has been made to death as well. I hoped, before I looked at Hollow Man, that the theme of the invisible man, who is hardly original in itself, would be the basis of something newer and more interesting. It's not like that. It is not long before the film becomes an overly familiar bloodbath and lots of ineffective histrionics - the cliché pile picks up so fast that it is almost impressive. <br /> <br /> On top of all this, Kevin Bacon does a pretty useless job and his support box almost doesn't try their best. Good points can be an acceptable Jerry Goldsmith score (but no competition for his better bet), a quite interesting use of thermal images and special effects. I was tempted to give this movie three out of ten, but the effects push Hollow Man's profits up. <br /> <br /> 4/10
