I can only believe that Garson Rabbit must have been two people. The one who wrote the brilliant "A Double Life" and the fun "Born Yesterday" and wrote together such excellent screenshots as "Adam's Rib" and "Pat And Mike" with his wife Ruth Gordon and saw the one who wrote and / or corrected Such a boring, sad drive like "Bachelor Mother", "Some Kind Of A Nut", and this. Castet tries, but the manuscript is so tired and clich√©d that even the effort of the always wonderful Brenda Vaccaro is defeated. The script drops until it is nadir in the really offensive order, where Janssen's character test drives Driva's character to make sure he's not gay. An ugly order, but unfortunately one that could easily play in a movie today. "Ethnic" jokes are now completely banished, but "subject" jokes are still "good, clean, family fun".
