I'm sure this was one of those "WOAH!" attractions in 1982 when Epcot opened, but now it's just silly. The film's message is clich√©. The circle vision is disorienting. And the horrible song at the end is lattice. And I really want them to install seats. After so much walking, all you want to do is sit for a few minutes. And when you hear, there's a movie to see it sounds pretty glamorous! You're being entertained while you sit down, aren't you? WRONG! You stand there for 18+ minutes, leaning against a short little railing. Disney should make a newer Maelstrom an attraction to experience things and replace this dull, darkest movie. NOT FUNNY. Skip it over. In fact, Canada skips completely unless you eat there. Move directly to the UK.
