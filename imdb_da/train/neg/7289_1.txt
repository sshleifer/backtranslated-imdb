This is a movie with huge appeal to a fairly well-defined group (which I am not a part of). I went to a preview of this movie without knowing what to expect - I finally found it disappointing. The story of a terribly dysfunctional (often narrow "twisted") Hungarian Jewish family is not my cup of tea. An epic tale like this should really give its viewers something more in the end. Ultimately, images like this are about human condition - this image hardly casts any new light on any of its more meaningful facets.
