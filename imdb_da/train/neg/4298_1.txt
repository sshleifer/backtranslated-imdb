Incredibly muddled, off-putting and ultimately ridiculous ("the horses, oh my good, the horses!") Thriller. It's scary at times, but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror movie. See how in the last 10 minutes everyone "magically" does exactly what the plot needs for the "resolution" to occur. Among the performances of the leaders, a typical eccentric of Richard Lynch. The video transfer is a real hack job, cuts scenes in half and makes the movie even more difficult to understand. 0 out of 4 stars.
