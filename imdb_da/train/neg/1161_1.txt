As a member of the player, I was a member of the band on all the basketball players, I would like to let the world know in the movie that we were not allowed to watch it when it was banned in Oregon. This was due to the manufacturers and the director who beat the contract with the University of Oregon where it was shot. Seems that U of O characters was displayed. As we shoot, we were allowed to eat several meals with cast and production staff. Sir. Nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the worst men I have ever met. All the time for a young 20 year old. Not exactly what campus life really was in the late 60s and early 70s despite what Hollywood might think. Trombone player from Oregon
