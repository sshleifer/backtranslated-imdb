As with most of Ben Affleck's films, the comedy is dry and the story is predictable. That's if you want to call this a story. Many points were left with no thoughts at all. I would like to thank the director for not explaining the points better. I say that because it would mean that the torture would have lasted longer. As for any of Ben Affleck's errors, this is no exception and can only be survived by the other actors. Even then, the play was mostly constructed and was not credible. The ride down the memory track with actors I haven't seen this year was not worth the admission fee. Everyone thought it should be told that they also quickly entered the line of "has-been". My choice was to wait for my car to be fixed or watch this movie. I made the wrong decision. All in all, I'd give it a laugh ... mainly because that's all I got out of it.
