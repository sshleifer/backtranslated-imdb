for a long time I look forward to watching this movie, here in Latin America Japanese or any oriental films have no distribution in theaters, we can find some of these films in some underground stores, and I just found Avalon, I expected something good but the only good thing in this movie is the first scene, the rest of the movie is boring and pointless, just stupid, with many useless scenes and a dull story. I'm wasting my time even writing about this movie. Sorry, but is the truth.
