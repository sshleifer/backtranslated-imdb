I remember watching this movie long ago on TV. I remember the premise that the film is about a bunch of hotel residents who are being attacked by the man who eats ants. What I didn't remember was how much it was !!! <br /> <br /> I recently caught this movie on television late at night. I'm sure it must have been a mistake because movies like this usually disappear from existence and will never be found again! Suzanne Somers (on top of her career playing Chrissy at 'Three's Company') plays a vacationer at Lakewood Manor. Building workers install a swimming pool outside and disturb the monster ants. Or should I say, a * MAN-LOVING ANOTHER NEST * !! One of the workers is actually attacked by the ants. One minute he chooses them from his clothes one by one, the next minute he is covered by them. The next scene shows a skeleton in the dirt. <br /> <br /> If you thought it was quite removed, you should see Myrna Loy playing a wheelchair-bound resident who is flying out of the manor by helicopter! I could almost picture her thinking in relief that she was flying out of the movie! The final scenes depict Suzanne, Robert Foxworth and a third guy sitting on the floor of a hotel room with his back to each other, blowing through the straw and covered with ants. It's basically the movie. There is really no "disaster" appeal or "big-star" draw for the movie. It was supposed to be a "large-scale" television event at that time. Now it is lucky if it gets dumped at 4:00 am at your local TV station. <br /> <br /> To catch Suzanne Somers at its best, watch an episode of Three's Company. If you want to see Myrna Loy do something to put bread on the table and pay the bills then watch this movie. <br /> <br /> 0/10
