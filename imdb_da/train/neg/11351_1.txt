With the massive advertising, this comes at Nickelodeon and Nick Jr., and that's what my son is bugging us to see. Between the DVDs and the theaters I have seen almost everything from now on the excellent (Incredibles, Shrek) to the really bad (Wall-E, Brother Bear). But this was easily the worst movie I've ever seen, children or no kids. It was a "when the stupid thing is going to end?" kind of experience? Okay, it's aimed at toddlers (or it's better - it's offensive to intelligence in everyone over 3), but I've never seen anything so predictable, repetitive, and slow. So when you're finally daring, but relieved that the movie is over, it's this bizarre thing at the end that you think is the setup for a joke, but there isn't one - it's serious, even though it's hard to tell what they are trying to do. The 3-D effects ... yes, if you've never seen a Viewmaster, they're a big deal, otherwise no (if you look at the screen without glasses, it looks like the same process). Even my son was upset at the end. Both my wife and I looked at each other and said "wow" at the end. Bad in every respect.
