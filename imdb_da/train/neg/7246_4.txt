Gwyneth Paltrow is absolutely fantastic in this movie, but the story is unfortunately half-baked, and David Schwimmer's energy is like cold mush. When he closes his mouth and becomes serious for a moment or two, there is a hurry about what can be. Who thought 25-year-old kiddies would be entertaining?
