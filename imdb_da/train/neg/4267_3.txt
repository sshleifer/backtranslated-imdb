I watched this movie at the Rotterdam Festival, which presumably all the other voters. The director was present and seemed to have worked very hard and be very involved in the project, which I think explains the above average reception and marks it. It is most similar to an episode of Aussie kids' favorite "Round the Twist", but it takes itself seriously to have the redeeming function. The film itself may be worth seeing if you are trying to make a biographical world tour that visits all UN member states as I cannot think of another Fijian movie, but in general it was generic, badly acted (albeit by an amateur cast) and switch to the subaltern mentality. The morality of history seemed to be that the indigenous islanders would try to screw each other, but as long as there is a mainly decent white governor to step in, all the problems can be solved (by leaving the island).
