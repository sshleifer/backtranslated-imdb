With the name Pinter, each knee should bend - especially after his Nobel Literature Prize-acceptance speech, which did little more than regain canned, by-the-numbers, sixth form anti-Americanism. But it's even worse; It is not only a talent for talentlessness, an excellent example of how to get away with your decades-old reputation, but it also represents the slaughterhouse of a fantastic piece. The original Sleuth was a masterpiece of its kind. Yes, it was a theatrical confection, and it is easy to see how it is central plot device would work better on stage than the screen, but it still worked well. This is a Michael Caine vanity piece, but let's see, Caine is no Olivier. Not only can he not fill Larry's shoes, he couldn't even fill his bathrobes. The appropriately named Caine is, after all, a clear average actor whose only real recommendation, as so many British actors, is their lifetime in the industry. He was a good Harry Palmer, excellent in Get Carter, but that's a lot, buddy! Give this a very wide berth and stick to the amazing original. This is more than half a pinter.
