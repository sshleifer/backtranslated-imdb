This is a film about how men think women think of love. No woman describes an ethnic sexual encounter and declares it a love story. <br /> <br /> Of the ten monologues I felt, only three really had any kind of truth calling through them. I was waiting to make the movie better, and it did a bit, but never better enough. This is an interesting concept, and I continued to feel good, but I never succeeded. Maybe if they were actually loving stories, it would have worked.
