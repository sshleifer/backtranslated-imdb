This is a depressingly low, naive and most eerie look at a wildly unlikely relationship between Brooks' psychotic movie editor and Harold, his wet girlfriend. The two have zero chemistry together - primarily because Harold is unable to do anything beyond looking good at this stage of his career; but also because Brooks' character is neither interesting nor sympathetic. There are 15 static, outrageous minutes in the beginning, when Brooks has just broken up with Harold, stumbling on his apartment in a depressed, drawn-out state - unbearable. Sappily and imaginatively posted by Joe Cocker's "You're So Beautiful", there is simply not enough material here for a feature film. There is virtually nothing on the perimeter of their relationship to indicate that these people exist in a real world. I am sure Brooks intended to shine a white hot spotlight on the affair and somehow deconstruct it; But if you do, the writing and play must be far better than what it is here.
