Feeding the Masses is just one of many recent mediocre zombie movies that are after your hard earned dollars. Suggestions? Keep your hard earned dollars and let's just say good old TheatreX took one to the team on this one. Guess what the plots are about? Zombies take over. This time, this film production takes place to maintain the original (?) In Rhode Island, and to be honest I am not sure I have ever seen a zombie flick based on Rhode Island. A government-controlled TV station apparently has to stop "normal" broadcasts so that all remaining citizens do not think there is a problem in the world, that is, those who never see or go outside, anyway . However, I would say that some of the commercials broadcast by this station were probably the most entertaining part of this movie. There is actually a story for this, but I don't bother with it, because for a while you won't break or fall asleep. In any case, this has lots of horrible action to throw on top of all the "seen before" things that are pulled out before the camera. Believe in you, you can find lots of other things to do with your time than to see this. 3 out of 10
