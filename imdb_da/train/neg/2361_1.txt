This movie is easily the worst of the series. Although New Line might just look at the sale, they all know only the only reason why one made more money than the one that was due to the 3D ending. It was not that 3-D was not good either because it was 50's 3D with the red and blue lenses (anaglyph.) It was just the fact that people wanted to see how it would look. Apart from that, this movie was so poorly finished! Bad script, bad character, bad acting, worse director. This movie is trying to push the camp factor almost to the point of being like a "Looney Tunes" episode. <br /> <br /> Seriously, not for the horror crowd, because it is corny and not scary, and not fun or fun for comedy crowds. Just a total mess with some really bad comos who are still trying to play this whole camp and live by falling far from what they probably wanted. <br /> <br /> I remember most of us who had been fans of this series just prayed that it would end at this time because of how bad it had been. This is one of the movies that helped to get rid of horror and drive a bit of faith that the audience really wanted to laugh at something stupid comedy than watching a good and scary horror movie.
