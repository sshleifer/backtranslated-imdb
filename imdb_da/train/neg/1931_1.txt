I went to see this with great anticipation. Unfortunately, the dialogue is completely stupid and generally the film is far from inspiring awe or interest. Even a child can see the lack of logic to the character's behavior. Today's children need creative stories that would inspire them, which would make them 'daydreaming' about the events. That's exactly what happened to movies like E.T. and Star Wars ten years ago. (How many kids imagined becoming Jedi Knights and turning on their own lightsabers?) Never waste your time and money on this.
