Oh, a guard once famous actress in a movie where she plays a mother of a child. It is shown on BBC 1 at midnight and I wonder if ... it's a TVM <br /> <br /> You have to give it to TVM producers, nothing to do with a mediocre movie , they usually give us two mediocre movies, where two themes are mixed together and NUHED TO HIDE is no different.

And she is a TVM and she replies that the reason is "That people change" rather than saying something like "I'm really relaxing" or your father's cruises while public toilets for sex "happening in spouse divorce cases. It is young Sam, I'm sorry, not only are his parents divorced, but he is as thick as two short planks. In fact, since he is so stupid, he deserves no sympathy because he is not aware that one man flushing things down the toilet is a drug dealer, unaware that you might die if someone shoots at you and ignores that I love LUCY, is painfully unfunny. If only our own childhoods were so innocent, ah and Orwell said "Ignorance is Strength "Sam is suddenly an expert on marine life! Is this character development or poor scripting? I know what a my money is on. And strangely, the Sam boy genuis has not noticed that if the story is set in 1994, why why people often use clothes, drive cars and drive trains from 1 950s But as it turns out during a plot twist it is the mother's dummy. Then there is a last plot twist that left me as an idiot to see this
