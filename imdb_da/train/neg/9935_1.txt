It completely defeats me why Godard is taken so seriously - and One Plus One is a good example of his unwieldy as both a filmmaker and an "intellectual" policeman. It's hard to credit Godard actually believed in the Marxist and Maoist edge. Anyone with half a brain could solve the bankruptcy of these 'isms' and how many people they had destroyed and continued to destroy, even though Gudard made his films supporting them. As the filmmaker asks you: Do you want boring voice headlines that read boring political diatribes on your audience, and then, since you couldn't think of anything else to do, create another voice-over for the first voice-over, which had at least lost his listeners after the first 100 words? Brilliant, Jean-Luc! As for Gudard, insists on making a movie with the Rolling Stones: of course he did it; would you not? It was the only guarantee to get such a mindless waste seen in the first place: Stone's genius darkens a talented and babblende political idiot who is loose with a camera. The bookshop scene was not worth even the worst gambling theater and was an insult to the intelligence of even the young children used to playing it - as it could easily be seen. Cutting-out by allowing friendly critics to claim that all this artificial crap was a satire on regular film production is no more than a safe place to offer those who clearly see Godard's poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his audience. Ironic, that Godard's once good friend, Truffaut, with Nuit Americain, made the best movie about film making ever, and Godard did the worst with Le Mepris! Godard did not choose Stone's trace of sympathy with the devil. It just happened to be the track they were working on when the "movie" started shooting at Barnes Olympic Studios.
