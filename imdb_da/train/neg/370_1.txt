Blank Check is easily one of the worst films in the nineties. The reason is completely meaningless; its overtones of loneliness are pathetic. Do you really think that a twelve year old acting as a personal assistant to a millionaire could achieve everything in this movie, like buying a mansion for just $ 300 grand. The notion, let alone the bargain basement price, will only be believed by the most gracious viewers. Please respect your intelligence and not see this horrible, horrible movie.
