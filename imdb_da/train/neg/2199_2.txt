I caught "Sorrows Lost" at the New York Film and Video Festival, and I think I had some great hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, this is just another Visual FX calling card. The story is pretty boring. The poor lighting and camera work along with the less than great editing and music all make the movie seem low quality. Is it really too much to ask that FX shorts have better stories and have the rest of The technical production is on par with FX! You can't just get away with cool FX in shorts anymore, it's been 5 years since "405" made a big splash. At least the short fast, cool and even a little fun! None of it can be said of "Sorrows lost."
