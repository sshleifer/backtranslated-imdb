I read somewhere when Kay Francis refused to take a fall in wages, claimed Warner Bros. by throwing her in subordinate projects for the rest of the contract. <br /> <br /> She decided to take the money. But her career suffered accordingly. <br /> <br /> It could explain what she did in "Comet Over Broadway." (Although it doesn't explain why Donald Crisp and Ian Hunter are in it too.) "Ludicrous" is the word that others have used for the plot of this movie, and that's right on the target. Attempted murder. Her seedy vaudeville career. Her success in London. Her last scene with her daughter. No part logically leads to the next part. <br /> <br /> The sets and costumes also looked like B-movie stuff. And her hair! Turner shows many and many of her films this month. See someone else and you will do yourself a favor.
