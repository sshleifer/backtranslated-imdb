The story is very trustworthy and powerful. The technical side of the film is pretty fine .. even managing it. The main problem is with castings that made the film almost another local and regular clich√© with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impressions. Besides the small role of the father, Rafael (played impressively by Asi Dayan), all other actors were unfortunately not at their best. The role of the older blind girl who played by Taly Sharon was fresh, but without intensity as a leading role. Therefore, the figure she acted to become mild and low profile. There were moments and episodes that looked more like an exercise, so a real movie. But after all, it's a good point to start off and make great improvements in the future.
