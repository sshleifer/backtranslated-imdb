I went into this movie and hoped for the best. I like wartime music in general. Dick Powell and Lucille Ball did good jobs with their roles; But the authors gave them a boring dialogue. The love interest between the two was not given any real growth; Suddenly it was there. I didn't think much about the music; The best figure was the piece we heard about Spike Jones with "There Fuhrer's Face." The one complete song that Spike Jones did was a bit of his great musical comedy; rather tame things, even with the monkey. Bert Lahr's comedy sketches were endless. <br /> <br /> There were parts to enjoy: Lucille Ball was a look and there was a good selection of bit players who really deserved more time on the screen.
