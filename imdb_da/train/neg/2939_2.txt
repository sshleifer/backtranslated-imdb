As others have said, "No, Luciano" is a more appropriate title or answer to this movie title. For entertainment, the great opera singer must keep singing ..... not that he is a terrible actor. It's just that this movie stinks. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes were fine - a nice family movie, as it was - but after that, it's just a boring soap opera. <br /> <br /> Appropriate to play a singer, Pavarotti, like "Giorgio Fini," loses his voice a few times, and the doctor "Pamela Taylor" (Kathryn Harrold) comes to the rescue. The singer then falls to the doctor, the doctor slowly drops to the singer, the two are constantly arguing and continuing. Pavarotti has a winning smile and is a nice guy. It's Harrold who destroys things and after seeing her here, I'm not surprised she didn't become a star. <br /> <br /> There is great scenery in the movie to enjoy, good pictures of San Francisco and Italy, at least in the first half of the movie. I'm bored and don't remember much about the second half of it.
