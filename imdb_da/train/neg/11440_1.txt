Otherwise, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen - and I mean ever. My wife and I were both bored out of our minds within 10 minutes. Not to mention being boring, it is absolutely incredible. Women (non-lesbians) did not swim together - nor did they "throw" accidentally. Brothers and sisters do not live well together in the 30s and run around swinging dancing together and engaging in footsteps in the central park. Men do not find that their wife and sister romantic kissed the night before the wedding and then never discuss it with wife. Absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham may be the worst actress in film today. She smiles when she is to cry and vice versa. The only movie she's ever been good at is Boogie Nights - and that's because she didn't act. <br /> <br /> I can't stress enough how bad this movie was.
