I couldn't believe I spent $ 14.00 on this. The only redeeming quality is the monstrous thing. The headline was worse than anyone I've ever experienced. It seems that it was shot with a VHS camcorder. I think every pfennig was used on the special effects because there was a lot of blood and body parts everywhere. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but I have to acknowledge the abundant gore that wasn't as disgusting as it could have been because the whole movie is so stupid and incredible
