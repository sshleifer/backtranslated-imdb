Bridges of Madison County is a better made version of this story. I felt that the end of this movie wasn't handled sensitively as they did in the original English movie. This movie is very indianized, if you are a very sensitive person crying in a movie when completely die in the end, you will love this movie. On the other hand, if you are a struggle in life and think that crying is for wimps, you may not be like the end. But on the whole it is pretty good, the subject is handled well by Indian conditions. Tabu was good as a caring wife and mother. All acted well.
