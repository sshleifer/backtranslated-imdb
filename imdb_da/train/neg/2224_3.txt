I saw the first thing when I was about 7. I remembered what I thought to be a vague sketch of what took place. Turns out 15 years later that I remembered everything with great accuracy, because it seems that the authors never came out of making an overview of the story. There is no plot for this movie / cartoon. There is no sign development, no back story, no character arches, nothing. The good people do things because they are good, while the evil ones do things only because they are bad. An unintentional hilarious part is when a person you think is important dies and no one cares least. They just push their shoulders and continue. There is hardly any dialogue either. If you cut the battle sequences and the running scenes you lose 70% of the movie. <br /> <br /> Look at this because you will see some good animations and no other reason. Or if you like to look at gently sticky hot cartoon chicks (or lightly dressed hot cartoon dudes).
