There is plenty to appreciate here: spectacular places and flying sequences; period costumes, props and sets; and competent writing and action. But in order to enjoy a drama, we need at least one principal that shows some qualities that we like or admire. In this bunch of catty snobs, we found only one sign that is at all sympathetic ?? an effortlessly mocked man in a fleeting peripheral role as their helpless victim. From reviews here it is clear that we are completely out of step, but we did not find their malicious schoolgirls entertaining or entertaining. Even the dog is disgusting. We threw in the towel after two of the six episodes, so you should discount these observations accordingly, but what I could find written about this mini-series gave us no reason to expect character conversion or redemption.
