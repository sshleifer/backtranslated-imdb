It is difficult to precisely put words into the glorious fate of this movie. A brand new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of something that is even remotely recognizable as "humor" or even "entertainment" in "Rabbit Test". So as a small contribution to this future effort, I would like to suggest this word: <br /> <br /> "Hubiriffic" (adj.) A combination of 'hubristic' and 'terrific'; used to describe excessively ambitious debacles as the movie "Rabbit Test." <br /> <br /> Joan Rivers and "Hollywood Squares" producer Jay Redack have seriously overcome their poor ability to entertain in this 82-minute festival of misery. Trying to put together a plane! style comedy with a musty collection of gags, (note Joan: German doctors have not been fun since Vaudeville) disinterred from their tombs in the Catskills - that's bad enough. But compressing this biographical crime is River's direct-oriented style, which can best be described as "ugly", and a cast of one-and-future has prayers, so eager to please they even override even the weakest return gags. <br /> <Adrift in this Sargasso Sea of ​​SAP is a rude Billy Crystal in his film debut role as the movie's outrageous protagonist Lionel. Seeing Crystal in this picture is much like watching a blind person take a walk in a minefield; Eventually, the cringe reflex becomes a semi-permanent state as a cheap joke, after a cheap joke blows in his face. <br /> <br /> I can only speculate on the kind of audience that might like rabbit testing. Cabbage, molluscs and mildly inhibited lizards are likely candidates. But for self-conscious, thinking people - I would enthusiastically recommend pouring bleach into your eyes before I recommend "Rabbit Test".
