Not only was the plot of this movie constructed with the ease with which the two psychoses are able to kidnap a pregnant woman without sweating, but it was a terrible rip-off of "misery". The main reason I gave this film such a low rating, however, was that it completely disgusted me. <br /> <br /> I'm not easily shocked by which filmmakers have the dish out and have always had a love for horror flicks, but this movie went too far in the form of violence and torture just to get points in the shock factor. I think most people, when you see only the first ten minutes of 'Hide and Seek', will find themselves now for the remote.
