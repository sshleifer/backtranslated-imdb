This is a really bad movie, with bad acting and a very boring pace Lorenzo Lamas is really cool though! All the signs are just annoying (except Lamas) and there is absolutely no mess or care to take! Plus the action is very boring. The movie gives us 3 villains who were to find threatening and disturbing when it was actually boring, ridiculous and just a bunch of morons that I would shut up! Plus it looks very cheap and amateurish! Lorenzo Lamas has a lot of charisma, but he can't save this piece of shit, and believe it or not that the opening was really cool as it was the end, but in the middle is incredibly boring and made me feel like pushing fast forward button !, plus the dialogue is especially ridiculous! There is a cool bar scene that I really liked, but when Lama leads to the quay, it all falls apart, plus the scene where the villains torture Jennifer's family and kill them should find it disruptive when it is actually ridiculous! This is a really bad movie, with bad acting and a very boring pace, Lorenzo Lama's really cool! But that is not enough, is not recommended. The direction is very poor. George Erschbamer does a very bad job here with mediocre camera work, bland location and keeping the movie at a dull pace. The action is pretty bad (except Lamas). Lorenzo Lamas is great here and, while he is not obliged to act, he is very fun to watch and has a really cool character and had a lot of charisma, but even he can't save this and he had no chemistry with thrown either! (Lama's Rules!). Josie Bell is horrible here and while she is decent looking, she is not very convincing and had no chemistry with Lamas. Cheryl Jeans is hot, but doesn't have much to do, but screams and scares, she did okay. Robert Scott is INCREDIBLY annoying as the biggest villain and was not at all threatening, he was ridiculous like the other. The rest of the throw is bad. Overall Avoid! Avoid! Even if you like Lamas (like me). * out of 5
