This is one of the films that is more interesting to see from an academic perspective than from an entertainment perspective. I make my assessment based on how much I enjoyed or was entertained by the movie, so I give it a 4. If I were to judge it as an academic film, however, it would get a 10. <br /> <br /> It's shot in a very interesting way, like a pseudotile movie with elements of sound effect and reality. It is supposed to convey memory and fragmentation of the mind, and it is interesting in these respects. <br /> <br /> But the movie has many disgusting elements to it that I didn't find all that entertaining. They are mostly just disturbing. It also has some very interesting pictures and some interesting concepts, but some of the character relationships (especially between mother and son) are quite disturbing. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie will either appeal to you or it won't. For me, it was interesting from an academic perspective, but it wasn't a good watch, and I probably won't go back to it once. <br /> <br /> 4/10 if you're looking for entertainment. 10/10 from an academic point of view.
