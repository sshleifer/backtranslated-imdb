The "spider web" is an example of many examples of films that have strong, sometimes remarkable performances and high points, but are unfortunately broken and drastically slowed by a murky plot and very little to interest the audience. It stars Richard Widmark as a physician working in a mental institution whose life becomes uneasy because of family problems and a rather ridiculous and overtime conflict that really doesn't look like anything. <br /> <br /> The reason is horrible. It is time for the institution to get new curtains for the library's windows. An old woman wants to have her drapes over them, but many of the patients want to make their own. And in a way, this ridiculous and accidental luney conflict breaks out at the point where life is in danger and families begin to fall apart. It sounds more like a conflict that would arise between very young children. The question of the plot's logic, and whether it really could happen, is so massive that one wonders whether only a genuine lunatic could buy it. Don't make me wrong, there's nothing wrong with the actor. The cast following Widmark is composed of other amazing actors, many of them Academy Award nominees and winners. And there is occasionally a moment in the movie that seems brilliant, but it always excludes the stupid plot of window blinds. Unfortunately, there is too much about the doggone curtains and thus lowers the film. Many of them take are long and finished from a camera view that adheres to the slow stimulation and lack of interest. <br /> <br /> In a short analysis, "The Cobweb" is an unrecognized movie, and it becomes clear why the viewers are basically as soon as the plot comes into focus, which it does pretty quickly. It just doesn't look really fun to see and I tell you it's not fun to see.
