This should be my kind of movie. Even if it sucked, it should still have been straight up in my alley; hell, i like "Congo" and "Allan Quatermaine" movies. I have a soft place in my heart for stupid stranger / demon / fairy-tale movie. Let's go over why I decided to see this in the first place. <br /> <br /> 1. Horror / Sci-fi almost always fascinates me 2. I'm a big fan of archeology, and this movie involves a rare treasure. 3. Super-natural enemies with quality FX. 4. Christian Slater and Dorf I generally enjoy. 5. Tara Reid is warm. <br /> <br /> So this movie had potential, at least in the cheese horror section of the video store, but boy did it suck ass. The only redeeming aspects are Slater and Dorf, and not everyone finds them as entertaining as I do ... I mean, let's see it, both are melodramatic. But now on some of the many mistakes. <br /> <br /> Tara Reid. Although the movie as a whole is worse, Reid's performance is really awful. We're not just talking badly, I'm talking about nominating Tara Reid for this year's worst performance. I don't know if she's capable of performing, but playing the museum manager is simply out of her league ... altogether. Seeing her try to carry the role of a trained scientist was not much different from what you see in the bad porn setup. I mean, it's not just bad, it's ridiculously bad. Oh, and for those you are curious, she won't be naked, just down to a bra in a silly, totally unnecessary love scene. Even with Reid's performance, perhaps the film could have worked, but the plot is what dominates, and the plot seems written by a 10-year-old. I hadn't realized this was a video game adaptation until AFTER watch the DVD, otherwise I would have appreciated the stupidity in real time. The storyline jumps back and forth from Slater's childhood in an orphanage, where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened, of course he has amnesia. In his adult life, Slater was recruited by Unit 713, a paranormal military force that apparently chases evil or something. Slater had to leave because he was too rebellious, I guess you never really know, unless it was in one of those voice-overs I sat down. The movie starts with Slater Hunting Artifacts, achieving his latest piece after some relationship with a "Chilean Mercenary Force specializing in selling rare antiques." I can get the exact quote wrong, but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> There is a vicious doctor who wants to release some hellions on the ground (no reason given), experiments on children, super demon / alien-human hybrids, "photonic" bullets (the demon's thing cannot stand sunlight) and of course Slater and Dorf are trying to save everyone. <br /> <br /> Jesus, I can't even wade through the clich√©dic elements. The scripture needed hard work to rework to narrow the focus and to give the depth. I mean, why is this evil scientist so vicious? Oh right, people are doomed, and he's just trying to save humanity. I think he's infected? How did it happen? Oh, he has one of the evil demon stuff in a cage and draws his blood to shoot himself. How the hell happened? Why and where did he get the super snails (oh yes, they use the old sci-fi state of parasitic aliens / demons who "melt" with their host's spine) Of course, Slater is like Blade, half super-slug powered, but his slug " did not fully secure due to an electric shock, "thank goodness. Oh, and the people with these "molten" spines have no idea that they are half-alien / demon and act as good members of society until some secret signal is heard from which they become killer zombies. Yes, we get zombies. <br /> <br /> So lots of crap that could be entertaining but none of it is. The end is also quite stupid as everything turns out to be not the big deal of a deal to make in the first place ... at least not something that a small dynamite can't do. <br /> <br /> Not the very best you want to see, but a really bad movie.
