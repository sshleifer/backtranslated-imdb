I thoroughly enjoyed Bilal's graphic novel when it came out and was surprised when I saw the trailer for this movie, and even more so when I found out that Bilal had corrected himself. However, the movie was a great letdown. The visions are nothing near the rich and twisted texture of the original works of art, and the story is badly told. Bilal seems to have chosen to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel, and he does not do very well either. <br /> <br /> The most entertaining part of the original graphic novel was the friendship relationship between Nikopol and Horus. They were both out of their time and place, forced together by circumstances. Most of all, they were fun and sympathetic. Not so here. Nikopol has no discernible personality at all, and Horus is a pompous twit who just wants to be laid. Although the film is French, Horus must not be! <br /> <br /> We've all seen movies we've had, but won't recommend to anyone for any reason. I would not recommend Immortel to anyone except perhaps as a warning not to hand over your talent and resources. Bilal is a master historian, but of course not a master for every visual medium.
