I found this movie in the 'Horror' section of my video store. It seems sensible, as most zombie films have their place there. From Romero's 'Dead' trilogy to '28 days later. 'But when you see it, you can quickly see what this movie really is. <br /> <br /> It's actually a music video that is progressively faster and more and more gory. There is no horror here people. Just halfway decent attacked action scenes, which soon become tedious because they last ... and last ... and last ... and soon you get the feeling, maybe you're a DVD player accidentally jumping back 3 minutes but no So they actually made the movie. It's a shame. I think someone could find a better need for $ 7 million in the film industry than make this lump o 'crud. Although some of the 360 ​​effects were cool, but once again they were consumed and dull, as it was the same stunt over and over again, just with a different character. <br /> <br /> Also what's ROYALLY annoying is the splitting of footage from the arcade game. I've played the game. It stinks. So why did they put it in here? Oh that's right, it's not a movie, but a music video, and that's bad. 3/10 <br /> Rating R: A lot of violence / gore, and profanity
