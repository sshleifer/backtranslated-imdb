I would say this was the worst gay-themed movie I've ever seen, but I can honestly say this is the worst movie if any genre I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> You know you 'are in doubt when a movie starts with a "personal note" from the director and asks for the audience's "understanding" of the many challenges facing a first-time director. The soundtrack is so bad in many scenes, it is almost impossible to follow the dialogue and this from a DVD version. Poor lighting, bad sets, poor photography, bad script, generally poor all appear to make this "movie" unavailable. I did it through to the bad end after several attempts and immediately gave away the DVD I silly bought. I'm sure there are many challenges for a first-time director. But try not to handle this lame attempt as a finished product. I see from IMDb details that this was not only the first Director's attempt by Richard Natale, but also the only one. That's the only positive thing I can say about this alleged "movie".
