This one is bad. A really bad and boring crime movie that has nothing beyond it. A number of crimes, the killer, which you do not see throughout the film, the classic investigations. And also the classic tale of a policeman who reckons what is going on and is not believed by anyone so he must fight for himself to reveal the truth. Not too much in this one. Vote: 4 out of 10.
