This film raises a number of pressing issues in my mind. First, how has Jennifer Tilly managed to maintain a film-making career for all those years, based on the ridiculously creaking voice and the very limited selection of hammy facial expressions she uses? Secondly ... what on earth were the people responsible for thinking about this offensive and deeply disgusting movie thinking? And thirdly ... considering that there were people who were perverted enough to decide to make a boy like this, there should have been no one in the system - the study, the distributors or somewhere - sensible enough to prevent it from actually being completed and released. You would really have to look for a very, very long way to turn up another movie as deeply uncomfortable as this ... and it's not even billed as a horror movie - as far as it can be seen as belonging to any legitimate movie genre it is determined. The film wallows from the beginning to the end in the sickest form of madness, violence and abuse, and has essentially no redeeming features at all. I'm not actually talking for censorship (which I don't believe in) ... but I really can't see how anyone would like to draw something positive from watching a movie like this.
