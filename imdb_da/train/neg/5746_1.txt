About the worst movie in distribution right now! I love zombie movies and saw this in the used rack so I thought why not? Oh my god sin to zombie movies and fans of the genre! Anyone who made this movie should remove the camcorder and go to the film school! There are so many nice dogs out there that have put time and effort into their movies, and they have something that this movie is not worthy of. I know what it takes to make movies, and I'm sure there was a lot of money and time to make the Meat Market, but none of the money and time went in to do it well. You need actors, a script, a real camera, invest in some books on how to make autonomous movies. I don't know how to get a DVD release, but the one who did it is either a really good friend or breaks the head on the wall. In gorefilm the quality is not quantity, the effects are weak! I was so angry that this is actually in stores and that I could not get my money back. If you've seen this movie, please type here and stop closing. I know I'm very tough, I only had 10 lines, so I'm trying to get to that point.
