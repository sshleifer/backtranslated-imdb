You should see this show once to have seen them all, the formula is exactly the same in each episode. Jim does something the way he thinks well, but he disturbs his wife, eventually she finds out that what he did was really for her, she caresses her cheek and gives a smiling smile while looking at bashfully. In fact, the lines of history are so boring and formal that I take a stack on one now. Episode 'Valentines Pay' <br /> Jim's wife notes that all Jim's weekly wages have disappeared, he explains to her that he lost it at the casino. She screams and leaves the house where he regrets how terrible he is. Then on Valentine's Day he turns up in a limo with tickets to a ball (thus explaining the lack of salaries). She understands 'Her' mistakes and the usual 'Oh Jim, you're so lovely'. .. The end Another very obvious thing is the fact that Jim's character is based on Homer Simpson, who as a cartoon character can get away with being belligerent and ignorant when this is attempted by People it does not work and jim just comes across as an arrogant self-centered jerk. <br /> <br /> IMO is the only reason why this is successful, simply because we are so many people with television, these days you can make a show about a man who insulates walls and you would get an audience. <br /> <br /> 'Two and a half men' on the other hand are fantastic and fun.
