I have a question for those who thought about this idea. Why? What made them do another movie of this. If the memory serves, did Cinderella not end with "They lived happily ever after"? I'm pretty sure it did, or it was implied. Wait a minute if they all lived happily ever after, how could there be a sequel? Unless they tried to make the most boring story in history, there could not be a sequel. I guess they probably could have Cinderella singing about nonsense for two hours, but why? A movie ending with "happily ever after" cannot have a sequel; if it does, they will not live happily ever! Something has to go wrong, causing problems with the first end! Why? It's not true, it's bad. That is my last word in the matter.
