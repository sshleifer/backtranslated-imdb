In my view, it is almost the perfect example of Hollywood ego that is only beaten by the new King Kong movie. Superman is the original superhero and deserves to be treated with respect even though he wears tights. Brandon Routh was the worst superman I've ever seen. From the start of the movie you will just push a piece of kryptonite into the throat. He just looks stupidly wearing a costume. But probably about him, Kate Bosworth was a bad choice for Lois Lane, she was supposed to be a hard ass reporter, but in this movie she looks more like a schoolgirl. The reason was weak and predictable (WOW, he is actually superman's son who would ever have thought ....) and the play was terrible. This movie has a good thing for it, and it's called Kevin Spacey. His portrayal of Lex Luthor was brilliant, but he himself could not save this film. What this movie needed was the cast of "lois and clark" (except Kevin Spacey of course) and another story. I watched this movie after seeing the "hills have eyes" and I was chocked to learn that there were worse movies so.
