I wanted to see it for two reasons. One, it was remake of the High Sierra with Bogart, two, the Bogart party was played by Jack Palance, who can play dramatic roles with some subtlety, as in The Big Knife. <br /> <br /> But now I wonder why they decided to shoot this remake. The film follows the same plot as Hig Sierra; Only here, the actors don't care, the director is lost in his thoughts, and who knows what the producer was thinking. Jack Palance gets bored watching Shelley Winters and Shelley Winters wondering what she's doing in this movie. I don't even want to compare her with Ida Lupino in the same role. And of course they had to use the dog's story again! They might have gotten some different ideas. Perhaps the color makes it great to see the same place where they shot the High Sierra, but it adds absolutely no quality to the movie. It's a waste of time if you've seen High Sierra before. Otherwise, why not see a pseudo-movie noir. As for me, I'd rather die than see it again ...
