This 1997 movie-blanc classic tale of smoldering passion has achieved its well-deserved legendary status as one of the screen's greatest sagas of a doomed and hopeless love. The sweeping, ongoing and progressive magnetism between Judge Reinhold and what's-her-name is sure to put many a viewer's heart a-flutter with memories of one's own first crush. The brilliant manuscript bursts this embryonic affair in front of the enchanted audience and sits transfected as the abstract, almost expressionist filmography, deeply focussing on the just underlying desires that ebb and flow between those responsible. You can cut the sexual tension with a dull tire iron. <br /> <br /> A little drop of sweat at the end of a nose catches the bright sunshine and leaves no doubt about its importance. Scenes like this are abundant and bear looking again and again. As with "Jane Eyre" and "Rebecca" (as this masterpiece is so often compared to), the actors' faces as they experience will slow the opening of the great love that is not yours forever. <br /> <br /> The now classic RC soundtrack score, with its creative and unique use of solo synthesizer, emphasizes the feelings that drip all the way through as a delicious cradle. <br /> <br /> If I had any criticism whatsoever by mentioning what I consider a minor mistake (and daring to risk the anger of the millions of fans holding this classic so dear to their hearts), I will say that the feature of "Runaway Car" - its sense of mounting sexual tension - is short broken by the motorway scene, which now, after repeated views, seems a little overong (and probably even unnecessary?) to the eternal, bittersweet tale of love interrupted. <br /> <br /> Do I dare to research what I perceive as the smallest of shortcomings in this critically acclaimed triumph of modern cinema? The 'Citizen Kane' had its 'Rosebud'. . . The 'Runaway Car' should also have its reference word. Perhaps the movie could have opened with an extremely close-up of Judge Reinhold, who said something like "A car is an extension of its owner!" And the rest of the bigline could then be dedicated to analyzing all syllables, subtleties and nuances of it sentence. Had the plot line been done, this movie could have topped the "Titanic" at the Golden Globes that year, I am convinced. My regret? That I didn't read the novel first.
