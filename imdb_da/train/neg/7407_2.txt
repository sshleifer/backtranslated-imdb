1. watched 6/18/2009 ?? 2 out of 10 (Dir-Pete Riski): Strange psychotic movie about a girl with autism being tested in a hospital, the flow flickering, and then the hell destroys loose. I am honestly not sure what the filmmakers' intentions were on this. What we get for the next one and a half hour (it was at least no longer) was a twisted horror / twilight zone / zombie party / ghost movie that really ended up saying no meaning at all at the end. After the power goes out, everyone in the hospital is missing, except for a small group of misfits, including the girl and his father. There is the typical annoying character, an eerie old man, and the typical hard guy looks like many scarefests and of course the young girl gets the main character attracted. Random things begin at different times like ghosts and monsters that appear, a hint that time has stopped, and dead people like this little group are trying to escape whatever they are. Of course, the autistic girl center for all is somehow and I really hate how they used this girl's affliction and insinuated that she was the reason to place it in a hospital where people are cared for is really paralyzed. We never really find the answer to what was going on, which is very strange, so please avoid this dog. Unless you want to be scared and confused for an hour and a half, it's not for you or any movie gallery. What a waste of time ?? really !!
