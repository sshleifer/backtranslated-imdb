This relic of a short movie starts with a teenager who goes through the process of trying to get a license. It quickly gets sidetracked with almost every conceivable topic related to cars. Such things as dune buggy, trekking, custom painting and car exhibitions are discussed. It often tries to be humorous, but instead the film is boring, drawn out and even sexist. None of the people in the movie have actually been heard. Instead, everything is done in narration and voiceovers. Sorry, but I can't keep it. <br /> <br /> There is nothing educational or interesting about "Dad, can I borrow the car?". It's just another piece of thoughtless filler to take time out of their "Wonderful World Of Disney" TV show. 1.10
