What happened? "Doubt" had so much potential to be a brilliant movie - but instead it fell with a drag-simplified plot line that made me stop watching. The only thing the movie was about to go to was the joy of Meryl Streep, which no DOUBT deserved the Oscar nomination. Although not one of her best performances, she still gave us a solid and truthful sign that flourished through the screen. <br /> <br /> But not even the gloss of the screens could save this movie from going downhill. From the dull start that had no power or blow to the less than convincing end, the film was really a disappointment - especially as it provided so many options through its promotional and trailers. It was obvious that the director was having trouble with the plot's simplicity, and he ended up with a boring movie that needed too much talk and not enough action. <br /> <br /> In addition, the second Oscar nominations were less than convincing. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman gave a decent performance, it was by no means scary. (Especially when they completely resigned performances like Will Smith in seven pounds). Amy Adams did not deserve the appointment. Seeing Amy Adams was like seeing a cardboard box - as it was one-sided and clean. It would have been more sensible to nominate her for a Razzie as I am sure she would have gone away victoriously. Viola Davis gave a brief but truthful performance, but the length of her performance prompted me to ask whether the Academy really should have given her the appointment. All in all, I have doubts about being one of the most disappointing movies of 2008. It was a mess in a movie with so much potential and I do not recommend it. The only shining light in the movie is Meryl Streep, which, however, offers a great, solid performance - not even enough to store this movie. *** / 10.
