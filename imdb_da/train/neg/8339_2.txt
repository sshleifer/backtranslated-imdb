This movie just goes around in circles, and the viewer doesn't know where they are. First I thought ..mmmmm, this could be a little cool movie this, but it just pulls on and off, and in the end you don't know what's going on. The main woman is a good actress and played her role well, and the psychic trap is scary, but after a while you don't worry about what happens because this movie just pulls on. Shame really, it could have proven much better. <br /> <br /> But would say the leading woman and psychic fella will have a good career ahead of them, but they will remember this movie because they made them known or to be the movie they apologize for they have ever made.
