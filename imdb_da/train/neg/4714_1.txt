I want so much to give this piece of GARBAGE a zero, unfortunately it is not, so I had to give it a 1 just to warn you how stupidly terrible this fraud of a well-known cartoon really is! The characters look like they were drawn by preschool teachers, no, wait, I've seen preschoolers do better! I prefer "Misadventures of Flapjack" to this horrible excuse for a cartoon! I say enough what others have said, two words: RIP OFF !! Remember the episode of Dexter's Lab as they drove go-karts down that volcano? Yes, Mister Fellows even paid in on that idea and failed! They even beat Shadow Lugia in one episode that parodied Pokemon! (He even deposited it on that franchise!) The one sign is a cheap rip off of Mandark from Dexters Lab! Mister Fellows must be sued for statutory violation of this piece of shit !! Everyone has their own opinion, but those of you who like Johnny (RIP-OFF) Test are just like you. Do yourself a favor, change channel when this rip off is trying to quarrel your screen!
