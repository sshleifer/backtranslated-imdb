This is a German movie from 1974, something to do with some women coming to a castle and beyond, I can't really tell you their purpose or even the purpose of the movie. I can tell you that there are more women who also moonlight as waiters at this particular castle, striping, putting on body paint and gazing at bongos as if they were at Goth Kit Kat Club, and it seems to be a good part of the driving time of this movie. Yes, there seems to be something with devilish worship and vampires, and there is some girl on girl things, etc. But the main focus seems to be the painted babes gyrating away in the basement. Rather, I resembled the eye-rolling of one of the greatest housekeepers / devil-lovers who issued authenticity in the case and made her even more evil. Was it Wanda the evil lesbians (who billed in the credits)? Does not matter. If you're not too fussy about your lesbian devil worshiping movies, you might like it, otherwise it's pretty boring, and I couldn't even finish it, I was so sorry. 3 out of 10
