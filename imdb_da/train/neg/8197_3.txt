I just watched this movie tonight and I have to say it's a mess. I love Vince Vaughn, but he ends up having more annoying fun here, and the movie is more than a remake of the crappy 80's classic "Santa Claus movie", but with out in the camp or the bad Sheena Easton song at the end. . The story is your run of the mill black sheep in the family who come back to face his family for the holiday kind of thing, but with the North Pole as its setting. Of course, Fred (Vince Vaughn) is the family that comes home after a series of setbacks that include his girlfriend (Rachel Weisz in a como role) who dumps him so he comes home face to face with his parents and his more successful brother Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti) and wacky high jinks come along with a little sibling rivalry and a little anarchy as well as threatening all Christmas. Now, if you believe you at the end of this movie, I think you'd be right because it's predictable for the hill. Regarding the actor, Vince Vaughn plays the same lovable loser he always plays, but this time he becomes more annoying than anything, Miranda Richardson plays Mrs. Claus, but the role is more than a note, Elizabeth Banks plays Santa's assistant, but she's not much of a sign of anyone other than a neurotic joke and poor Kevin Spacey essentially ends up playing the same person he plays in the movie "Glengarry Glen Ross" but a little more anal. The only two actors who come out of this movie with their dignity intact are Paul Giamatti, who brings true sincerity and warms to his role as Santa, but he looks a little embarrassed to be in the movie and you cannot blame him and Rachel Weisz, who manages to do much more with a very small role than most major players do with theirs, which is a shame because both Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti deserved much better than what this script gave them. <br /> <br /> To put it in a nutshell, a big disappointment.
