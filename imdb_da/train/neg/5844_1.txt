This movie is easily one of the worst I've ever seen. And I don't think so in a good way. We wanted to see a crazy horror / thriller, so we chose the one that seemed to be the lousiest in the store. For once, the film was all we expected. And more! (or should I say less?) <br /> <br /> The actors look like they are reading their lines from posters behind the camera. The so-called special effects are created by putting red transparent plastic in front of the camera to give the impression that we are looking through the eyes of the killer rats. And the script? Not even getting me started on the script ... And just as you thought it couldn't get worse, the first part of the movie turned out to be the Oscar material in the end. <br /> Take it from me, this movie is fun if you are into crazy horror movies, but if you want a good movie, watch out. This is not for you.
