... for one of the worst Swedish movies ever ... forgive me for being boring. First of all, I haven't seen the first one (I'm bored it's my reason to see the 2nd before the first one), well I hope the first one is better than this, it was filled with weird rock scenes and very strange plot changes, for the people who have seen this and think 4/10 is loud (believe me i do too), but it made me laugh a few times because it was so bizarre so bad and i still laugh and think about the punk that came up with this idea, what is next "The Seventh Seal II". Sequels that are not based on novel or book do not appear very often, and this is a perfect example of one. OK, I'll be honest with you: I laughed a little it got some decent jokes in it and slapstick humor. But don't buy it, rent it. Just let another idiot do it or download it. <br /> <br /> 4/10 This movie is remembered and the instructor is probably already laughing already ...
