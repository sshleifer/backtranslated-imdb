If this is the black experience, let me out at either the front or back door. <br /> <br /> One mommy's boy sees one day two young caps on and from then on, it's all down the hill for him. Angela Bassett, the one shining grace in this movie, plays her over-protective, religious mother. Despite her anger at how his life has turned, in the middle of the picture, she really decides to accept this. She gives her friends the opportunity to enter and suddenly it is just right to use the profanity as long as it is not for the children. <br /> <br /> This is a sad state of gangster rap. You knew where this movie was going. I literally put out loud when at the end, when Bassett accompanies her son's body to burial, says that while his life had been shortened at age 24, he had become a man. Which man? He had been a doomed criminal, wrote the most terrible rap music with constant vulgarity and despised society. The scene in the classroom where he tells a teacher that he, as sanitation, is earning more than the teacher, is a perfect example of what is going on in our schools. The complete and complete lack of respect for the teacher. <br /> <br /> East coast, the West Coast rage has never been fully explained. All we see are guns blazing. <br /> <br /> An awful picture does nothing to prevent gangsterism. What horrible role models are these rapeseers and their foul music. African American society should take a bias towards their being. Who was this classless fat slob portraying Biggie? He made Rerun from the old TV show, looks thin in comparison. I know it was the streets of Bedford Stuyvesant that changed this shabby little boy to the vulgar monster he was. What a sorry state when this is called motion picture entertainment.
