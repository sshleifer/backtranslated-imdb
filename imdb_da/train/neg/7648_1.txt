It is considered fashion to emphasize any social evil caused by patriarchy and male domination, but moronically, this illogical "logic" can be. But within the film's history and theme, there is no gray area, and the woman who is called the film's antagonist is the villain of history. Under no circumstances can what she did be justified. Women's sexuality is just hype in this matter and has nothing to do with reality. It is the betrayal of the ultimate kind. The man ended up using his resources and time in the wasteful breeding of another man's offspring. First, the weakest of arguments arising from the 3 'liberated' female characters in the climax are pathetic. A woman's sexual needs are no excuse for her to commit adultery and continually betray her husband and worse, there are no other children. So essentially his life has been wasted. In some societies where justice still prevails, such situations result in the execution of the unjust.
