It was really that bad. Equal to the (merciful!) Short-lived "Dirty Dozen" television series that played Ben Murphy and was made at the same time (also on the cheap in Yugoslavia). I was embarrassed by the cast members of this movie - and especially Telly Savalas. He was waaaaaay too old and fat for the role (pushing 70 when he made this garbage), and the reviewer drawing parallels with Telly the Greek in this and John Wayne in "The Green Berets" sums it up. <Br /> <br /> Other reviewers have pointed out some of the many ridiculous howlers that this crime against celluloid contains, so I do not repeat them here. But I would add that I am amazed that no one has yet mentioned the ridiculously-looking helmet worn by Savala on his large inflated head. <br /> <br /> I am also surprised that this play of a movie has a rating as high as 4.7 here at IMDb. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, it's a "1" across the table. If you want a good example of why flogging a franchise kills it, it's really a bad idea (especially 20 plus years after the original). Look no further than "The Dirty Dozen - The Fatal Mission". <br /> <br /> Awful - Avoid !!!!
