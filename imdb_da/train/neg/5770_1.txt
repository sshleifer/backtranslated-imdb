If I were to make a film thermometer, this film would be absolutely zero. Out of ten stars, I would rate it as follows: <br /> <br /> Plot: zero stars Video quality: zero stars Sound quality: zero stars Acting: zero stars <br /> <br /> It's like high school students came Together one afternoon with a camera, made a plot and shot a movie. It is lacking in any artistic value that I would rather see children walking around in a high school than watching this movie. But something has to be said about the abysymal depths. "Shootout" in the stairs is one of the most wrecked fun scenes ever. First of all, the warriors simply bend plastic guns on each other and move their arms back and forth to simulate recoil. The pair "ducks" each other's non-existent balls. No squibs, no sparks, no items, just waving spray-painted spray gun around. If you want to see two adult men playing "actor", give it a ride one day ... after you've cleaned the fridge, combed the rug, polished all the doorknobs, shaved the gravel, straightened the books on the shelf, etc.
