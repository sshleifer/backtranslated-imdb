First of all, this plot is very exaggerated - the girl wants to do it, everyone loves her, snobbish girl intervenes, everything looks lost, the girl pulls through, everyone loves her again, etc. Throws into things, an attractive male crush on the hero , plus enforcement issues, and it is so predictable that you can almost recite with it. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I really hate how they continue to convey classical music. They send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is busy and sneaky and close to each other - in fact, I can't remember the quote exactly, but I remember at some point in the movie, Holly says, "why do they have to be so repressed .. So classic? "It's really insulting how to label classical music this way. <br /> <br /> Third, I have gone through dozens of times, but the only reason to think about making this movie is to promote Britney Spears. There is just no point at all. <br /> <br /> And yes, while the actor who portrayed Holly (I'm not sure if it really was her song or not) had a pretty good voice was not as amazing as they did it Be - especially when she belted. She constantly oversubscribed. <br /> <br /> 1/10 stars.
