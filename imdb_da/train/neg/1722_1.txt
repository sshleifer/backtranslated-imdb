This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, it is extremely boring with lots of dull dialogue and has some very annoying characters and a ridiculous look. The only reason I saw this bin is because it was on the 8 disk horror seen I got. The reason is preposterous and completely stupid as it is the final. No blood, what ever except a few bloody marks on the creature and a few bloody shoot wounds. The action is AWFUL !! Richard Cardella is horrible as the sheriff and was quite ridiculous plus his character is annoying. Glen Roberts is the comic relief and was not fun at all! Mark Siegel is extremely annoying and was not FUNNY either. Bob Hyman is decent, but not much more than that. Richard Garrison is annoying and had no chemistry with Kacey Cobb what so ever. Kacey Cobb is so here and had no chemistry with Richard. Overall, avoid this piece of waste at all costs! BOMB out of 5.
