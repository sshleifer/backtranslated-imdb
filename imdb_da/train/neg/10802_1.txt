Let me give a quick summary of the movie: A rat, rude child named Max stumbles on a radio containing Kazaam: a rapping genius. Like all geniuses, he gives 3 wishes, but also helps Max with his personal life, as he is dealing with bullies and a father mixed in organized crime. In all this, Kazaam is raging from time to time (also showing Shaq's bleak excitement). <br /> <br /> This movie proves what we all know: Athletes must stick to sports. I admit it never looked like an Oscar-worthy movie, but everything about this waste of film is terrible. The characters are either unlikely or stupid, the plot is not even worth mentioning, the dialogue is a joke, and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem. Hell, though Denzel Washington played Kazaam, this movie would still be a joke. I know the movie only accounted for because Shaq was so big (no saying calculated) at that time. I honestly can't think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time. Shaq should have said that time was accustomed to making this movie against free throwing.
