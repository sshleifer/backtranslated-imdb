There was such a hype about a game show with Bill Shatner ... and especially in the wake of Deal or No Deal and 1 vs 100. What a disappointment! As Ben Stein says so stoic and nasally, "wooww". The only thing good about this show was that you knew it would eventually be over. Sitting through a full hour of it was like going to the dentist ... you find yourself looking at the clock in what you think is 10 minute intervals, only to find out that only one minute has passed (but seemed like an eternity since you last looked at the clock. So why didn't I just move the channel? Well probably for the same reason, most others did not ... out of pure optimism. I think no one really * wants * to think that a show with Bill Shatner could actually be so bad. Personally from the first 15 minutes I never thought it was the kind of vehicle that would showcase William Shatner's talents. My main complaint was that the set was so dark. Watching it left me feeling depressed. You continued to get ahold of a little excitement, but there was just no one to have had. There wasn't even enough light on the set to get a sense of energy from the audience (which you couldn't even see). Dear Networks: People do not see game shows to cure their insomnia. .. they see game shows being tense and having a good time. Please do all of us a favor and lose this in the vault.
