I may not be a great admirer of the original "Creepshow", but the crooked sequel makes the anthology look like perfection! And to think I went into this one expects to like this one. Five years after his predecessor, George Romero comes back on board the EC Comic Style track, and on this excursion you point to the manuscript of Steve King's three stories. Although the direction is handed over to Michael Gornick. The film mostly falls into that aspect with uneven brushes by Gornick. But most of the blame had to go to Romero's terribly static and unbearable cringe-like script (especially in the dialogues flowing through the first and final history). Moralistic messages (which came from mostly a sour bunch of characters) simply took over the black humor. Oh it was painful and the same can be said about the lively rat music score that comes with the picture. Easily linking the three stories (Old Chief Woodenhead, The Raft and The Hitchhiker) together is a mildly curious and effective wraparound story done in nostalgia (80s) animation form. I liked this segment and the wisecracking creep character was a shining light. <br /> <br /> # The first story "Old Chief Woodenhead" sees two older proprietors (George Kennedy & Dorothy Lamour) of a general store in a dying native society, the Dead River. Get robbed and eventually killed by a couple of punks who die to live it in Hollywood. In front of the store is a wooden statue of an Indian chief who is going to live to avenge their deaths. <br /> <br /> - List to George Kennedy Waffle. And waffle for 10 minutes about how he has committed himself to his 'great' community. What a lovely touchy feely time. Well, as Kennedy's speech, it is a monotonous colorless and overcoat that never gives a good starting point. The indulgent script is common inane and the performance is appropriate. These two factors are really added to my headache. When the Indians live and become avenged, goons meet a very quick (but pig) death in the right way. The effects were legally done, but what about the free flowing hair. How could Hollywood knock that lock back? Ugh! <br /> <br /> # Second story "The Raft" follows a group of dope tuxedo and yahoo teens on their way to a remote lake. After swimming to the navy in the middle of the lake, they are trapped on the platform because of a creepy appearance lurking in the water. <br /> <br /> - Now this is much better, much better. What begins as your basic teens run afoul becomes a mysterious scary setup full of tight and claustrophobic excitement. And it doesn't even run out of flashes of nudity or spit-splatter. Pretty morbid is it, and it also goes for its humor. The surprisingly ironic end has a beautiful touch to it. The performances of nobodies are acceptable without making a big mark. Gornick's direction sticks to the unpleasant and rather huge side. While the alarming music score on this occasion pushed the right chords. The mud-like creature in the lake (as many have mentioned) looks like an icky black tarpaulin (yes you read it right!) Floats on the water. <br /> <br /> # Finally, number three ends with "The Hitchhiker". A wealthy but sexually missing woman is on her way home with her male gigolo, but she is late. Thinking of some ideas to explain to her delay, if necessary, she slips off the road and accidentally hit a hitchhiker. Instead of checking or getting help, she runs in the hope of coming home before her husband. Soon she will be terrorized by the missing body of the dead hitchhiker. <br /> <br /> Not terribly, but I didn't really get into this ridiculously ridiculous exercise at all. Compared to the first two, this was so different in tone and tried to tickle the fun leg instead. Lois Chiles was okay in the lead, but the constant assurance and the small conversations she has with herself became miserably aggravating and even tired. The living makeup effects are well shown and drip with the sight. When she beats, the hitchhiker is when it gets hectic, cheesy and over-the-top in its performance. From there we hear infinitely repeating and repeating our supposed dead hitchhiker? and repeat the line, "thank you for riding lady!" This happens every time she decides to run over him. Get some courtesy for the dead treasure. <br /> <br /> In total, the second short story "The Raft" and the unpleasant, well-developed effects is what promises this extremely inferior successor.
