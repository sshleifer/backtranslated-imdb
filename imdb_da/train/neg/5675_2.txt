Seen in the 70s, "Seed" centers around convicted serial killer Max Seed (Will Sanderson), who killed 666 people in 6 years. He is doomed to death, but he does not die in the electric chair, even after he has been shocked three times. <br /> <br /> Detective Matt Bishop (Michael Par√©) and other officers cover this secret by burying Seed Live. Seeds break out and go after the people who put him in his living coffin. <br /> <br /> Filmed by the worst director in the world (Uwe Boll), "Seed" is no more than a snuff movie trying to stretch the envelope of decent society and failing to deliver in any aspect of a story. And he said this is based on true events, because if a person survives the electric chair after being shocked three times, they become free. This is a legend, and it would never happen. Like Boll's other abominations ("Alone in the Dark" for one), "Seed" is just awful.
