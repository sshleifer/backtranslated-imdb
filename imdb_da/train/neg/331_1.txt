I can no doubt say that Going Overboard is the only worst movie I've ever seen, and yes, I've seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is an abomination like Schecky Moskowitz, a wannabe comedian working on a cruise ship. It's the plot. <br /> <br /> That's it! Nothing else in the film makes sense, it's everywhere like a crazy man's breakfast, and not in a crazy naked gun kind, but more frustratingly, "throw both shoes on" kind of. Even General Noriega looks, for no reason I can understand it (it was certainly not for humor). Add to the mix Miss Australia, which has the worst Australian accent I've ever heard, and you have something that I won't call the worst movie ever made because overboard doesn't even fit the basic definition of a movie. I highly recommend watching this movie as it will raise standing of every bad movie you ever see. I guarantee the first thing you say after watching a bad movie will be "at least it wasn't that bad to go overboard".
