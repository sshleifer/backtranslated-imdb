I have been convinced to write this review for a number of reasons: <br /> <br /> 1) This is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen 2) Unless there are more reviews, it won't be listed in it all-time worst movie list - which it deserves to be 3) I was a little lucky - I paid five pounds for it. I've seen it in stores for Â£ 15. DO NOT PAY IT MUCH FOR THIS MOVIE! You will be very angry 4) There are many movies out there in the horror genre that do not get a fair rating (in my opinion) and give this movie a higher rating than they are criminal <br /> <br /> Plot overview: A guy outside Friends meet a tramp that promises the world - yes, the magical ability to show up to everyone else as another. Our hero sneaks to a teenage girl and joins their gang - sitting on swings, baby-sitting. He kills them one by one until he is tracked and found by the police. <br /> <br /> Why is it so bad? Initially, the play is very very bad. Someone else compared it to a school production. No, this is worse than any play I've seen at a school stage. <br /> <br /> I've purchased a number of these previously banned movies from the vipco DVD company and haven't been as disappointed as I was at this one. Okay, the play is bad, but the film fails to deliver in any other sense. What was the purpose of making this movie when there isn't even a gore! Okay, no one does. What more can a movie like this offer offer? Breats? No, not even any titillation! It is true that this movie may have some charm in its unique naffness, but any potential buyer / watcher of this movie should be advised that this movie is at best worth only one in ten.
