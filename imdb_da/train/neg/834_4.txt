I found this to be a total waste of time, effort and money. I know that Disney always shows a lack of creativity when making "straight-to-video" movies - but rebuilding the original movie with a "new perspective" is a very low time ... soon they will just be re release the original movies with new animation and new songs and call it a "new version of the movie we all love." Nathan Lane returns surprisingly to Timon's role. Timon and Pumbaa begin the animated animals of the world by the original "Lion King" on a narrative journey to tell us the original story as it really happened ... as they see it. <br /> <br /> Of course Timon is now the story of history, yadda yadda yadda, blah blah ... <br /> <br /> The musical sequences are lame and the animation is crap. The vocal talents are impressive for a video feature, but then when was the last time you remember Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg or Nathan Lane in some real commercial stuff? Overall if you liked the original, you will hate this. It is insulting because it is unfair for both children and adults. And it sums it up.
