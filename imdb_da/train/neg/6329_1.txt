I saw this cinematic misery in a dollar theater with a friend in 1979 (back when the tickets actually sold at $ 1). This is the only movie I've ever gone on (with my friend, while the idiot that is "Laser Bra 2000" sketch was on the screen). It was obviously my and my friend's reaction to the film that was commonplace. It's not that I found the movie offensive (either as an 18-year-old or now), but rather it's silly and open-mindedly unfunny, devoid of the unintentional humor that makes an Ed Wood movie visible. This is the real reason why NBC refused to fly it, rather than not understanding Mike's "vision" (unless his vision was of course driving the movie's backers into bankruptcy). <br /> <br /> I was amazed by this day that this movie doesn't seem to have made any "10 worst movie worst time" list available. It certainly does min. You have been warned.
