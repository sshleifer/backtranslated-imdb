This adaptation positively strikes a classic who is loved for his subtlety. Timothy Dalton has absolutely no idea of ​​the different shades of Rochester's character. I get the feeling that he never even read the book, just sauntered in put in his too tight pants and was handed over a character collection that read "Grumpy, Broody, Murky Past." He doesn't play Rochester as a character or as a real person, but as one over the top grouch who never breaks a smile until he becomes engaged, then miraculously morphs into a pansy. There is no chemistry. The only feeling that this adaptation excited me was adultery and also sympathy for Charlotte Bronte, who certainly turns in her grave. GO AND LEARN THE BOOK. ROCHESTER HAS A PERSONALITY. And that way: A "passionate" love scene doesn't mean you have to eat her face.
