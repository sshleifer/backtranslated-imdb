90 minutes Mindy ... Mindy is a teasing to boyfriends Bill ... Mindy prances in high school dancing ... Mindy hitchhikes to Big Sur, shoplifts a loaf of "shepherd's bread", Mindy becomes almost criminal ... Oh, the pleasures of Crown International drive-in features. You have to remember that these movies were never designed to be watched on DVD players. They were made as 90 minutes of mood so teenagers in the 70's wanted a soundtrack when they got it in their Pintos and Citations. The lack of pacing and structure did not matter to the original audience - they were probably only set as T & A on the screen matched what they were in the parking lot. The movie is really annoying when viewed as a story. It is very fun to talk about it than see it. My favorite inanities: 1) Bill and his friend accompany the teacher to find Mindy. Without luggage or replacing underwear, they spend 2 nights sharing a motel room with the teacher, just like in real life. 2) After being abducted and almost raped by depressed motorcyclists, and after their innocent friend "Pan" is severely beaten, Mindy and her boyfriend find an unattended motorcycle on the road. Mindy immediately lit up and chirps, "I'm going" to Big Sur !! "But again it is very fun to talk / read, but to sit through.
