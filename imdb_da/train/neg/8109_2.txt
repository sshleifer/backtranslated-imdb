*** Contains Spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I didn't like this movie at all. <br /> <br /> I found it incredibly boring and somewhat superficial, regardless of the significance and depth of the proposed themes: considering that we must eventually die, how should we turn to life? In a "light" way, like Tomas; in a "heavy" way like Tereza; Or should we find ways to not address the question that Sabina? How Much is Faithfulness in a Relationship? How much of business can be relaxed for our loved ones? How much should we be involved in political life and social issues in our country? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I have not read Customer's novel, but after being disappointed with the movie, I will definitely: I will understand whether the story was destroyed by the movie adaptation (which is my guess) or if It was boring from the beginning. I disagree with most positive comments that defined the film as a masterpiece. I simply don't see the reasons. What I see are many mistakes and a sample of them follows. <br /> <br /> 1) The three main characters are thrown at you and it is very difficult to understand what drives them when making their choices. <br /> <br /> 2) The "secondary" characters are just there to fill in the gaps, but they add nothing to the story and you wonder if they really are needed. <br /> <br /> 3) I didn't like how Tomas was imitated. Nothing good for him. He is so self-centered and selfish. He is not human, in a way. But when his self-confidence fails and he realizes that he is dependent on others and is emotionally attached to someone, I did not find the interpretation credible. <br /> <br /> 4) It is very unlikely that an artist like Sabina can afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968. Besides that, the three main characters are all very successful in their respective profession, which sounds weird for me. a) How can Tereza easily become such a good photographer? b) How can they do well in a country that lacks all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed? <br /> <br /> 5) The fake accent of the English spoken by the actors is ridiculous. And I'm not even a native speaker. Furthermore, the letter Sabina receives in the US is written in the Czech Republic, which I found very inconsistent. <br /> <br /> 6) Many comments praised the film, which said Prague was beautifully reproduced: I suppose most of the movie was shot on the spot, so it's not hard to give the film an Eastern European feel, and Considering Prague's own beauty, it's not even hard to make it look good. 7) I found the end kind of trivial. Tereza and Tomas, finally fond of the countryside, far away from the "metropolitan" temple, remote from the social struggles that their fellow citizens live, detached from their professional lives, die in a car accident. But they die after realizing that they are happy. So what? Had the dead unhappy, the message in the movie would have been different? I do not think. I considered it a cheap trick to satisfy the audience. <br /> <br /> 8) The only thing in the movie that is unbearably light is the way in which the director has portrayed the characters. You see them for almost three hours, but in the end you are over with nothing. You do not feel empathy, you do not relate to them, you stand there in your sofa and see a series of events and scenes that have very little to say. 9) I hated "stop the music in the restaurant" scene (as some comments praised a lot). Why has Sabina got such a strong reaction? Why does Franz agree with her? I really don't see the point. All you learn is that Sabina has a very bad mood and a very strong personality. That is it. What is so special and unique about it? <br /> <br /> After all these negative comments, let me point out that there are two scenes that I liked a lot (that's why I gave it two). <br /> <br /> "Naked women Photoshoot" where envy, jealousy, and insecurity Sabina and Tereza are beautifully presented. The second scene is the one representing the studies after the occupation of Prague by the Russians. Tereza images taken to let the world know what is going on in Prague are used to identify the people who participate in the troubles. I found it quite original, and Tereza's sense of despair and guilt is nicely portrait. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a small chance that the movie has been intentionally "designed" in such a way that "Tomas types" can like it and "Tereza ones" will hate it. If this is the case (I strongly doubt it) then my comment must be drastically revised.
