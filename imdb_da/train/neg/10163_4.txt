When I think of the revelation that the main character in "Bubble" comes to at the end of the film, I recall last year's "Machinist" with Christian Bale. The only difference between the two films is the literal physical weight of the character. An understated, yet realistic depiction of small city life. The title is the cause of contemplation. Perhaps, we, the audience are the ones in "Bubble", as we do not get any payoffs in the slimmed-down 90 minute movies. Audience reactions were often slick and judgmental, clearly indicating how detached people may be from seeing any human thread in characters so foreign to themselves. These characters are the ones that refer to those who put George W. back in the office for another period. It is sober to consider how reality television has spoiled our sense of reality when we see an audience leaping to their feet to the exit as soon as the credits play. This movie has that merit and deserves to take into account the things it doesn't say directly.
