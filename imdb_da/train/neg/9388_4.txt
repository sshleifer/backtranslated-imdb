Former private eye-turned-security guard dike his latest droning job and is immediately offered a chance to return to his former profession. His task: to haul a mysterious French woman who recently arrived in California ... and apparently the desire of lingerie. Try to update the movie noir genre, without enough stitches or wit (or involving plot dynamics) in the manuscript. Director and co-scenarioist Paul Magwood (who later claimed the image was edited without his involvement) does not give the impression of having great respect for "the 40s film his" Chandler "was carried off; his nostalgia is appropriate space, but also bitter tinged and somewhat indifferent Handling is curious, promising low key, and Warren Oates is well-molded as this 70's variant on the 'private dick' archetype, but the film has no snap. It's great to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the cast - Although it doesn't have much to do, and Caron's warm and cold running character is amazing all the way through. Live cinematography by Alan Stensvold, good location, but it doesn't come to any kind of cooking. * 1/2 from ****
