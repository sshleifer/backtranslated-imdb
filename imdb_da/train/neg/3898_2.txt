I'm terribly sorry I know Fa√übinder is still one of the greatest directors of the post-war era, and that most of his films are considered "masterpieces", but when I see "Lili Marleen" today, in 2004 wonder what everyone is up and about about this movie! The action is simply horrible - Hanna Schygulla is all smiling like an idiot! - Changes between Nazi glamor and battlefields are ridiculous, the whole movie looks like it was made within two days in a loft. Probably it was exactly the way, and many people seem to take this "real art", but for me this movie is simply poor and cheap. Compare this with Viscontis "La Caduta degli Dei" and tell me again that "Lili Marleen" is a good movie ...
