First of all, yes, animals have feelings. If you didn't know it already, then I think you are a moron. But let's assume that none of us are morons. We all know that animals have feelings, and we will now see how these feelings are evident in nature, right? <br /> <br /> What we get instead is a boring and ridiculously simplified documentary trying to show how animals are "human". The filmmakers are looking high and low for the footage of animals dealing with human behavior, and when that happens they say, "The monkey is almost human!" (it's actually a direct quote). <br /> <br /> Everything is in human terms. They waste time, theorize about what makes dogs "smile", but not even mention what a swinging tail means. The arrogance of these researchers is disgusting. They even go as far as showing chimpanzees dressed in human clothes and wearing a cowboy hat. I had expected an insightful documentary of animals on their own terms. I wanted to learn how the animals emulate in their own language. But instead, the researchers hold back on pedantic, anthropomorphic observations and assumptions. Add a cheezy soundtrack and pictures of chimpanzees "celebrate Christmas" and that was enough to turn my stomach. <br /> <br /> But it doesn't end there. Half of this documentary is not filmed in nature, but in laboratories and experimental facilities. All camera shots of chimpanzees are through steel bars, and we see how these monkeys are crowded together in their sterile concrete cages. A special beneficial moment is almost in the beginning (although you need to be quick to notice it), where a captive monkey says in sign language, "Do you want to go out. Hurry up." <br /> <br /> Obscure references are made for "stress testing" and psychological experiments that I rush to imagine. Baby monkeys are separated from their mothers at birth and get wireframe dolls to prove that baby monkeys want a "mother figure". And after 40 years of experimentation, smug researchers are trying themselves at the back to reach their brilliant conclusion: monkeys have feelings. <br /> <br /> A chimpanzee named "Washoe" has been in a concrete cage since 1966 for that purpose, and so she remains. We get a brief glimpse (again through columns) of her leaning against a concrete wall with a rather lacking expression. Personally, I do not need to see further experimental data. Washoe, I apologize for our whole species.
