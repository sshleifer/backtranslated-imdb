This is an in-name-only sequel to "A Christmas Story", originally called "A Summer Story." Ralphie tells her family adventures during the summer as they moved to a small hick town in the middle of the sky. The hilarity is unfortunately not the same. <br /> <br /> The original worked because of its irreverent character and honesty - everyone could relate to it. This is simply stupid and not fun at all. Charles Grodin's Last Movie - No wonder! It is one of his poorest roles. I was sorry for him. <br /> <br /> Mary Steenburgen gets a little to do, everything is formal, and you have to wonder why they even plagued. <br /> <br /> And I mean, come on now - a competition with spinning tops?! Unfortunately, it's the best part of the movie ...
