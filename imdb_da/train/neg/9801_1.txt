I remember that this show was on television when I was a kid back in the early 1990s, and there was this anger over children with greasy leotards who made kung fu on each other and ran around in plastic dinosaurs. It was called power rangers. I remember that the little kids would walk around and beat each other and then shirts and things from the show were banned in many school areas across the country because this show taught the kids to fight each other to solve their differences. <br /> <br /> I never really thought of this as a show, especially when better shows like The Tick played on Fox Kids. Most older teenagers always looked at power rangers in a ridiculous and passionate way, and it's not hard to wonder why. The recordings are at best ridiculous. The colored ranges costumes look like things you want to train out, and the dinosaurs look like plastic. Then you come into the play and of course the really ridiculous haircuts. All guys run around with earrings on, half of them have 90 mullets, and they always wear the same clothes every day and then change to leotard wearing power rangers. The toys are especially ridiculous and were joke by many late night talk show hosts. And of course, two of the worst movies have ever been made, and I think two of the worst movies ever made were based on this show, with almost all critics destroying both the movies and the ideas it was based on. . <br /> <br /> Power rangers are nothing more than a bad television company for particularly poor toy merchandising. As an adult I do not look at it, but rather as another embarrassment in the 1990s, children, fashion and guys show earrings.
