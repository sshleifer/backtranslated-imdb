"Pandemonium" is a horror movie spoof that comes out more stupid than fun. Believe me when I tell you, I love comedies. Especially comedy spoofs. "Airplane", "The Naked Gun" trilogy, "Blazing Saddles", "High Anxiety" and "Spaceballs" are some of my favorite comedies that spoof a particular genre. "Pandemonium" is not up there with these movies. Most of the scenes in this movie had me sitting there in stunned silence because the movie wasn't that fun. There are a few laughs in the movie, but when you see a comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a couple of times, and that's all this movie has for it. Geez, "Scream" had more laughs than this movie, and it was more of a horror movie. How bizarre is that? <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
