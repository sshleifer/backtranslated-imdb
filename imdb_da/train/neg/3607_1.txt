I start this review with a huge giant spoiler about this movie. No further reading ... here it comes, avoid your eyes! The main heart, the girl who always survives in other slasher films, is murdered here. There I saved you just 79 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> This is one of the cheap movies thrown together in the mid-slash era of the 80s. Despite the heroin being killed, this is just substandard junk. <br /> <br /> Both priests and college students get a bad rap here. They are depicted as overblown, sociopathic morons who have too many internal problems to cope with what resembles junior college campus life ... and college students get even worse. <br /> <br /> "Splatter University" is just gunk to put in your VCR when you have nothing better to do, even though I suggest seeing your main band, it would be more entertaining. <br /> <br /> This is characterized by (R) strong physical violence, gore, profanity, very short female nudity and sexual references. <br /> <br />
