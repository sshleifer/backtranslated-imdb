I loved Adrianne Curry before this show. I thought she was great on Top Model and was really happy when she won. I also liked Chris Knight, he seems like a good guy. But this show just made me SICK! I'm so angry with them both for what happened at that show. I don't care that they were different ages, I know that age cannot stand between love. But Adrianne, you had been together for only seven months. It didn't surprise me at all that he hadn't suggested. And I can't see the appeal of forcing anyone to marry before they're ready. If it's supposed to be, why not just enjoy each other's company and love each other and let it come naturally? Turning a wedding ring into a ball and chain was completely unnecessary, it is stupidly clear that Chris loves you, with or without a ring. And Chris, shame on breaking down and suggesting her anyway! You've been through two failed marriages, how could you hurry in another just because she put a fit? I hope the relationship lasts, but I really feel the marriage was premature and for all the wrong reasons. Maybe now they can breathe and find the right reasons to get married from within the marriage.
