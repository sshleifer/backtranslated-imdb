Maya is a woman without interests. She just dreams her life away and wonders why she doesn't feel satisfied. This could be an interesting topic. It would need a good story, a good attitude and good dialogues. It doesn't have any of these. This movie is totally boring. There are only lengths and no climax. The only climax is Shahrukh Khan. But even though I'm a big fan of his, I couldn't stand this movie. Even he can't make this movie exciting. The movie is not as bad as "king uncle", and if you are an artificial fan or like it slowly, you might like it. It's not fun, it's not interesting, it doesn't catch. My recommendation: Don't look at it.
