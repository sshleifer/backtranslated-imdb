For the past 10 years, I have worked in 3 different indie professional wrestling organizations, managed many pro wrestlers (including 2 Backyard Wrestling stars), worked on 2 different wrestling TV shows and made voice-overs and comments on many wrestling DVDs. I have never experienced the level of direct amateurish stupidity, lack of talent and skill and scary production quality found in the Splatter Rampage Wrestling. To mention this as a wrestling video of any kind is a direct abuse of the term. Shot with low-dollar camcorders, it's mostly home videos of kids playing battle in behind yards. The sound quality is poor, the video quality is poor, and the play is terrible. The "wrestlers" carry careful costumes with hand-drawn tee shirts and ski masks and hit each other with a variety of things and halfway mimics wrestling movements. Sometimes the "fighting" is on the grass. Sometimes on a backyard trampoline. EVERYONE is badly acted and executed with a shameless lack of any wrestling competence. In short, don't bother with this stink. Whether your interest in this DVD is entertainment or academic (both in my case), you will be terribly disappointed.
