Our teacher showed us this film in first class. I haven't seen it since. I just saw the trailer though. Does it look like a first class movie? I do not think. I was so horrified by this movie, I could hardly see it. It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting the little girl in half, and then there was the boy with ketchup! I was freaked out of this movie. Now, today, 20, I probably wouldn't feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that young children might not see this movie, even though it is PG. Be aware of the possible results to show this to children. I don't even remember what it was about, once was enough!
