When I started watching this movie, I saw the guy from Buffy, Xander and figured ah how wonderful it is that he still lives in movies. Now, a weird movie I can stand, as it is a good dose of strange, such as David Lynch movies, top songs, lost highway, etc. And you must be in the mood for one. However, this made me mockingly remember the crazy websites about there on conspiracy theory that makes absolutely no sense. I mean to come to Nazis who conspire with America to make an unholy trinity of evil forces? I was surprised they didn't mention the hollow ground in this movie with Hitler flying saucers and lizards. Perhaps if you had 60 grams of heroine with this movie, it would be a kind of reason, but seriously I do not admit drugs that I do not condone this film. It must be burned, shredded and forgotten, just as well, so Xander can get another play. However, it was not his play, it was okay, but the script just made no sense. Pardon.
