"ASTONISHING" scares the LA Times from the front of the DVD box. They must have referred to the fact that such a sad thing was ever released. The film is about a bunch of girls who have a disease that forces them to become cannibals and murder innocent people just to stay alive. Their skin peels all the way through the film, we also see cut legs, heads, etc. There is just as convincing as a Halloween Fuzzy Field set. There is a terrible lot to talk b * ll ** ks, a little human kitchen and a strange zombie hunter chap who imprisons the sick people in his closet attached to a chair before sticking them in the head and chopping them in bit ... <br /> <br /> You get the picture. Considering that there is no acting talent on the display and gore is ridiculously unrealistic, what is the meaning of all this farrago? Looking at the video box, the person responsible for it is an "underground cult director". Would it be like the strange religious cultures where they brainwashed you to think in a way when clearly the opposite is true? Because that is the only possible reason I can think of for anyone to derive pleasure from seeing this depreciation on tax. Then he compares in the same section with Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and George Romero. HAHAHAHAHA oh stop it. Now you're just stupid. <br /> <br /> Do you enjoy this movie? Are you offended by the above sentence? If so, be a member of the cult. Do they pay your wages? Do they let you see other family members? Do they need you to watch Andrew Parkinson's movies until you think he's the best director since A.Hitchcock? Tell ... it sounds like a Panorama special brew to me. And say the greeting to the critic of the LA times when you return to your colony, will you? 0/10
