I've finally seen INCUBUS after waiting 20 something odd years to see it, and it probably wasn't worth the wait all the time to see it. The INCUBUS is strictly by-the-number horror movie: invisible killer / monster raper and murder women in a small town. <br /> <br /> The movie goes like this: The movie opens with killing; so blah blah blah; more blah blah blah; then another killing; even more blah blah blah; continues with blah blah blah; another killing (surprisingly, huh?); blah blah, etc. ... <br /> <br /> The movie is completely predictable from start to finish. Even the stupid "big" red herring used throughout the film would not convince a 5-year-old. And I found out the secret identity of the incubator, the moment I saw the character, so when the "shocking" surprise ended, I was not shocked or surprised. In fact, it was so fun that I continued to chuckle days after I watched the movie. It's so stupid! <br /> <br /> Yet, the movie is so by-the-number that the "rock band" sequence is one of the few stand-out moments in this boring flick. It's a stand-out scene not necessarily because it's good, but because it's so funny and pointless: the movie playing on the big screen shows a rock video-like moment with a guy in red leather pants that gets his obviously fake long hair cut, all together this is edited with scenes of a girl being attacked in the cinema's washroom by the incubator. The best thing I could say about this movie is the movie I actually liked. But apart from that, there is almost nothing worth mentioning about INCUBUS, except that it is inadvertently fun.
