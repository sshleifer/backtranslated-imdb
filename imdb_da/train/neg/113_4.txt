Today I found "They all laughed" on VHS for sale in a rental. It was a really old and widely used VHS, I had no information about this movie, but I liked the references listed on the cover: the names of Peter Bogdanovich, Audrey Hepburn, John Ritter and especially Dorothy Stratten attracted me, the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it. I searched for IMDb and the user rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference. I looked in "Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003" and ?? wow ?? four stars! So I decided I couldn't waste more time and immediately see it. In fact, I just finished seeing "They all laughed" and I found it a very boring overstated movie. The characters are poorly developed and I spent many minutes understanding their roles in history. The reason should be fun (private eyes falling in love with the women they hunt), but I haven't laughed all the story. The coincidences of a big city like New York are ridiculous. Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if she were Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas or George Clooney, is quite ridiculous. Ultimately, the main attractions are the presence of Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten, murdered by his husband right after the release of this movie, and whose life was shown in "Star 80" and "Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story "; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen, the future of Mrs Keith Richards; It's always wonderful, though he's fifty years old, Audrey Hepburn; and the song "Amigo", by Roberto Carlos. Although I don't like him, Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the late 60s and is called his fans as "The King". I will hold this movie in my collection only because of these attractions (male Dorothy Stratten). My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Muito Riso e Muita Alegria" ("Many laughs and lots of happiness")
