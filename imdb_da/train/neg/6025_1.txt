The left behind is the kind of "we know what we know because we know it" movie that Christians (and most other naive people) need to help them feel like what they "think" and "think "(not" KNOW ") is right. But at the same time, I feel bad for the little guys, because it's not a well-made movie. It doesn't help any message. I work at a video store and I know the only reason people went to watch this movie because they were religious and they thought it was. Anyone on this earth who thinks they know what will happen in the future is wrong unless they think they know they don't know it. I have had enough (but only after I have had too much) of these people walking around with their nose in the air and thinking that a movie with a half-talented television actor matters to me. <br /> <br /> Please, if you love yourself, you will stay away. I refuse to go into detail about this movie (not because AI didn't see it (because I did it), B-it was too shocking for my atheist-self to handle (because it wasn't) or I really didn't I something to say badly about (because I do it.) The reason (which is a word that has not helped make this movie understand) is that I want this movie out of my head I want, that it was made of my head, I would like to see EVERYONE with the OPEN MEMORY out of my head, I want the message Kirk so proudly and coachly gives at the end of the movie out of my head. I just want all that was in my head BEFORE watching these movies there, all that is directly related to this movie is flowing in my head, GET OUT! My peaceful anger races. in this world went to the theater to watch this movie about what could happen in the future (but it will not) when they could have given the seven dollars plus to one any number of people, animals or rain forest charity. But if they did then they would not be able to "believe" in the fact that it is true, they may have to know what is. LEFT NOTE ZERO (out of ****)
