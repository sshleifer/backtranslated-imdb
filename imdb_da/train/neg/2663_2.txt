In an interview, David Duchovny said that he was unable to see for himself the first hour of this film - nor should you. The scene where he asks the owner of a house where a murder was committed if he can look around - change the name he gives, and he could have lifted his performance from almost any episode of X-Files. He's on autopilot for the whole movie. Brad Pitt is terribly overpowering.
