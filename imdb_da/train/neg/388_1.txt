I can't stand most reality shows and this one is worse than the one with Paris Hilton, and it's probably his company. But "you're fired" or "you're employed" for how many seasons now? After looking at the show, I would not like to work for the guy with his ego and everyone, and I think having paint dry has more entertainment valve. I would like to hear only one person get up and say "Donald I quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdresser". I see that he even tries to buy fame in the wrestling WWE. I hope he gets hurt so I don't have to see his pathetic face anymore. It must be sad to have fame so bad and not have the talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it. I would give this show a negative mark if I could, but it gets a 1 and it doesn't deserve it.
