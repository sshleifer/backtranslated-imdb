This movie is about a very young girl, Cassie, (Melissa Sagemiller) who leaves her family and heads to become a college freshman. One evening, Cassie and her friends decide to go to a wild party with lots of drinking and dancing, and Cassie rides with her boyfriend, whom she likes, but never told him she loved him. When Cassie drove, a car was stopped in the middle of the road, and she couldn't avoid an accident, and as a result there is a bloody loss of life with her boyfriend. Cassie gets very emotionally upset and has nightmares that cause her to get hallucinations about her boyfriend coming back to life and meeting men trying to murder her and she is struggling to find out who her real friends are, who will Have her dead and she will survive this whole horror trial. Cassie dreams that she is loved by her girlfriend after he died and finds another guy in his bed and is told she asked him to love. This is a way out movie, and not very good at all.
