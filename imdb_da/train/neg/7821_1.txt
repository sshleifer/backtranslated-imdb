Preview of movie producers before they released it? The script jumps from place to place without giving a great explanation. The beginning does not clarify whether it is a prequel or not. It starts with Superman's beginnings on Earth and then jumps to a point after the last movie - but does not pay particular attention to the viewer of this. Very confusing! The Superman himself is weak and needs Prozac. He is portrayed as a potential home winner, a stalker and a person who is clearly depressed and confused. This type of character rarely gives an interesting hero. The end is completely ridiculous. Superman, who joined a hospital, just made me kill him. I seriously wait for a SNL shit, where Superman appears on Maury Povich and Maury says, "The results are in - in the case of the child, Superman, you are a father." In summary - OK appears by this Superman and Kevin Spacey, but HORRIBLE script. The movie is basically unmatched.
