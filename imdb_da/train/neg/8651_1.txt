I saw the first 15 minutes and thought it was a real documentary (with an annoying overly dramatic "on camera" producer). When I realized that it was all going, I thought, "Why would I like to waste my time seeing this unwanted? So I turned it off and came online to warn other people. The signs do not work in a credible way. very immature emotions, for a guy traveling halfway around the world to a war-torn country, he acted as a child, and I do not believe that it was because "his character was so sorry about the bombardments in the trading center." > <br /> very tired and stupid. <br /> <br /> Have you seen "lost children of the city"? French dark fantasy movie about a guy kidnapping children and stealing their dreams ... I liked it !
