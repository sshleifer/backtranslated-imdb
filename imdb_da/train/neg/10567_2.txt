I thought this movie seemed like a case study on how not to make a movie for the most part. Being a filmmaker, I give it a 2 for consistency. The problems remain from the beginning to the end, as the plot is highly predictable using more and more pieces, if not all previous successful war stories. The computer-generated graphics were too much like watching a video game on points, and there seemed to be no attempt by the director to add some realistic quality to the story. I was interested in the budget to get an idea of ​​what to do with, but didn't find that information. <br /> <br /> It looked like this project shot the boundaries of a low budget movie too far, resulting in a production that draws the viewer along with the story without their imagination being engaged. The actors were not bad, but the plot needs more innovation.
