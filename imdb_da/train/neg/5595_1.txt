Wow ... OK. So after reading the little feud here I decided to watch this movie for myself. This movie is HORRIBLE. I stopped seeing it. I strongly recommend cleaning a cupboard instead of watching this movie, you become more spooked / entertained. <br /> <br /> It's low budget with bad acting. <br /> <br /> Who gives this movie 10s is completely incorrect and should be ignored. <br /> <br /> I am by no means connected to any of the other reviewers. <br /> <br /> Put simply, this movie is not worth watching. <br /> <br /> Very, very bad movie.
