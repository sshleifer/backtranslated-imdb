Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips from "Dead and Breakfast") returns to the house she grew up where she recently acquired from her late sister, unknown to her grandmother (Fay Dunaway), still living in it. Jennifer decides to sell it as she needs a lot of money for Granny's chagrin. She also begins to have troublesome recurring nightmares of a mysterious raven. There really was no one to relate to in this movie. Jennifer seemed cold, distant, unentimental, and narcissistic, while grandmother seemed to be foolish, sad and also narcissistic. The film is good and well-made, but with no one to empathize with, I found it hard to break into what happened to them. <br /> <br /> My grade: C-
