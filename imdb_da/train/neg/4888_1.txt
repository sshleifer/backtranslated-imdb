Nick Millard aka Nick Phillips should have left well enough alone when he made "Criminally Insane" 10 years before the release of this god-horrible waste of time and effort. The fact that the original "Criminally Insane" was less than an hour in length should have brought him into the fact that he probably had milked this story for anyone he should get out of it ... but instead choose he used TONS of recordings from the original in this too, even to the point of reusing the original opening credit sequence! Unfortunately, the rapidly growing Priscilla Alden did not save this one. Which little bit of original recordings were in this flick looks like it was filmed with a rented handheld camcorder! If this movie cost more than $ 100 to do, I would be very surprised and I would be just surprised if it did anything close to that amount! Avoid this and see the original instead!
