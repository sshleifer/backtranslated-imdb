I was hoping for some in-depth background information on the Apollo 11 mission, and what I got was some decent interview material with Buzz Aldrin Gene Krantz and others involved in the mission associated with overheated disasters that predicted sensationalizing voice-over in the worst tradition for television production. <br /> <br /> If you could cut voice-over and change the program's spin to a positive testament to how people can overcome setbacks to reach a goal out of the ordinary, it could have been good - but I feel that I've been wasting about 45 minutes in my life while watching a 60 minute program. I want those minutes back.
