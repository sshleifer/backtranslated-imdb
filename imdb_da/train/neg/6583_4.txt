Interesting idea and story that didn't work completely. <br /> <br /> When you watch the movie, you may feel so unhappy with the end as I did. I didn't really know who was to fight in the movie, Taye Diggs so bored as detective, the rest of the characters seem so one-dimensional and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> If the victim Alicia (Mia Kirschner) had been more of a nice girl, we could actually have enjoyed seeing the plot unfold and the perpetrator brought to justice. The problem was that she was as bitch as the other girls, turned from sweet girl to conjunctive opportunistic cokehead. I can't understand the moral message of this movie, and as a detective story and thriller it doesn't work.
