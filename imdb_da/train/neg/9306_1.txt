This movie is the worst excuse for a movie I've ever seen. To begin with, I would like to say that the front page of this movie is in some way misleading, if you think you are seeing a really scary horror movie with a monster slogan, you are sooo wrong. In fact, the killer isn't even a bit like the front cover, it's just a picture they must have found on Google and thought it looked cool. Talking about things they found and thought it was so cool, there is a scene in this movie where some of the band is searching for the vein in the old forest, so suddenly the screen cuts to a scene where there is a mother deer who cares it is young in a shine of sunlight ... do I seriously mean WTF ??? How is this relevant to the dark forests they migrate through? I bought this movie from a man in a market, hoping it would be entertaining if it wasn't horror then would it be fun at least? WRONG! Next day I give it to my work colleague riding me from the plague called S.I.C.K <br /> <br /> The bottom line is: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE !!!
