This god-forsaken movie is about three stupid millionaires who gather a lot of people to play a deadly game and the winner gets a million dollars. First of all, the play is terrible and the film makes no sense at all. It's not scary at least, it's so stupid that it made me laugh why it earned it 1 star. The film is not violent at all, but is pretty blurry and focuses mostly on women's breasts all the time, and some of the characters are very annoying and whiny. Plus, the monsters in this movie are so cheesy and fake and not scary that it just lets you throw something on the screen. Last but not least the end is horrible. I will not give it away if you are actually strange enough to see this piece of junk. AVOID ALL COSTS !!!!! <br /> <br /> Not rated (but must be R) for nudity, profanity and gentle gore.
