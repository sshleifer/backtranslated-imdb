First of all, I'm not easily scared ... Something except my few phobias, but this movie is absolutely horrible. This is not appropriate for kids at all! I had my mouth open all the time, it just shocked me. I couldn't believe how horrid it was for a children's movie, rabbits were brutally murdered! It is just unnecessary to be so scary and appreciated G. I recommend being over 8 to see this. But don't make me wrong, it was probably a good movie if I wasn't mentally meant to be a child. I can't believe a parent would allow one, let's say, 4 year old child to see this. It's just too intense and complicated, not to forget gory, for young children. I'm goodbye over 4 and I was shocked by the violence. I do not recommend
