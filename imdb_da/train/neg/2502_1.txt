Yet another Die Hard straight to video rip off with cardboard crooks ?? How many more of these god horrible cheap (and bad) rip off the more popular action movies from the late 1980s and early 1990s are still out there? For the record (not what you really want to worry about), this is yet another blatant rip off of a combination of Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed ​​2 complete with a complete complement of clichés and predictability. <br /> <br /> Non-descriptive villains are the usual selection of cardboard cut out gun toting thugs sent in various ways as the film progresses, the hero is of course an ex-cop or something that has family and attitude issues and Of course, he brings to the party not only the usual emotional baggage, but also a matching piece of eyeshadow and his annoying son. The supposed luxury craft liner running between Florida and Mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry ?? This goes somewhere to explain how it seems to be larking around on a rusty cross channel ferry ?? in New Zealand! The play is like wood as a deck, the manuscript is crooked, one line predictable, the villain completely unheard of and the plot has holes in it that you could sail a boat through. <br /> <br /> There seems to be a never ending tide of this kind of rip off just to video waste polluting late night slots of TV and DVD buying trays of supermarkets everywhere (though even this movie is so bad it has yet to see a dvd release yet but give it time!) Is there any chance of anything at least half decent made, semi credible and most important ORIGINAL?!? No, I didn't think ??
