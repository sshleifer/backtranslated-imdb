If I could I would give ZERO stars to this, but unfortunately I have to give one ... <br /> <br /> There is no single scene I could laugh about ... but the game didn't make me laugh either. So if you are a little poorly inhibited, go to your local cinema, watch this movie and give it 10 stars that some people here already did. <br /> <br /> But for me ... in a movie where children are shot dead for humor ... good taste goes over the edge ... this was the third time I wasted my time watching a ball -film and it was definitely my last! <br /> <br /> 0/10 ... I'm ashamed to be from the same country as Uwe Boll! <br /> <br /> PLEASE KEEP HOME FROM MAKING MORE MOVIES !!!!!
