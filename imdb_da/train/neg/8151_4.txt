Leslie Sands' styled game "Deadlock" becomes a bad choice vehicle for Bette Davis and Gary Merrill, right after their joint success in "All About Eve". After killing his spouse, a shameful woman is visited by her husband's best friend, who departs as his husband when others begin to stop at the house. Irving Rapper, one of Bee's top directors of its highest years, is unfortunately unable to raise this ridiculous material, where Davis is curiously dismissed and detained until the monstrous finale (where she fortunately pulls all stops). Production and support cast strictly second rate; only for Bette Davis finishers. * 1/2 from ****
