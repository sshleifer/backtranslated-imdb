When someone recovers a classic movie, remake is always unfavorable compared to the original. There is also a chance that remake is so radically different that it is just too unknown to the audience. <br /> <br /> Now the 1973 television version of "Double Indemnity" has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the 1944 original. The main difference is that remake just seems to have no energy at all. Fred MacMurray was great as the lecherous hiring insurance agent Walter Neff in the original; Richard Crenna just seems world-wide and tired. Edward G. Robinson brought great manic energy to his role as MacMurray's chief Barton Keys; Lee J. Cobb, a fine actor, seems almost sorry for the procedure. Samantha Eggar is all wrong as the conniving, back-stabbing Phyllis Dietrichson; while Barbara Stanwyck was just as awesome in this vicious role, Eggar is too polite and masculine and just seems to be out of place. <br /> <br /> In the role of Robert Gaines as Robinson's boss Norton and John Fiedler, Robert Webber takes the Porter Hall role as the decisive witness, bringing some life to the movie. In particular, the Webber Norton role recreates well in a 1970s context. <br /> <br /> But after the movie starts, it's all just kind of lies there, without any life or electricity. This is a movie that should never have been recreated.
