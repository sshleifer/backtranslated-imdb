This movie was way overhyped. Many of the viewers who thought this was "amazing" must have been in the old school movie because the whole movie is in the past. At first I thought the movie just showed something from the past, so I expected it to be dimly dreamy as lighting on the signs to pass, but it just went. Basically, it was a movie trying to blend the future with the past, and the 2 do not mix very well in this movie, even with special effects. You could actually see the blue screen the actors were working on. There are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did, so there's no need for critics to hype this movie up and say "it's the greatest movie ever made". It's just bad on a stick. Nor did it help that the story was sooo crazy. I don't understand why Hollywood agreed to produce this movie, nor do I understand how actors / actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this. It's almost as if everyone is reading the script and forgot to read the fine print ... "It will all happen on a computer". This was a movie that should have been on a movie network because nothing about this movie was revolutionary. I'm very sorry for paying money to see this. Whatever you do, don't play your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow.
