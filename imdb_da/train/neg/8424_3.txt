This film can be judged from three points of view: As a story, as a profile of Amin, as a fictional thriller. <br /> <br /> It fails like history, it mentions passing the coup that threw out Obote, expelling the Asians, and having the Entebbe hi-jack as a background, but not in any chronologically coherent timeframe. <br /> <br /> As a profile of Amin, it may have been interesting because Forest Whitaker is incredibly good and if it was a better movie, he would get an Oscar. (He got it - which shows that the Oscar voters don't see the movies they are voting for.) It ignores relevant historical episodes in the novel, which observed Amin and Uganda's history from the doctor's point of view. Instead, it tells the depicting doctor and his impossible love life from Amin's point of view. But the story told is the only event that Amin was probably innocent. <br /> <br /> As a fictional thriller, there is no plot to hold it together. The beginning is tight - it takes cinematic freedoms with the novel, but sets the story up. The doctors' character is well-defined, but is lost in the second half of the film that suffers as a result. Why does the doctor decide to stay in Kampala is wrongly explained - seduced by power? Why he is friendly with no one is strange. The character of the vein in the novel has been lost because the scooter has an affair instead of the black doctor - a ridiculous interference that does not seem to be weakly credible, but allows the film's authors to show the Amine's sharpness close to hand. The man called horse bite at the end is risible. <br /> <br /> Finally in 1971, Uganda drove to the left, not right, the plate was three letters and two or three numbers - and where is Equator tusks?! <br /> In short - if you've never heard of Amin, you might spend two hours watching this movie to appreciate Forest Whitaker's play, but the last hour will drill you into confusion. If you know Uganda or have read the book - you cannot see the movie - it will only push you. And if you want to know why the doctor was so stupid - he wasn't.
