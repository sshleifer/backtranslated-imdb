Add to the list of caricatures: a southern preacher and "congregation", a torch singer (Sophie Tucker?), A dancing choir, and The Mills Brothers - it only makes it worse. Despicable burlesque of "Negro" artists who themselves often appear in movies to parody themselves and their race. Although "Negro Comedy" may have been accepted on its day, it is extremely offensive today and I doubt it was ever fun. Although I would not have been offended, I do not think I would have laughed at the weak attempts at humor. As an 11-year-old white boy, I may not have understood any of it.
