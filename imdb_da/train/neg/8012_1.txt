As a lesbian, I am always looking for movies related to gays and lesbians. But with this kind of stupid out there - it would be enough to discourage any audience. <br /> <br /> I was waiting for something to happen - something! - a story to develop or just to make some sense. Neither appeared. It was just meaningless scenes that were not related to anything. The film failed to convey any kind of story or depth to the character. <br /> <br /> After an hour or more of this nonsense, I simply knocked it off. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time on this absurdity. <br /> <br /> 1 star - and it doesn't even deserve it.
