Rex Reed once said about a movie ("Julia and Julia" to be specific) that it looked like it was shot through pomegranate juice. I was reminded of what I was spinning through Purple Butterfly. This seemed to be shot through gauze. The story was boring and it was not helped that for large parts of scenes, the actors' faces were literally out of focus or would only come into focus after longer periods of time. <br /> <br /> Everyone also saw the same thing, so it was difficult to distinguish between the characters. I call this the "Dead Poets Society" syndrome. <br /> <br /> There was no one to care about, no one to get interested in dramatically, and the movie does not shed any light on a very interesting period and set of circumstances. <br /> <br /> A total disappointment.
