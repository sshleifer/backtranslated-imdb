This movie is horrible. The manuscript is bad, the manuscript is mediocre, and even the sex scenes are worthless. The excitement and plot of the original film is completely missing. This film was shot in a dark, shady and monochromatic style (a la "World of War") which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film. Greg Morrisey's brooding character shows a facial expression throughout the film. The twists of the original plot are lacking here; the few that exist are simply anticlimatic. The only highlight is Sharon Stone's performance as Catherine Tramell, continued faithfully in this sequel, but it is not enough to cope with the other shortcomings. The only fact that a "Basic Instinct 3" should be made would be if Michael Douglas agrees to join the cast.
