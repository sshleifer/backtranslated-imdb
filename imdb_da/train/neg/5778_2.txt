Okay, so I've been dying to watch this movie. Stoked about, "who's who" in horror land that's in the movie .... Well, my friend rented this, brought it over, and we started to see it. It must be a comedy .... I didn't even taste until 40 min. The marking. Does it have to do with the budget? At all, there are actually movies out there that cost close to absolutely nothing and they are amazing (for me anyway). Also, while looking at this movie, I couldn't help realizing the similarities (ie, STEALING) to a low-budget indie movie titled "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE", read my review about it (it damages this movie BTW). <Br /> <br /> This movie ... it had potential it really did. It had the "star force", stolen plot (lets the movie behind the scenes to make a movie ... IE ... "ACTRESS APOCALYPSE" .... seriously, this scares me the more I think about) ... it could really have been fun. A lot, some of the jokes fall flat. The action is okay for what it is. But it turned on, was not fun, and the plot was totally stolen. <br /> <br /> I give this a two because it wasn't so good, but that's the only reason.
