I've seen all kinds of "Hamlet" s. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Branagh was most ambitious, Mel Gibson was quick and to that point Laurence Oliviers was the best hands down. But now we come to Maximilian Schell at Bard. <br /> <br /> One is a dubbed version of a German television production by William Shakespeare's venerable chestnut. But if there is a slower, more plodding, more lethargic and poorer-staged version out there somewhere, it must have been traded at school level. <br /> <br /> Having seen it on MST3K, Mike and the robots help jolly good jabs on the old boy who punctures the depth of black and white television, Shakespeare and wisdom (?) by Germans who performs an English game and make it look like an Ingmar Bergman reject. <br /> <br /> Of course, the best parts are the MST grids. Best Lines? "I want to trigger the great Dane", "I don't think so," breathe "" Meet the Beatles "," Hello father, will you help me with my science project "and my personal favorite, during a party -" Garrison Keillor leaves Germany (YAAAY !!) ". <br /> <br /> But then there is Schell who plays Shakespeare's greatest character, just like a department store mannequin would, not just as expressive. There is no doubt he is a great actor, but here he comes out as well as Paul Newman in "The Silver Chalice." Have you ever seen one? You GOTTA see these two on a double bill! <br /> <br /> Finally, this is an example , where it is true that you are much better off just reading the book, at least the book has not been dubbed by Ricardo Montalban. <br /> <br /> Only a star for this "Hamlet"; MST3K version. <br /> <br /> Good night, not so cute prince.
