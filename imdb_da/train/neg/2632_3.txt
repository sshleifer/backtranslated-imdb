It makes me judge a movie with many of my favorite actors, places and genres, ie. Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, D.C. and political thriller, but 'The Sentinel' really hits a low. It was as if they had a good idea up front, signed the right throw and had some good city shots and then took a vacation so the remaining crews improvised the rest. And I wish I could blame it for another boring performance from Basinger (I don't just feel that she is one of the worst actors in Hollywood, but I still steam more than a decade later that she was the one the only and definitely the only bad actor in the movie, to win a play Oscar for 'LA Confidential.') But she was not the only problem. Sutherland who I love as Jack Bauer at '24' again plays ?? Jack. I miss his old 'A Time to Kill' or 'A few Good Men' days. Douglas certainly avoided trading and calling this one. Plot: Someone, any Secret Service traitor, would like the president dead and Douglas (randomly) is framed. Will anyone believe in him? In fact, no spoiler here: As soon as they came up with the subplot halfway through, it's over before you know it. And why would anyone (s) have the president dead? Is it being revealed in the sequel? Too many plot holes, too many doors opened and never closed and for predictable 'The Sentinel' is. If you only watch a movie a year, you can't know who the pier is, but anyone who is familiar with these types of movies or even just watched a 'Law & Order' episode you know in the first few pictures. Was it terrible? Not really, cinematography was good, and despite Sutherland playing Jack again, he still has it.
