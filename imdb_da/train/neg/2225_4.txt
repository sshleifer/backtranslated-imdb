Honestly, I can't understand why this movie is doing so well here, nor why Bakshi himself thought it was his finest movie. I am a big fan of Bakshi's previous work - especially 'Heavy Traffic' and 'Wizards', but honestly 'Wizards' (1977) was the last good movie he made. Then he turned to the mainstream, starting with the Devil's Lord of the Rings, and then barking with Frank Frazetta's sword and gravity for 'Fire and Ice'. What can I say? The story is pueril, the animation is TV quality - I insist that it is considerably worse than his 70s thing - and while 'Wizards' had real imagination, quirkiness, a beautiful background art and an underground adult sensitivity, 'Fire and Ice' is only designed for 14-year-old boys and has the intellectual divide of Robinson Crusoe on Mars. <br /> <br /> Yes, if you liked the books, you like it here. In my opinion, this was just another blip in the picture of quality after 'Wizards', from which Bakshi was never restored (although he has made some decent TVs recently) <br /> <br /> 4.5 out of 10
