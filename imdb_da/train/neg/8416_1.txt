It makes sense to me that this movie gets raves from Hollywood because it's often in Hollywood, it's just a popular competition. It also makes sense when you think that people who like the movie can just react to the myriad of songs spat on you instead of the content of history. But this movie is overstated and overblown. Eddie Murphy just looks ridiculous. By no means does Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles give the Oscar-rated performance so many have raved before the movie was straight. I can't even believe that Condon is set up to be nominated for an Oscar Oscar as all he did was put together an album. Glitz does not replace any story. A bunch of songs doesn't make a movie.
