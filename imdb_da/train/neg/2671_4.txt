** MAG INCLUDING SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The titular topless heroine saves another beautiful child and her father (an eccentric professor whose tribal helmet is broken into one shot and whole in the next) from a moth eaten , dime store mummy and nasty Nazis out to - what more? - Build a fourth kingdom. Misty's costume, as in some other wimmen, becomes skimpier as the film rolls on. The last part of the film is devoted to long-lasting lesbian action; In fact, this recording gets really boring, really fast, which says more about the critters behind the camera than the curly creatures in front of it. MISTY gets its nominal plot out of the way first and fast, and then gives undivided attention to nudity and soft sex. This makes MUMMY RAIDER a return to movies made in the 1960s by guys like Stan Borden, David F. Friedman and Harry Novak. Just think: If this wonders had been twisted four decades ago, it would have been playing for years on 42nd Street along with WHAM BAM THANK YOU SPACEMAN and KISS ME QUICK. As it is, MISTY MUNDAE MUMMY RAIDER went directly to home video. Grab it, quickly, before it goes out of print.
