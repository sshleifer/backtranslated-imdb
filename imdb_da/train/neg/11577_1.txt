The director is trying to be Quentin Tarantino, the screenwriters trying to be Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger trying to be Faye Dunaway, the late James Coburn trying to be Orson Welles, Michael Rooker trying to be Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore trying to be Faye Dunaway ( older version) Cameron Diaz tries to get out of the frame as fast as she can (successfully), don't ask for Joanna Going. Eric Stoltz and James Spader try to hide their embarrassment with these crappy things. It delivers endless, meaningless dialogue and very little action. <br /> <br /> Tulsa is a town with beautiful elevator lobbies, an art deco church by Bruce Goff, and a lovely bubbly mansion by Frank Lloyd Wright. Visit Tulsa, don't see this movie. It doesn't do the location justice.
