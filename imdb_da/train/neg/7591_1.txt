This film is based on the novel by John Fante. Can anyone tell me why? I see absolutely no reason why this fine book should be adapted this way. If you want to make a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek, how can you possibly connect to Ask The Dust? - And if you wanted to make this story a movie, why would you make it a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek? I don't get it. <br /> <br /> The adaptation of the story is poorly made and if you have read the book and liked it, I'm almost sure you don't like what Towne did with it. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie you may find the casting weird, the acting and cinematography is just a little overdone. But you hope for the best. I was really hoping for this movie. I would actually be fine. But it just gets worse and it's as simple as that: Whether you're reading Phantom's novel or not, it's not a good movie. Just another romantic melodramatic Hollywood production combined with poor acting, lack of structure and - of course - lots of pictures of Colin Farell's naked butt. <br /> <br /> I could complain a lot more about this movie, but why waste my time. I have seen it. Alright. I had to see it because I liked the book so much and was curious. And I'm very disappointed. <br /> <br /> 1/10 is for Colin's cute little mustache at the end of the movie. So sweet ... Had he used it all the time, I would have given it 2/10.
