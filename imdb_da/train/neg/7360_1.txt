This is one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. This is mainly due to much of the factual disagreement (as an obvious agent that constitutes a bank loan officer while making it clear that he is talking to someone through a line or the scene where the scientists assume it is safe to enter in a room where a virus has been released, even though it has not found a viable host, it does not mean that it will never find one), the cheap sets (the bank looks as if it was poorly designed to look like a dungeon ) and the bad action. It is the story of an organized crime group that has successfully stolen a capsule of the deadly virus. The head honcho, who decides to remove it from a bank's security box, does so while a bank's heist goes down, at the same FBI agents being informed about this, and at the same time triggering a terrible earthquake. Needless to say, the aftermath of the earthquake is cluttered in more ways than one. However, the results do not lead to an enticing action movie, but instead one that has been obviously z-grade junk from the beginning of the film. (Maybe that's why some of the screens on the packaging appear to be created with computer graphics rather than being actual screenshots from different sequences of the movie). What the hell Ron Perlman did in this, I have no idea. I wonder if he was so embarrassed to be in it as I should have seen it.
