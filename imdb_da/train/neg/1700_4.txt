In movies, I feel as though it should be more than just art. I think it should be more than that, a way to tell a story on the screen. This short from David Lynch tells a story but not much of one. I felt it was fun, but for the bizarre to be a comedy. It's good movie production, but there really is nothing else for it. As I have said before, I'm a big David Lynch fan, but I get frustrated with some of his work because I don't see a need for it at all. This is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far, but I know he still has a ton of talent and I'm excited to see what he has in store for us in the future. If you like Lynch, check this out, but don't be surprised when you don't like it very much.
