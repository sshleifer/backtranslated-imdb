I am generally more willing to be open minded about room coms than many, but it was simply not a very good attempt. It has nothing to do with comparisons with the British original - have not seen and doubt I will. It has a lot to do with a meandering plot, lack of chemistry between leaders and a benign performance / character from the supposed male lead (Jimmy Fallon). <br /> <br /> Fallon is wearing the clothes and hairdresser of a 15-year-old and appearing a decade younger than that. He was supposed to be a teacher you see, and of course it is well known that the school dictates the world of love to hiring people who are less mature than the children they claim to teach. The character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that I doubt whether any actor could have made him feel comfortable, but old ones like John Cusack or Adam Sandler could have given it a shot. Not Fallon who is not fun or an actor, but seems to think he is both. Not even in the film's lifetime do you think either Fallon in his role or believe that there is any way these two people should or would be together. At the end of the film, there is a scene where Barrymore (who was cute as usual, but couldn't bear it alone - it's hard to have a personal romance) tells Fallon that it's too far, too much, and she moves on. And instead of feeling bad about the scene, or sorry Fallon, you are actively hanging on her - finally she does what she should have done months ago. But of course, the plot mechanics will not allow it to be the end of it (an end that could actually have spoken about this mess), and instead we see the rational career girl throwing it all away to hunt for this childish idiot and encourage his delusions. Of course, that meant being nice and satisfying, but it actually made me more inhibited than anything else.
