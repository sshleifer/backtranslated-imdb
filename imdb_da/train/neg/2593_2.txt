American Pie: Beta House is kind of limbo between genres. On one side it is a plot without plot and get real clever jokes. On the other hand, it is porn that is a bit too soft core to actually hit the viewers. Beta House is essentially a collage of sex scenes - some humiliating, other lamps attempting to humor - with a few thin plot points thrown into an attempt at cohesion. The characters are barely two-dimensional, and most developments rely on knowledge of Naked Mile, and the "important" plot scenes are so far apart that you wonder why the authors themselves felt the need for a story. <br /> <br /> In fairness I didn't go into this movie without expectations. I liked the original three American Pie movies, and thought Band Camp and Naked Mile were regular rentals. I thought Naked Mile was almost good enough to be released in theaters, and when I saw some of the same characters returning to the Beta House, I was excited to see this rate. I was aware that there would be many scenes of debauchery and sexual humiliation in several forms. And it was fine with it, because in the past these scenes were backed up by history and were well integrated into the plot. In the Beta House, it's almost as if the authors forgot why the formula in the other AP movies worked. They used too much energy in the nudity that they forgot to actually write a story. <br /> <br /> This movie is a disappointment and not even worth a dollar. The wit is lame, the story is non-existent, and the porno is too tame if that's all you really care about.
