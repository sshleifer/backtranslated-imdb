This may be the worst movie I've ever seen. Again I made the mistake of buying the movie because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front deck also looked good. (After purchasing this and the movie "Malevolence", which I have also reviewed here, I have learned my lesson). I love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm. This is probably done in the Texas forest, but was probably filmed in the instructor's backyard. The production was probably the worst I have ever seen. The actors were definitely the WORST. The story had nothing to do with what the back cover said. I even tried to sell it to F.Y.E and another "mom and pop" store that bought second-hand DVDs and wouldn't take it either. Thats how horrible this bad miserable excuse for a movie was. I've seen some bad movies before (Troll 2 for example) but it definitely takes the cake. I didn't think there was a worse movie than "Troll 2". Boy was I wrong! Do not buy this movie unless someone hands it free to you, but even if you are stuck with it unless you throw it out, which is what I have to do !!!!
