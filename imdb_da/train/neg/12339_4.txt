This comedy has some tolerably fun things in it, surrounded by a lot of scary things. Almost every scene involving citizens' servants and their stupid antics is a waste of time. And the plot is so sloppy that it makes you wonder if they actually had a script ready before they started filming this, or they simply did it all while walking together. (* 1/2)
