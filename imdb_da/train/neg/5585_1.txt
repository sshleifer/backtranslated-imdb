The problem is the character of the characters in the movie. Man to man shows a British anthropologist who kidnaps two pygmies and takes them to Scotland and then realizes that they are not animals or subhumans, but actually equals themselves. The problem is the role of the pygmies in the movie - two people being kidnapped, treated like animals, yet having such a low, stereotypical role within the film. The kidnapped (British anthropologist) ends up being the hero's heroic movie because he "manages" to relate to the pygmies ... No notion of how the two hostages feel their point of view of their trial ... I find it is a low movie with a one-sided fundamentally racist view ... it never manages to move away from the white man's view
