This really does not do the blues justice. It starts out badly with pictures from the voyager probe and Blind Willie McTell (or was it Blind Lemon Jefferson? Any blind anyway) apparently narrating from outer space (?) And telling us life stories from various blues musicians. Corny as it is, it may be the visually most interesting part of this documentary. Then, the only thing that sees actors incompet the classic melodies recorded in fake 20s black and white intercut with similar ones like Beck and Shemekia Copeland, which cheats the same songs subsequently. This is a good unit to show us why the old Blues greats were really that big but it doesn't make it a compelling view. There is hardly anything here that could justify making it a movie and not a radio game. No one should be forced to see these poorly executed reenactments. It's a shame for Wenders, Scorsese and especially for Blues. Avoid at all costs.
