For 50 years after World War II, the United States was in a state where the key segments of the economy were dominated by military interests. At the same time because of the draft and the wars, everyone in the community had served or been associated with someone who had. <br /> <br /> This allowed a mini-genre based on the concept of American wisdom in the midst of an inflexible military machine. Sometimes this machine was non-US military, for example in prisoners of war. Once removed, stories in other machines are: science fiction and corporate, but they always refer to this military genre, and actually testosterone shoots are even referred to their comic siblings. <br /> <br /> You can track it, I think, maybe starting in the comic, meaning Amrican, episode of "The Great Escape" that immediately created TeeVee's offspring in "Gomer Pyle" and "Hogan's Heros". Then another wave triggered by "Catch 22" and "MASH", both had been real life, then books, then movies and in the MASH case, so TeeVee. <br /> <br /> But before all that was "Phil Silvershow" about a Sergeant Bilko, this came from "Mister Roberts." A happy con man who only committed harmless crimes, and only in response to an overly coarse system that tried to limit his life. It was the day when TeeVee turned out to be important. You absorbed them instead of just carrying them to work to talk about. It was not very smart in any way, except finding the crack between what we wanted in control and freedom. <br /> <br /> The one big zone where Americans worked out how they think of forgiveness, even initiated lies in a military context, a zone that has been granted by one of our political parties here. <br /> <br /> /> Because it's big, it pays sometimes in grin. "Stripes" was beautiful, fun, I thought. In fact, the twist of the misfits had defeated serious enemies, such as folding in some "dirty boxes." And sexual adventure. <br /> <br /> Now this before the cultural wars escalated. It tries to touch the sweet spot, like other remakes handled by Steve Martin. It's so scary that you actually stand for the army to be the strongest player. Yet another way to track how societies train the handles on military power. <br /> <br /> Ted's Evaluation - 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.
