From the star "MITCHELL", From the director of "Joysticks" and "Angel's Revenge" !!! These are taglines that would normally prevent me from watching this movie. And the worst thing is that all the above statements are true !!! Ugghhh ... Joe Don Baker eats every other five minutes in this movie. It's like a bad remake of "Coogan's Bluff"
