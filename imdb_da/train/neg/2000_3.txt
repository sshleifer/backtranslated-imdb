I found the pace to be glacial, and the original story was blown far out of proportion to the content. My wife slept most of it, and I didn't try to wake her up because I felt she didn't need anything. When Holmes and Watson enter the house and then potentially are caught, it is unclear how they could hide all their access and intrusion tools so quickly. It is also unclear how the door to the survey is locked and prevents the servants from entering. What confused me was right at the end when there was a glimpse of the broken statute. I have no idea what this should represent.
