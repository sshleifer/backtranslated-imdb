If you've seen Sholay in 1975, don't watch this movie. If you haven't seen Sholay in 1975, you should see it. But don't watch this movie. This movie has all the ingredients that might have gone wrong with making a remake of Sholay. <br /> <br /> Amitabh 'Babban' Bachchan plays the role of a psychic villain for the best (Probably the only 40 minutes of the wheel that should not be burned). If you remove the rest of the movie and just watch amitabh play around with its character, it would still be worth watching. But like Insp. Narsimha, Mohanlal doesn't do justice to his talent. Ajay Devgan (Heero) is extremely mundane and the only reason to think, they throw Prashant Raj into the role of Raj is because he has a striking resemblance to Amitabh in his youth. Sushmita Sen carries well, with grace and makeup. But the price for "WORST performance and any roll to date" must go to Nisha Kothari. She manages to break down her plays to such levels that even high school drama would overshadow her performance. <br /> <br /> If you have a deadly enemy, take him to this movie. :)
