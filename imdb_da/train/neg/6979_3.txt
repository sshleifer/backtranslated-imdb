I also watched this movie and although it is very well done, I found it a heart cutter and would not recommend it to women who have small children. The terror of this mother's face when she sees her child being driven over by a train is really heartbreaking. And the sad thing is - internally she dies. Eventually she goes back to the Applacian Mountains. All the money in the world she does from making dolls does not hide the grief she has. I remember her desperate face as she withdraws money from her clothes and tries to get her baby cured. I am surprised that this movie is taking place in Detroit because when I looked at it, I thought people would have come to Cincinnati, Ohio. This was also a route for the poor from the mountains.
