This series was the CBS network response to the success of the Big Valley. It was a 90 minute western like the ABC program was. Although it was an answer, it didn't have things to make it past season 2. <br /> <br /> The problem was really lost on this show. For example - in an episode Johnny gets his eye out of a stick. Amazingly, by the end of the show, Johnny had healed completely. Along with that, the stories here were not as close as The Big Valley. <br /> <br /> This is a show that I do not want DVDs off and greetings hope they will never be released. Think when CBS runs out of much, used the many familiar settings again. This was one of the last western series CBS produced as Westerners was not really popular in the 1970s.
