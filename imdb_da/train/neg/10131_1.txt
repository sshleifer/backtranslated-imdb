Well, once and for all, I can put an end to the question: "What's the worst movie ever made ... ever?" It's Flight of Fury, starring and co-written by Steven Seagal. Sure there are lots of infamous bad movies, but this one takes the cake because it takes so seriously. It's a Romanian movie that speaks to how far Romania should go to catch up with Bollywood. It also speaks of how completely devoid of intellect and talent Steven Seagal has become. This movie is so bad that you literally feel offended after seeing it and have to crouch in the corner of the shower and cry, knowing that nothing will make you feel clean again. <br /> <br /> It was only released on video (I can't imagine why) and I suppose the workers who had to make the DVDs had to wear protective equipment and receive regular advice.
