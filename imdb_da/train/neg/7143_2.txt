This movie has some of the most amazing cars I've ever seen in a movie and certainly the hottest women, but I have to say it's still one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Here's the plot, and if you read it with a little bend, you also have that play. <br /> <br /> Begin by bringing characters, warm woman singing (blatant lip synchronization). Music agent or producer comes in, believes that she is fantastic asking her to drive. She turns down too many bad memories. Flash for war hero, back from war, has several battles and becomes movie hero with attitude that he is better than everyone. Drive away in fast exotic car. Brother runs, then dies. Completely avenge death, cut away to get weapons from friend. (You have never seen this friend before or after, but really seems to like him) Are you sure you want to do this; Yes; I mean you are absolutely sure; Yes, give me weapons; are you really sure yes; OK, I think I can't talk you out, be careful, I love you. Now he is going to blow up his uncle's house, which owned the car, his brother drove. Finds a woman, decides to save her, she runs away, and he doesn't stop killing his uncle. Now there is a race to finish the movie. Oh yeah, you have to throw in a more scene with bad people coming in to beat people who don't really matter, but maybe it adds a little plot. Race is not even so exciting, of course it ends with two cars, and one that has to win is thrown into a surprise. <br /> <br /> OK, I just saved you $ 7.00. You can send all your money to me because I should have given you the same amount of enjoyment that this movie does. Don't make me wrong, the cars are amazing, and Nadija is beautiful, but it's really a horrible movie.
