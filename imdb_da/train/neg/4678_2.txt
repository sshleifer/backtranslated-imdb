This movie had some other aline kickers, but it's an old story that simply could never happen. Navy protocols could never break down so much that a crew much less an XO could ever go so far against the captain. I'm taking Dr. Strangelove one day if I want to see this plot. Side note - US Navy did not support this movie.
