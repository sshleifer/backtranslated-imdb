Oh, brother. The only reason this very annoying movie avoids getting the overall "bomb" from me is that it is at least historically remarkable is the first Three Stooges movie (since they were not yet alone and still with the painful scary Ted Healy). But even as a prolonged Stooges fan I have to say that the young Moe, Larry and Curly are badly used here as three zany assistant guardians of Mr. Healy's higher chief guard. They aren't highlighted steadily through the movie, and their stupid, on-and-off stints measure them more like zany overactive cartoon characters trying to be hard to entertain. Most of this toothache deals with Jack Perle seeking in vain to get some chuckles from the audience himself as a man imitating Baron Munchausen (here is a good example of the level of humor: "I am protesting!" "For what reason?" "Coffee grounds ! "). His sidekick is none other than a young Jimmy Durante, but even Schnoz himself is a drilling.
