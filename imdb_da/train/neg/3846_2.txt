W. Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage should be English-language classic. If so, much must be lacking in the movie version here. Phillip's (Leslie Howard) attraction to Mildred (Bette Davis) is so inexplicably that the scenario seems like a post-breakup tale of a relationship from the man's point of view. Being a family lawyer I have heard many such accounts; the man portrays himself as noble and always corrected, and the woman is a hellion who has no other purpose than to exploit the man. In fact, unless one is willing to laugh at the social assumptions of the film maker, this is an unpleasant movie to watch. Phillip even worships Mildred when she brings over an indefinite fathers, but the real highlight comes when Phillip allows Mildred - upset and now of dubious reason - the free run of his apartment with predictable results. Bette Davis was attractive for about five years of her life, but that period did not arise here. In fact, at the end of the film, she looks a lot like the Baby Jane character she wanted to play thirty years later. I note how Howard's character is always impeccably dressed and embellished. It tells me that Phillip craves middle class respectability. One could not run from a woman with a course Cockney accent fast enough. Phillip is, for most of the film, a student; such a person would have been more credible if he was younger and had the unpleasant appearance that speaks the low income and low self-esteem that often accompanies student status - an English Raskolnikov as it wants. And balanced it by giving Mildred a modicum of charm.
