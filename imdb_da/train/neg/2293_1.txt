If this series were to be an improvement over Batman - The Animated Series, I believe that it didn't succeed terribly. Draw the drawing is miserable ... (Catwoman looks awful, for example) But what really annoyed me is that it made Batman look like a kind of wimp that just can't take care of itself in a battle without using two, even three sidekicks. I mean, he is Batman, for God's sake! I know the cartoons, I know that Nightwing and Batgirl should be Batman's allies besides Robin, but still ... that Batman says he needs help from them ... What can he not handle a few battles? In BTAS, he could meet a dozen opponents without any problems ... He gets old? Come on ... And another thing: I really don't think Batman would give a kid like Tim Drake the opportunity to go into battle soon, without years of hard training. One, it is irresponsible (and Batman is all but irresponsible), and two, this is not the case in the comics if we are to remain faithful to them. <br /> <br /> Batman - The Animated Series made history, with its animation, its stories and its characters ... It was truly a legendary Batman. The New Adventures series turned the game into just another Batman flick.
