This movie is about a rape victim / cartoonist from New York who decides to get away from all the horrible big-city lights and move to a dirty, worn-out little town where she finds refuge in a single wagon on a dirt much in the middle of 12th and nowhere. The cities are mentally ill, but she also wants to invite crazy men into her trailer. Annoying is that she has the ability to do exactly the right thing to place herself in dangerous circumstances after dangerous circumstances. DB Sweeney's performance at best was high school. He is one of those kind of cute young actors with a sweet smile. Unfortunately, career has not been friendly, and the mother's nature has been really good. To the former commentator, stating that the play was "so right," yes, I agree. In fact, it was not. The two main characters are really pathetic, weak and unable to make mature and healthy decisions. In short, this movie sucks like no other, rents it to laugh at it. The real crime scene? The dreadful wooden panel in the trailer - enough to make ME commit murder. And finally, she is an artist / writer so she couldn't afford a double-wide trailer and anything other than a sun-yellow Chevy Chevette for the love of God!
