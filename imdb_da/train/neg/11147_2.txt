I have nothing to comment on this movie. It is so bad that I had to put my first comment on the IMDb website to help some viewers save time and do something more interesting, rather than seeing this "movie" ... something will do, even if I must write at least 10 lines of text, I also say that it is a low budget film, bad acting, no names actors, a stupid mutt like the wolf etc. The story also brings nothing new, special effects are made in the 80s style. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost as bad as the movie "Megalodon". <br /> <br /> So funny! ;) (don't see this movie)
