Why do filmmakers always go against the author's work? I mean, yes, things must be condensed for the sake of the viewers' interest, but look at Anne of Green Gables. They did a wonderful job of combining important events into a coherent whole that was simply lovely. I can't believe they chose to combine three novels together for Anne of Avonlea into such a terrible mess. Look at all the missing by doing so. . . Paul Irving, little Elizabeth, widows, windy poplars. . . and another's school year for heaven's sake !!! Wouldn't it have been great to meet Priscilla and the rest of the Redmond band? Kevin Sullivan should have taken things a movie at a time, rather than jumble them all and combine characters and events he did. This movie was good if you leave novels out of it !! But L. Montgomery's beautiful work is something that should not be denied. This movie was a disappointment after seeing the successful way he brough Anne of Green Gables alive.
