I went to see it in the hope of some good old-fashioned Alice Entertainment. When I realized I wouldn't get it, I saw it as a pretty good movie (in terms of movie recording and yes, that was it). But apart from the fact that it had a good movie quality, considering that I had seen grain films all day long, there was nothing good about that movie. He killed 42. Why was Tweedle Dee and Dum played by Mudler and Scully? Serisouly, who can answer that for me? Who can answer anything that is terrible about this movie for me. I agree with the one who said it was just a big long before joke for the staff. That's all it seemed. <br /> <br /> Poor Mr.Carroll.I'm sorry someone made it his amazing stories.
