I was very happy to find this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy in service, director Stanley Donen, so far, what do you dislike? It's the kind of movie that has me wondering about two things - when everyone involved (including some known names) realizes that they have a turkey on their hands, and what's the worst about it among a number of conflicting aspects? Still predominantly the first, but my vote for the latter goes to the enchanting story, in front of the wordy, sometimes pretentious script, the uncertain tone, the lack of uniform and well-developed characterization and the lack of inter-character report. You need to add a lot of bumpy action to the criticism, but it is understandable that the actors are struggling with these things and also seem to be under-trained. Often they can hardly get their lines out fast enough. Cary Grant tries to portray his usual charming and urban persona, but sometimes it seems uncomfortable and staccato in his delivery. However, I have to say I was relieved when the first suggestions his character will be mating with the indescribable vulgar Jayne Mansfield go away with Suzy Parker's appearance. What do you like about the movie? - For me mainly Parker beauty, which also works with restraint and a Grace Kelly-like dignity. Generally speaking, the movie is nice to watch. The figurines are very clever in their uniforms - but you really have to wonder about the horrible black Fu Manchu tunic they don't have in their luxury hotel. Even Grant can't look elegant in his. Back to the credit side, Ray Walston makes a commendable job with his character, and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre-Hogan's Heroes Werner Klemperer talk without an assumed German accent!
