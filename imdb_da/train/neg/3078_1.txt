I didn't think it was possible for a horror comedy film to fail so abysmally on both fronts .... really awful. The fact that it doesn't take itself seriously (usually a good thing) works against it, mainly because the actors are so wood you really would swear they read cue cards. On the outcome however ..... the MST3K version, as always, has a few laughs ...
