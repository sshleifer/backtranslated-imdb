This movie was a bit interesting ... I had to watch it in a college class about India, but synopsis tells you that this movie is about a thing when it doesn't contain very cold and hard information about these details. It's not really true to synopsis until the end, when they suddenly try to tie all the elements together. The Gore factor, however, is amazing. Even right at the start, you will look away because gore is quite intense. Just watch this movie if you want to see some cool things because the plot is thin and will make you sad that you wasted time listening to it. I've seen rumors on other websites that this movie is based on true events, but you can't find any information about it online ... so basically this movie was a waste of time to watch.
