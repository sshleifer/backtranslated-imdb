I really didn't have high expectations and I have to admit that I was not disappointed. This movie is so horrible that I felt obliged to register an account here at IMDb just to warn others not to waste their time. The story is horrible and you continue to ask yourself the whole movie "can it get worse?" Yes it can! Somehow they manage to do the worst for every minute, and you end up thinking "I want my 1 hour 35 minutes back!". Someone has to pay for this! <br /> <br /> I dare find a movie that is worst for this ... <br /> <br /> I really didn't have high expectations and I have to admit that I was not disappointed.
