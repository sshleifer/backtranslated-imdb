This movie was like "The Disney Channel after Dark." Get out of the "not we naughty" languages ​​and themes and you're back with dialogue and plot devices that offend the intelligence of anyone who doesn't describe "Saved by the Bell" as quality television. The dialogue looked ridiculously clumsy and deliberately dirty, one might think that the manuscript was a product of locking Aaron Spelling and Joe Eszterhas in a room with orders to produce an amalgam of every bad script that had ever had a hand in create. If it was Roger Kumle's intention, the mission achieved.
