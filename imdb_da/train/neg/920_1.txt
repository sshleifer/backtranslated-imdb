Seriously. I just wrapped my first view of Demonicus and words have let me down. <br /> <br /> I remember a time when I wanted to see Charles Band's name on a movie and my heart would race. He was never a Wes Craven or a John Carpenter. He was a bastion of hope for the little man. The guy whose movie arrived at the video store instead of the multiplex, but they were getting tougher than most of the trendy junk we would otherwise have to endure. <br /> <br /> And now ... this. <br /> <br /> A painfully obvious California hiking trail doubles the "Alps" and an overpassed train tunnel must actually be "an old cave". I mean, they didn't even try to dress things up with moss or film it in a way that might indicate that it was anything but an old train tunnel! Ugh! Instead of an eerie demon gladiator that the cover entails, we are treated to a guy wearing the latest in Wal-Mart Halloween clothing. There is a beautifully cool-looking body that occasionally comes to life to hang and tilt your fingers, but he doesn't even learn to stand for the last five minutes. Why couldn't he be the villain? Instead we have frat boy Joe with a plastic sword. Ouch. <br /> <br /> Charles Band ... you should be ashamed that your name is related to such tripe. I love movies that are so bad they are good. Hell, I occasionally enjoy a flick that is so bad, it's just bad. However, this one is just not available. A perfect example of making a buck instead of making a quality movie.
