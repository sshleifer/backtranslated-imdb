OK, apart from the psychedelic background images, the information here was presented well. The music I could have done without (not that it was bad music, just that didn't fit this movie at all). <br/> <br /> Regarding the content of the film, the director often brings up-related pagan perspectives on Christ's existence and a spectacular comparison of the works and events of Christ's life versus the lives of mythological figures / deities such as Mithra and Dionyses. Then he comes up in chronological chronological origin and presents an 'ok' case, but not one that blew me away. <br /> <br /> If the director had stuck to the facts and continued with them, this movie would have been good But at this point in the film it dissolves in a group of personally satisfying attacks on Mel Gibson's "Passion of Christ" and a Christian private school, which the director attended in his youth. During an interview with his old principal (who, in the course of lightening up the director set up under false misconduct), I felt that the director appeared kind of childish. He asked good questions, but as the film itself, the interview crumbled into an attack on the rules of this particular private school, not Christianity. All in all, if you are just interested in some information, see the first 30 minutes or so and then turn it off.
