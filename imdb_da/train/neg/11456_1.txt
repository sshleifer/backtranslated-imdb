This is one of the movies that makes you think: would the Hulk "The Real American" Hogan have done the same? Frankly, I don't think so, and he would have been right. I'm Italian, I can't take pride in my country for many reasons, but I wouldn't have messed up another team, for example because I'm in love with Juliette Binoche. In addition to the protagonist, a British girl does not fall in love with the end of the movie, but with a compatriot, so why row against Yale. As far as the action is concerned, it is good that all the players seem very bad. And then you know I hated the "Dead poet's society" atmosphere. In fact, it's another movie I hate.
