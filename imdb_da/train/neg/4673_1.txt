I love Henry James books and Washington Square was no exception. I was very excited to see a new movie coming out, based on the title book. Jennifer Jason Lee is an excellent actress and Ben Chaplin is good enough to play the lead. Albert Finney is miscast and doesn't carry the role well. I wanted to shoot Maggie Smith .... or rather her stupid, incomplete role. The real problem and what is missing in this latest version is a good script, music and direction. I fell asleep in the theater and watched this long drawn-out and exceptionally boring movie. There are more pauses in the dialog than a Pinter Play. In the book I felt a deep care for Catherine Sloper and her life. The film had just the opposite effect. I also didn't like the twist where her aunt has a sexual attraction for Morris. Eeeeeeeek. YUK. <br /> <br /> See if you can't sleep, it's a particular snoozer. Don't look at it if you're depressed. You must use Zoloft after this. <br /> <br /> Sure, "The Heiress" was outstanding with Olivia Haviland and Montgomery Clift in the title role. The actor who played his father was on the ground as the creepy, cold father .... still cares for his dead wife and hates Catherine for it. The film was not true to the book, but neither is it. <br /> <br /> This movie was a box office flop. I have no doubt why.
