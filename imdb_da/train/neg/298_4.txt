Daraar got off to a good start. The first scene really left me on the edge of my seat and wondered what would happen next time. Apart from that, the first half of the movie is a total BORE. The first half of the film is about Rishi Kapoor falling head over heels in love with Juhi Chawla. By the way, don't you think he's a little old for her ??? Things finally begin to spice up the middle of the movie when Juhi tells us about her former husband; and wow what is a lunatic he! He was an overprotective, nice freak with a really hot TEMPER! He used to look up poor Juhi for no good reason! One of the reasons I really don't like this movie is because I can't stand seeing Juhi (my favorite actress) being so abused. This movie in general has WAY too much abuse and bloodshed; I find it so boring! <br /> <br /> Yet, all I'm trying to say is, if you're thinking of renting Daraar, put it right back on the shelf where you found it and choose something else!
