you can ask why? the characters snarl, shout and chew nature for no apparent reason, unless someone wanted to make a movie in Barcelona. Billie Baldwin, the right one, is forgettable in the policeman / outfit-man / affectionate-father-of-cute-little-blonde-girl role. The story seems to have been cut and deployed from the scenes thrown away from adventure films over the past three years. The ellen pompeo's lack of charisma is a black hole that seems to suck the energy out of every scene she is in. Her true sphere of action appears when she takes off the blouse as the movies tend to be from a relaxed chase scene to another . Unfortunately, the steering rarely goes bad enough to be a camp or a parody. It's just clich√©, well-known in every respect. The director threw his own daughter as the perishable brat probably because no respectable agent would have allowed a client to ruin a career by being in such a lame, constructed and uninteresting movie. The only hoist here is theft of the investor's money and the viewer's time.
