"So there is this break you see and she gets killed to death by this statue that falls on her wedding day. Then you get this, a year later, her former fianc√© falls in love with a beautiful psychic and then it becomes beautiful psychic haunted by the ghost of the unhappy dead bride who will keep her able to steal her boyfriend? he he? it will be fun! "polite. <br /> <br /> What I like to imagine is how Jeff Lowell, the man who dreamed "Over Her Dead Body," presented his concept of studying ecce there on New Line Cinema. The big mystery is how the same companies bigwigs can turn to the right and green light project, so Lowell can control the movie and write the script. <br /> <br /> If you think no movie might be as bad as this original assumption sounds, of course you have another thinking coming. The only way it could have worked is if the author simply got lost in it and turned it into an unsaved satirical farce. Instead of ensuring that he delivered a fuzzy, unofficial and warm-hearted romantic comedy, Lowell engages in boring half-steps every step of the way and spans the absurdity in favor of killing conventions. In fact, "Over Her Dead Body" is thoroughly incomplete and unfunny that it's hard to know exactly how Lowell thought he was going with it. Almost every set-up, joke and sight gag in the movie are flat-footed and poorly executed, with even the actors themselves seemingly aware of their difficulties. How can you explain the half-hearted, lifeless performances of Paul Rudd, Eva Langoria Parker, Lake Bell and Jason Biggs in their various roles? <br /> <br /> I choose not to blame the actors, some of whom have proven their talents in better cars in the past (this is especially the case with Rudd). But Lowell and the studio execs probably have some "splainin" to do.
