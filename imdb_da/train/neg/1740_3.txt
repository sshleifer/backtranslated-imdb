The movie was a huge disappointment. Especially since it was directed by Priyadarshan, it was sad to see such gloomy standards. Bad plays (almost non-existent) and song songs with bad songs every minute and mostly odd times killed what humor the movie could offer. some of the scenes were fun, but it probably only accounted for 5 minutes of the entire duration. The editing was pathetic. Gloomy! Overall, the movie was disappointed as the lack of history was too obvious. In fact, only a few people kept watching the second half of the film after the interval. <br /> <br /> You wouldn't miss anything if you didn't see the movie. Not worth using valuable ticket money on this movie. wait until it appears on TV
