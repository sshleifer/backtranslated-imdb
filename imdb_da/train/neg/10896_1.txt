I know you've read it before on countless other movies without a doubt you are reading the comments here, but the voodoo academy is still the absolute worst movie I've been able to track. Undoubtedly, the really bad are not even available to buy or watch TV, but even though I feel it is fair to qualify, I am not just a stupid tenant who chooses badly. <br /> <br /> I 've seen two thirds of the bottom 100 ranked movies here on imdb and I tick the remaining ones with every chance. most of them stand upside down and in their shoulders above this ... excersize in absolute monotony. I like to judge really bad movies (as in those without humor even in how bad they are) of how many people you have to watch it to make it all the way through. If you can see for yourself, it's not that bad. If you can see it with a single friend ... it's bad, but it can be much worse. <br /> <br /> It took 5 of us to do it all the way through the voodoo academy. And not even the fun moments of seeing bad movies (eg 3mm in this, if I am not mistaken) can remove the dry taste in my mouth. yes i had seen it but i had also forced 4 of my friends to see it with me to reach that end. I hope and we ask the directors to cut ... to think that there could be a 20-minute version with big eyebrows lugs with baby oil glands rubbing their torso, just scaring hell out of me. so much of the film centers on this. <br /> <br /> I welcome David Decoteau to lend this film in two days on a short budget, just as I welcome him to convince people to pay him to do what is without doubt a celluloid version of some of his fetishes. But it's not a good movie. The original horror store was shot at the same time for a similar amount of money (considering inflation) and was a complete gem. It's not an excuse for how bad this baby is. front spoilers ... <br /> <br /> it is not even worth picking apart the plot holes or cliched knows the whole whole characters ... pacing the movie ... is crazy ... nothing ... is interesting for the length of time decoteau dedicates to pectoral self massaging. Whatever your adjustment or sex ... friction just can't maintain that kind of screen time. <br /> <br /> The play is cheese ... but not too amateur ... I've seen much worse in better movies ... but somehow it's the semi-competent delivery of some worst lines you will ever hear in a movie that really beats. <br /> <br /> If you have a fascination with the worst worst and only if you look at a group of people ready to work through it, hire this one. This is not ha ha the put wobbled affair. It's an endurance test you're likely to skip. <br /> <br /> I'm sure it's worse ... but I wouldn't be surprised if it has decoteau name on it.
