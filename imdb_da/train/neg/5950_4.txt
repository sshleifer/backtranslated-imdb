My first question after watching this movie was, "Why is the title LIAM?" If the intention was to tell a story from the boy's perspective, it was not done well. Of course, there were the formal use of camera angles in the boy's scenes, but much of the decisive action took place outside his field of vision. Having a "head" character who cannot speak (obviously indicates the child's dumb, powerless position) makes it difficult to give the character depth. The melodrama is defined as: "dramatic or other literary work characterized by the use of stereotypical characters, exaggerated emotions and language, simplistic morality and conflict." Sulfur Catholic Church in the Collegiate School Marble and the well-born priest squeeze money from parishioners. (A stereotype that gets very tiring.) What's more - the Jewish characters are money lenders and factory owners! <br /> <br /> Much of the movie was predictable ... Who didn't think we'd see the Theresa scrubbing the toilet after her mother had told her: "No one my daughter will scrub another's toilet!" I am a fan of British realism if it is well done. In my opinion, LIAM is not. <br /> <br />
