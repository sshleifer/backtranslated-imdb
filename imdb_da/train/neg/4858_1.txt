Why in the world would anyone do this piece of garbage? The first two Zombie Bloodbath movies were stupid enough, but it takes the cake for the worst of the trilogy (maybe all the time). Todd Sheets is still director, but no more the scriptwriter, who is not negative or positive, considering he is as unlikely as the guy who wrote this. The scripture is too strongly dependent on the f-word, which is used somewhere between 200 and 300 times by nausea. The action is about the same as the last two Bloodbath movies, so that's obviously one of the worst things I've ever seen. The special effects are better than the last 2, but they still look good. The plot has become too complicated for its own good, and was about the fact that some government experiments had gone wrong and zombies were produced. Also highlighted are cryogenic frozen mutant zombie and schoolchildren who travel time, leading to one of the most idiotic conclusions I have ever seen. After the movie it goes to outtakes, which is strange because this whole movie is a tap. Just watch this to make it fun, because if you go into this with a serious mind, you might kill yourself. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 95 minutes.
