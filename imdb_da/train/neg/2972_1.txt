My teacher lost this and showed it to us in childcare to show how teenage pregnancy affects people. It showed just how teenage pregnancy affects a childish jock not properly trained on how sex works and a whiny, furious girl who throws fruit at angry and couldn't tell she was with the wrong man even though he had a sign that he was such. I wouldn't be surprised if the child's father had about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script. Stacy's (baby's bearer) mother is a rebellion. She is unaware that her daughter is past four years and apparently untouched when people spy on her through her dining room window. Bobby's (father) best friend's name is Dewey, and is an obvious rip off of Sean Penn's character in the Fast Times at Ridgemont High. This movie is horrible, simply because none of the characters are credible. Thank goodness it is only made for television, which limits the chances of the public seeing it.
