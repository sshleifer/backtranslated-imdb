Unusual? Yes! <br /> <br /> Unusual approach to a US War Time movie, New Zealand. Unusual subject, four sisters and their relationship with American soldiers, from one carrying the illegitimate child of the son of death to a senator, to another living with seven marines (one at a time) before being murdered by her returning POW New Zealander man. Unusual to see Paul Newman deliver such a poor performance so shortly after his unforgettable role as Rocky Graziano in the brilliant "Somebody Up There Loves Me". <br /> <br /> Unusual for two fine "Stars" Joan Fontaine and Jean Simmons, leave so little of themselves on a movie. <br /> <br /> Unusually, I could be bothered to write such a bad movie, give it a miss!
