This movie was horrible. Throughout the movie I was confused and didn't see anything about it. I had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it was about. This movie is not worth seeing at all. Not only is it sick and disgusting but absolutely BIG! Please do not look unless you are one of those who likes to watch bad movies. If this film questions Japanese society and their values ​​and roles, this is a country I will not visit or disturb to know. This is a completely ill movie !!!!!!!! I didn't enjoy it because it didn't make any sense. My boyfriend and I sat there waiting to see if it was a horror because it was the one listed below. It was total disappointment.
