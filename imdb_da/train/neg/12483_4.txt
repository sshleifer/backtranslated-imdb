This movie is like Conan the Barabarian, but with more sex, rape and murder. There is a plot somewhere throughout this confusion, but the filmmakers don't do a good job showing it, which is a shame because it could be a decent story. Richard Hill gives a solid performance in the lead role, just like the villain - which unfortunately does not appear in anything else. The battle scenes are also not bad - I love the way Deathstalker makes his sword "drinks" the blood of his victims - and there is plenty of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo throughout. <br /> <br /> All in all not good - but not necessarily so bad either ...
