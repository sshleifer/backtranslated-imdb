A BDSM "subculture" in Los Angeles serves as the backdrop for this low-budget and shabbily-engineered mess, clearly a vanity piece for its top performer Celia Xavier, who also produces and scripts while performing a dual role as the twins Vanessa and Celia. A question soon evolves as to whether something rather outdated camera, lighting and editing of pyrotechnics can ever reach a point in connection with a weak and often incoherent story that will not be taken seriously by a sensible viewer. Celia is employed as a highly motivated Los Angeles County sampler, while her wicked natural twin has become an iconic figure in her fetishist world largely due to erotic notions on CD-ROMs, but when the disaster commands "Mistress Vanessa" , virtuous Celia, determined to ward off his sister's evil attacker, begins a new job as "sex slave" at the private Castle Club, where the house's specialty is a "dungeon". Two FBI field agents (whose posting to the Vanessa case is allegedly required due to her involvement with internet BDSM sites) in addition to an arbitrator in the Los Angeles Police Department are assigned to investigate the crime while attempting to give security for Celia if the enthusiastic performance of her new call is in vain considered by her customers to have created a personal danger to her. Lack of logic and continuity abounds, such as a murder allocated to L.A.P.D. Operations-South Bureau, a region of the metropolis that is far away from the movie's setting. The direction is unfocused and not helped by irregular editing after production and sound reproduction. Said photographic gymnastics culminates in a nice montage near the film's end of previous recordings that only refer to the scenario. A solid-acting tour is shown among this slag: Stan Abe as a jealous FBI agent.
