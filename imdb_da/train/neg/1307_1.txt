This was really a very bad movie. I'm a big fan of Italian Horror, Argento, Mario Bava, Fulci and yes, even our good friend here Lamberto sometimes comes out with a good one. I found the first two 'Demons' movies to be very entertaining - they were so bad they were big, but one is just so bad it really is really bad. It is intensely boring, the story never goes anywhere and I hated the characters - the wife who relaxed man and bad crying children in *** wife drove me angry, there was nowhere near enough of history devoted to Ogre, who was probably the one best actor in the whole movie. I struck it about three-quarters of the way because I was very, very TABLE! Do not want to.
