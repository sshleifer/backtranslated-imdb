This was a good attempt at something, but it is too pretentious and boring to rise above it's low budget steps. The use of virtual sets works almost, but on some points it doesn't fail. They have made good use of the small budget I guess. I just want the story, and most of the play was better. There are many parts where you see what they were aiming for and it would have been good if they actually hit those brands, but they didn't. Confusing and incredible story. Bad DVD transfer too. It doesn't take much for me to watch a movie in a meeting. I had to shut this off. It was too boring. I can make slow movies. But just make them appealing in some aspect. Visually, history-history, performance, etc. This was lacking in all departments, so it never filled up for an exciting experience. Maybe the film producer's next attempt will be better.
