The goofy Griswalds wins the T.V. game show "pig in a poke" grand prize, and everyone flies together to Europe, where they manage to cause a stupid disaster after another. Of all the ridiculous, unfunny money-spinning followers, this one beats a lot. Harold Ramis' 1983 film was a pervasive case where the evil family went on a nightmare "holiday" across the states. This time, Amy Heckerling ("Look Who's Talking"), which turns out to be a disastrous "comedy" that will annoy you more than it makes you laugh. Hughes script (with Rob Klane) is terrible and you wonder why Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo were bothering with such a death-beat project, as even Anthony Michael Hall and Imogene Coca had a point to reject the offer . Even an all-powerful Michael Palin is incapable of lifting the procedure to any level that one could call entertaining. But as inconceivable as it may seem, "European Vacation" was successful enough to justify another successor! It couldn't be as unbearable as this one. You know I haven't yet seen a National Lampoon show that was worth disturbing. <br /> <br /> Monday, December 26, 1994 - T.V.
