Question: How does a bourgeois director treat a topic like immigration? Answer: by making it an existential alienation. <br /> <br /> Yes, we are back in the early 90s right after the dissolution of the Eastern bloc and the subsequent flood of immigrants in the EU, and what better way to deal with the issue than to make one film about an existentially alienated middle-class journalist, an existentially alienated upper-class politician, his existentially alienated rich wife and so on. In the background, immigrants are asking for political asylum in a named Greek village near the borders. I believe that Angelopoulos can show some social consciousness while dealing with the existentially uneasy upper classes. I honestly believe that the scene in which some senior army officer curses his fate because he sent his daughter to study in London is enough to make you beat. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it can't be that bad, Angelopoulos is a cinema champion after all? Wrong. It is at this time that his manuscripts begin to become artificial, like a filtered image in Photoshop. His usual tricks show up: there are blurry windows, blurred lights, a weird wedding, a riverwalk and people with yellow watercoats. Mastroianni also breaks new ground for most sleepwalking achievements ever. Really avoid. Go to his early movie.
