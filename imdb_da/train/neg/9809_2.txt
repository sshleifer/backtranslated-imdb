Some wonder why there was no longer Mrs. Murphy movie after this. It is because this movie has blown snot. Disney was not the right studio to run this movie. Maybe Touchstone (well, they are owned by Disney, but it would be more adult). The movie is for kid-ish, since the book series is not. The casting is all wrong for the signs. The signs don't even work as they do in the books. And why was Tucker changed to a guy? He is a girl in the free books! Was this done to make the movie appeal to boys? Sheesh. And where was the tin, the gray cat? One of the funniest characters from the book is absent from this filth. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but letting Disney blow his work was wrong. An animated feature film, perhaps in the shovel of Don Bluth's art, would suit a better Mrs. Murphy movie. Overall, I give this a 2 because at least Disney made a movie from an underwritten book series. But I wish they did better. In any way, I still have my books to entertain me.
