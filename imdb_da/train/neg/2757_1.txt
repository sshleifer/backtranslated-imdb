I am a guy who loves movie movies ... I was looking forward to seeing a dragon fighting with the army with great special effects. All this happened, but this movie was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The story was standard, but the story of history was horrible. The scene transitions were the worst I have ever seen. Why would you go out to a beach to relax if your life was in danger? The snake's actions in themselves were very poorly written ... and the snake's attack capacity varied greatly throughout the film. Several times the protagonists had to be dead. <br /> <br /> The director tried to incorporate a love story in the middle of the movie in the most stressful times, this movie was obviously not seen after it was made, I love movies but had to force me to finish watching it, thank God, I didn't buy this, I borrowed it from a friend. <br /> <br /> Don't buy this, don't let it rent, just watch the discovery channel ... much more exciting.
