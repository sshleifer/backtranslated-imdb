A police officer (Robert Forster) in a crime-ridden city has killed his wife and young son after she dares to get up to a dozen at a petrol station. After the killers have been fired by a corrupt judge and he himself is imprisoned for 30 days for contempt of court, he decides to take matters into his own hands by joining a group of vigilantes led by a grizzled looking Fred Williamson . These Robin Hood types sort out any criminal that the law is unwilling to prosecute, and with their help, he tries to trace those who strayed him. <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing but a big bag o'clich√©s. The only thing that is out of the ordinary is the screen kill of a two-year-old boy who was quite ill. Otherwise, it is business as usual for this genre, for example, lots of cargo, battles and shoots blended in with lots of male positioning. I could have done without the jail fight in the shower that involved all those who were just in possession. Also, they run out of money before the movie the last scenes? I mention this because it ends very abruptly with little closure. If anyone knows, give me a bell .. in fact, don't bother. <br /> <br /> Exit: File under "Forgettable Nonsense". Next..
