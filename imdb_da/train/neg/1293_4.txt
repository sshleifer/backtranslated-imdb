I'm probably one of the few viewers who wouldn't recommend this movie. Thoughtful visual anesthesia like all Ang Lee's work (every frame seems worthy of a touch), I was really disappointed with the film's uneven pace. It was really too long. The story is set in Civil War era Missouri, and is about a young man (Roedel) who joins Bushwacker's wild thoughts, a kind of renounced Confederate sympathizer who performs geurilla-type struggle with Jayhawkers, their Union colleagues. He and his close friend Jack Bull Chiles played by Skeet Ulrich, joining the group after Chile's father shot blank and his home is burned, presumably by Jayhawkers. The story follows Roedel's and Chile's raiding adventures and their interactions with other war victims, including former slaves fighting for Bushwhackers (Daniel Holt played by Jeffery Wright) and a war thief played by Jewel. <br /> <br /> It seemed that every time the film developed the story into an interesting point, it would turn to another subplot and leave things undeveloped. For example, agitation among Roedel's group is shown by former slave Holt, who participates in the Confederate cause, briefly through a certain conflict of propriety and protocol and then fell later in the movie. A young villain / bully Bushwhacker hates Roedel and leads a lot of fear and violence against him, but we never know why. Some of the signs never seem to surface; I think it is because the film includes too many of them as well as taking on large amounts of history. <br /> <br /> The historical detail was excellent. I loved looking at homes, furniture, clothes, etc. And I thought the main actors did a wonderful job of humanizing the characters, even though they stumbled slightly with the dialogue. Unless you really enjoy history or are a giant Ang Lee fan, of course, take a look at this one.
