Oh God. Well thrown, but writing and correcting is an art and writing white and direct humor is a bit of a task. Do yourself good comedy, you need to get the timing and the moment to the right. I do not do everything down there were parts where I laughed loudly, but it was very few times. The main focus for me was on the fast free flow dialogue that made some people in the movie annoying. It may sound great while you read the script in your head but getting it out and in the camera is another task. And the handheld camera work gives energy to few parts of the movie. Overall direction was good, but the script wasn't all that for me, but I'm sure you read the script in your head it would sound good. Pardon.
