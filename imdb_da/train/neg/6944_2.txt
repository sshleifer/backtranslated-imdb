The film's premise is that Thomas Archer's son was murdered and his wife was brutalized - and he got a chance of revenge when he (after post-traumatic stress disorder) was put in a room with a man attached to a chair and told this was the culprit. He gets a large table of utensils that he can offer retaliation: exercises, bats, nails, sledge hammers, flashlights, whatever you think anyone might want to physically hurt another person. <br /> <br /> We go too many scenes of torture before we find out that The Man Archer is not torturing is the man who committed the crime. The two then form an unpleasant alliance; who puts them in this situation and why. <br /> <br /> Well, when all is said and done, we don't really like ...
