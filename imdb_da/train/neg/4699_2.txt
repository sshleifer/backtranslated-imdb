wow, Naked Brothers Band. What should I say. I can say that this show just sucks. number one: they have no talent, they may not even play the instruments. number 2: on the commercial it said they were famous, but no one even heard of them until the crappy show came on. Look, I really do not hate that bad, I would give it as a 4 out of 10, but what annoys me is how everyone says they have such great talent and Nat is so deep and writes deep lyrics. Deep my ass! He talks about hardcore wrestlers with inner feelings. Wow, I could read what it says on a bathroom wall and it would be deeper than that. And they weren't famous by themselves, their parents are famous celebrities and wished their kids were too, so they made a bad show. I have a feeling that it will be canceled soon.
