Wow this sucks. I'll summarize it as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> A counter invites 4 naive slots back to its slot. A lot of nothing happens for a long time. Some lams and non-erotic soft-core sex scenes happen. Some girls get their heads cut off (off-screen) -The End. <br /> <br /> The only things going for this are the decent looking sets and costumes, some bad dubbing, leading to an unintentional fun dialogue and a few short nudie shots. And believe me - these things are not enough to redeem the 90 minutes of tedium that this movie is. In fact, the best part is getting started from the distributor, which contains some slimmed-down goth chicks covered in blood and showing their breasts - and again - it's certainly not worth the price of admission to that waste. As everyone else has noticed - the movie's title is completely obscene - since there is no blood suction at all, or at least not dancing in the movie. It might as well have been called 'The Goat-Raper Leads the Circle-Jerk' - and at least it would have had a better title, which also relates to nothing in the movie. An exact title would have been '90 minutes for torture '- another excellent title that would at least be truthful ... for the viewer. Honestly - the trailer that is on the disk shows all the best parts (and I use the term "best" extremely loose ...) so I suggest a lot to see it instead if you are still curious. I can't imagine anyone who likes this wreck of a movie - please take my advice and leave it on the shelf. 2.10
