My favorite memory for this show and the band was when I came with a bunch of friends who are NBB haters and had a big bonfire and we took a CD with their songs and the DVD in the movie and a bunch of pictures of band members and threw them into the fire and danced a happy jig around burning things while singing "Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead". It was the best thing about the show, and this show is stupid with a capital, God, this show sucks. I hate it so much. Get rid of the crappy car You really suck! You really destroyed the entire canal! No offense or anything other than you need to get a life, I really mean who makes a stupid show with a stupid leader singer who can't even sing! You sound really awful and need to have a life like hobos or something, except Roselina. She is really beautiful. But still, you react!
