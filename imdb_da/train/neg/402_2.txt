Describing this movie as garbage is unfair. At least rooting through waste can be an absorbing hobby. This flick was neither absorbent nor entertaining. <br /> <br /> Kevin Bacon can act excellently given the chance, so no doubt an IRS bill had settled when he agreed to this gloomy play. The mad scientist story of 'Hollow Man' has been told before, been told better and told without resorting to so many ridiculously expensive special effects. <br /> <br /> Most of these special effects appear to be built around transparent anatomical dolls by men, women and dogs you could buy in the early 70s. In the UK, they were marketed as 'The Transparent Man (/ Woman / Dog)', which may be where they got the title of this movie. Clever special effects, dire script, non-existent plot. <br /> <br />
