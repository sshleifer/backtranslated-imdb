*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Are all teenager flashes suffering from the drought of originality? It seems terrible. First of all, this is a noble premise that could have been used well. A rejected young nerd who grows up, stems and kills all the girls who tortured hell out of him when he was in junior high? Can't say you didn't have anything to work with. But this movie goes through the same movements as all the other recent slashers. Everything from the score to the camera angles allows us to predict exactly when a false alarm comes and exactly when the killer will hit. We know the pattern now. These stupid slasher films push the credibility envelopes more and more per minute. Let me ask you something: Who in their right mind will surprise a friend of theirs in a dark, sad morning in the middle of the night and just surprise her out of the blue while she is alone and surrounded by corpses? Is that something sensibly sensible? <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is only occasionally innovative. A good shot involves slaughtering Denise Richards' character. She gets caught inside a pool, and the killer spokes on her with a chainsaw. There are some good songs in the soundtrack, including a cool track by Orgy. The music video is included in the special function section of the DVD. <br /> <br /> Even the actor is at best mediocre. The actors all sleep through their roles. Of course, David Boreanaz is often stoic, even in his depiction as the title figure of "Angel". Denise Richards, however, is a fine actress and she holds a stoneface throughout the film. <br /> <br /> "Valentine" is like you would expect: pretentious, incomparable, forgettable, cheesy and without a good scare in sight. Don't even bother. <br /> <br /> My score: 4 (out of 10)
