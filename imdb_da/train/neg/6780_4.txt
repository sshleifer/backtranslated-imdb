This film was a critical and box-office fiasco back in 1957. It was based on a novel that later became a game - which flopped on Broadway. The story is about some navy officers on leave in San Francisco during World War II. They have 4 day leave that they use at the Mark Hopkins hotel. The movie winds a lot and none of the characters seem very real. Cary Grant is generally brilliant in comedy and drama - but here he plays a kind of wheel dealer, and he doesn't really pull it out. Tony Curtis or James Garner would have been better choice. Audrey Hepburn was originally set to play opposite Grant but had other obligations - so Suzy Parker stepped in. She had never acted before, but was America's best photographic model at the time. I think she did a good job considering all the pressure she was under. Grant's pairing with Jayne Mansfield in a couple of short scenes didn't work. The studio tried to give her a class by performing with Grant - but the sign had no substance at all.
