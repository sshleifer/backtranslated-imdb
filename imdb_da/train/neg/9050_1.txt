I watched this movie in its entirety in the 1960s and 70s, yes it's cruel, and could be the ancestor of the "Faces of Death" series, popular in the 80s and 90s. Considering the state of the so-called "driver training" these days, this must be required display for anyone who is preparing to learn to drive. When you see violent death in all its gore and horror, you certainly (if you have some sensitivity) have a better perspective on the responsibility required to run safely, which moment of thoughtlessness or ignorant driving on the wheel can do. I worked for Bell Telephone in the 70s and 80s, and at one time was assigned a security class. I found this movie in the company library, showed it at the session, a number of people got physically ill and had to leave the room! Incredibly, most of them later said: "I never knew a car accident could be so horrible!" This movie and another, "RED ASPHALT", are certainly reality in its most graphic form. I will never forget, I only wish I could have found a copy when my children participated in "driver's ed" in high school!
