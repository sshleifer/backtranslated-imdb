This is an interesting treat for a topic that is rather controversial (just read the other comments on this movie). Apparently, you either love it or hate it, and it seems that most people make this distinction based on whether they think that tribulation and end times will happen as depicted in the movie. Basically, the movie - and its sequels - was made for about $ 1.30 each. The production values ​​are just below "Plan 9 from outer space" and the play is about the same level as "Glen or Glenda" (my excuse for Ed Wood). To put aside the religious message, the story is as scary as they come. Add even the slightest thought that the story can actually be close to something that can happen in the future and it becomes even more daunting. <br /> <br /> This movie and its successors did not attempt to bring the causes of the tribulation when it did so. The "Left Behind" and "Omega Code" tried to get into everything "Thief" did and explained to all politics and maneuvering in the Middle East that led to it. The net effect was "Thief" did a much better job on the scary part of the movie, instead of spreading too thin and trying to explain what happened in the Middle East at the same time. <br /> <br /> Forget about politics and watch this movie and its sequels for what they are - horror stories. That they can be horror stories that are indirectly told by God makes them just as much more scary. If it makes you think about the subject, it has done its job - even if you never think so.
