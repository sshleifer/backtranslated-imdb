Hubert Selby Jr. gave us the book "Requiem For A Dream" and co-wrote the script for Aronofsky's film of it. That movie succeeded at all levels by providing an intimate and impartial portrait of people's horrors of life and the vices that destroyed them. "Last exit to Brooklyn" still has vice and the many signs that live sad lives, but it hardly makes them the same justice that Aronofsky did. <br /> <br /> The film seems ridiculously anti-gay at times. Especially when in the movie homosexuality is equal to death. A gay character gets stoned, skyward launched by a speed car and lands dead on the pavement. Another is crucified and more and more is simply opened up. Another exaggerated piece of shock value that might have actually been convincing, if done well, are scenarios for union workers who are literally struggling with the strikers. Who would have thought a drama about Brooklyn's would have action sequences and truck explosions? <br /> <br /> The director, Uli Edel has a skill level as a television director, but he is far below the clip for real movies. The movie is lumpy, which doesn't even seem to settle on a genre. The lake gets a useless role that any mannequin could have filled, and Baldwin only knows how to look stupid in his just lean part. And then Jennifer Jason Leigh comes as our leader, a disgusting hooker named Tralala (believe it or not, I'm not talking). Her performance is nothing great, and the fate of her character is dirty to say the least. Poor use of color and composition makes it look cheaper than it is, and also takes the "real" edge out of the more provocative bits. A mistake.
