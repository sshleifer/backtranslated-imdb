This is an OK movie, but lacks a true depth, either emotionally or in relation to narrative. <br /> <br /> The story is based on real events, and this limits the amount of action to almost no one, no real excitement. <br /> <br /> Washington is credible at the forefront, but he sleeps by going through it, there is no room to bend any acting muscles to him or the supporting spirit. <br /> <br /> The story is simply a little flat, even though they have never heard of the title character, the ending was obvious, but unlike other films of such injustices, this has no emotional impact, you are not really interested in him And the motivation from outside helps seem more academic than worried about his welfare. <br /> <br /> There is an attempt to inject some emotions using the boy outside, which hero allows Carter, but it seems forced. It's an OK movie but instantly forgettable.
