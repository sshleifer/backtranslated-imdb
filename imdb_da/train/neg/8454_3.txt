This series has its ups and occasional downs, and the latter is the case here. There is a pleasant amount of spatter, with an inventive implementation of Baby Cart's weapon, but the editing film is a serious, non-uniform film that makes it more robust than normal. At times, the action goes slowly to a crawl, as the camera follows the wordless wandering of "cub", which is almost lost early. All in all, disappointment. <br /> <br /> It is said that there is a spaghetti-like quality to the music and action that can gain approval from dedicated viewers. This episode spends much of his time following the little boy's lesser misadventures, which begin to stare into the abyss of death as his father opened to him.
