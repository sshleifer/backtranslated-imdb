For some reason the TV guide gave these two and a half stars, plus Faye Dunaway is in it, so it certainly looked like something to see. My, oh, mine, this may be the worst movie I've ever seen. Ever. From his destiny action (every time the girl asks the boy what is wrong with him, I cried to the TV "I can't act!" When she asks what he needs, I shout "I need trading lessons ! "For the incredibly bad dialogue (" Give me back my organs! "). <br /> <br /> And Brian DePalma wannabe also ends, it was all just as horrible. I like it. Dunaway is a of the best actors ever. And the production values ​​were pretty good. <br /> <br /> But wowzers, it made me laugh, LOW!, most of the time. Not even disturbing out of curiosity, it was mine First error: Living with it was definitely my second and third and fourth.
