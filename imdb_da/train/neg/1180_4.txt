Notoriously for more than a quarter of a century (and often forbidden), it's turmoil was the biggest asset it seems. Hey, it's often better to be talked about, rather than actually seen when you can't back up the "legend" with the substance. <br /> <br /> The movie has been playing in Los Angeles a few times recently and is available on home video so the blur is slowly lifted. Although there is still plenty to insult the masses, it is more likely to drill them than to awaken very genuine passion. Apart from a free and long-lasting XXX sex scene between a couple of horses ("Nature Documentary" someone?), There follows almost an hour with a boring arranged marriage melodrama. When the sexy and nakedness begins, it is a nonstop sequence involving masturbation, a looooooooong flashback to an alleged "beauty and beast" encounter, and a naked woman running around the mansion (no even her seemingly protective aunt even thinks putting some clothes on her!). On video, I think you can accelerate through the banality, but it's not really worth doing. The necessity does not go beyond what is seen in something much more substantial than Bertolucci's DREAMERS. Try as you might find something 'moral' or 'symbolism' in carnality, I doubt the worthy of everybody's efforts. Unfortunately, for LA BETE, now that you can see the movie more easily, the infamy of something that is forbidden has been lifted. And this animal has been tamed.
