This show stinks. For parents, they will usually have the kids see something good for them. It is usually educational, fun and desire. <br /> <br /> Is it educational? No. Doodlebops sing and that's it. They usually sing about themselves, they are not trying to learn anything. <br /> <br /> Is it fun? No. Doodlebops instead says something that is not intended as a joke and laughs. <br /> <br /> Is it bright? It's so bright, it's painful. What goodbye is, everything is very bright so it's good. But nothing is ever wrong in Doodlebop's world. Therefore, they are always happy. A child in trouble gets depressed because they have never been exposed to being sad. <br /> <br /> The view is also extremely cheesy. Each syllable is said to be the highest level of exaggeration and very corny. It's overkill. <br /> <br /> For children it is entertaining, but over 2 years you will not have your children see it. They will never know how to grow up.
