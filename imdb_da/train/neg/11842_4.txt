Kirsten Dunst is terribly overstated as an actress. You can always tell that she is just "acting". I like Izzard myself. The reason is terribly boring. The viewer has no real connections to the characters, never knowing who really should sympathize with or even worry about. Slow, boring movie with some laughs, but few and not very funny. Plot is not engaging or exciting at least. You can see every plot turn coming one mile away. What should this movie be? Comedy? Drama? So what? You will not at the end of this movie.
