How this movie wins a 6.7 rating is without faith. It doesn't deserve anything better than a 2.0 and should clearly be among IMDb's worst 100 movies all the time. National Treasure is a front end to national intelligence and just another attack on the American audience of Hollywood. Critics told about plot holes you could drive a 16 wheeler through. <br /> <br /> I love the grounds for this movie is good ... "Nicholas Cage is sweet." Come people, no wonder people around the world think the Americans are stupid. This must be the most stupid, insulting movie I've ever seen. If you wanted to watch a really decent movie this season, consider Kinsey, The Woodsman, Million Dollar Baby or Sideways. Unfortunately, National Treasure has much more publicity than the amazing movies. I am sure that most of you reading this have not even heard of them, as some have not been widely released yet. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is a great actor - when he's in the right movies. Time after time I have seen Cage play his amazing talent in horrible mind-numbing movies like Con Air, The Rock and Face-Off. When his talent is used as in Charlie Kaufman's adaptation, he is an incredible actor. Bottom line - I'd rather feed my hand to a wood chipper than be exposed to this visual cruelty again.
