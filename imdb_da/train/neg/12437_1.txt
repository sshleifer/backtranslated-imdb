'Home Alone 3' is the first of the Home Alone films that do not feature Culkin in the lead and the same villains. However, the plot is very similar to the original 'Home Alone' movie. Instead of two comic villains, we get three or four of them. This movie involves some traps, but it also has a long scene with a remote control car. Slapstick humor is also consistent, but the young boy and the bad guys really fail to influence this movie. (No proverb is calculated.) This movie offers nothing new or different than the previous films did, and there really isn't the heat, holiday feeling or subplotter that the other two movies had. It is more of a pure comedy, but it failed to make me laugh, as the characters didn't really do it for me. I would not recommend this movie; It's pretty boring. If you are looking for a good holiday family movie with comedy, watch the original 'Home Alone' movie.
