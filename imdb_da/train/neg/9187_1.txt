I've seen some pretty bad movies in the past, but what the hell were they thinking when making this movie. Had the production herd turned into zombies when they came up with the idea of ​​doing it, for you must definitely be brain dead to find some pleasure in it. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of most genres and enjoy the shoot'em up game, but merging the fragile scenes from the game just made it ridiculous and unmatched. As most have already said, there was hardly any script and the play was weak. I will not waste my time describing it. <br /> <br /> Anyone who judges this movie over 4 must be part of the production company or Sega, otherwise they have a very distorted concept for entertainment. <Br /> <br /> I have to say I was more annoyed at the video store, which gave it a thumbs up, which made me rent it. Thank God I had another movie to watch to restore some of my belief in movies. <br /> <br /> Cartoon guy would be right if he said "worst movie ever"!
