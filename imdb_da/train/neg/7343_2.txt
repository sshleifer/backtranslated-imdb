Have you ever heard of a Taiwanese horror movie? Or any Taiwanese movie? Propably for a reason. This was a really dull, though it has black magic, including withered baby bodies and people exploding from within with thousands of eels. After reading other people's thoughts I looked forward to some violence and do, but there is not much at all. Some blood puking and other lame things, if you are waiting for graphical doing or any gruesome effects you will be disappointed. They obviously didn't use the eel's exploding and other things to their maximum potential. Very much nothing good about this movie; a single character that was not completely bland and a few OK black magic magic, like the eel one. The plot was confusing and boring. The signs were thin and annoying, including the protagonist. The horror aspect didn't work at all, the most horrible thing was an albino girl (not so scary really). This is the worst Asian horror movie I've ever seen.
