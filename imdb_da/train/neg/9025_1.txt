Sorry - this movie is just a cheap TV production. I saw so much promotional material and expecting a professional movie like "Stormriders" - what I was presented was a low-budget movie like "XENA" or "Hercules" on television. No atmosphere, very boring, more than worse match scenes. Some good ideas - no more. I hope I get the chance to make a movie like this, and then I show how to make such a movie !!! <br /> <br /> My Asian tips: "MUSA - THE WARRIOR", "STORMRIDERS" "SHAOLIN SOCCER", "BATTLE ROYAL", "VERSUS", etc. <br /> <br /> Sorry for my bad English!
