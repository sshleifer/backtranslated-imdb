If you are looking for eye care, you can enjoy Sky Captain. Sky Captain is just a video game injected with live performers. Visials are fun and interesting to watch throughout the movie. Now it says that visuals are the only thing good in Sky Captain. <br /> <br /> After ten minutes I knew I was looking at one of the worst movies all the time. I was hoping that this movie would be better, but it never gained any degree of interest. After thirty minutes, the urge to go out continued to grow and grow. Now I own over 2000 movies and have probably seen five times that number. Yet it's only the other movie I felt like going out of my whole life. <br /> <br /> Works --- there are none. The three greatest artists are pitiful. Jude Law (also in the second movie I wanted to go on) is just awful in the title role. I'd rather sit through Ben Affleck in Gigli than look at law again. <br /> <br /> Paltrow is trying so hard to be campy that it backs her face. The last article I had read said that Paltrow is thinking of staying home and being a mother rather than acting. After this performance, I welcome the decision. <br /> <br /> Story --- Soaps are better written. The story behind Sky Captain starts out badly and gets worse as it progresses. <br /> <br /> Direction --- none. Everything was put into the special effects that history, acting and directing are suffering a lot. Even "Phantom Menace" had better plays and that doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> I should give this movie a "0" out of "10". Avoid paying theater prices and wait for video release.
