I'm a big mark for Neil Young's music, and with that and the glowing praise the movie received in many all-indie press circles, I beat Greendale's first show I could find. My excitement was short-lived, as this turgid history and weak lyrical momentum left most movie guests either asleep or disappointed. <br /> <br /> Neil says the movie started out as a soundtrack, and the characters were alive so much that they just filmed the soundtrack. Not the best way to make a story. No sign really has an arc, and when "significant" events happen, the user doesn't break because film technique irritation levels are so high at that point. The movie is all song, and in that connection the characters on the mouth end the lyrics as they are sung ... the technique works for the first stanza, it is finished and grids the nerves after it. It doesn't feel right or false, it just feels unfortunate. <br /> <br /> Terrible acts, with characters finding a mood and playing all that. Poor lighting at times. The only kudos I can give the movie is with regard to several scenes shot as news broadcast, but the technique is then used in the cinema today that this movie did little to promote it. A good soundtrack, but nothing I am quick to buy. A bad movie.
