I've seen other guinea pig movies, like mermaid in a manhole and he never dies, and while they're pretty sick, they have at least a little humor for them (though dark). However, Devil's Experiment is no more than filming a lot of punks that send a young girl to many methods of torture and violence, and there is no plot and no redeeming value at all. It's not extremely scary, except perhaps the mindset, but it's definitely disgusting, and I certainly wouldn't call it entertainment. Now I'm not the good taste in movies and I like my trash and sleaze, but it was too much for me, really. I'm all about to disturb, I actually seek things that disturb when possible, but it was a bit much. The young woman is kicked, beaten, exposed to continuous noise through headphones until she drools and then pelted with raw meat and indards and left hanging in a hammock into the woods somewhere. If you think it sounds good, go for it, but it surely struck me to see more Guinea Pig stuff. 1 out of 10, absolutely nausea.
