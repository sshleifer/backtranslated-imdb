DEAD HUSBANDS is a somewhat stupid comedy about a bunch of wives summarizing to encounter each other's husbands'. It is by no means embarrassingly bad as some comedies I could mention, but it never sheds its potential. Imagine how good it could have been if we had the Farrelly brothers who lead Ben Stiller in the role of Carter Elson. <br /> <br /> Is Carter based on Jerry Springer? Just curious because the catch phrase on Dr. Elson's show is "looking at each other and continuing to talk"
