Bad action, no script, no plot, no convincing killer, no excitement, no original setup, it uses the same cabinet / under the bedding / person-behind-you-in-mirror tactic over and over again making it repetitive and boring and NOT in an insulting way and the fact that NOBODY is ever "really" being killed (at least not on the screen), which in turn weakens any excitement, it can claim right out of it and makes everyone feel Eva cheated for user money on their admission card .... it's a horror movie without any scare LMAO. The most you see is what looks like someone who has taken a ketchup bottle and sprays it over a plastic plate. You must be a teenager sitting there screaming in the theater and scaring yourself to have enjoyed this or you were tall / full at the time. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I have a life and don't bother writing reviews, so often unless I really hated something or enjoyed it tremendously. <br /> <br /> But this movie is AWFUL and I feel I have a duty to warn you NOT to give your money to Hollywood and encourage this kind of filming ever again! <br /> <br /> It is one thing to rent a "bad" movie on blockbuster from Weinsteins, the other, when you have to sit through it in a theater. <br /> <br /> Also, in case you want some recovery nostalgia, forget about it! This is NOT a remake, nor is it a performance. It's not scary or engaging or satisfying enough to be "fun" as others at IMDb have claimed ... it's just outdated and booooring. <br /> <br /> Here's what you want to get away from this movie: remembering pea at Brittany Sney's head that stands out above the plot that Jonathan Schaech will have a sexual affair with JS Cardone of "The Forsaken" has got another role as a killer (because he is as scary as my poodle and too cute to kill almost everyone) and it is for some reason (duh) anyone going back to the hotel suite never comes back. What kind of person would not be worried about prom when deciding to announce candidates for prom king and queen, and the hard-competitive girl just somehow doesn't show up? This is my warning to you. Don't waste your money as I did. The "original" also sucks, but is more of a guilty pleasure for Jamie Lee Curtis fans, but not nearly as bad as this shot (sorry to sound vulgar or rude, but when you see this, you will understand why I say what I say).
