I caught this movie on Sci-Fi before I went to work. If you have any interest in watching Dean Cain dive and avoid being enclosed in flames at least a dozen times, this movie is for you. If it doesn't span your interest, then I'm afraid you'll want you to be the one to be surrounded by flames because this movie is pretty bad. The action is first and foremost horrible, horrible, horrible. The characters are all completely unpleasant, and the dialogue is worse than your typical Z-grade, Sci-Fi movie. Towards the end, the film began to remind me of 'Hollow Man' (complete with escape via elevator shaft), except with a dragon, not a naked, invisible man. However, unlike other similar flicks, this wasn't even awesomely bad ... it was just pretty bad.
