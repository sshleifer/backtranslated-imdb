First of all, I would like to say that if I were to honestly judge this movie from a 1 to 10, then I would give it a -4. It's not that I'm a tough critic, it's just that this movie is so bad. Everything from the story to the direction of editing is horrible. The story isn't even halfway decent at first (one can't expect much as it is based on a video game, something I didn't know about going into the movie), but director and editing made it even worse. The movie cuts at awkward points and goes to scenes that are completely unrelated to the former; Some, like a quick sex scene in the middle, do not even make sense in the story, seeing how the characters show no emotion toward each other. You could go into this movie and expect to see a pile of shacks on the screen for an hour and a half and you will still be disappointed. Honestly, if you pay to watch this movie then you are wasting your money and if you don't pay anything, you still waste half an hour and a half. So do yourself a favor and don't see it.
