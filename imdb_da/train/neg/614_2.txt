I see this on the Sci-Fi channel right now. It's so awful I can't stop seeing it! I'm a videographer and this movie makes me sad. I feel bad for someone connected with this movie. Some of the camera's work is good. Most are very dubious. There are a few decent actors in the girl. Too bad they are surrounded by what must have been the director's relatives. It's the only way they could have been qualified to be in a movie! Music was a little better than the actor. If you come around to see this, I hope this is because there was absolutely no other option! The sequel (yes sequel) comes on now .... I think I'll skip it! Jason
