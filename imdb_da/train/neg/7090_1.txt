I fell asleep on my sofa at. 19:35 last night to see Larry Sanders (I usually be DirecTivo it, but not last night). Woke up at. 3 (invesment banks on the west coast) and was fascinated to see this on HBO2. I was shocked at how poor this movie was. Seriously. shocked. So shocked that I had to write a comment on iMDB. This really is really bad. The writing is boring, but management and editing are simply under a freshman at a film school. <br /> <br /> Yes it's shot video. Remember it's shot on VIDEO, not DIGITAL VIDEO. It looks like a soap opera. Clips from skateboard videos have a more 'movie' feel to them as this horror. <br /> <br /> I wanted to describe the bad management but I honestly can't remember anything. The shots and blocking are stupid. yes, i chose the word 'stupid'. not unconventional, not bold, not fat, not boring, just stupid. I know that people reviewing this review will say "give me an example". I can not. It was 3am. But believe me, I know you will see it anyway, you will be drawn by the horrible reviews. <br /> <br />
