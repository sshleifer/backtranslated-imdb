If it is a remake and Thing (1982/1951), I think it is that there are so many factors from the previous film, it refuses. <br /> <br /> So the play is bad, James Spader makes a super-bright stargate re-enactment of himself, with his coffy mug and his somewhat strange thinking / movements, but it's about what the other actors didn't notice one time. You do not get the feeling of knowing any of the protagonists. And the plot development is slow, boring and, I know what's going to happen in 30 minutes. Score / music is ultra-hard, as there are many untold people out there who would score scores for a cola and a credit, but that is a big step. Some of the special effects are good if it was made in the early 90s. If you like Slimy Aliens, chills and tensions, don't miss this movie. It's a boring combination of Thing, Alien 3, Outbreak and some Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay production really bad. Now, this combination would be cool if anyone knew what they were doing, and the only ones on this production who knew there were none. <br /> <br /> Although I have seen much worse, I would not recommend this movie to anyone, but if you are on a cold night and just want to shine on something, it will pass the time slowly.
