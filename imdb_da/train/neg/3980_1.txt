No, I'm not talking. If they ever suggest a movie idea, they should be kicked out of the studio. I am serious. Their movies are exactly the same in each one, and they consist only of traveling to foreign places, with a problem that they easily solve, hoping to be popular and getting new boyfriends. Think about it. If you've ever seen a movie staring them with another plot, contact me and tell me their name. These "movies" are bad excuses for being on TV and going to other countries. There is a reason why the movies never go to theaters. I am sure that when they were really young and got some O.K. film, a studio manager bought all their rights for 15 years, or something, so now that they are, what 17 can they do movies in other countries when they want to spend the study money. Let me advise you, STAY AWAY FROM MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY! It is for your own good!
