Is this the "worse" Star Trek TOS episode? Perhaps it gets my voice at least in the bottom 5. I think this episode makes absolutely no freaking sense. See something that makes you get angry? Give me a break. This episode also has a different feel for it, the music is increased, almost forced to increase a sense of distress, to the point that it sucks. Give me some Klingons, Gorns, Tholians, Romans, higher beings like Triskelion or anything but Medusin, these are very boring aliens to make an episode. McCoy gets his famous phrase "He's Dead, Jim". Spock puts on the goggles when he transports the ambassador away, but Kirk doesn't. They go through the freaking "barrier" now for the third time I can remember, boring. At least season three next episodes would be "Specter of the Gun" and "Dove Day" and others to follow, making Trek a decent show to watch in syndication where it would choose people like me as avid fans. Personal observations, Trek loved using the color purple, that kind of a pink purple, like when they are in the corridor outside the room, the hallway is usually gray, now purple. We've never had a little bridge, but it's interesting to see, I noticed it in several episodes, it was made of a light filter, and it works very well, but in this episode, the ship's corridor is pretty paralyzed.
