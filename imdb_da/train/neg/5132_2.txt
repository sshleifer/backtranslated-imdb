I found out this movie because Jewish Ben Chaplin from Game On was in it. Game On is a fun British sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break into Hollywood and star in this movie. He failed God. <br /> <br /> The movie is a very simple romantic comedy with Janeane Garofalo playing a nasty woman using her neighbor Uma Thurman to date Ben Chaplin because she thinks Ben Chaplin doesn't like her because she's ugly . The movie is just bad for so many reasons. The reason is incredibly predictable from the obvious slapstick bits to the serious green bits: just the montage where all three have fun and then the photograph bit. These two scenes made me hug! Janean's character is morally arrogant (and guesses her role as a stand-up "comedienne" and arch-feminist is also in reality). She claims the movie is "anti-feminist" as it is actually just realistic. Men more often than not go for looks beyond personality. It is interesting to note her hypocrisy as well. She had been a feminist and "comedienne" for years before taking that role and then suddenly deciding afterwards that the movie was bad. I imagine she hated the idea and script in this movie before it was released, but she made sure she kept it quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a movie. I mean, come on! She acted in it for heaven's sake! What this movie was really was anti-men if anything. It portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their light sources, while the men do stupid things to attract the attention of Uma Thurman's character Noelle. There are other bad things about this movie as well as Ben Chaplin's character being the British man finds every American girl sweet and Jamie Foxx is the best black best friend of Chaplin and of course Foxx had to try to imitate his accent a few times for good. Is it the best scriptwriters to come up with? Blimey they have never done it before, except with every Hugh Grant and Dudley Moore movie ever made. There is also a really horrible phone sex scene that is just grotesque and shows how cheap the picture is. The other comments about here all say how Janeane Garofalo is not ugly but is actually beautiful. Erm did I watch the same movie as they were? She is certainly no one looking, and the only good thing about this movie was that she was rightly thrown like the ugly one. Although I have said that, I also fail to see Uma Thurman's appeal: she is tall and looking. <br /> <br /> I guarantee three things about this movie, if you've never seen it: <br /> <br /> You'll know what the end will be; <br /> <br /> You will find the phone's sex scene painfully embarrassing and; <br /> <br /> You will be bored after ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk.
