I am 13 and I hated this movie, it is the worst movie on earth, I totally wasted my time watching it and was disappointed with it on the front and on the back film it looks good, but I was wrong. But when I was attending, she was completely different and a bad actress, and I really didn't know how old the two girls were trying to be, I was so confused. the movie was in some parts confusing and i did not enjoy it at all, but i saw the whole movie just to see if it was going to get better, but it didn't, it was boring, boring and i said BORING.and i dont believe many Other people liked it as well as me. Drilling boring boring
