I also watched this movie at a local screening about a year ago. First of all, I want to say that it looks good. Cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic film photographer. I just wanted the movie to be as good as it looks. I wouldn't call this a horror movie. Putting a few shots of a decaying ghost doesn't make it a scary movie. There is no mystery, there is no excitement, you know who did it all the time. <br /> <br /> It's a drama. You know what is going on with both sides the whole movie. The action was okay, but it's nothing special. <br /> <br /> And the tagline "Revenge can be deadly" .... really? ... they should have checked how many hundred horror / thriller It has hurt me to say something about this, but I know many of the people who worked on this movie and I know they don't want people blowing smoke up their ass so I give my honest opinion.
