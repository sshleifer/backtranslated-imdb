A supportive plot, uninteresting signs and underparent (for the least) dialogue plagues this television production, which could hardly have been interesting even with a billion-production budget. <br /> <br /> The characters are not credible, in their motives, actions or their professional profession. The plot sounds like a bad Dungeons and Dragons (TM) hack, but with plasma rifles and force fields. There are serious continuity problems, and the degree of meaningless interaction between the characters has this author at least wincing. <br /> <br /> Avoid it like the plague. See some episodes of Dark Angel and you will get better acting, dialogue and plot. Yuck.
