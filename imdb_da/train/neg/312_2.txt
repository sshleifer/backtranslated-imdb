If you've ever seen this movie, you'd know! If you don't have it and want to see a classic BAD movie, I suggest you watch this movie because it goes down with the worst. So, if you are really bored, you have to rent it. If you want to know how it is, here's my little summary: Adam Sandler is employed for work on a huge cruise ship with some Ms Universe models and five other people. Adam does not like how a passenger gets all the babies and he tries to take over with the cheezy jokes. BUT WAIT! It just gets worse! You have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it is.
