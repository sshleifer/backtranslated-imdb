This is a bit of a first for me, the first time I've ever been disappointed in a Tim Burton movie. POTA is not a bad movie (great sets, costumes and the weird performance), but it could have been made by any off-the-shelf Hollywood director. The pacing was very strange, the last third was just used and waited for the film to end, alone and cast. Tim Roth was excellent, probably the only pleasure in the movie. Come back Tim.
