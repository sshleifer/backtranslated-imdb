and a budget of $ 30,000, and this movie still looks like it was made for $ 50. You can tell from the first frame that he didn't care about the movie's continuity or plot, he was just happy to make a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> What the end result shows is a lazy movie maker who loves zombie movies. It could have been good if he had just been cared for. The end result is endless zoom ins on poorly done gore, and even more poorly produced metal plays over it. What happens when you combine great hopes, big dreams, a decent budget, hard work and an idiot behind the camera.
