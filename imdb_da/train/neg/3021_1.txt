Tony Scott has never been a really good director, but every movie he made after "Crimson Tide" seems to bring him one step closer to being the indispensable worst day today (Michael Bay may fall into the same category but at least his great, stupid, misleading epics entertain at some perverted level). And, like other blasted Hollywood biopics ("De-Lovely" and "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"), for example, chronic lives of pretentious, overrated or rather superficial ciphers gave an aura of "mystery" of a society thriving on juicy back-the-scene details, "Domino" is a movie that begins with little potential and dashes that infinitely illuminate within the 60-minute mark. With an already widespread operating time of 128 minutes, the film feels twice as long and spends time with characters that are extremely superficial and forgetful (unlike the superior "Rules of Attraction") that Scott's attempt to forgo the irony issue through Dominos's alley , self-confident-rich-girl-voice-over only draws attention to the movie sledge hammer cluelessness) becomes an action only masochists could find comfortable. The story? Spoiled-upper-crust-babe Domino Harvey (Keira Knightley, in a replacement badass performance as shallow as her beautiful appearance) is sick of the rich and famous in Los Angeles, shallow lifestyle and accost's gruff bounty hunters Mickey Rourke and Edgar Ramirez learning a more exciting trade; Along the way there are double crosses, shootouts, media attention (with kind regards, Christopher Walken, calling his trademark sleazebag) and ridiculous hints for romance. Scott cuts the film into segments that rarely last more than a few seconds, and cranking the resolution to make the movie a neon-drenched nightmare that is frankly uncomfortable to see - if Scott gets the chance to shake the frame a picture, joke it , or distort it in some way, but he but all this sticky stylistic overload will overwhelm the little plot, characterization and tension the movie has (not to say, its, ehm, "entertainment" value). Most of the characters come out as either disgusting or stereotyped, often both (observe the unbearable, multi-minute segment where an African American introduces a new list of race categorizations on "Jerry Springer"), and I found myself wanting them all to get the end of our protagonist's coin at the end. "Domino" is utterly eerie Sunday - whatever interest in that person Scott hoped to inspire in his audience, it is lost in a sea of ​​migraine neon pretension a few minutes in.
