Ripping this movie apart is like shooting fish in a barrel. It's too easy. So I will challenge myself to acknowledge the positive aspects of Little Man. First, I am impressed by the special effects. It really looked like Marlon Wayans' head was tied to the body of a small person. I never doubted it in a moment. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I loved some of the unexpected cameos. David Alan Grier played an annoying restaurant song, and his reproductions of "Havin 'My Baby" and "Movin' On Up" were priceless. John Witherspoon, who randomly played Grier's father in 1992's Boomerang (if you remember, he "coordinated" the mushroom belt with the mushroom pan) now plays Vanesse's father in Little Man. So it was fun. <br /> <br /> Besides that, this movie is as credible as White Chicks. How stupid is it when even the doctor cannot tell that it is a 40-year-old man and not a baby? He has a complete set of teeth !!! How is it possible that no one seems to notice that it is not a baby? Little man is so bad that there is a Rob Schneider cameo. And please, if you're stupid enough to waste $ 8 on this movie, at least make me a service and NOT bring your kids. This movie is far too sexual for young children (lots of jokes and insinuation about sex, going down, eating out, etc.), and I felt embarrassed by the parents who brought their children to the screening that I was forced to endure . If you insist on watching an idiotic movie, at least save your children about pain and suffering.
