I study Catalan, and was very happy to find El Mar, a movie with mostly Catalan dialogue, at my art house video store. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... not so happy to have seen it. <br /> Yes, as other reviewers have said, it is well crafted and beautifully photographed. Although the child's opening sequence is shockingly violent, it is well-traded and convincing. (Mostly it is ... Will Mallorquin strip a corpse in preparation for the funeral right in the middle of the square, in full view of the dead man's 10-year-old boy?) Oh, yes ... minor details. Up to this point, it had some of the feeling of a non-magical Pan's Labyrinth, which was also set in the Spanish Civil War. <br /> <br /> Fast forward and the three children who survived the opening incidence have come of age. Francisca is a nun working on a tuberculosis sanatorium, and the two boys, Manuel and Ramallo, are both patients. I know, but hey, coincidence happens. <br /> <br /> The problem, as with so many Spanish films (excuse Almodovar fans), is that with an exception (Francisca), the characters are just so dangling * weird *. Their motivations, personalities and dialogue are often simply incoherent. <br /> <br /> In addition, it rises into some terribly miserable profits. Be prepared for lots of pain and lots of blood. The reviewer who called it a "pot boiler" is completely on the way. If it had been made 40 years ago, the poster would have said: SEE PROHIBITED LOVE !! Rape !! MURDER!! Harassment !! Fanaticism !! ANIMAL ABUSE !! TREASON!! <br /> <br /> The opening sequence is not nearly enough to make the personality's personality and relationships credible. To work this should have caused more flashbacks to educate the characters. As it is, it looks like a bizarre and depressing cross between "Brother Sun, Sister Moon" and "Pulp Fiction." If it sounds like something you have to see then you must enjoy it. I think I go with something that doesn't make me feel like I have to take a bath to wash off gore and gloomy. <br /> <br /> With regard to Catalan, the Mallorqui dialect is quite different from the Barcelona dialect, although I was surprised at the comment that even Barcelona's apparently needed Catalan subtitles to understand it .
