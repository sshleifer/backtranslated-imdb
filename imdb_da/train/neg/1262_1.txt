This movie has a weak plot, weak characterization and really weak special effects that I wonder why I lost valuable life by seeing it. It has random characters that do not add anything to the story and seems like excuses to the director getting his girlfriend in the movie. The robots are sad and the biggest "hero" bot is turned on by a big knife switch. If this movie wasn't that bad, it would be ridiculous, but there's nothing funny about it. The main antagonist is one of the only redeeming signs and he is killed. It's boring when you mess with the bad guy because he's the best to cheer for. When all is said and done, this movie was better back on the rock floor, or never funded at all.
