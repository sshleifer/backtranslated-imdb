I've never seen a worse movie. <br /> <br /> It is possible to take a shootem up video game and make it a decent movie. <br /> <br /> Error 1: absolutely no connection to any of the characters. In this movie you are not bound by any of the characters, because ... you do not get the chance. The only sign that is sympathetic or even interesting is the deck hand: Salish as played by Clint Howard. Apart from this unique character, the result of the movie is meaningless, since all the characters were lifeless from the start. <br /> <br /> Error 2: The worst ceasefire scene ever. I love puzzles. I love when the heroines open up to badguys and clean houses. heck i also like to see a badguy clean house sometimes. But this warfare was weird, I suppose the best way to describe it is "Apathy" I've seen people shoot with more emotion and emotion while playing the video. In this movie it looked and felt that the "actors" simply went through shooting everything that moved without emotion. <br /> <br /> Why? Where does the trash speak? where are the races of rage among firearms? These should be children caught on a rave badly ... but even real soldiers act professionally and ruthlessly show their humanity. <br /> <br /> If you want a good horror movie about a secluded house full of monsters, I recommend Sam Rami's Evil Dead series. DO NOT see the disaster that is the house of the dead. I hope they burn the master and all the copies of this movie.
