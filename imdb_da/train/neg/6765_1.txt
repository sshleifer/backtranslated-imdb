* Spoilers * Some people claim that Natural Born Killers is brilliant criticism of media obsession with violence. But this plea ignores the actual content of the film. Oliver Stone could have shown his serial killers as maliciously inhumane killers of innocent people and opposed this with a morbid media fascination. Instead, he gives them justification. The film depicts almost every victim as one who deserved to be injured. Engaging in vicious stereotypes, Stone presents the victims as unpleasant caricatures - stupid rednecks, broken English-speaking immigrants, lazy obese people. The one person that the homicide lovebirds is also a stereotype. Of course, they are friends with the old hallucinogen-using American-Indian - because they are trendy, guy? Let us make him an admirable character. Fat, Chinese comrades and "hicks" are unclear, so let's make it work that deserves to die. Instead of transformed, hateful, destroyed by their wrongdoing, their rage makes them happier and more in love. Mickey and Mallory are made sexy and cool and surreal images are bound to lure more impressive people. Justice is mocked. The police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal, ugly and scowling against the GQ killers. Again, it is not in the media reports in the movie, but in the "reality" of the movie. There is no nuance or subtlety in the movie - just overblown performances and visuals. The film says nothing new or specific about the occupation of violence. The evidence that the film fails in its message lies in the real world reactions to it. Some impressing young people who saw this movie quoted it as inspiration for murder they committed. The movie's "message" is a mistake because it inspires people in the opposite direction with terrible real results. The wise message is nowhere to be seen.
