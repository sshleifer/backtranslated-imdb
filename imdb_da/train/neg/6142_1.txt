Gymkata is undoubtedly one of the worst movies ever made. But not the bad kind of bad movie. This one is so awful, it's fun to watch and laugh. Kurt Thomas obviously does not have a lucrative career in acting. He had to go back to gym. But who can forget about such memorable scenes as the high bar with chalk, the stone horse or the five minute hunting scene through the village of crazies in slow motion. I don't think it was supposed to be so bad, but who can tell it. It is not art, but if you want something small and fluffy that will make a good conversation, you need to hire a gym. Make for a fun night.
