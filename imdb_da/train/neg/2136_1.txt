Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. When did Hollywood ever make a successful movie that attacked the Republicans? Why don't they learn. The Dixie chickens do not have. These Lefties live in their own elite bubble interacting among themselves; Unaware that most of America is far more right than they are. <br /> <br /> The best Hollywood productions are not biased and rarely political at all. <br /> <br /> Dan Akroyd's imitation of Cheney was bad. <br /> <br /> I would have thought Cussack could have landed better movies. <br /> <br /> It wasn't fun.
