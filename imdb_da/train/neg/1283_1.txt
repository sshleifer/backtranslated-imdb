I must say the first thing I saw on this movie was about 6 years ago and I enjoyed it then. I bought the DVD recently and by another view I was wondering why I liked it. The action was horrible and, as usual, we have the stereotypical soundmen in their fake costumes. The action was at best horrible. Tim Roth did an OK job as Liam Neeson, but I have no idea what Jessica Lange was thinking. The plot line was good, but the execution was just bad. I'm tired of seeing Scotland's portrait like this in the movies. Brave heart was even worse, which is only these movies that save grace. But seriously, people didn't talk like that these days, why should all actors have glassy accents? Just another movie to try to capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes. I notice the only people here who say this movie is good is the Americans, and to be honest I can see why they like it I know they have a persecution for men in Kilts. But if you're thinking of buying the DVD, I'd say spend your money on something else, like a better movie.
