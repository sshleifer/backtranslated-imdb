First of all I was expecting another hero - a great work of art for the action genre. I've only seen parts of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but I can imagine it's better than HoFD. Basic elements from Hero are found in HoFD: Great landscapes, fascinating filmography and sincere performance (I mean, if you can't understand a word, they say without subtitles, but you're still worried - it's good acting). What went wrong? What begins with political intrigue walks into a love story. Worse, it's a soap opera-like love triangle. You have three characters that I believe will fall in love with each other - for no good reason. This movie basically falls apart after the escape from prison (I fell asleep about forty minutes into it). It's almost as if they changed authors at the time. The rest of the film is about how a character is "like the wind". Ick. Also, you really have to stretch your suspension of disbelief to believe in the actions that are broken. This is not unique to this genre, but since history is weak, you can't wait for the action, and as the fighting breaks out, it really wasn't that good. The beginning takes hold of you, but then this movie just runs out of gas.
