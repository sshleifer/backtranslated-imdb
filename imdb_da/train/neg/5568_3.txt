Dolph Lundgren stars as a former policeman seeking Boston's kinky scene to find out who killed his brother, who was well thought of in society, but on the way he learns how his brother enjoys kinky sex and that a serial killer is to blame. Dolph Lundgren is very good at this film, in fact, based on his performance here, one would forget Lundgren's rise to fame involved action roles. That said, the material gives Lundgren nothing to work with, Lundgren is completely unable to dry in a boring thriller, which is both predictable and incomprehensible. Co-Star Danielle Brett is also good, in fact the film works best when it is centered on Lundgren and Brett's chemistry, in fact the film had taken time to explore their relationship that the film would have been quite decent. But the film is lackluster, the action is non-existent, the plot is not given enough investigation (Too much boring BS about Lundgren's investigation of his brother's employer) and the film is unnecessarily gory and ridiculous. Once again, Lundgren is actually really good (As a beginner Danielle Brett), but the film just lumps from one sequence to the next, making this film extremely disappointing. If there is anything else, however, it shows that underrated Lundgren is like an actor. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of 4- (poor)
