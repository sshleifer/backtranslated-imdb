Before I begin ... let me say that I fully believe in God. I believe in heaven and hell. Kay now out of the way, I just want to say that what in the world do these morons that call themselves "hosts" think they do? The last time I checked a host did not discriminate, spitting hatred on TV, or trying to push their own beliefs down all the unfortunate souls that venture on the channel. All of these are insane, idiotic, conservative, bible-like, Fred Phelp's lover Pat Robertson does every day. I'm all for freedom of speech, but from then on, it covers a guy who basically says that if you wake up from his ideal lifestyle, you are immediately sent to hell? This is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of many many problems. One day in my classroom we had a substitute teacher, so we decided to watch some TV since the teacher did not give us any work. And we (many of us will) looked at the 700's Club, and of course, jerk Pat was ranting and raving about the Bible, and he said Simon in line with "God says homosexuality is a sin" and I have actually heard a child go " Hmm I think he's right. " WTF ??? Seriously, if the host is trying to get people to believe that the sexual orientation of the other is a great sin, then they have to take the host seriously, duct them and throw them off a cruise ship in the middle of the Arctic.
