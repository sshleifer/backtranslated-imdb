Saw it at the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Film Fest. <br /> <br /> What can I say? Against my better judgment I liked it, but it seemed to me that the play was a little ... weak (mostly I noticed from the teen boy's family). I think the manuscript was not a star to begin with, but the actors didn't make me believe in the relationships. <br /> <br /> The reason is also predictable. <br /> <br /> Nonethels, you liked it. The characters are sympathetic and the plot is not challenging or disturbing. It's cute, the characters care about each other, and I don't count it as fifty minutes badly used. <br /> <br /> But I do not recommend it.
