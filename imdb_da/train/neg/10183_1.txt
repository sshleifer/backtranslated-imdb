This is a very bleak production. The general consensus has always been that although Princess Margaret may have been pampered and pampered and perhaps wriggled in the excess luxury at her disposal, she was a very beautiful young woman. Here was the weakest point of production, the actor failed to get it across. It also turned out that the production budget could not extend to a hairdresser - from the beginning the hair of Princess Margaret had a permanent bird nest in the disorder and looked as if she had been pulled through a bush. The actor, who played the Duke of Edinburgh, seemed to have prepared for his role by seeing Rory Bremner imitating Prince Charles and was farcical. The production was a mistake that was run, clich√© ridden, embarrassing load of waste. I think all Daily Mail readers deserve a free DVD copy for Christmas!
