I saw this at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was awful! Every clich√©d, violent, rich boy's imagination was shown, you just knew how it would end especially with all the women's shots and the first girl's rape. The worst part was Q&A with the director / author and the author / producer they tried to cross as intellectuals, but one could say that they are the types that go on violence. I bet something, the frequent brothels and do drugs. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time. I had to keep my girlfriend from going out of it.
