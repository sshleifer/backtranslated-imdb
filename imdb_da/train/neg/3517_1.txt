I don't know who wrote the script for this movie, but from the first moment I was annoyed. Of all the possible decisions they could make in the mountains, why do they make the decision, which is the most dangerous of all? Why do the criminals seem stupid, even though they managed to get a large sum of money out of a bank and get rid of it? Why doesn't the main criminal country take helicopter shots, shoot Stallone, grab the money and fly with chicken as hostages? And there are several cases of illogical behavior. I would give this movie 5 points for good action and great landscape scenery, but because of the illogical behavior of the characters, I can only give this movie 1 point ...
