Written by Stephen King, but this treatment is not as solid as most of his stories on film. A mother and son move into a small Indiana town with a secret. They are sleep migrants, cat-shaped creatures feeding young virgins. This little story has its share of gore and special effects; plus hints. <br /> <br /> Alice Krige is excellent as a mother. Other looks are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King came as a caretaker for the cemetery.
