Sorry, but every time I watch a movie where a woman sucks a man and the man does nothing but struggles, the film loses all credibility. So, the new (female) Starbuck spotted the plot immediately before it even came out of the ground (no saying is calculated). Dirk Benedict was so much more plausible as the sensitive hero type than the new age Kattee Sackhoff - whose assault is likely to be hailed in the future as "a convincing, exciting, must-have, groundbreaking performance" of the politically correct new-speech of today's revision copy editors; But in essence, it's just a tired, old picture of a woman with a chip on her shoulder as big as a townhouse: the biggest clich√© on screens today. I can give this series another shot, but human caricatures alone will not keep me tuned. As James Hilton once tried, "A story, please, just give me a story."
