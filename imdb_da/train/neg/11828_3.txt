Some months ago, I was involved in a debate with another IMDb poster (Hey, Kmadden) about this movie. The poster insisted that if I gave 'Flushed Away' a chance, I liked it. Based in part on this argument, I went in to see the movie. <br /> <br /> 'Flushed Away' has good intentions (at least on Aardman's side) but lacks the strength to pull it all together. Its best asset is the Cave / Boat Captain, Rita (played by Kate Winselt), whom IMO should have been the protagonist of the movie instead of Roddy (Hugh Jackman). Rita is cool, hard and interesting, while Roddy spends much of his time on the screen. One of the things that bothered me most about 'FA' is the repetition of jokes that are not fun to begin with. When Roddy gets hit in the hook, the movie causes him to be hit five times more times. "My name is Shocky," says one of Rita's brothers who then electrodes Roddy at least three times. My tolerance for cheap gags involving pain is low. <br /> <br /> I won't waste time dealing with Katzenberg's kleptomanic tendencies against Pixar (A similar movie is a coincidence, five is a rip off). but I will say that I am disappointed with Aardman. They can do (and have done) so much better. Try harder next time guys.
