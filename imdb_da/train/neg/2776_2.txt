King Maker is a film about a series of real events that occurred during the Portuguese occupation in Indochina. <br /> <br /> Even though costumes and artisans are legitimate, the film still fails to impress the viewer. The action was especially extremely poor. Some of the actors are trying hard to let tears fall and the accents, both real and false, are extremely annoying. The story was too stupid and too stupid to be true and it seemed more like a history lesson. The movie couldn't even capture that kind of royal and centuries air, and it looked more like a botched attempt to make an Asian version of Elizabeth. <br /> <br /> Final say? Costumes and artistic direction give the film a breath of fresh air, but the performance was extremely poor, and the actors could not even give out natural emotions. In short, the movie sounded more like a hole abaloo than a script.
