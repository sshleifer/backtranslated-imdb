The topic seems quite dated today. Adapted to TV from Rona Jaffe's book; We turn and stumble through a fantasy existence. Four college students are deeply involved in playing a live version of board games Mazes and Dragons (based on Dungeons and Dragons). A player, a young Tom Hanks, goes into the fantasy world too deeply. His fellow players must come to their rescue and save him from self-inflicted injury. <br /> <br /> David Wallace, Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace round off in the foursome game. Support cast is made by veteran actors such as Murray Hamilton, Vera Miles, Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg. <br /> <br /> On this date, it seems lumbering and tame. But the highlight of watching is seeing Tom Hanks between his "Bosom Buddies" salad days and his big splash in SPLASH on the silver screen. The youngest of the viewer gets the most enjoyment.
