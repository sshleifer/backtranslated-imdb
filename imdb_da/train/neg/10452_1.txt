I saw 10 p.m. shows and I have to say that this movie was nothing special. Although I did not leave the theater that wanted my time back (since I do not actually pay for movies anymore), I did not find any redeeming features. <br /> <br /> There were some lines and things that made me chuckle, but mostly the movie seemed to consist of a fierce fan service to the younger one (in mind more than the age this movie is rated R) male audience. The fan service seemed out of place and quite distracting as well. I know you all want to hear Samuel L. say his infamous line, but let's be honest, it's a lot of hype for very little pay. The only really awful part of the movie was CG, which so much digitized and didn't meet well with live action on the screen. Now I am a reasonable man, I knew to go into the theater that I would not see "Casablanka" and I am at least grateful that this movie is an original (albiet inane) idea and not a re-release or franchise spin off. But to be honest, if you're not part of the cult, you're probably better off spending your money elsewhere and watching the movie in another round of theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months.
