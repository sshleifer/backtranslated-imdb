I was very disappointed with this 1970's movie based on a Bernard Malamud story. This is basically a story of possible redemption, racial bias and the failure of life based on mistrust. A black Jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his critically ill wife. If Morris Mishkin (Zero Mostel) only wants to believe in the angel (Belafonte), his wife Fanny (Ida Kaminska) will recover. The problem is that Morris is basically abandoned and just refuses to believe Belafonte is an angel. <br /> <br /> When he thinks so, Fanny improves, but at last he is in doubt, and Fanny suffers. It would have been very nice if there was an English translation in the last scene when a dying Fanny speaks to Morris. <br /> <br /> Jan Kadar, who successfully performed Miss Kaminska in her Oscar-nominated brilliant performance in 1966's "The Shop on Main Street" also manages this movie. Kaminska is reduced in the movie to mostly bed scenes and her kindness in her speech really does not convey the desperate situation she is facing. She continues to call Ruthie, their daughter, who does not obey them by marrying the Jewish religion. For most of the film, she does not discover the appearance of the fire in her apartment. <br /> <br /> The scene in the pharmacy is confused and the scene where England's pig wine confronts Belafonte in their apartment is memorable, but all too short. <br /> <br /> We don't know why Belafonte is in danger and why he's dead. <br /> <br /> Those watching this movie should have left the theater in a state of depression and desperation.
