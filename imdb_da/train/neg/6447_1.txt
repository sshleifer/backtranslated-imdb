I bought this movie for $ 5 in a grocery store on my local video store, only for one reason Chase Masterson, but I should have crumbled up five, thrown it in a toilet and rinsed. The movie is about a bunch of twenty somethings who topped high school and reunited the anniversary of their idiot friends dead, who became drunk and walked into the forest and died. There problem is a reptilian monster is hunting them down one by one. The action is immense, these worthless people were apparently thrown offs at shows like 90210 and Dawson's Creek. The management was on a par with a twelve year old, and the manuscript was probably done by a thirteen year old. The whole set looks like someone else's backyard in Malibu. The people here who have praised this movie are, of course, friends of the director and / or the actors. Avoid this pile of garbage at all costs.
