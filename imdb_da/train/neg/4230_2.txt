Ok, I like B movies ... I know what B movies should represent. But it's just awful. I'm amazed to get such a decent overall score. The only redeeming qualities of this flick are the (mostly) marginal splatter effects. Don't make me wrong, do swell in this flick - but few effects really jumped on me (like the anal "probe" ... it was amazing!). I think this movie was recorded on a camcorder. C'mon - rent a Betacam at least, I've seen porn with better production values ​​(and better performing too). <br /> <br /> Acts - sucked! But not in the Troma or Full Moon kind of way. <br /> <br /> History - constructed! But that's what you get from movies like these. Very loose! <br /> <br /> Sets & props - sucked! My 16 year old brother makes more elaborate sets for our house on Halloween. Dubbing and dialogue - sucked! Horrible Voice Dealer (I don't even call it acting) and every other word is "S ** t" or "F ** k". <br /> <br /> There are tons of good classic and B-rated horror / splatter flicks out there and they're not that hard to track. Do yourself a favor by not wasting time on this crap!
