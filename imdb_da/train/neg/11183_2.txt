"People I Know" is a clunker where no one should fight for and no one should care about - despite a talented cast game. <br /> <br /> Pacino delivers its usual tour de force as Eli Wurman, a pastor who is the sensation of the past, eroded by a lifetime of moral corruption. But, unlike Michael Corleone, it is impossible to get an emotional investment in this character, his dilemma, or his fate. The film tracks Eli's preparations for a liberal political cause while distracted by a client (Ryan O'Neal, good at a signed part) recent "dirty laundry" - in this case, a television actress companion who has become involved with the wrong people. Tea Leoni brings her usual starry power to this supportive role, even though the script doesn't give her much to work with. As Eli's son-in-law, Kim Basinger can induce sympathy despite inappropriate plot mechanics. <br /> <br /> This movie is strictly for those who like to see Pacino, stretch their stuff and enjoy the other principles. Unfortunately, "Man I Know" between the script and the direction is strictly amateurish. Therefore, the limited theater release and fast travel to DVD. Consider yourself warned.
