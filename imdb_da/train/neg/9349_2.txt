This movie was horrible. I've given the highest score of 2 that I've seen worse but very few. From the klich√©d start of having the end of the movie at the beginning and going back to the start at the end this movie used everything in tricks in tricks that were used for film making, just because it is due to it as a child with too many toys. There was the endless, boring repetitive narrative, slow motion, freeze frame, flashbacks and merged images, etc. - none of them made a dull movie better. <br /> <br /> It's called "16 Years of Alcohol", but there was little drinking or drunkeness and no portrayal of retreat with the movie jumped all over the place with no coherent meaning. The story was poorly written and extremely pretentious, and the direction was just as bad, and it is a pity that people have put up more money for more films by Mr Jobson, who previously knew they were in a rubbish group and on television, so much like this I make it a big fight to see this to the end, but in the hope of getting better I went on to the bitter, but it was really a waste of time and I would have been better not bother.
