I never really like Myra movies, I appreciate how it pushes the Hollywood envelope at that time. Absolut Miss Welch's costume became an iconic image, although I have to ask many people who recognize the image, really watch the movie and know what it was all about - <br /> <br /> I rewatched Myra at FMC a couple of years Since then, did not think it had improved over the years. There is a section about it in the comic books Sexploitation Cinema Cartoon History, where it is given proper credit to put such big stars into what was then a monstrous production. Imho, the movie is too bitter to be charming, too stupid to be a turn-on, and so busy trying to shock that it fails to inform, engage or entertain ---
