Im the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when i choose a movie so i picked five over the eyes, i was disgusted by this movie and thought there was no story line and no point that you could Enjoy it, it made my skin crawl to believe that people like to watch movies that just call for hell for it, it was low budget and very rubbish! I think I could do better myself. I think it was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, and you shouldn't bother to see it, the actors were bad the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch I think it was a little a bit like a cheep rip off off dick as a project and it hasn't worked at all it was foul.
