Now where do you start here? Straightheads presents me with a bit of a dilemma. Had this movie come out of Italy in 1975, been directed by Ruggero Deodatto and starring David Hess, then I would patch it up faster than Labrador drinking water on a summer day. Because while Tarantino and Rodriguez are busy elsewhere with their tribute to grindhouse cinema, Dan Reed has produced a rape / revenge grindhouse picture of his very own in England and on the same budget as it would have taken Rodriguez to make Rose McGowan's leg a machine gun. Because if you want to play grindhouse bingo, let me call out the 'numbers': <br /> <br /> 1. Rich, high-flying career woman meets a bit roughly from the wrong side of the tracks in an incredible way and equally impossible get hots for him. Check. <br /> <br /> 2. Gratuitous shots of the high flying career woman in various states of nudity. Check. <br /> <br /> 3. Envelope and very unlikely plot development that sets up characters that exist only to do what they do and who cannot imagine having any existence outside the scenes they are in. Check. <br /> <br /> 4. Unnecessary graphic rape scene committed by a gang of men without any depth of personality or background except that they are there for rape. Check. <br /> <br /> 5. Gritty and bloody scenes of murder and revenge to round it all. Bingo! <br /> <br /> Plotwise, Straightheads is pretty basic: Dyer meets Anderson and she invites him to a party on a country pole owned by her boss. On the way home, the three locals disturb in a Landover who takes revenge by giving Dyer a good shoe and vulture Anderson. The couple then sat down to avenge themselves. So far, "Straw Dogs", "Late Night Trains", "House on the Edge of the Park", "I Spit On Your Grave", etc. So why didn't I think much about this movie? A number of reasons: I guess, first of all, that if Gillian Anderson, like Gillian Anderson, has the right choice, makes me expect better, but that is the complete lack of honesty here than the most popular. Because when somebody settles down to see Hess and his ilk terrorize women and murder their men during those 70s, they always know exactly what they are getting - the low budget quickies designed to only shock and appeal to the lowest common denominator . The evils terrorize and murder the goodies, the goodies turn the tables on evil and kill them back, and everyone goes home satisfied, their desire to see a little unpleasant violence slaughtered and surely with the knowledge that the world order had been restored. <br /> <br /> As a writer and director, Dan Reed clearly believes Straightheads has far more to say about the human psyche than that and desperately tries to restore his film with a philosophical depth that is simply not there. For example, when Anderson and Dyer plan revenge on their attackers, they learn that one of the rapes has a fourteen-year-old daughter who is the object of the two men he is associated with. When Anderson finally meets him face to face, he admits that he only raped her as a distraction so his two friends would take the attention away from his daughter !!! The informal and bold way in which Reed drops this little revelation into the plot is simply jaw-dropping, it's almost as if he expects that simple reference to pedophilia is enough to throw the audience's moral compass into exaggeration and bring it to life. to leave the cinema, they think I just got through something of importance. To make sure we get it, at this time we are shown a review of the rape sequence for another time, apparently from the attacker's eyesight and his concern over his daughter, but Reed ensures we get many more shots of Anderson roughly handled and raped across the engine bonnet. Gratuitous does not go into it. <br /> <br /> Having been informed of his reasons for raping her, Anderson binds him over a table, hitting the business end of a sniper rifle (complete with great muffler, only if someone was clearing the fake imaging ) up on his jacket, but lacks the courage to pull the trigger and tells Dyer (who does not have such moral nausea) that "it is over". Otherwise, Dyer argues and their moral dilemma is presented as something that Wittgenstein and Russell might have discussed in their rooms back in Cambridge over tea and cakes. It is almost impenetrable in its ridicule. <br /> <br /> In fairness, mr. Anderson on the stomach throughout the movie. Obviously, she will leave Scully far behind and bless her, she certainly does wonder what Mulder would have made of his former partner who cut down to take a leak next to the road and then sodomize a man with a gun? Dyer, on the other hand, does what he does in almost every movie he is made to date - that is, playing a gay blimey guv cockney type chappie with a roguish grin, a cheeky teat line and a face that most would never get tired of punching. This is especially true of the final scene, where after murdering his attackers in cold blood, Dyer sees into the camera what I am sure is thought to be a look at existential anxiety that invites us to sympathize with the fate of the hand Treated him and the moral swells he has had to overcome, but instead is much more reminiscent of Oliver Hardy, who looks confidently on the camera, after Stan has landed him in yet another fine mess. Which randomly summarizes this movie quite nicely.
