I rented this horrible movie. The worst I have ever seen. I think a 1st class class could have done a better job. The worse movie I've ever seen and I've seen some bad ones. Nothing scary, except I paid 1.50 to rent it and it was 1.49 too much. The action is horrible, the characters are worse, and the movie is just a piece of trash can. The striking house scenes are so low budget that it makes a B movied look like an Oscar candidate. All I can say is if you want to waste a good night and a little money go rent this horrible flick. I'd rather see kittens clutches from outer space while sitting in a bucket of shavers than sitting through this flop again
