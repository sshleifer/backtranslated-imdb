Although it is early to say how the series will evolve, I can say that the pilot was smaller than I thought it would be. However, there is still potential for the series. Of course when I first saw Voyager, I thought it also had potential - but was very disappointed. My gut tells me that Enterprise will not be as bad as Voyager. <br /> <br /> Regarding the pilot's impressions ... The pilot had some good ideas and good topics. I liked the introduction. The show's opening credits were interesting, with the exploration of exploration and an appropriate theme song. Scott Bakula is excellent in the captain's role. <br /> <br /> What made me short was that history lacked the "feeling" of embarking on a great adventure. Plot of the episode itself was more of a "generic" Trek story with the themes "exploration" and "first step toward space", just subplot and subtitle. If you were to edit the references to this as the first deep space mission, the plot would be difficult to distinguish between Eras Enterprise, TOS or TNG. The central plot does not reflect or make right the major theme of the series. <br /> <br /> The reason for launching the first mission would have been big enough without "action". Instead of isolated references to news exploration, they could have been the story. Get a little more nostalgic and philosophical about it (oh for a TV show that would make us think again). Let's feel the thrill of "the wind" and be on the "sea" instead of distracting us with a rescue and an abundance of gunplay. There was far too much gunplay. <br /> <br /> We had the feeling more that people were "freshmen" in an established school. New kids on the block, as opposed to awakening into a largely unknown universe. Unfortunately, Klingons landed on our door instead of finding them. This meeting could have been much more historical and far more sociological. Just how do two such different communities interact? I just have to think of it more as `Trek with an akward crew and limited technology 'as opposed to` the first brave steps in the unknown'. I wanted to see something newer and fresher. The series promises to have a new concept, but so far I have not seen this new, great concept. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I repeat the feeling that the series has potential. There are some interesting signs. Bakula is wonderful. Blalock has the potential. The overall theme is the most interesting one when we first saw Kirk in a world before Apollo 11. If only future episodes can do justice to this great and wonderful theme, we will have a show that will create new legends. <br /> <br /> You shoot an arrow into the air ... Good luck Capt. Archer. <br /> <br /> To the manufacturers: TAKE MORE RISKS AND MAKE US * Think *! :-)
