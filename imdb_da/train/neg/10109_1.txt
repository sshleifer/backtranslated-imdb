BTK Killer, Green River Killer, Zodiac Killer; The man continues to lay absolute nonsense and the ironic thing is, he loves his shit. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a Ulli Lommel movie, but I was so amazed at how everyone thinks his stuff is so terrible. As the movies I said at the beginning, not even six respond to each other when added! After reading the comments I was curious to see how bad this guy really is. He's the worst out there. The credits would not end when the pathetic movie started, and I quickly noticed that the sound was incredibly badly dubbed. The play was incredibly horrible and the same for the camera shots. Editing is easily the worst. This movie made no sense and I couldn't hold it anymore, as it wouldn't end and I was only 45 minutes in the movie. I couldn't take it anymore. I wasted 45 minutes in my life. <br /> <br /> DO NOT SEE THIS CRAFT!
