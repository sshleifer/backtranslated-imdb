The Wicker Man. I'm so angry that I can't write a proper comment on this movie. The plot was ridiculous, thinly tied together and, in general, just lame. Nicolas Cage ... shame on you! I assumed that since you were in it, it would be least decent. It was not. <br /> <br /> I felt that much of the movie had been left on the rock floor and even though it's finished - the movie was just foreign and stupid. <br /> <br /> In the end, you are left foot agape, mind befuddled and good taste offended. I have never heard so many people leave a theater on the opening day with so much hate. People complained about it in small groups in the mall, four floors down from the theater near the entrance. It's so bad. <br /> <br /> I heard about: Glitter, American Werewolf in Paris and Gigli. My boyfriend was so angry he wouldn't even talk about it. <br /> <br /> Grrrr!
