IMMORTALIZATION was interesting. It certainly did not kill me in the hour and a half, but it didn't impress me much either. A group of children are abducted in an alley of muscle head mutants (in a scene with the cinema's least compelling crushing sound effect) and taken to a fancy house in the suburbs. Here, Dr. Divine and his team brain transplants to his rich old patients so they can get young bodies again. Hi, this was quiet again with a big budget a few years later as FREEJACK! Who knew when transplanting an old person's brain into another body that their new voice sounds exactly like their old voice? With all this talk of pineal glands and the use of a glowing green serum, you can almost see the visions from FRA AND RE-ANIMATOR dancing in the producers' heads. But production has literally not the courage to pull it off. I never understood why when someone makes a low budget horror movie, they don't pack it to the edge of the frame with gore. The action is uniformly horrible, with the only good performance coming from Clarke Lindsley as assistant Dr. Price. He has a good grin. The only other thing about IMMORTALIZING is that it contains lots of old people doing their own stunts. Seriously, most of the casts take some serious bumps for old people.
