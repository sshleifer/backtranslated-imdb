The signs of deep-less rip offs. You've seen all the characters in other movies I promise. The script tries to be edgy and uncomfortable, but fails failed. It throws in some hangover meets superbad comedy, but the jokes are far out of the left field, completely forced and almost barred almost after they are cracked. hot chick is old and has no personality, just shes some early thirties blonde chick with a few clever ass non-underwear wearing jokes that are less than endearing. The attraction between Molly (the hot chick) and Kirk (dorky love interest) is barely announced. The attraction in nothing to be found is a completely platonic relationship until the unpleasant and predictable seat belts have arisen. First, they are in full context and it is just incredibly lame. The main file of this movie is not the relationship, but an unsuccessful attempt to make a raunchy super-bad-esquire movie with a semi pleasing plot. I could compare this with the carpenter, in his forced nature. I don't want to get into it. I could go on, but it's just meaningless. Just pay not to watch this movie.
