This topic deserves a much better script and final result than this movie serves. The script is full of holes because it was never perceived as a story, but rather a string of nightmare scenarios loosely knit. The gap and the loose ends in history are many. The scene where the kidnapper has been told that her parents have not died and has been searching for her since she was taken is just bizarre. It is written as a cathartic therapy moment with the head's house flush, which gave her a "missing poster" from when she was eight. In the real world, if the head of a house fled to find out that he had solved the kidnapping during his roof, it would have followed an immediate call to the police. It's a law enforcement problem not a 12 minute segment for Oprah. Everything that follows from there to the end is so short that I can only conclude that the first 90 minutes were for pure free use. Fun, that's what this movie should condemn. Finally, it seems to have become a member.
