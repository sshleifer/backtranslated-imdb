Kitten Natividad, from Russ Meyer's film lady, plays Chastity Knott, a woman who has found that she has breast cancer, so she goes to South America to get a special fruit (Crockazilla?) That needs healing powers. Having fallen on some of this fruit (which seems to be plastic bananas on stems), chastity is endowed with some mysterious magical powers that make her a superhero, especially Double D Avenger. Note that she also wears a pair of panties as a mask. In writing, it all sounds pretty good. In execution, it leaves more than a little to be desired. It seems that chastity owns a pub, and a local strip joint is disturbed because she takes away from their business, so some of the strippers (including Haji, also of Russ Meyer's film lady) go after her to destroy her. Of course, chastity fights back in the dual damper cover. Watch her make a "Wonder Woman" type spin to switch to her outfit and also lose her balance due to excessive centrifugal force. Bad jokes and lame double entrants fly as if there was no tomorrow. With the inane theme song playing over and over, it comes out as a twisted 70s "live action" adult show adult show, though this has not been rated, it might get away with the PG-13 at worst. And it is another blessing that the faded stars were well covered. This makes Doris Wishman's Chesty Morgan movie look positive in comparison. Special look of Forest J. Ackerman but then what. Very stupid and I never buy another movie with Joe Bob Briggs on the cover. 2 out of 10
