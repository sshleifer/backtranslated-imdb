Parasomnia has an interesting premises, but the story is poorly done without tension or even a logical approach. They threw in convincingly, even Patrick Kilpatrick, who played great roles in movies like Scanner Cop 2, Open Fire, Under Siege 2 and Eraser. The rest of the casting is unknown (and not very good) with the exception of Jeffrey Combs. (Herbert West from the great Re-Animator trilogy). But he can play roles like this in his sleep (which is a little what he does here). The main problem is that the characters' characters do not make sense at all. The story is pretty boring and predictable with cheap computer effects mixed with some gyros, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> This could have been so much better, I don't get the good reviews on this. It is below average really.
