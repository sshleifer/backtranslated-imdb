With a story and manuscript that has apparently been written by a high school student, "The Art of Seduction" has not delivered the romantic, sophisticated experience it seeks to count on. The two main characters have the potential to be interesting - both male and female leaders are "swinging singles (or in the case of the women's leader, engaged)", but "The Art of Seduction" doesn't even try. Shirking from an honest study of these two persons' personalities, The Seduction Art, scares some of the substance on the basis of thin, lean stereotype. <br /> <br /> "The art of seduction" is abusive - insulting to its characters, abusive to men and women and abusive to its audience's expectations. It takes the awful beautiful people we all know and play out of their painful interactions while we expect to idolize them. Ji-wan is an immature, spoiled, manipulative bitch. The viewer is expected to suffer and forgive her mistakes because she is beautiful. My-June, well, he is exactly the same. Neither are nice people. "Humor" in this film is primarily about Ji-wan and Min-Jun's overseas attempts to exaggerate each other in the honorable art of lies and manipulation. No sign development occurs and we never learn why Ji-wan and Min-jun are like this. We are simply expected to take them as they are and not ask questions - they are sweet! And that's all that matters. The abundant references to the major actors 'celebrity in the azn cinema scene scenarios can tell you the' Art of Seduction's shallowness. <br /> <br /> If you're still in high school, you like Grease or you're a yellow fever, you like this movie. <br /> <br /> Despite its "Romance" tag, this is not a really good date movie.
