Think of Grudge 2's ending with the following: <br /> <br /> - A man who repeatedly says the word Sunshine - a cowboy - a love story - Sarah Michelle Gellar cut herself - and a creepy mirror <br /> <br /> OH AND UNDERWATER SWEET ANIMALS ... yay ... <br /> <br /> not a good movie ... I really don't see it well. The movie poster is also very misleading and I found out that it was just sucking people to see it ... I can't believe I went. <br /> <br /> Save your time and money ... go see Saw III ... a movie where writing makes you feel there was effort in it ... <br /> <br /> Im Mike and I are out
