I never once promised to go out of any movie (a personal policy that caused me to suffer through the most different kinds of drinks, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Dogstay was a really horrible experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think Austrians are a miserable, pathetic bunch of retarder. It shows a world where love and humanity does not exist, a world where people only humiliate one another for a reason - distract from their own miserable existence. By choosing a documentary-like style with non-professional actors (most of them resembling the imagination of the Austrian shock-cartoonist Deix) director Seidl would like us to believe that this is the reality of Austrian (European? Western?) Suburbs. The viewer is confronted with depictions of sex organs, violence against women and disabled people, madness and degradation. But it is not social criticism. This is just pure shock without aesthetic value. Instead, you get bad acting, poor filmography, poor filmmaking. If anyone needs a movie like this to realize that something is wrong in our society, then that person must have gone through life with their eyes closed. This is pseudo-social criticism with a sledge hammer. And it looks down on people in a disgusting discouraging way. It shows ugly people - that's not why I hate it. But it depicts average people in an ugly, misanthropic way. And that's why this movie is really despicable.
