It's hard to put words into the almost sweet hatred of this movie. But I will try: <br /> <br /> Every second word was explosive, the sex scenes were unpleasant, drugs were violent and stereotyping was out of the norm, if not offensive to the Italian-Americans. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying the play was terrible because Leguizamo, Sorvino, Brody, Espisito et. Al, worked well. But ... almost every character in the movie I despised. Not since the vanities, I do not like any character on the screen.
