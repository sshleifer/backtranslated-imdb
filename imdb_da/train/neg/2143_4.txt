I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella, and have always loved it so much that the tape is a bit worn. That's why I was thrilled to see that Cinderella 2 came on TV and I would be able to see it. <br /> <br /> I should know better. <br /> <br /> This movie joins the club of movie followers who should have been just left alone. It has absolutely nothing of the originals super charm! It seems to me, quite rough and almost brutal, ranging from (not) Sing-a-longs to the characterization. <br /> <br /> While I remember the character's story of a story through a song, this movie's soundtrack was laid over the top and did not seem to fit. Jaq's transformation into a human is a good example: Where he walked around eating an apple and adding a few small quips here and there, he should have danced around and sing about how great it was to be high! And in the ballroom there is old country dance type country music. It is as if the authors forgot where and when this story was set. The optimistic fiddles certainly do not fit. <br /> <br /> Even the artwork and animation in Cinderella 2 are not up to scratch with the original. The artwork in this film seems quite raw and less detailed. And we see a part of Cinderella's skirt that doesn't feel right. <br /> <br /> The movie itself could have been its own story, I think it should have been just that. I won't say I hate it, but I think it had many shortcomings. It seems to downgrade significantly from the beloved Cinderella original.
