You have to give it to Steven Seagal: whatever his other mistakes may be, he has good taste in women. If you choose a Seagal movie, there are chances that there will be one or more very beautiful women in it. And as a rule, they do not act as mere eye-hands; they get involved in action and fight, shoot weapons, kill with knives, etc. "Flight of Fury" offers the duo Ciera Payton (who has a very sexy face with delicious lips to match Angelina Jolie) and Katie Jones, and finds time to get them involved in both catfight and some lesbian fondling! And if it seems like I'm spending too much time talking about them, it's because the rest of the movie, although acceptable, is so unexciting that it's hard to find much else to talk about. Ironically, the weakest aspect is probably Seagal himself, who looks as though he can't even be bothered by trying to care. This is a military-type player who is very small in it, and he does not fit into his role (a sniper fighter, "the best in the world", of course) very well, which can explain his almost offensive sleepwalking.
