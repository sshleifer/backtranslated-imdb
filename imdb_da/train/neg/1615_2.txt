Same old same old about Che. It completely ignored the truly interesting facts of Che's true character. Sodeberg redirect the same boring story about Che. The stupidly seductive tale of an Argentine rich boy who was so shocked at poverty became a Robin Hood fight with the poor until he was eventually murdered by the CIA. Yes, yes, heard it all before, BORING and UNTRUE! The reality of Che Guevara is very different and far more explosive! The facts show that he was totalitarian with a messiah's streak, which would obviously impose Maoist tyranny on the world. He was so fanatical that in the hottest moment of the Cold War he even asked the Soviet Union to nuke New York, Washington or Los Angeles and bring the end of the world. CHe urged Khrushchev to launch a nuclear strike against US cities. For the rest of his life, he stated that if his finger had been on the button, he would have pushed it. When Khrushchev backed and literally rescued the world, Che was furious with "fraud". If Ch's recommendations were followed, you would not read this review now. How a homicid maniac became a pop icon would have made a much more interesting movie. Amazingly, no filmmakers have been bold enough to show the real side of Che and his posthumous media transformation. IT WILL DO AN Oscar winner film! I thought making independent movies meant taking real risks and being groundbreaking! They only stick to "safe counter-culture issues", "Che cool", "Wall Street bath", "Republican = Nazi", "Bush ex Hitler", "NRA is worse than KGB", "Christians are fanatics and stupid", etc ... ad nauseum. Oooh, how daring how the mind blows. Tres anti-mainstream and edgy. I wish they would have some real cojones and tackle the independent film Oligarchy! It would be really daring!
