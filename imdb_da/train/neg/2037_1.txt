If I could give it a zero, I would change it and give it a -10 instead. Absolutely horrible film without a movie plot, doesn't make sense about what happens. Just PLAIN BORING. Don't waste your money on this. Pleaseee !!! This movie could have done so well if it really portrayed the story of the true zodiac, but no, I felt nothing but shame while I watched it. Do yourself a favor and rent some classic movies instead, it's better to watch a movie you've already seen as 3-4 times than look at this crap! I don't understand why people even disturb themselves to make such movies when they know it's not going well. The Zodiac killer must be called 'Boriac Killer' instead !!!
