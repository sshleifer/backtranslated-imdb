If there was ever a movie that deserved a great fat zero rating it is this pile of crap. I love zombie movies and even bad ones usually have something for them but not this cruelty. In fact, I started to feel angry at this movie because it is so insultingly bad, I cannot believe that the people responsible for it would actually believe that this was acceptable. There is no plot and the non-plot is cut with scenes of sadism and spanking. The people do not react, act or in any way resemble humans. The whole movie is also shot in two rooms, which are gently decorated to be watchful similar to the places they should be. The whole thing is a pointless mess, it does not go anywhere, and when the zombies finally come up, they look nonsense and do not do much. <br /> <br /> I could make a better movie than this, so can you and that too could anyone who had never seen a movie before. It's miserable and undoubtedly the worst movie all the time. <br /> <br /> Honestly, the worst movie all the time. You also notice that the only positive reviews give this a 10/10 and encourage you to buy the DVD. I can't imagine any neutral really think it's a good movie, it's terrible. <br /> <br /> 0/10 and it's generous.
