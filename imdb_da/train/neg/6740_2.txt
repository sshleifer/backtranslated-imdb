Too much of anything borrowed grade B- <br /> <br /> The Super Bowl Sunday is one of the slowest days on the theaters every year. Because of this, the film studios tend to avoid releasing larger budgeted movies this weekend. Within a few years, a studio broadcasts a counter-programming female quarrel (2001's "The Wedding Planner") to compete with the big game. This Super Bowl weekend with the same name "The Wedding Date" will try to find success and attract viewers who do not see the game. <br /> <br /> Sufferers of sad people commit Kat Ellis (single-time, Kat Ellis (Debra Messing, TV's "Will and Grace") male escort Nick (Dermot Mulrony, "About Schmidt") to Being her boyfriend for her sister's wedding in London, her family has given her a hard time telling her that she was not married and her seven-year-old clerk who dumped her for no reason is the best man. Kat paired Nick around her ex to get him to see what he was missing, but in the end Nick Kat helps her open up and let someone love her. <br /> <br /> The movie lends too much of It is almost a carbon copy of 1999's "Picture Perfect" and blends in scenes similar to "The Wedding Planner" and "My Best Friends Wedding." The movie also features a reverse "Pretty Women" theme that goes after it and know her audience, the director makes clever references to it and other movies. <br /> <br /> "The Wedding Date" has all the klich√©dic elements of A typical wedding film, which is the stereotypically indulgent mother (Holland Taylor, "Legally Blonde") and practically plagiarized wedding tales of the family and friends at the wedding and rehearsal dinner. The twist at the end has been done before, but it was something that was not entirely expected. The real reason why Kat was dumped comes as a surprise and changes the direction of the movie in the last half hour. <br /> <br /> Although "Wedding Day" is predictable, it is able to stand on its own. Debra Messing shows in her first lead that she can be charming and fun. Dermot Mulrony has good chemistry with Debra Messing, but most of his dialogue was too corny and unrealistic. He is able to make the best of what he gets and be able to save the character. <br /> <br /> Using many clever puns (often sexual), the movie is actually fun. Although it is primarily a chick-flick, the movie has components that everyone can enjoy. The sensitive story and humor make it the best date movie released for a long time.
