Worst movie ever made !!! See the right movie reviews from the pros on this movie. See Rotten Tomatoes on the Internet for some good independent reviews on this movie. The comments from this site are apparently from people of some economic interest in this movie. I find the positive comments very misleading. I find it amazing how the negative comments are so bad against this movie, and the positive comments sound like an Academy Awards Speech. Don't waste your hard earned money !!!!!! This movie is retarded !! I can't believe a movie like this would ever be made. Why would Hollywood waste their time on such junk? This movie is an attempt at nothing. I wonder what looser actually would sink their money producing such trash can. I went to the blockbuster and the companion even told us not to waste our time or money. I didn't listen and I wasted my time and money. Please make the same mistake! It's really the "worst movie ever made!"
