This is the worst piece of crap I've ever had to see - in fact it was so bad I just had to see it :-) <br /> <br /> CGI is so bad, it's fun! It's not even close to the Shitty CGI animations in Spawn, it's so bad, I have ... <br /> <br /> I'm surprised by the fact that some distribution companies have actually put money down to Release this on DVD, but I think they get more money out of it that way, because the cost of doing so may not have been more than a few hundred dollars. It's so terrible that a preschool could have done it. <br /> <br /> See it and laugh!
