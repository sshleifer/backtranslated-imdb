My friends and I rented that movie last night and we had one of the biggest laughs for a while. The movie should not be fun at all, but it is just so ridiculous and it lacks any realism at all. First, Phillippe (I forget what his character is and I am not really interested) uses his permanent employee ID to go through all top-security terminals. Not only is it pathetic, but it is peaked when his enormous efforts culminate in his discovery of the scary Lego space hosted by supercomputers. This is common fun. The tense atmosphere we have to experience is completely spoiled by the childish-looking room. The end, like everything else, is very very very cheesy, especially when the evil guy's lawyer turns out in time. Anyway, this movie is a good laugh. If you need something to make fun, then be sure to see it.
