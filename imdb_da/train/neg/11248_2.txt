One gave it a "2" instead of a "1" (horrible), because it is not denied that many of the pictures were amazing, a lot of talent went into special effects and works of art. But it wasn't enough to save it. <br /> <br /> "Sepia" tinted, lacquered colors of things have been done many times in other films. Nothing new there. I can see that there were some hat-tips for other old, classic movies. OKAY. No problem with that. <br /> <br /> But a movie should be entertaining and interesting, not something that will put you in bed. <br /> <br /> The story and script in this movie was terrible, the characters two-dimensional. Slowly moving. Some of the scenes were pretty much to look at, but in the end it was quite boring, I couldn't recommend it.
