The only reason to comment is because I finally found out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week, Dr. Cox bailed because they showed these episodes in a different order than they filmed them. The latest episode when our favorite scared, Jesus-loving nurse Roberts dies Dr. Cox shaves his head. The goal has shown them out of service for some odd reasons and forgot that they were pushing up continuity. For shame, Scrubs. They've made mistakes like this before. I remember when Elliot was trying to dance Scott Foley and her hair was wet 2 seconds before the water hit her. I'm not trying to notice these things, but my favorite program has to step up.
