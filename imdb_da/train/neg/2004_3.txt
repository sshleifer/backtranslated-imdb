I read the book a long time ago and do not remember the plot specifically, but remember that I enjoyed it. When I'm home sick on the couch it seemed like a good idea and Hey !! It's a lifetime movie. <br /> <br /> The film is populated with B actors and actresses. <br /> <br /> The female cast is straight out of Desperate Housewives. I've never seen the show, but there are lots of commercials for the show and I get the core. Is there nothing original anymore? Safe, but not lifetime. The male cast is all fairly equal in appearance and play, but the girls need to have spouses I suspect. <br /> <br /> In a scene, a woman struggles with a man, for her life, and what does she do ??? Kicking him in the testicles What else? Women love it, but let me tell you something ... It's not as easy as it always is to see. <br /> <br /> It wasn't all bad. I got chills a while or two, so I have to credit someone with it.
