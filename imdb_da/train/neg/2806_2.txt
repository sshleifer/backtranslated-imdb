The worst kind of movie. Basically, the US Declaration of Independence was replaced with a plasma screen, and this tricked the museum's security for several days. Eh? The plasma screen, which will theoretically run for less than 2 seconds, sees battery, provided it had a low enough internal resistance to deliver the required power that it would not. <Br /> <br /> It would be possible with a dozen large car batteries and an inverter, but that system would not fit into the case. Sorry to be anal, but it's not even close to being plausible. The rest of the movie wasn't much better, and I'm left with why the budget could not have been donated to charity or me.
