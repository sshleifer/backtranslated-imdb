Director Spike Lee is famous for making movies that point to racism. In many of the films, such "Do the right thing," most of the white people are all brutal racists. In this movie, interracial marriage is the subject, with racism being the whole problem again. However, what Lee does, shows his bigotry against Christianity. It's amazing the double standards found in the movie world. If Lee or anyone else ever produced this kind of bias against another group, would he be confused, but Christian? Hey, it's "open season" on them. <br /> <br /> Ossie Davis, a judge in this movie, shoots his son and puts the smoldering gun on his bible. They zoom in on it to another close-up, only if you missed it. Hi guys here is another Bible reader and see how he is! Lee does this kind of thing in almost every movie he makes. <br /> <br /> He shows the same hate when dealing with race. Who could argue for exhibiting racism as a bad thing? Lee continues, however, in this film he has in his other films. His obvious bitterness towards white people does not help the situation. It only adds fuel to the fire. <br /> <br /> Hi, Spike: start "do the right thing" and let your prejudices stand in the closet. It is even better because the subject could have made a thought-provoking film if it had been done with objectivity and intelligence.
