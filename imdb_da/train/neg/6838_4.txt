Plot Synopsis: Hong Kong, 1966. Paul Wagner, the man who built Victoria Tunnel, is murdered with his wife by his fellow men. His twin sons, Chad & Alex, are separated from each other. Twenty-five years later, Chad, a karate instructor in Los Angeles, and Alex, a smuggler living in Hong Kong, go together to avenge their parents' murders and justify the tunnel. <br /> <br /> This is the second time Jean-Claude Van Damme & Sheldon Lettich have worked together as they have previously done "Lionheart". This is also the first of three films to play Van Damme with two roles ("Maximum Risk" and "Replicant" are the others). The reason is a very simplistic withdrawal story, the film's only redeeming feature is Van Damme's performance as two very different people ?? the splendid rich boy and the hard and shaken cigar who hugs hard guy. As it goes, Van Damme does not do a very good job in both roles, even though he is taking on Alex, being mildly funny. It is puzzling to have the brothers confused with each other, with them wearing different clothes and having different hairstyles. Bolo Yeung is a very worthy hand for the evil ones.
