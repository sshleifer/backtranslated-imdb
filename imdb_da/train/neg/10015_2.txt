Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow is a typical 1950s teenager in the riots. It's not a horror or science fiction movie. Plot relates to a group of teenagers who are being kicked out of their "hot rod" club because they cannot meet the rent. Once kicked out, they decide to try an old haunted house. The only saving grace for the movie is that the "ghost" (Paul Blaisdell in She Creature suit) turns out to be one of a movie monster played by Blaisdell.
