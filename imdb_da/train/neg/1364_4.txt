The more I think about it, there was nothing loose about this <br /> <br /> movie. I saw it 9 months ago so my memory could have done it <br /> <br /> worse than it was, but I know it was at least as bad as a 4 out of <br /> <br /> 10. <br /> After watching the movie, I met the director. he seemed so unclear <br /> <br /> what he did or what he had done, and as far as I could <br /> <br /> tell, he didn't care about the movie either. even he agreed that he <br /> <br /> didn't really know what he was doing and he was forced to do some things because it was filmed digitally. <br /> <br /> I felt the movie was trying hard to fit into the formula it <br /> <br /> built for itself: "9 people must all be linked in some way. < br /> <br /> we can get from point 'A' to point 'B' 'so to get from <br /> <br /> the prostitute is seen at the beginning and back to her at the end 10 <br /> <br /> minutes of each character's relationship with another person. it <br /> <br /> causes one to be strangled by the 2 dementia badly drawn <br /> <br /> characters. I just remember the one redeeming part of the movie ... Steve <br /> <br /> Bouchemi is a scene where he is amazing. that is it. as I <br /> <br /> say ... 4 out of 10.
