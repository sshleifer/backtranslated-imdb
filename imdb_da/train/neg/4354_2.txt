This show is terrible. no comedy, no plot no good signs. America is you blind giving the price to real shows. I hate this show along with 30 rock. Honestly I am so glad they canceled this show. thanks CBS. Hold two and a half men, hold Christine, keep the rules of engagement, stick to how I meet your mother who is really not fun but much more fun than this. This show is a rip off of friends. with the same instructor so it's okay. But keep this show away and never bring it back. never ever before. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 rating is because it keeps me awake instead of sleeping. It's the types of movies or TV shows that I give one. The only reason I was still awake was because of the audience's laughter and I was looking forward to the next show. I really wish this show was funny sorry but my opinion stupid. very stupid. I can't see why everyone loves it. my opinion again. but i also find the big bang theory a little stupid. my bad wise class farewell dad now i have a smile and its not from seeing your show.
