This was just awful the plot was just OK, but the rest of the item was bad. I mean to get on the puppet and then they even tried to make the movie digital and it made it even worse! Usually I would like to make budget movies, but this was just a waste of time and almost made me return the set it came up with. I have about ten low budget movies with like 6-8 movies on them, and I have to say this is the worse movie out of them all. Also, the wording is off, and they use a fake plastic machetes that do not even look like a real one, they could use one that looked even a little closer to a real one, so save your time and money and not see this horrible movie.
