Despite being a movie from 2001, the direction is the kind of 90-style style that was considered "old" and outdated some years ago. The cheesy cuts and effects were painful to look at. The script is decent enough and a couple of scenes made a kind of captivating me (like when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night). But the story of the detective whose sister killed himself and how he was obsessed with suicide was simply horrible. The appearance of the actor playing Selma Blair's married girlfriend has seriously bothered me. I got through it all, but it is rare for that kind of random, what is this movie you just find on TV and decide to watch.
