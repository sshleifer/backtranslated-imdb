First, I thought it was only about Eddie Murphy, who spoke to some stupid animals. I was right. Some people called this movie Eddie Murphy's comeback! Who are these people? Jesus, if this is the best he can bring, he can just stay away. What was the story again? I was so annoyed by all the lame jokes I forgot. I should have gone out on this one.
