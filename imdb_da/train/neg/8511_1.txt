I couldn't follow my life, find out or understand the story. As plot progress it also remains incomprehensible. I would guess and say that there was a preproduction story / plot problem that was never sorted. The producers could never separate the many details that the novel, or any novel, has the time and space to create from the second idea that would make a movie about a serial killer and the murderers' pursuit of the police. They ended up with too many things that took place in a prohibited motion picture time limit. Too bad really because they had a solid cast, a director who knows how to move around and excellent filmography. In fact, a well-created movie that you could enjoy and relax for a few hours.
