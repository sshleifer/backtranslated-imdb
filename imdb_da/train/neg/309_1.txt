Hey. I am Paul Raddick, a.c. Panic Attack of WTAF, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this god of horrible film that ran on Adam Sandler's film career but was digitized after a short time. Going Overboard is about an aspiring comedian, played by Sandler, who gets to work on a cruise ship and fails ... or I thought. Sandler meets babies like World History Part 1 and Rebound. The children should be engaged, but in fact they are executed by Sawtooth, the best possible cannibal world ever known. Adam Sandler went badly overboard but went better in Big Daddy, Billy Madison and Jen Leone's favorite 50 First Dates. Man, Drew Barrymore was a hot chick. Spanglish is red, Going Overboard is not Dooley squat! End of file.
