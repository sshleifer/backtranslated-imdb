Is Miike like Chabrol, changing art with dragon, sometimes confusing the two? Does he compare the thirty-five fifty percent, as some demands on Chabrol? Do we see too much or too little Miike? I do not know. I do not know. I do not know. But I could easily fill ten lines that simply quote Chakushin Ais (One Missed Call's) steals, allusions, and clich√©s. Others here will turn on most of them, although perhaps not Ochiai's Saimin (Hypnosis) to the shabby telecast that sneaks over supernatural things. Only once, when Yumi takes the zombie-like mother in her arms, a missed call scared me a little. <br /> <br /> Another point of interest: Renji Ishibashi (similar to Christopher Walken) as a detective. Ishibashi in the Auditions abused back story, and as Dead or Alive's boss Aoki of the chamber of excrement drowning and more, can be the most compelling evil character actor I've ever seen. So here he is a policeman.
