This is awesomely bad and awesomely embarrassing for a Canadian. We grow good wine. Our writers and poets are among the best in the world. The National Ballet is classified among the world's five largest companies. BUT WE DO BLOODY AWFUL MOVIE! This is not very bad. It is especially typical and typically poor, shot in two-bit hotels and public parks with thin direction, secondary level and "gee whiz ... let's see what this button on the camera does?" photography. If Michael Moriarity was so appropriate to make a Jack Nicholson imitation, could he at least have made a good Jack Nicholson imitation? And if the film was shot in Vancouver, truly one of the most beautiful cities on earth and also a yacht building center (part of the "plot"), why in the name of God we let the endemic Canadian inferiority complex dictate that it be disguised as Seattle ??? Not only am I angry with this movie, I am embarrassed and more than a little ashamed. The Australians show some amazing things. We produce pretentious second rate piffle. Gawd !!!!!
