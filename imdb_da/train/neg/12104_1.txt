Bill Maher's Religulous is not an attack on organized religion. It is an attack on Christianity and Islam. In addition to ridiculing a bunch of rabbis who discover curly machines to get around sabbaths, he really does not attack Judaism and seems furious when a rabbi actually challenges Israel's existence. If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to his logical conclusion, he would realize that Israel's creation in the Palestinian territories is based on the so-called "sacred books" of organized religion. These are signs of his complete and complete lack of objectivity or focus in the creation of this film. I find it really hard to believe that the man is an atheist or even all that intelligent. Anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their faith, but what do you offer them in return? Nowhere does he actually tell them why he thinks they are stupid. What makes him the "rational" person in space? In a way, it reflects how he really is and is becoming as stupid as the people. <br /> <br /> To watch a good movie / documentary about the current evil of religion and how religion can actually be harmful to human civilization, see Richard Dawkins '' Root of All Evil ''. It is an excellently researched documentary that clearly describes what it hopes to achieve and how. Bill Maher's Religulous is not fun, gives no interesting questions, nor does it give an insight into such a controversial topic. It seems to be an old man's robberies and ravages dissatisfied with his Catholic upbringing. I almost feel sorry for him.
