Honestly, I can't be bothered to spend my time writing about this milestone of cinematic incompetence - life is simply too short. What I want to say is that Alone In The Dark only succeeds in three things: 1. It makes you laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. 2. Throwing several useless plots into the air, but losing them all. <br /> <br /> 3. It disgraces the classic PC game that is supposed to be based on a complete flaw in all aspects of film making. <br /> <br /> Doctor Boll, if it really is what you are (I think proctology here), what on Earth are you doing in a director?
