Johnny and Jeremy are vampires of the sort. Minus fangs, of course. They are dark, bitter creatures with nothing better to do than to spread their own misery. Through their charm (namely, a sharp tongue and a bold wallet), the desperate souls seduce who they continue to torment and sacrifice. It is more or less the basis of this black comedy that I understand. <br /> <br /> It's not a mix of humor that I can easily subscribe to, partly because it botheres me to imagine the audience revealing a sleazy, protagonist. However, I enjoy the sound and melody of the fast fire (and supposedly very twigs) remarks. I was very impressed with the cast's strong plays, especially David Thelis; Only the character of Jeremy seemed to be bi-dimensional. The photography and music, both dramatic and gloomy, work very well together. <br /> <br /> What really strikes me about "Naked" (and the main reason I never recommend it to anyone) is the way it repeatedly appears to present misogyny as a valid way of airing it anxiety. In other words, in a world that sucks so badly, what difference does it make if you throw some pains on girls, right? To suggest (as some have on this site) that Johnny is not so rude a person because he is not as hard on girls as Jeremy, seems completely absurd to me. They are both terrible, ugly people. And they are particularly eager to hurt women every time they get a chance. One could claim that Johnny eventually gets what he deserves as if his bad karma suddenly swung right back and hit him in the row. But still his and Jeremy's sadistic behavior is treated to some extent as a ridiculous question. And I could be wrong, but I guess most people who absolutely love this movie also find the aspect of the movie dark comical.
