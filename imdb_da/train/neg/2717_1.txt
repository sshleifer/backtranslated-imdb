Do we really need more narcissistic garbage on Baby Boomer generation? Technically, I am a Boomer, but at the time all the "idealistic youths" in the 60s read Marx, their draft cards burned and generally extended a war that destroyed tens of thousands of lives; I was still in college. But I remember them well, and 9 out of 10 were just moronic fools who would believe something as long as it was destructive. <br /> <br /> This is just another exercise of self-interest from the kids who never really grew up.
