Horrible movie. About an old crusty painter hanging around with a young girl. Boring. Tatum O Neil goes through the movements in his part and has some of the corniest lines in film history. Richard Burton looks close to death in this movie, and we have to believe he sees "good at sixty". The play is bad as it is plotted. The signs are terrible, just like the story. It's really hard to feel for everyone in this movie, except Larry Ewashen, who plays a guy in a porn theater that hits Tatum, he's fun. This movie is really a waste of time. If you're a Tatum fan, like me - that's why I rented it in the first place - please don't watch this movie. She is really bad at it and you will wonder if maybe PAPER MOON was a fluke. It was not because of BAD NEWS BEARS and LITTLE DARLINGS it is known that she can work well but still does not rent this movie. And if you're a fan of Burton, rent something when he was nice and not fossil.
