Like most of the festivals, Hamiltons concludes an interesting watch a movie that is all ideas and little execution. Though impressive for the obvious low budget, the film falls into the final twist and becomes terribly long under it pulled out and obvious conclusion. The film is about a family of killers trying to survive after the parents have died. They kidnap people, drain the blood from them and feed something locked away in their basement. There are some fine dark humorous performances by Mckellhar and Firgens, and the rest are just so-so. The film never feels realistic or very disturbing for that matter. But for the first half, a strange humorous and dark mix is ​​poured, which is a surprising achievement. The next half is not as successful as it gets in the film's oblivion with unrealistic twists in a ridiculously cocky finale that makes the whole movie a complete hug. It is a shame, although there is no doubt that some talent was involved in this production, and although it is deeply deficient, it remains original and creative. Too bad that when it comes to delivery, it fails completely at all levels. <br /> <br /> ** / 5
