National Treasure is about as over-rated and over-hyped as they come. Nicholas Cage is by no means a credible action hero and this movie is not "Indiana Jones". People who have compared this movie to the Indian Jones classic trilogy have seriously fallen from their rocker. I can't really figure out what kind of audience this movie shot for. Perhaps the pre-teen audience will like it, but I found it absolutely ridiculous. Nor can I imagine that adults or young adults find this to be so big of a movie. Simply put: It's just ok at best. National Treasure is unimagined and uninspired and borrows what it has from "The Da Vinci Code". I would recommend waiting for the movie to be released in 2006 and pass this nonsense on. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​being so easy to steal the Declaration of Independence and running around Washington DC and Philadelphia with it (while it never harms it once) while struggling with the "evil" and experiencing what should be "non-stop action" is absurd. I especially loved the scene with the statement folded in its tubes, lying in the middle of a busy road, while cars laughing without destroying it. Oh brother! <br /> <br /> Reminded me of the episode of "Brady Bunch" where they go to the amusement park, and Mr. Brady loses her architectural plans. Except that the episode of Brady Bunch was much better than this whole movie! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​such a great treasure that no one thinks exists exists buried within a secret destruction of the United States is foreign. Literally, there are thousands of undiscovered "priceless" things in this treasure chest. Yeah right!! Ridiculous!! <br /> <br /> Worse still, the speed and accuracy that Cage finds out and what should be "hard" traces of these ancient puzzles is pre-posterous !!! Oh .. humanity! <br /> <br /> The shows from Cage, Voight and the other actors in the National Treasure are as stiff, wood and flat as they come. But when you work with such a miserable dialogue, it's hard to fault the actor's 100% for it. <br /> <br /> National Treasure is an OK movie to watch once. I can't recommend it beyond that and would definitely NOT buy this over the top, outlandish scavenger hunt for a mess. Rent it if you want to see it first .......
