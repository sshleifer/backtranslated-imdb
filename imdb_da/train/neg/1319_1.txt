Probably someone heard of Alberto Tomba. A former policeman, a former heavenly master, and now a terrible actor. "Alex L'Ariete" was scheduled to be a TV "mini serial", but the Italian television itself refused to show the movie on its channels. Now it's a, believe me, ridiculous movie. The script is simply fun (it must be a dramatic movie), something like a 5 year child labor. But what really blows you away is the amateur play: Alberto Tomba, who was actually not credible as a policeman himself, plays terribly a silly character: a special action Italian policeman specialized in smashing open doors! ("ariete" is "ram"). This super-guy will try to save a young beautiful girl's life (an actual Italian "little" TV showgirl, married to singer Eros Ramazzotti): Nice but absolutely unlucky in the actor. Lose this and do yourself a favor. A film that is a shame for the Italian cinema industry: Only John Travolta in Earth Attack was close ..
