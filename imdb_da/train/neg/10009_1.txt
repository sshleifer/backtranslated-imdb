This movie is a huge mortgage charge. Paul Schrader is completely lost in his own bad manuscript. And his leadership is as comatose as it can be without actually having slept during the process. <br /> <br /> The worst is Woody Harrelson, who I usually like when properly thrown. He plays "the walker", a gay man in D.C., who plays social companion to the Washington elite's bored wives. He could not have been more one-dimensional if he had been cut out of a leaf and jumped around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick. His "southern accent" is the "off the rack" version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers, as if the heat and humidity of the south is still draining him with every ounce of energy he has. It's monotonous. But his is not the worst accent in the movie. His "boyfriend", played by Moritz Bleibtreau, tries to influence a kind of Mid East accent that is so clumsy that he can hardly deliver the bad lines written to him. He is not able to roll his r, despite the fact that he is actually German and speaks several languages ​​- one of them is Italian! It's a good reason to throw someone else, don't you think? <br /> <br /> From the history of the play, to the director, to the work of the camera, to the performances of the leaders, this movie is bad from the beginning to the end. The only tolerable moments in this movie came from three entertaining actresses: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact. In fact, all three are excellent, despite being caught in a really bad movie. Unfortunately, no one can ever be good enough to redeem this infinite number of errors. If you like these three actresses, watch them in something else. This movie is not worth your time.
