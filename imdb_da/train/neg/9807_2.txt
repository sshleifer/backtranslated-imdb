Very rarely do I give less rave reviews on a show or movie I don't like on IMDb, but the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers are just so oddly awful, it's terrible. I would not have thought if it had been an animated series - would have been better in the way I guess, but as a live-action show, it is the expression of the terms 'cheesy' and 'campy'. Of which Power Rangers is. Five multi-colored, spandex wearing teens struggle evil by using their martial arts skills. The costumes are awful - they look like something that reminds one of what athletes and female gymnasts would have. The play is sad and battle choreography is so shockingly bad and so lame to see, it makes Jean-Claude Van Damme look as good as Bruce Lee, which is an understatement in itself. In fact, they look like they are jumping and dancing; as if it were a version of the 'Nutcracker', or they make the ball rather than fight. In addition, there are some cartoons that have strong martial arts, and yet it is done in a fun but not so cheesy way that makes it look stupid. Kids show or not, it's just as boring and on the verge of absurdity. And even though this version is set in America, you may be forgiven for thinking that when you see some of the battle sequences that they were not filmed in the United States, but rather in Japan; Thus, they became somewhat fake matches and recordings loan from the Japanese version - only to be equated with the American version. <br /> <br /> If you like this kind of thing, stick to the Sentai Japanese equivalent.
