This has to go down as almost one of the worst movies all the time. Awful play, horrible script ... and they were the good stuff! One to definitely miss! The witnesses, if you could call them that, were so predictable to be pathetic. Pamela Anderson still relies on her body to detract from her acting like plastic! I was willing to give it a try, hoping it would improve, unfortunately not! If it was a choice between this and a book, I suggest you sit down for a good reading! I like Denise Richards why I gave this movie a ride, but why she has let herself be thrown into this movie is beyond me!
