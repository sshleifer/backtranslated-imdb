In short, it's the worst movie since the "Police Academy: Mission to Moscow" (if you liked that movie, you probably like this one). What did they think? Some ideas should remain just that, an idea. The fact that this idea could be aimed at filming should be an offense. <br /> <br /> What was so bad about what I hear you're asking. One word ... Everything. <br /> <br /> Cost of rent: $ 4.50 Time to watch: 89 minutes <br /> <br /> I want a refund on both!
