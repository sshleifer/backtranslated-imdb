Oh, the Italians! Assuming movies of aristocrats with weird fetishes drowned castles in gothic atmosphere, and reluctant relatives trying to get their hands on an inheritance, are intrinsically interesting to everyone! If you've seen a movie of this type, you've pretty much seen them all (MST3K favorite "Screaming Skull" also fits the shape) ... and "The Night Evelyn came out of the Tomb" is formal, by the numbers and boring as hell. Even the delicious Erika Blanc wears out here. <br /> <br /> zero / 10 <br /> <br />
