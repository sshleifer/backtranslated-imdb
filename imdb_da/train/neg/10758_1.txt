This is probably the most boring, worse and useless movie I've seen last year. The plot that should have some philosophical aspects appeared to me as a very poor hollow copy of the matrix with lots of clich√©s: The lonely wolf policy, nice, psychologically disturbed, sleeping with his gun ... + lovely hard worker and shy, but nice she-scientist, you add a 2 cent plot and you have me, Robot! I was terribly disturbed by the obvious advertising of brands such as FedEx, Audi, converse, etc. This movie stinks commercializing and tends to be more of a bad ad space that unfortunately does not end after 30 sec. I would not recommend it to my worse enemy, if you have a little free time, watch a good TV program instead or read a good book better.
