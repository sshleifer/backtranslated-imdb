Five minutes after seeing this, I log on to IMDb to warn you all out there not to bother with this movie ... genre: horror? it had moments of mild excitement, and throughout the film I thought of myself "something should happen soon" it did not ... when the movie ended, I felt so embarrassed to the author / director that I have never been to it biggest fan of patrick rea this guy just doesn't know how to make movies and after seeing this apologized excuse for a horror girl I have gone from, has not been the biggest fan to not see another of his works .. <br /> <br /> I was taken off the plot overview, don't make the same mistake. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 2 for the actors .. they weren't bad and it wasn't that fault they got such a bad direction ...
