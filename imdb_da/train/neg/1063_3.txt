The idea is great. Bringing so many stars into a movie is amazing. But .... too many stories, too short and really lack any meaning. No connection between the scenes. There were some 3-4 brilliant stories ... but these were out of 18. The frame reminded me of "All the invisible children" - a movie I liked a lot. Compared to that, "Paris Je T'Aime" lacks the fascinating novel that develops - starting and ending. And it lacks the subject that connects all these - children. I can't find Paris enough of a topic to connect 18 short sketches together. Maybe for people who know Paris it is interesting. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it ...
