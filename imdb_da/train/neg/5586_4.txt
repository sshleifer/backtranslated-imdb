Man to man trying hard to be a good movie: It has its heart in the right place, it strives to be epic, and it has a message that no doubt everyone will appreciate. But there are also some of the problems with this image. It strives so hard to be good and to get its message across it, the viewer sometimes has to feel unattended. So it is only sufficient that the images used by this image are simplified. Man to man does not let the viewer decide what he thinks is right, but hammer his message in the head. Joseph Fiennes exemplifies this in his role: he does his best to look worried, really moved and all the other emotions you can express with the only facial expression his repertoire has to offer. Add that movie is lengthy and loses its speed towards the end, you will easily lead to the conclusion that Man Two Man is not worth seeing. But there are enough points to defend it: it's entertaining, has some humorous scenes and show-stealing Kristin Scott Thomas. Of course, you should not compare it to humanistic masterpieces like The Elephant Man (David Lynch), but you leave the theater satisfied. It tries to catch your heart (though your brain thinks it's too obvious) and succeeds most of the time.
