POPEYE AND BIG FOOT **; POPEYE'S ENGINE COMPANY **; GO TO POPEYES GIT ** 1/2 <br /> I used to patch these up as a kid, but caught an episode of the series consisting of three cartoons back-to-back now, several years later ( They preceded theatrical screening of the pirate yarn RAIDERS OF THE SEVEN SEAS [1953]), I can see how they do not keep everything that good! Popeye's character is not exactly sympathetic to begin with, Olive Oyl clearly indulgent and Bluto's antics failed to provoke much interest either? In short, the scriptures were alarmingly thin, rather awful and generally scary to start. They are strictly juvenile fare, but I doubt that today's children will even tolerate sticking to them! In addition, the animation style is incoherent. <br /> <br /> When you take each card by itself, they assume that they are improved from one to the other: after the initial shock, they adapted to their mediocre quality as it was so that the third cartoon results easy to be the most comfortable of the party ?? Popeye is entrusted with a mascot army goat whose huge appetite gives him no end of mischief (hardly original, I know, but always an entertaining trick). An interesting element here was that the shorts were posted with Popeye, who provided moralistic points of wisdom to the children in the audience.
