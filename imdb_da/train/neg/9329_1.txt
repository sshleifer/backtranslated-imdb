One of the worst movies I've ever seen. My only thought was, "How can I get my money back from Hollywood Video". It's no way worth four dollars or any dollars. I think it was an attempt to tear off The Mexican, or Vin Diesel's movie, but it failed miserably to do so. The play was terrible, I was sorry the actors did not find anything better to do with their time. The story was ridiculous. We called the lines in front of the actors, it was so predictable. The Mexican accent of the leading lady was insultingly exaggerated, worse than a comic book. <br /> <br /> Skip it.
