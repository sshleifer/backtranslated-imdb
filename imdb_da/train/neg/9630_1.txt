I realize that several Ben Stiller films are out or will be out this year, but maybe he should insist on quality, not quantity. I was dumbfounded at what the filmmakers believed passed for comedy in "Along Came Polly." <br /> <br /> Stiller's Reuben is lattice, charmless and ranks as one of the worst performances of the year. Stiller's schtick becomes tiring. He has undoubtedly a comic talent, but he must either find another schtick or take a break, find some material that is actually fun. Because his film goes from painfully humorous to scary bad. There is absolutely no chemistry between Stiller and Jennifer Aniston, who is a shame because she is a good, smart actress with a promising career. As long as she continues to make more films like "The Good Girl" (where she is amazing) and less like "Along Came Polly," she has a career that she could be proud of. <br /> <br /> Aniston desperately tries to overcome the lukewarm material she's working on, but it's a daunting task for any actress. Except for a moment with Alec Baldwin, as Reuben's chief Stan, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Reuben's best friend Sandy, there's nothing fun in this horrible movie. Other supporting characters, including Debra Messing like Lisa and Hank Azaria as Claude, are annoying. Azaria's accent is not only stupid, it's terribly unfunny. The principle of "Along Came Polly" certainly showed promise. Unfortunately, it needed a writer who could actually make it a good comedy, instead of this lame, boring, boring excuse for a comedy.
