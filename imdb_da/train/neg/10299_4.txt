I have to admit that I stuck this one out and thought something was going to happen, besides the dead body in the first scenes ... and her disposal of him. I was mistaken. It was a movie theater verite of Betty hits the beach encased for the first part of Mordant Morven. I don't care what young lassies from Scotland are doing these days, who your screw, which drugs they take. Visually, the stroll through Cabo de Gata in Andalucia was pleasantly and surely the highlight for me. The nadir was the chop shop for his dead girlfriend. When the movie came to an end, I had two thoughts ... 1. That is all there is? 2. Now I see why his girlfriend killed himself. Rename it. "Just Bitch Boredom or what I did on my trip to Spain." I'm such a sucker to stick these things out.
