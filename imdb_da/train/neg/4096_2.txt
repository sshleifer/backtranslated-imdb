This was a classic case of something that should never have been. Gloria was now a single mother, her husband had left her because she would not live in any municipality with him (he was angry that Reagan had been chosen and wanted to turn his back on society). Ever since and then I had problems with the series - come on, I say to myself, is this the same noble Michael Stivic that counteracts Archie Bunker's right wing philosophies? The series continued, but it just had no pizazz. No matter what moment Sally Struthers got from the whole family, it was far away. Perhaps if the series had been given a different name and presented as being completely independent of All In The Family, it could have worked. Oh yes it's show business.
