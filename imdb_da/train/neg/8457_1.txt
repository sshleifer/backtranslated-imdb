I only saw this movie because I was so impressed with Olivier Martinez in SWAT. But this is not SWAT. SWAT had a plot and some sympathetic characters and sensible. Bullfighter had none of these. <br /> <br /> I should have realized that it could not be any good, after all, it always had a painfully bad Michelle Forbes. <br /> <br /> A poster here called the film incoherent. Another called it the worst movie ever. Both gave the film too much credit. I'm so glad I downloaded it from the library for free, but I still feel ripped off. <brD> IMDb should include a "0" in the "rate this movie" vote, just for movies like this one.
