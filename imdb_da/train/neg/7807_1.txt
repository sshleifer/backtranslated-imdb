I picked this DVD up at Dollar Store. The DVD was on 2 for $ 1 rack, but since it had Michael Madsen in it, I thought that since I had never seen the movie, I bought it anyway. I have to say I didn't. T likes the movie. The movie played more like a documentary or an advertisement for religion than anything else. I found out that the director's use of flashbacks didn't add the story to me. I would have preferred to see the story in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I don't want to throw it away as one of the other commentators, but it may be some time before I would consider watching this movie again. <br /> <br /> Who knows when it was Michael Madsen's film debut, it may have a certain file value on a future date.
