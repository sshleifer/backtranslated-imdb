I was expecting a B-Movie French musical. After all, Dhéry, Blanche, was DeFunès superstars of low budget French movies from that time. And it's in color! But I have hallucinations in this incredible one hour 30 of pure mediocrity. Music tracks are terrible and comedy is absolutely boring and stupid. And the songs? Which songs? These are just a number of bad numbers, one after another. The only very rare thing about that thing is the women's nudity. It was not known at that time. In fact, some figures are just there to show us topless women. It adds to the mediocrity! And try to find young Michel Serrault, the future great actor of French cinema, in a part as a musician, in his very first movie. Good luck!
