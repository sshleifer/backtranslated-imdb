I will not approach and criticize the theories in RAW. I think this is a movie site and whether the movie delivers or is well-founded and not a debate philosophy. <br /> <br /> That said, this video really blows. It's a talking head shot of RAW after another. Some of it is archive video so you can see how he's been aged and it's pretty cool. But otherwise the viewing experience is relentlessly monotonous. <br /> <br /> It's a weird comparison, but I was thinking about Sunday afternoon when I saw some of the Barbra Streisand * Funny Lady * (another really bad movie). After a while I was so scary at Barbra, I wish there would be a scene she wouldn't look like: you know "in the meantime, other characters in the movie were up to something else ..." moment . But it was about Barbra. Now this video is RAWs * Funny Lady *. <br /> <br /> So if your idea of ​​good time is to look at multiple roofs and angles of RAW's surface while he is talking to his theories, gather in a lame structure that doesn't add any interest or insight, so be my guest. For me, I couldn't take it after 20 minutes.
