Yikes made this movie blow. The signs were weak, the plot weaker. I figured that this couldn't be too bad because it has Christoper Walken, oops. He must have done this because he is bored and in need of money. The characters should be Irish, but no one had an Irish accent. I try desperately to find something good in this, I cannot except Walken did a fine job with a wooden character. Find something to read, or see discovery, never see this movie.
