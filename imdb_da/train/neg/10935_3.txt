I've never been a big fan of Mormon movies. Being Mormon, I've always felt that humor was too exclusive to the LDS community and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive wackos. I was hoping it would be fresh breath, the Halestorm movie, I could finally discuss with my non-Mormon friends. <br /> <br /> Boy, was I wrong. <br /> <br /> I expected, as this had B-list talent like Clint Howard, Gary Coleman, Andrew Wilson and Fred Willard (one of my favorites), this should be at least a little fun. And besides, the church struggle is ripe with the potential for lots of fun gags and such. But I have to say that in the whole movie it seemed as if no one knew what they were doing. Every joke fell flat and every opportunity for a really fun gag was ignored. The dialogue was bland and the movie had some of the worst sign developments I have ever seen. Every single sign, but Wilson's was less than one-dimensional. It's hard to believe that after nine rewrites the movie, it was still so much fun, stunned as it took the train I experienced. I can't express the anger I felt sitting through this. My friends and I were extras in the last game scene so we went to the premiere in Washington City, UT. Kurt Hale, the director, was there and I have to say I avoided all contact with him after the show. He was waiting at the door, apparently ready for feedback. I could not bring myself to tell him that his movie not only half an hour and a half of my life, but it left an unpleasant, painful scar that I will never forget. <br /> <br /> Here are a few specific problems I had: There was a minor love story subplot between the caretaker and the shabby piano player, but these two characters came out of nowhere and were impossible to care about, so mine friends and I were left to constantly wonder why we should care about these two lame, uninteresting characters. There were many subplots that appeared every now and then, and everybody promised the audience the chance to laugh, but each came and went in a smoke quarrel and ended, even before you could even start caring. This was basically how the whole movie felt. <br /> <br /> This movie was a great letdown and I feel bad for anyone who expects the first real fun Mormon movie. True, the jokes in this are not too exclusive to Mormons. So again, it's hard to tell what was a joke, and what was a loud ringing sensation in my ears. <br /> <br /> Please DO NOT see this movie. Remember the imagination that this movie is fun. Save yourself the disappointment I went through
