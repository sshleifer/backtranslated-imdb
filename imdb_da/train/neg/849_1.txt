A star. That's all this documentary deserves. I have not felt disappointed to see a movie, let alone a documentary, for some time. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of the "Walking With ..." series, including it's Nigel Marvin spin-offs, for all their pleasingly fun but informative information. And although the subject of prehistoric man has never interested me nearly as much as other prehistoric creatures, the subject is still interesting and unique to explore. After seeing all the other docks from the series, I figured I should also see it here, especially after seeing relatively good reviews elsewhere. Well for those of you who made a good review of this document ... what were you thinking? laugh out loud. Although the information they could get through was interesting, the presentation failed in any other way. It had a terrible flow, was incredibly unfocused on what it was trying to say (with information encircled and sometimes out of place), horrible effects (it includes the few moments CGI and especially the makeup effects) and overused MTV style camera effects . <br /> <br /> Talking about the makeup effects, one reviewer mentioned how ridiculous the scene was when the cavemen came across this gigantic monkey and how it looks like a 70's tailor-made horror movie. Now there are plenty of moments, just as it was the people who portrayed the monkeys, so ridiculous and ridiculous. None of this is helped by horrible camera positions and compositions. <br /> <br /> The worst part of all is that none of them is shown in an interesting or dynamic way or looks distant right. It doesn't even look like it was taken seriously. It also lacked any emotional blow that the predecessors of the series had. Remember the episode in "Walking with Dinosaurs" by Ornithochirus (sp?) Fate? That episode still gets me on tears every time I see it. It is this kind of engagement with the subject that lacks most of all here. When you are more committed to the subject and it is your own personal story, even one who is just speculation, you are more interested in the facts that surround it. <br /> <br /> The only saved gracers of this production is the pretty good story (at least in the BBC version I saw) and the music. Otherwise, do not rent this one unless you want a good laugh (as I often did, but usually followed by rolling eyes). This does not belong to the shelf with the other "Walking With ..." docs. <br /> <br /> And it makes sense to learn that this document was not produced or directly involved with the same people who did others in the series? Hmmm ...
