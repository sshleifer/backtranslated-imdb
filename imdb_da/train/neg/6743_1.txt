How many times do we see bad horror movies with a killer in a Scream ripoff mask? The plot of Bleed is a bit original, but the film itself is a complete mistake. First, the dialogue is poorly developed, it is boring and wastes too much time on trivial details, the play is bad, and so on. I want my money back, this rental stinks worse than a skunk.
