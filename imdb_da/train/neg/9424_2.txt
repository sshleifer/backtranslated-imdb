This was not fun to see. Frank puts all his dreams on the back burner and gets a normal (boring!) Job just so his stepson can go to the film school, but his stepton decides that he will make a humiliating documentary about the man instead. A documentary filmmaker must point to the camera and simply shoot, not manipulate and comment with cunning captions. The filmmaker's bitterness and anger at his pins is obvious. And sorry. The goal seems to be making Frank become stupid and pathetic, but instead he comes across as the most human of the 3 people. really is. It left me with an intense aversion to the film maker.
