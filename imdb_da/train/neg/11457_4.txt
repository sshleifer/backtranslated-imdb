OKAY. I know that John Hughes' 80s movie was flat on one side, so the expectations of this movie were pretty low. <br /> <br /> Still, after sitting through this crap, there is one important thing I can do "I seem to get out of my head: <br /> <br /> year-old Rob Lowe movie that had no nudity and only hints about sex in them. The play is terrible, the characters boring and flat, Oxford's portrayal of an absolute insult and the roots scenes unexciting, uneventful and unaccurate. Unless you have some terrible Ally Sheedy or Amanda Pays (or I guess Rob Lowe) fetish, there's really no need to see this.
