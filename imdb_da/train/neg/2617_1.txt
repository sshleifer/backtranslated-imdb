This movie was pure pain. Sitting in the theater for x-minutes, I wondered when the movie was to begin. All the setups were in place; Typical love story, characters must overcome their briefing, the villain must appear, but none of it has ever begun. When these things happened I was already bored stiff and the units were completely ineffective. In scenes requiring tremendous excitement and buildup, it felt necessary to cut frames. The child's things do not have to be that way. Children's movies can be as easy and engaging as adults. The excuse, "Hey, it's for children," is the bull. I'll take "Sword in the Stone" one day. This was terrible. I get the feeling that Disney will put something out these days. And for the kids, the 10-year-old I saw this with, agrees ... clean trash can.
