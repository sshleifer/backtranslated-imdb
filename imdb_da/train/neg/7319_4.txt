When you get to scenes involving Albert Brooks without his shirt ... try not to go on a fur ball. <br /> <br /> I like Albert Brooks. I have seen most, if not all, of his films, but it was the first time to see this. Modern Romance is an interesting take on the subject of love. There are few films that handle the desperation of love as well as overtly as Modern Romance, although the 1979 Chilly Scenes of Winter comes very close. They both deal mainly with occupied men who are too mentally attracted / possessed by their respective women. <br /> <br /> Where-as cool scenes on winter borders on the topic of stalking, this movie has a more basic foundation with the motive of love because both people are already in a relationship .. and out of the relationship .. and back into it again. <br /> <br /> And because it's a movie released in 1981, it's time for style and style. That's the main reason I like this movie. My basic rule when it comes to movies is "If it sucks at least, it can have some historical relevance", you know the time capsule thing. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the terrible scenes of Albert Brooks sans shirt. <br /> <br /> The man is hair. Very hair. Just like he has a black curly coat shirt-hair. And what's worse is that he almost looks to burn off sacrificing his hair. It's not a pleasant sight and the scenes with him without a shirt go on and on again. Back in the early 80s, hairy men were seen as normal and nothing shocking. But in 2009, the sight of something like this is just pure revolting. Sorry, Albert! At some point I wish someone said "hi let's try this scene, but with you wearing a simple t-shirt, I think you might scare people". It's just really bad, and I'm sorry about the poor beautiful actress who had to deal with Albert Brook's naked body on her. She probably took her hair out of her teeth for days after that. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's an OK movie. It could have been better if I hadn't seen Albert Brooks without his shirt for what seemed like 10 long continuous minutes because it will forever ruin my viewing of this movie.
