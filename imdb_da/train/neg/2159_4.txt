Well, it's Robin Hood who 'geezer' okay ... just as announced! It doesn't sound much hope, and unfortunately it was worse than I suspected. <br /> <br /> A laugh Robin I can take; a Robin who is affiliated with a Pert Dyer's daughter I can credit; but a Robin who does not exchange much fun with his only hands is harder to swallow, and a Robin and * the whole cast * who seem to have difficulty managing their lines is the kiss of death. How can anyone let such born delivery pass without resuming the scenes? Again and again it sounds like he is struggling with half-understood Shakespeare instead of letting himself go with a salty twig; At first, I hoped that it was just a flawed comedy feature in a character that was clearly destined for the role of comedy sidekick, but then it began to spread throughout the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Whatever you say about Errol Flynn in the role, he was able to deliver high-spirited dialogue as naturally as he had just thought of the moment ... and as this production shows , it is not as easy as it sounds! If they were to throw the characters as naughty chappies, the actors in question should have been given appropriate lines: they sound like they have no idea how to handle them. <br /> <br /> I'm scared I didn't even look like the pantomime sheriff for a similar reason; The lines are obviously not meant to be taken seriously, but delivered (and in this case written) with a knob and a glance at the audience. They're out of order okay - fourth brash thing - but it's really not that fun. <br /> <br /> This much promised production reminded me of a lunatic school game. The only actor and character I felt any appreciation for was the one who played Guy of Gisbourne, who was the only one who seemed to have any hand over (a) credible rudeness and (b) credible characterization - but honestly I would not that I haven't said, it was a very good augury for the future of the series! At the time of writing, I will give it a new shot in the hope that things can improve and lie down a bit next week, with less stylish stage setting, and perhaps the actors more calm with the dialogue: after all, the opening section "Doctor Who" was not exactly one show-stop, although it was not as near as bad as this. But if I do not see any improvement after episode 2, I am afraid that the series has almost certainly lost a viewer. <br /> <br /> It would be a shame because I have a soft spot for Robin Hood "The Legend on the Screen, from Douglas Fairbank's adventures to Richard Gree's robust confidence. But this Robin fails to touch my blood at least.
