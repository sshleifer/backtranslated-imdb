Like some of the other people who have gone through this movie, I also grew nostalgic about it ... before I had the accident to actually see it again. Unfortunately, my childhood memories of this movie were completely untrustworthy, and Paulin's dangers have now been revealed to be an embarrassing exercise in banal, racist, and plain boring filmmaking. Even the presence of old benefits Edward Everett Horton and Terry-Thomas cannot overcome a rancid manuscript, a horrible theme song, and some miserable "special effects". In addition, the stereotypical depictions of African and Arab characters make painful display, especially considering that this was produced in the immediate vicinity of the civil rights movement. Michael Weldon's original psychotronic encyclopedia reports that the dangers to Pauline were originally produced for television, but inexplicably ended up getting a theater release. Judging by the results, it's a completely credible (and confusing) scenario.
