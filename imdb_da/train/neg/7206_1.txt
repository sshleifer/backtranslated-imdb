Well. Where to start. Let's just say this; Avoid this movie at all <br /> <br /> costs. It is based on a comic book series. The movie makes the sign look like Hamlet. Filled with emasculated actors who seem embarrassed to be <br /> <br /> here, lousy camera work, horrible music and enough product placement for <br /> <br /> that you will never visit Yahoo! Again, this movie is really the bottom of the barrel. To quote New Yorker, Matthew Broderick and <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett shouts their way through this image of homosexual assault on men who have seen a rare sort of paycheck in the distance. "<br /> <br /> They should pay us some of the millions they earned to see it. <br /> <br /> Awful.
