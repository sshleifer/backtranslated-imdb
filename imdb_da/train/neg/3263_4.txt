This is the second British rank film that adapts the stories from Sommerset Maugham to movies. All but one story from the 'Quartet' does not go well into the contemporary era; and the actors 'speech is definitely "clipped", as only British before the 1950 actors' delivery can be. At least 'Trio' seems tighter and more cinematic than the first movie adaptation. <br /> <br /> One of the problems these two movies can't overcome is that their source material was written 25-30 years before the movies. As a result of the 1940s, Maughm's (pre-war) popular "little morality" narrative seemed quite quaint if it wasn't pretty coy.
