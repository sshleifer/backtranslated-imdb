What a horrible movie. It starts well with the title sequence, but it's about as good as it gets. <br /> <br /> The movie is something about rats that turn into monsters and go on a killing The play is not that bad, but the script is pointless and the movie is not even scary despite atmospheric music. It's really amazing that some groups cobbled together this bag of waste and thought it would make a good movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie. It's garbage and I urge you not to waste a moment of your life on it! One in ten.
