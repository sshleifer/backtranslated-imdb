Min how the mighty have fallen. Kim Basinger is a great actress, but she definitely knocked down when she took this role. This movie is bad for some reason: lapses in logic. It looks like one of the movies that would have been acceptable with all its plot holes if it had come out in the 80s and 90s, but in 2008 it just looks really stupid. This is the worst thriller I've ever seen, and I've seen The Bone Collector and Twisted. <br /> <br /> History details Della (Kim Basinger) just comes from buying gifts in a mall and is harassed by a gang of thugs ending up killing a policeman who came to her. From then on, she is chased by these idiotic goons through an abandoned street and she gets rid of them one by one with a toolbox full of tools. So many things go wrong with this movie. As I said, this movie skips the logic of every turn and except Kim Basinger, the play is made for television. Hell, this pseudo-thriller is made for TV bad. The way she kills each of these politically correct gays (1 Caucasian, 1 Spanish-speaking, 1 Asian, and 1 African American coming together to steal a Caucasian woman. Don't just want America?) Is ridiculous for a mistake. The way she killed the Spanish-speaking guy made me laugh hysterically. The sex scene with the main hoodlum was so out in the left field that it made you shake your head in shame. I only recommend this to lovers of bad movies and no one else. Anyone else especially Kim Basinger fans would do well not to own this flick. You don't want to see an actress you respect in a movie, this bad thing you do now? Of course not. You were warned.
