What a disappointment, especially in the light of the budget, the available technical resources and the talent gathered. Is not the basic rule of science fiction / drama to create in the audience the willing suspension of disbelief. POA 2001 creates a probable beginning that sucks us in, but subsequently Burton is delighted that his movie guests have brains. The over-libertarian of Helena Bonham Carter's chimpanzee, the worthlessness of man's lock, their flight, their extraordinary horsemanship skills (this is an astronaut and a group of human primitives that suddenly run full tilt), the massive and instant human rebellion is too incredible. Mark Wahlberg never evokes any sense of real fear, danger or comeuppance in this world turned upside down. Compare with the original where Chuck Heston's nakedness metaphorically captured his complete helplessness and amazement at his event. The uniformed Wahlberg retains his modesty, but also his apparent sense of leadership and control in an inherently crazy situation, and we really do not speculate on his well-being. Unlike Heston, he never seems to be in real danger. Tim Burton should have used some of the f / x budget for some competent screenwriting. In fact, after this subordinate failure, I wonder why Hollywood's manufacturers are ever having trouble settling the writers and directors hitting threats. Let them go. Tree monkeys could have done as well as they did in Planet of the Apes in 2001. I bet that the repetition of this effort will not exist. It could have been a new franchise and a wonderful new step to imagination. Another option lost.
