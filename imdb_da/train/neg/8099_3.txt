It was a great book, and the possibilities for a really good movie were definitely there. But the casting decisions completely destroyed the film. Hanks is a great actor to be sure but lacks the smarmy, morally ambivalent characteristics that are essential to the lead role. Jeff Daniels would have been my choice. <br /> <br /> It is understandable to put Melanie Griffiths in the eye like that, but again she didn't show the depth or ambivalence so it needs to be pulled out. <Br /> <br /> This movie is a good example of how any decision, even early in the film production, can make or destroy a file.
