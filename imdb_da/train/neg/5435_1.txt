... they bothered to make this movie? Anyone? I didn't think so. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie that comes alive, you should rent the summer of '42. This is no summer of '42. <br /> <br /> When your big stars are Nolte & Sarsgaard, Sarsgaard gets more screen time, it's your first warning sign and of course for such an "artistic" movie, there is plenty of curse and skin ripped around just to Make it look like "artistic". <br /> <br /> Sarsgaard made his usual uninteresting cardboard character, characterized by moments that should be intense. The intensity is that of a person with bi-polar disorder. <br /> <br /> Miller is most famous for her appearance and what she had to say about the city of Pittsburgh after this movie. Pittsburgh should hold her courage. She confused a genuine Pittsburgh native. <br /> <br /> Foster gave Sarsgaard a run for his money in cardboard-acting style. Wow! Was this his first role after high school? <br /> <br /> So we have this weird triangle. Foster is in love with Miller, but is with her boss / boyfriend. He can't take Miller to bed and won't take his boss to bed. Then he hangs with Sarsgaard & Miller and looks at them. <br /> <br /> So after one of Sarsgaard's pseudo-intense moments, Foster & Miller gets it on a scene, we are "treated" to every sloppy, moody detail. Finally, in order to round it all, Foster & Sarsgaard continues with Foster in the Miller role. Now I know how 2 guys get it on (as if it was ever something I needed to know). All that is all that is left, the tragic end of a sign and the retrospective views of the remaining 2. It gets me right in my stomach. Oh wait! It was the pepperoni pizza I just had. <br /> <br /> Thank you for the time this movie took off my life, thank you.
