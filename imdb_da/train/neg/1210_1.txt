Where to start ... Oh yes, Message to the wicked: When you first find the person you've tracked (to kill) who witness a crime you've committed, don't spend time talking to her so she has another opportunity to get away. Message to the victim: When the bitches talk to each other and argue, take the opportunity to "RUN", not sit there and watch them until you make a sound they hear. Notice to the Director: If someone has a start of 5 or 10 minutes in a vehicle or on foot, you can't get the bad on their heels or bumper right away! time and movement do not work that way. It would also be nice to think that a woman does not have to brutally kill (4) men to allow her to leave a violent relationship at home.
