I've read comments that you shouldn't watch this movie if you're looking to touch the Shakespearian dialogue. It is true, unfortunately, because all the stirring dialogue this wonderful game contains has been cut and replaced by songs. I've read this game, and recently I was lucky enough to see it done, as it is still one of my favorite Shakespearian Comedies, but this movie seems to take everything I like about it. The princess was undoubtedly doing what she was directed to do, not having any regal bearing, and all girls seemed to lose the wisdom of their characters - also hit by unwise cuts, which not only removed the female characters already scant dialogues, but took comments out of context - it was a little uncomfortable to hear the princess preaching; "We are wise girls to spot our lovers so!" As it hadn't been random. The news rolls throughout the film also disturbed the stream and removed many good scenes as they showed the information in the scenes after them and were in modern formulation. In conclusion, an excellent game, ruined by a strange concept and unwise cuts. Kenneth, I usually love what you do. What did you think?
