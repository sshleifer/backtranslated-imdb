I was interested in seeing the transition that believed it could be a diamond in gravity, but the only thing I found was bad writing, horrible rule (the shooting sequences don't flow), even though the instructor might say that's what he is goes for it looks very uninspired and immature) editing could have been done by someone with 2 video recorders, and the stock was low budget video. I would say that it wasn't even as simple as mini digital video. <br /> <br /> There are some simple ways to make a movie with what the director has, like through editing, etc. But it's obvious he just doesn't care. There is just as much effort in this movie as a ham sandwich. It could be done better, but that would mean extra work.
