In recent times, I have been exposed to both this movie and "King Arthur" on DVDs chosen by others for an evening's "entertainment" and together they gain nothing more than exposing a growing concept I have that the modern film review publicly is completely lacking in discrimination and is satisfied as long as they get "action". Both films were completely rubbish. <br /> <br /> Whatever happened to character development? What happened to meaningful dialogue? What happened to ACTING? And when you look at something that vaguely suggests to be "historic," even trying to capture some degree of accuracy, a realistic idea of ​​the "political map" of the day, even a little taste of the era, especially in its social opinions. Why should they all show the value set in 21st century America? I have read the disclaimer message tables that "little was known" of the dark ages. Not so. Significant amounts are known, with much learned scholarship on the era, but these jokers simply couldn't be bothered to do any homework. <br /> <br /> I just wish I could vote 0/10
