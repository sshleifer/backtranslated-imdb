Bangville Police allegedly marked the debut of Keystone Kops, named after the studio they worked for. In this one, they do not dress in the stupid cop costumes or drive the fast car that is their trademark. Anyway, Mabel Normand is a farm girl here begging her father for a calf. She later sees some strange men in the barn and quickly calls the police. An answer and the hunt is on. Then Mabel beats her door just as anyone enters. It turns out that her mother jumping to the conclusion that the robbers are in there! So while Mabel blocks her door with furniture, Mom and Dad are trying to fight their way! This was perhaps the most entertaining part of the brief along with some explosions of the cop car. This was a short 7 minutes that went so fast it was over before it started. The only real characterization that has been developed is Mabel's, which exudes charm with just her face and big eyes and seems so optimistic pleasing here except of course when she is scared. It is easy to see why she became a star. It is largely because of her that I had recommended seeing this at least once and why I give this a 4.
