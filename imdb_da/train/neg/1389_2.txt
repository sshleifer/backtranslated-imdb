I was very disappointed with this movie. Plotwise was it slightly bordering on stupid: Souls that can affect reality in the way they do? A mission apparently critical of Soul Hunters entrusted one of their younger members? And the whole B story with the "holobrothelen" and the trial of the station was so horrible that at one point I blew out to the television: "Why are you wasting my time with this?" <br /> <br /> Thematically, "Soul River" did not really go into the soul's questions in more depth than the original episode "Soul Hunter" did. We see that soul-hunters can make mistakes, but we still do not get a sense of their culture. (Are there any female Soul Hunters?) <br /> <br /> Considering the material they had to work on, the action was okay and the special effects - especially planescape in the first action - were very impressive. But overall I would say give this a lady.
