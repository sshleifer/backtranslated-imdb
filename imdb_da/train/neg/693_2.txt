((NB: Spoiler warning as it is!) <br /> <br /> First of all, this is a teen slasher flick - the Spam-In-A-Cabin genre that Joe Bob Briggs explicitly puts it. If you're looking for Roshambo, that's not it, and it wouldn't be. I am desperately unimpressed by staff by his film, directing or acting. <br /> <br /> Second, this was not Zuniga's first horror flick, it was her first screen appearance period, movie theater, television, whatever. For what it's worth is neither Daphne Zuniga Susan Sarandon nor Katherine Hepburn. <br/> <br /> Thirdly, just give a lame slasher flick prop. Sure, it follows the deeply insulting formal message about its genre: Every young woman who has or is interested in sex is the hip of her hip, and the harvest time is now. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the carved to the sweet, virgin protagonist too! Now there is a mediocre teenage death movie that has the courage to its beliefs! Interestingly, this was said to be no single film role. Another who hit the excuse, except that this term gives too much credit. <br /> <br /> (Then again, this movie probably has one of the highest percentage of single-film actors in history. Of the nineteen credited actors, there were not so many thirteen in any other movie, three appeared in another movie of the same producers. Only one other besides Zuniga has as many as six screen credits. What was this, it has been and never been mutual aid association?) <I have seen this long ago on the sennate cable when I am bored and never expect to Be that bored in my life again, but I see no reason to chase anyone involved and throw them in the incinerator with Joanne. <br /> <br /> 2/10.
