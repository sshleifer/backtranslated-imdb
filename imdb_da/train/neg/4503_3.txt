I admired Rob Marshall for Chicago, but Geisha's Memoirs turn out to be another mistake in combining Western and Asian art. Overall, the scene is beautiful, but after anxious emphasis on exoticism-oriented scenes, some may just find themselves in them. The exaggerated cherry blossom was frankly exaggerated. It is probably the cultural difference in the perception here: The ultimate beauty is not the flashy type, since truly beautiful geisha would not be the westernized pumpkin in the film. <br /> <br /> Some other comments have rightly mentioned the biggest mistakes. As a Taiwanese, I am undoubtedly the great actress. An actor / actress can play any role when he / she can look like it. Gong Li is great, but the power of emotion she showed in this movie had not been translated into Japanese style. All I saw was a bittersweet and jealous Chinese woman. Michlle Yeoh, one of my favorite actress, didn't even look like Japanese. Some comments have mentioned the peculiar delicate, feminine characteristics of Japanese women that I cannot accept anymore. These are so delicate that I suppose not all modern Japanese actresses are eligible for the roles of Geisha, let alone the two Chinese and a Malaysian actress who grew up in different cultures and probably not known Japanese culture so much. <br /> <br /> Geisha is a great shot to awaken the curiosity of the American audience. But it would be an insult to the film itself and to art if the film wins Oscar for the best costume, best director or best picture.
