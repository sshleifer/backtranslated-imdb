The film is about two brothers who must be the same - but they do not expect to be wise at all - one is a surgeon and the other is able to write a computer code. Geniuses that they can call themselves, which sound very exaggerated, if you compare it with personal characteristics, you can experience from the title. <br /> <br /> I honestly didn't like the style of the movie. I think that anxiety, confusion and deep blues it brings are for a purpose, but what I don't get is why there is so much of it. The film is cheap on scenes and tells the story essentially without any human aspect at all. It gives the comic book as an experience. But it is visually dampening the viewer, it somehow brings him into the blues with short dialogues, monotonic scenes, dynamic cuts, music and sudden sounds. <br /> <br /> The history of the movie is very simple, most of what is happening is dramatically depicted in long minutes, mostly in confusing delirium simulating effects of drug use and dynamic cuts. <br /> <br /> I would obviously say that this movie did not meet my expetations a little.
