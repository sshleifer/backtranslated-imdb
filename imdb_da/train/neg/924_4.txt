WARNING SPOILERS ***** A really stupid movie about a group of young excursions in Italy, which finds an armor of mythical warriors with a demonic soul. One of them carries it and becomes obsessed with the spirit of a demon. It kills time and several of his friends die under his knife to revive the demon. <br /> <br /> Wasting time for viewers as the fine young ladies in the movie leave their clothes, the gore is ridiculous at best, and the play is terrible, perfect pairing to such a bad script <br /> < br />
