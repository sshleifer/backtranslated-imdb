I have never found Charley Chase very funny, even though his screenplay sometimes reminds me of John Cleese, who I find very funny. (Charley Chase also reminds me of gowky Hen Broon from Scotland's Sunday Post cartoon page.) In Chase's best movie, I tend to admire his professionalism rather than laugh at him. I want to give Chase credit that his very best movie - like "Mighty Like a Moose" and "His Wooden Wedding" - has inspired a fandom that is highly loyal to him ... but I am positive that even the most deadly Chase The fan will agree that the very early and very raw 'Gift with Order' is just not fun. Chase - anxious, awkward, gormless, naff - is a young swain hoping to court the fair Rose. Oliver Hardy gives the best performance in this movie as his blowhard father who despises Chase as a "mollycoddle". Leo White, who made more remarkable work as a foil for Chaplin in Essanay, is here as a rival. There is something that involves an Ingersoll watch. I was thrilled that the label is mentioned in the dialogue titles: is this an early example of product placement? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a big mistake in "Gift with Order" is the molding of Rosemary Theby as Rose: she is supposed to be a standard decor, but Theby - flat cross, hawk-faced - is physically wrong for the role Theby (wife of Harry Myers) had a successful career as an actress, but was never a credible object. Movie historian William K Everson treated her very dismissively in one of his movie books. <br /> <br /> I rate 'Gift with Order' only 3 out of 10, and I'm charitable ... because I suspect Charley Chase has got something that everyone else gets but I continue to miss.
