REALLY? REALLY???? I know if you make a political war movie, you will be noticed, but this movie was just garbage. Terrible in every sense. Terribly inaccurate in many ways. I have an easier time believing that the president of the United States is watching, flying a jetfighter and shooting foreigners. It is easier to notice the few things that were right. My jaw fell when I saw some say that this movie was the best in the last 25 years. It was exaggerated, seemingly meaningless plot diversity, and had dubious filmography at times. <br /> <br /> X-box, YouTube, ACUPAT utilities ?? Has anyone checked that these things did not exist in 2004? It's not like you had to do extensive research, it was only five years before this movie came out. I am a war veteran in Iraq and if you spent a day with an infantry platoon or an EOD team, you would realize how B.S. this movie is. To compare this with Platoon or Save Private Ryan is ridiculous. Why don't you just throw Commando and Red Dawn in there too; I think they can be more precise. <br /> <br /> For some reason, if you look past the incredible plot, historical and actual disagreements, this movie can only be OK. Nothing more. If you continue to hear "Oscar buzz" and have to add your own pompous review, go ahead. As for me, I am writing the director to see if I can get my 131 minutes back.
