I went into this movie, expecting it to be really god-horrible. And that was that. I felt really sorry the star-cast cast-Kathy Bates was a wonderful actress ... before she made this movie - Vince Vaughn and Paul Giamatti were disappointing as usual, but Miranda Richardson couldn't put one of the amazing shows I know and love her for. Fred's father, played by Trevor Peacock (including Vicar of Dibley fame), had a line. <br /> <br /> The reason was predictable and everywhere, and humor was ... lacking. (However, there was part of the movie where Santa Claus came into a Jewish family ... it made me laugh just because their expression was classic) Don't watch this movie unless your only other alternative has a head-on collision with a train (actually maybe the train would be better ...)
