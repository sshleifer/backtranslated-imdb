OK, my girlfriend and I rented the DVD and about 30 minutes in the movie, we had exchanged a lot "ehhh, what is this movie about and more importantly, I'm interested in finding out what it ends with" look and decided We either needed drugs to keep us interested in the "plot" or just finish the pain right there and then and see something else. We chose the latter. <br /> <br /> I liked "But I'm a cheerleader" a lot, but Mango Kiss is too stupid and surreal for my taste, sorry! I prefer preferably "D.E.B.S", "Better Than Chocolate", "Fucking Åmål", "Goldfish Memory" and "Fire". <br /> <br /> -Sorcia
