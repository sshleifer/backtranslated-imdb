This is a pretty bad movie. But not as bad as that reputation suggests. The production values ​​are not so bad and there is the odd effective scene. And it has an 80's cheezoid veneer, which means it's always fun. Beware also of Jimmy Nails short look - his attempt at an American accent is so amazing it is amazing. Fantastic also is Sybil Danning's breasts - they show a short look in the movie, but the scene is repeatedly rounded up in the final credit in what can only be described as the 12 "remix of Sybil Danning's boobs. Must be seen to be believed. is it not scary, the effects are stupid, and Christopher Lee turns out to be sleeping through his performance, assuming he bought a new house and needed some cash for a deposit, the two key characters - the man and woman - were so insignificant I have forgotten almost everything about them, and I just watched this movie earlier this evening, the walls are noticeably less impressive than in the original movie, in fact bizarre they sometimes look like badly burned monkeys. good, and the music provided by the new wave band Babel, while it is pretty terrible, at least gives the film a little added cheese, overall - good for laughing, not good quality, but did you seriou sly expect And at least you've always got Sybil's knockers.
