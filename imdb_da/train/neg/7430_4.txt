It is interesting to see what form Pierce Brosnan's career was before Bond arrived on stage. In this "thrilled" thriller, Pierce Brosnan plays the gentle Patrick who works leading ghetto kids on "confidence courses". He romanticises a woman who has a mop-top mid 90's child named Eric. The woman's drunken ex-husband soon arrives on the pitch and starts tearing with Pierce. <br /> <br /> At one point, Pierce makes innocent "vegeburgers". The man comes in. Pierce resumes making road citizens. The man then violates Pierce. Small lumps of half-eaten vegeburger calls fall from Pierce's mouth. The fight ceases abruptly without showing the result. This is as good as the movie gets. <br /> <br />
