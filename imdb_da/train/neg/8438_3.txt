I suppose bad Laurel and Hardy are better than no Laurel and Hardy at all, but just barely. It's sad that the Fox movies are the ones that get a great release on DVD and expose people who may not be familiar with L&H to their WORST things instead of their classic comedies. <br /> <br /> Once again, the boys are saddled with a stupid romantic plot about a guy who invented an invisible ray. He is in love with the boss's daughter who hates him and prefers a beautiful guy. It's amazing to think about the geniuses at Fox. This is what L & H needed in their movie. Without their pancake makeup, the boys look tired and old. The only scenes that work for them in this picture are when they try to sneak out of a bedroom window at night and the rather bizarre scene where Robert Mitchum, a classic noir bad guy tries to sell Oliver Hardy "insurance "at Stan. br /> <br /> Otherwise, this script is just a mess. Forget about this and see if you can find a copy of "A Chump at Oxford" or "Bohemian Girl" or "Sons of the Desert" instead.
