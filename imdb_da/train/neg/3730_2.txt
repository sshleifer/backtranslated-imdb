First, there is nothing wrong with studying Daniel, Revelation, Matthew 24, Isaiah, and other prophetic writings. There is also nothing wrong with making a movie like this to try to present the gospel message. So my nausea with this movie is not in either its sincerity or ambition. As a Christian, despite an amile scholar, I believe there will be a great tribulation, and I believe that Christ will return as he said so much. So even though I disagree with this movie about the rapture, that's not why I consider this movie so low. <br /> <br /> No, what makes me judge this movie so low is not its sincerity or its message, but rather its lack of production values, horrible scripts, mediocre plays and pitiful FX. This movie is down there with some of the cheesiest scifi feeds from the 1950s. No, this movie is down there with Plan 9 From Outerspace. This movie was not aged well and was probably dated by the time they made a sequel. The apocalypse gene film producers could have learned how to make a closing movie from this, but they failed. The left behind the series, the Apocalypse series and the Omega code series did not all succeed in learning this because they addressed the FX problems and the dated look problem, but their scripts are still poor and their plays are wood. <br /> <br /> There are great Christian movies, with extremely low budgets, but this movie is not one of them. I'm surprised that the MST3K crew never did this.
