I was willing to laugh at this movie as a Mystery Science Theater experiment, but it was just boring. It seems that the producers had many biker-enthusiastic friends, and from there they decided to make a movie randomly. <br /> <br /> It's often unwatchable. Lots of recordings of the cyclists run on a dirt road, with the same music played repeatedly. Unfortunately, Renee Harmon is hardly in the movie. Harmon would probably have lived up. Maybe she had other obligations on the day she was filmed. <br /> <br /> Of course, cyclists terrorize a small town. Fighters, murders, a fake policeman, a goofy mechanic, etc. One of the cyclists always wears a football helmet, a weak attempt to distinguish him from all the other bans. <br /> <br /> The script has nothing to offer. A scene a biker has attacked a woman, shouting in the woman's face "You're the same! You're the same!". We come back to the scene a moment later and he declares again "You're the same!" Couldn't the author think of anything more creative to say? <br /> <br /> In the end, the good people have killed the evil ones. We also learn that the wedding between the Middle Ages mechanic Joe and young Susie has been canceled. Susie goes to college, and we suddenly learn that your wedding is still on (but with another bride). End.
