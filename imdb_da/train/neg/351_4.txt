1. watched 2/16/2002 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery ?? / Thriller with too many ridiculous plot twists. Despite the highly talented cast, this movie is too predictable and just below estimates that it is the audience. The cinematic public is not stupid, and I no longer hope to fill certain star pockets again and again despite what they are involved in. We believe that this movie will be about something with Connery's belief in the initial capital traffic But it turns out to be nothing more than a standard designed for the public's sake, run by the mill, let's never get it over with, thriller. We are drawn into every stupid switch in character, as they are portrayed to us when necessary in history, and we are ready for this thing to come before it ends. Yes, there are some good plays here, especially from Blair Underwood, Fishburne and Ed Harris in a psycho-supporting role, but the story doesn't work from almost the beginning to the very long-awaited end.
