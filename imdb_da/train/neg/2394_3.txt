This movie was weird ... I saw it while taking a quarter of psilcybe cubensis (mushrooms). It was really weird. I'm pretty sure you need to see it high, but mushrooms were not enough. I couldn't stop laughing ... maybe lsd would work. The movie is a bunch of things that morphing into other things and dancing. It's really cheesy for today's standards, but when it was released I was sure it was good ... one of a kind. I could see how some people would think this movie was good, but I didn't think it was very interesting and I was on mushrooms at the time. If you have a party or something, and every day is turned on, pop it, you get a few laughs.
