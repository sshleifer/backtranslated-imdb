Seeing Tom Hanks as a hitman for the Irish mob is a bit like watching Jimmy Stewart as a serial killer, it just doesn't work. I had a very hard time accepting this. Not I don't think Tom can act, he has followed his career since Mazes and Monsters, but for some reason it fell flat for me. Maybe because I'm such a fan of the graphic novel and at risk of sounding like a fanboy (the only form of life lower than a fanboy is a cockroach) The movie as a whole fails for me. The additions Jude Law and Subtractions made everything else cold and more than a little disappointing. I was expecting a big crime movie more in Bonnie's blood and Clyde Mendes took the whole heart out of the story and left us with only those bare bones. There are things to suffer from this flick, but the cinematography is great to fill the screen with beautiful pictures. Paul Newman is, as usual, excellent, and I really enjoy the score, but Tom as the "angel of death" Sullivan was completely flat.
