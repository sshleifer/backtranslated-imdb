This is the worst ripoff of Home Alone movies I've ever seen! See sections 1 and 2, but don't let anyone say this is better than the first two! I really mean you don't make a movie, then make a sequel with the same characters and actors, and then make another sequel with different characters and actors! I think it would have been ok if it wasn't a "Home Alone" movie, but they made it a Home Alone movie. Culkin is too old now, so you suppose to stop making followers! Goodness, this movie makes me SAFE! Buy parts 1 and 2.
