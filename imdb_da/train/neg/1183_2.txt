This and the Immoral Tales, both left a bad taste in my mouth. It seems to me that Borowczyk is disgusted with sex, and these two films are cautious stories of what will happen if you have sex. As a movie, it's not very well done - some of the actors are really epic bad (like the "American" woman with the French accent). The young woman's sudden flip-flop from being anxious to the interest of the marriage (when it looks like it should have been the other way) and the aunt's sudden realization of the youngster's secret doesn't make sense - not explained at all. I also did not like how the daughter's relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her family's perversion or penchant for bestiality. The central idea, the idea that there is this "sexy animal", if you want to live in the forest, could have been the basis of a perverse but fun story, but instead used only as the basis for a grim sex-negative , moral games.
