Strained comedy, a sketch-like revue, originally a means to showcase the once-off star Jack Pearl, but is now best remembered as America's introduction to The Three Stooges. In fact, Larry, Curly and Moe are billed with Ted Healy as Ted Healy and his Three Stooges. Although the supportive cast has Jimmy Durante (who is totally wasted on obscure material) and ZaSu Pitts, the only audience for the movie these days is Stooges addicts, and even they won't find much to pat here. Incredibly high and indulgent, it shows how far Hollywood had to go to achieve a certain level of slapstick sophistication. * 1/2 from ****
