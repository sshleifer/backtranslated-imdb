I decided to watch this serial after watching the endless ads for the BBC in the weeks before it started. I saw it despite the fact that I don't like the pretentious kind of stuff Alan Hollinghurst writes (sorry for his fans, but I think we have a case of emperor's new clothes with this author's work). I admit that the play is excellent, it's beautifully shot, and I was reasonably entertained by it - though I found that the story was extremely thin and after seeing all three episodes, feel very dissatisfied with this rather empty production. The "explicit" homosexual that the media drunk about has all been done before on television - several times - so it was nothing very shocking, I'm afraid. Full marks for production values, but low for storyline / content I'm afraid.
