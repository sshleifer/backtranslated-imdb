I want to say that curiosity got the best of me. If I only saw a trailer, I could tell you the whole plot of the movie; I could have saved the most pointless one hour and forty minutes in my entire life and about $ 20. This movie was a disaster waiting to happen, and it's an embarrassment to Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The movie shows a living ignorance of reality. For example, this kid's remote control race car runs across the neighborhood and even enters this house. It is even covered in clothes. Isn't it rational to believe that a remote control can no longer send a signal under these circumstances? Of course, Hollywood hasn't believed it. Common logic and every concept of electronics dictates the opposite; I doubt that car could even have reached the street, let alone a house across the street. Another unrealistic feature is the lack of intelligence that criminals have. Why is it in all these movies that these criminals are rocket scientists until they meet an eight-year-old? The child is supposed to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists? Please, there is more reality in The Matrix. Also, the leader puts down his real gun and "randomly" picks up a plastic gun; apparently he could not tell the difference. Even with a glove on, one should be able to do it. Just because they see the same doesn't matter; There are other senses than sight. The traps are also unrealistic; If one of them actually worked, the criminals would be dead. But, Hollywood intends for us to "laugh" at the "fun" results of the traps. I didn't laugh; I sighed and rolled my eyes. <br /> <br /> But I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they've seen a really bad movie; The movie they saw will seem like Citizen Kane to this one. Otherwise, skip this one for your pride. Home Alone 3 also raises a question. We all know Alex D. Linz stars in the movie, but did he also write it?
