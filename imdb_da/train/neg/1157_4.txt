I ended up seeing the tenants with my close friends who rented the movie exclusively based on Snoop Dogg's appearance (a passionate fetish of theirs) on the front page. Understandably I didn't expect much. I thought the movie would include the typical selection of Snoop Dogg related behaviors and imagery often seen in clich√© rap videos. But my generalization was mostly wrong. Unfortunately, this did not make the movie better. <br /> <br /> Most would describe the movie as a dark serious drama, while I would describe it as a dark, seriously drawn boring drama girl. The film tells a story of two struggling writers (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg) trying to create their own separate masterpieces. Their polar opposite lifestyle ends up forming an unlikely but very complex and neurotic friendship. This friendship moves throughout the movie as a wild roller coaster - most of which is contributed by Snoop's character - reminiscent of someone with a serious case of shared personality disorder. And even if the movie is a drama, it is acting - having a morbid and serious tone - from Snoop and the company more comical than anything else. I would not recommend this movie to those who are noticeably impaired because it has a lot of dialogue and much more dialogue after that. There are some mediocre conflicts, but even they are mostly spoiled with more dialogue. The end, however, jumped at me with a sudden surprise. It was a little twisted, something unexpected and a perfect way to unpack a movie to finish. As I looked at the final credits, I couldn't help but see the picture of the director: "Oh God, how in hell do I end this snoozer." By the way, the director carefully planted hints and subtleties that led to the climax - all of which are more visible than Waldo in a crowded street of midgets carrying nothing but black sweaters.
