Disappointing musical version of Margaret Landon's "Anna and King of Siam" filmed in 1946 with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, Deborah Kerr has cast as a widow and mother traveling from England to Siam in 1862 to accept jobs that teach to The King's many children - and perhaps teach the royal a thing or two in the process! Stagy image begins well, but quickly loses energy and focus. Yul Brynner, who repeats his stage triumph as the King, is a commanding presence, but used - as a buffalo - by. Kerr keeps his cold dignity and fares better, despite having to sync with Marni Nixon's vocals. Perhaps he has already played this part to death, Brynner sees as if he had nothing left for the screen translation except for the bombast. The second half, with Anna and the mopeds setting up a musical version of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" is quite ridiculous, and the Rodgers and Hammerstein songs are most lumbering. Brynner won a best actor Oscar, but it is feisty Kerr who keeps this bauble over water. Overlong, heavy and 'old-fashioned' in the worst sense of the term. ** from ****
