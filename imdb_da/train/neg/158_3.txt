Warning Spoilers follow. Fantastic recreation of the base in Antarctica, where the film's real events took place. Other than that, ridiculous !, outrageous! Filmed in Canada; Presumably from a largely Canadian crew and cast. I caught the last half of this movie recently on Global TV here in Canada. Nothing else to say than how thoroughly shaken I was at what an obvious piece of American historical revisionist propaganda it is; and starring Susan Sarandon of all people! I can only assume that the Canadian born director Roger Spottiswoode was forced to make the USAF the heroes of the movie as the real rescued where a small private airline based in Calgary; Kenn Borek Air.
