This is a bad B movie masking as a mockumentary. The film documentary filmmaker in the film has almost as much screen time and dialogue as any other character. It completely destroyed any "documentary feeling" that they might have wanted to create. <br /> <br /> The fact that the movie is not a mockumentary is the least of it's problems. The movie is not fun. The movie is not sexy. The movie has nothing obvious to say about the porn business. It's not even very sour. While sex is simulated, the amount of nudity is mild for an R-rated movie. <br /> <br /> Someday, somebody will make a good mockumentary about the porn industry. It is not.
