a word boring. <br /> <br /> The young demi looks good, but she is pregnant (- points for that = D) the movie is not scary at all ... the first scenes so little crazy, I could make better clouds with my laptop computer and aftermath. But it was then ... and now it is. some movies don't get old well ... this is one of them. <br /> <br /> Not worth renting or buying ... get something better instead of the exorcist, ... <br /> <br /> next = D <br /> <br /> Oh drama- part in the beginning just and simply suxor = D
