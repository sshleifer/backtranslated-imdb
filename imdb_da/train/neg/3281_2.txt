I suspected that the movie would be bad. I'm a duke's fan from the way back. Have three years of TV series on DVD. Well I was right. Took the family to see it. I really wanted to see the General jump again and some of the jumping jump scenes were good. But to sum it up, the movie was a dumbed down tarted version of the TV show. <br /> <br /> Jessica Simpson was pathetic. While I can honestly say that the original Daisy's outfits were just as revealing, Jessica Simpson's interpretation of Daisy was simply horrible. Sorrel Booke and Denver Pyle should also roll in their graves. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money. If you are an old, tried and true Dukes fan like me and my three children, you will be very disappointed.
