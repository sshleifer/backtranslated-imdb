This has to be the worst movie I've seen in the last 20 years. When I saw that Michael Madsen was in it, I figured it couldn't be a bad movie when he was in some pretty decent movies, and he was a pretty fair actor. WRONG! No one should waste their time on this movie. I quickly jump through 80 percent of it, and I don't feel like I missed one thing.
