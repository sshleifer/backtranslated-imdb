Big Western I hear you all say! Brilliant first effort! Now I'm not sure which movie you were all watching, but it must have been different from the one I saw. Great western or really good movies of any genre have characters you can believe in and this movie had none! The action was bad to say the least, and I couldn't care less about any of the characters, making the whole movie meaningless. The story was too big for decision makers, and maybe they should try to do it directly to TV-low budget waste that you see on these "FACT OR FICTION" programs on sci-fi. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good movie, a great western or even just an enjoyable one and a half hour, please look elsewhere.
