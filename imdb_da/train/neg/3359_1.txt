They turned up this story! In the end, Nell is completely heroic and takes on the team to save all their donkeys from Hill House and a lot of nonsense like that! The added heads are chopped, wires cut people's faces and the ceiling becomes a huge hand! What the hell is that about ??? I own and love the original movie, I read the book and I love it! The reason why the original film and the book are so great is that it scares you so much without even showing the ghost. There are none. There is no ceiling hand. It's just the ghost advertisement how ghosts can really kill a person. They can't kill us, they can't throw us around the room or fly a knife into our head. No. They can only drive us crazy. Removes all our senses of security. Nell was a selfish woman. She only wanted good things for herself. Yes, she used a little for the others, but not too much. David Self and Jan de Bont have been driving this amazing story! I hate this damn remake!
