Because others have struggled to summarize the plot, I would like to mention a few points about this movie. There may be spoilers here; I don't care to filter them out. <br /> <br /> - In light of the film's low budget, the design was quite good. It's actually nice to see a direct-to-video horror movie that doesn't slathered with horrible CGI. Unfortunately, digital film quality is quite grainy in places, and it is most visible in the asylum's well-lit white halls. <br /> <br /> - Ridiculous lighting designs plague parts of this movie not to mention the variations in the time course. I understand that the director might have been trying to simulate dementia, but for this to be effective, it would be necessary to establish time flow. As it seems, it seems to be amateurish. <br /> <br /> - Plot twists were many but consistently predictable. Nor did I have any doubts about the identities of the identified cultists, nor that some kind of lame evil trumps - good development would surface at the end. <br /> <br /> - It may seem like quibbling, but characters in this movie fail to use any common sense. First of all, regulatory commissions will be over a mental health center that unilaterally declared all patient and employee deaths induced cardiac arrest. Why would the main psychiatry also be able to perform autopsy? Why was it not a plot of these impressive qualifications, or of his introduction to his odd choice of religion? What is the background? What are we to do about anyone in this? And just as importantly, who in their right mind would go through the introduction to the place, see everything that was so scary wrong with it, and then conclude that it was still a good place to pursue a stay? This film did not even respect its characters enough to give the intelligence the benefits of doubt. Bottom line: See The Wicker Man instead.
