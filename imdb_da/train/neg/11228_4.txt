The biggest mistake in the movie is its uninspired script. It goes back and forth between the vignettes of Bettie's story and the re-creation of Klaw's short films. While the Klaw recipes are well-finished, it is unnecessary to recreate them in their immediate entirety. Page Richards, but not a great actress, does a decent job in general. And at times she bears a remarkable resemblance to Bettie. Also by note are some faithful attention to detail. Costumes and clothes well finished, which are some of the set direction. The sets are generally sparse and feel phase-y but feel for the era. It is sometimes surprisingly well-lit, and the color palette was clearly thought out to give the overall look a vibrant retro feel.
