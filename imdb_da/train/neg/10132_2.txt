STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday evening Monday morning <br /> <br /> The US military has just launched a big new stealth fighter plane that can evade detection as opposed to everyone else. A deviant pilot (Steve Touissant) steals it and depicts the US government detached from it. So they are forced to send their best man John Sands (Seagal, who else?) To stop him in exchange for his freedom from a detention center where his thoughts were to be wiped out by all the incriminating information he has learned over the years. <br /> <br /> I skipped the Attack Force because I could tell from the cover and all the post-production manipulation that it would have been bad, and since all the negative reviews and low user ratings came to pour in it , just confirmed what I thought. But I decided to give FOF a chance because Shadow Man (of the same director) was not bad, and what the hell was Seagal my favorite action star once and maybe, maybe just, he could make a good movie again. Oh, what a fool I was. Dubbing, horrible stock footage of air journeys, horrible cameras, cheap production values, risible, compelling combat scenes that have become Seagal's trademark and a dull sleeping inducing plot that doesn't go anywhere. Fortunately, his next film, Once Upon a Time in the Hood (which I skip) apparently marks the end of his contract with Sony, which means no more of those horrible European lenses action movies and his next movie Prince of Pistols can mark a return to theaters. Hell, he did it before, and Stallone has managed to do it before him (Rocky Balboa.) <br /> <br /> This is not a Flight of Fury. It's not even fun. It's a flight that doesn't even run off the ground. *
