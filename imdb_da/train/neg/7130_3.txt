This movie should have been named Need For Speed: The Movie. For those who haven't played, Need For Speed ​​has mostly hot cars and beautiful women and almost no reason. This is perfect for Redline. The only thing about this movie, which was A-Level, was the cars. The play seemed forced and the manuscript, the premise was at best flimsy, and the plot was almost non-existent. I only really watched this movie to see how bad it was, and even though it was pretty bad, it could have been worse. And at least it was entertaining. I just wish they had shown that Eddie Griffin crashed Enzo somewhere in the movie. All in all, don't pay for it, don't go out to see it, but if it's on Showtime or HBO and there's nothing else on it, it's a decent distraction.
