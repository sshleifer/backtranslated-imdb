Well, how do you even consider a movie like this? Does it even have film value really? It's a movie trying to get as close to being a snuff movie as possible. Basically, the whole movie is a lot of guys torturing a young girl. Not very appealing and beyond that also not so realistic really. It is obvious that the film was trying to be as realistic and shocking as possible. But the movie is just too false for it to work as planned. The slapping and stumping are all soft and false looking, as well as sound. They often kick into the floor, rather than into the girl. Also the way the girl reacts to all the pines is pretty tame. I mean, if this were right, she would probably scream it out. There is more groaning than screaming in this. <br /> <br /> The film is, of course, low budget and it is a valor attempt to try to achieve something shocking and realistic as well as original and provocative with very limited resources. Do not really think that this movie has had much influence, even though it was released, even though it should have done some good, as a total of six successors were released after that. <br /> <br /> Fans of shock and Gore will most likely be disappointed with this movie, although there are still some fetish people out there who will get a kick out of this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
