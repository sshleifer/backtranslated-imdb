THIS AUDIT IS MOST ALL THE SPOILERS. If you are planning to enjoy this movie, do not read this overview. <br /> <br /> That's the problem with kids television today. It is all so condescending and condescending. "Wow, it was fun, wasn't it?" No, it wasn't. And, unfortunately, it also seems to have permeated children films. And that's what 'Fly of Reindeer' is all about. Admittedly, I haven't seen the Reindeer flight in a few years, so I may be unclear on some points, but I remember being thoroughly inadequate at that time. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the story follows a speaker who gets a book for Christmas. Now the lecturer is a valued researcher on some animal's flying habits. I think it was bullfrogs. In any case, through this book, teacher / family learns that reindeer can fly exactly the same as bullfrogs. Apparently, this book was written by a researcher many hundreds of years ago who disappeared in the North Pole. Now, if it were me, I would have thrown the book out into the nearest window. Flying bullfrogs is a naturally occurring phenomenon, but flying reindeer is a fantastic and completely unrealistic concept. But Mr. Speaker is not me, so I assume explaining why he decides to fly to the North Pole, leaving his wife and child at home without knowing where he is gone. Of course, it goes wrong, and before he knows it, a flying reindeer has stepped into his private plane, and he's stranded at the North Pole. <br /> <br /> Are you still following this? Good. <br /> <br /> Of course, his family is destroyed. I would also be, I mean, what a sigh-tacular Christmas. Elsewhere, Mr. Lecturer finds himself in a hidden city at the North Pole inhabited by midgets and a tyrannical figure that only dresses red and white. Instead of trying to escape immediately, as I would have done, he greets everyone there with open arms. This hidden civilization of midget monsters, and he greets them with open arms. Oooo-kayyyy. They feed him with this story that they are the elves of the jeweler, and they use toys all year round, they have no idea. And the speaker accepts all this. He even accepts that Santa Claus is actually the scientist who disappeared two hundred years ago or anything. There is only one problem - they don't want him to leave. The world cannot know their secret existence. After all, before they would know, there would be a McDonald's and a Starbucks on each street corner. <br /> <br /> Still with me? <br /> <br /> Now find my cozy guy's family book and assume he has gone to the North Pole. Boy, wouldn't they be embarrassed if they found out he had just gone for a good trip? Before the audience knows it, they hunt to spend a Christmas in the most authentic winter landscape on the planet. Meanwhile, the lecturer gets sick of all the cuts and decides to leave. I can't remember exactly, but I remember him holding the Christmas Clause to gunpoint. A fire fight comes up when the midgets attack and he manages to escape through Santa's sleigh. With Santa warm on his heels and with blood problems in his eyes, he finds, no matter what he is flying through a wonderful coincidence with his family plane looking for him. So he jumps on to their plane, the planes fly back and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> The fact is, there have been some shocking movies made in Christmas name over the years, but because they have the festive charm they get away with it. And that is the charm that is completely devoid of 'the flight of the Rein' There is not much wrong with it; nothing that offends the intelligence (it is clear that it is, but it is a children's film and thus can get away with such things) or something particularly offensive, but the problem is that there is nothing right. It just doesn't feel like Christmassy. And for a movie about Christmas, it's a pretty big mistake. But hey, I don't think 'Fly of the reindeer target group mind about it? Why should they all be so doped in calming means that they probably could not spell "Christmas" <br /> <br /> I give it three out of ten. If it were a TV movie, then I would add another two stars to it. We all know how bad they can get.
