I'm a big fan of Italian movies from the seventies, and I wouldn't hesitate to list beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favorite actresses all the time, so I went into this movie with some hopes. But it soon becomes clear that this is a largely meaningless movie that does not go anywhere. It is clear that no one would go into this expectation much more, but the fact that this is meaningless becomes more annoying when one considers that it is rather boring, and none of the signs are interesting. As the title suggests, the film focuses on a "rogue"; in this case one who steals, feminises and smuggles things. It's basically all the plot this movie has. The film has a real 'seventy style' for it, and the idea that it is all very carefree comes in well. It sometimes seems as directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson tried to put some sort of point, though it is certainly not the only point. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on the screen is always a pleasure, and this is also the case; She is definitely the best thing about the movie, and the order in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the movie. Overall, The Rogue will probably have some appeal to people who love the seventies style, but unfortunately it doesn't have much to offer.
