Oliver Gruner is completely unknown to me. My friend showed me this movie because he had seen Gruner in what he called a pretty good sci-fi movie, Nemesis. So we saw this, we were fast forwarding through BS drama parts just to get to the incredible action sequences. Gruner loves to kick and kick and kick. And save! haha <br /> <br /> Groner character is a graduate student forced to stay in a ghetto close to the one he grew up in. He finds himself looking for the boy living with him because he Really want to join the Mexican gang that hurt their family. Instead of participating, Gruner tells the boy to fight back (against a gang? For crazy). Gruner plays a typical Van Damme character, who kills everyone (or rather fails them) and works to rid his block of these gang members. <br /> <br /> The reason was very cheesy and easy to think about. Gruner is probably not very well known because of his script selection if this movie is something to compare possible choices to. This ghetto is a pure hell, and I enjoyed seeing that person's smart crew go through it as if they have a chance against Gruner's character. The music was typically action music (thumping pianos and timpani, raising guitars), which actually wasn't as bad as I get it to sound. The director really needed to hold the action instead of taking a break every 5 minutes for a tense family moment. <br /> <br /> In the end, I gave it a 4/10 because it really tried to be an average action movie for Oliver Gruner to star in, but the overall feeling of the movie leaves you wanting more closure on what you so.
