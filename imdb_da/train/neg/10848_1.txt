Of all accounts, this could have been an interesting movie. With a score of the mighty Cradle Of Filth starring their frontman Dani and being hyped up as "Britain's fear future," I expected Alex Chandons to do the hype. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is either clich√© or unlucky. The card history anthology setup was made to death (and much better) in the 70s and 80s. Certainly the thought of the 'hospital' sent a chill down on my spine, but as with most of the film was let down by poor script writing and acting. <br /> <br /> Chandon can't write dialogue. Every sentence with the largest police investigator is full of hardship and imperfection (the typical "policeman on the edge" formula. Fun, I'm sure I've seen it somewhere else before ...) No Chandon, you're not Tarantino . Or Scorsese. That sounds bad. Add ludicrously OTT, which works with very risky casting (don't confuse me, Dani Filth is a great singer and musician, but actor he is not) and the performances are beyond ridiculous to the vein who is breaking creeps. Give me Bruce Campbell one day. <br /> <br /> The visual effects are on the whole poor, with some awful CGI, horrible gore effects (for the sake of goodness, Peter Jackson did it better and it was over ten years ago with less budget) and editing filters , that shriek ABOUT USE! As for the often suspected use of Cradle Of Filth's score ... man, they should sue. The basic problem with Cradle Of Fear is that it takes seriously, trying to build the atmosphere and encouraging terror and rejection within its audience. For many good horror films made in the 70s and 80s, this does so much better with far better gore effects (eg: madman, zombie carnivores, the exterior, suspiria, etc.) that give Cradle of Fear in my court, second movement and obsolete. <br /> <br /> I hope Chandon can learn from this hideous ghoul of a movie and continue to do some quality fear that actually scares. <br /> <br /> Better luck next time.
