I have gone out of very few movies before they quit, but I could not finish this piece of waste. This was the greatest burden of racism trying to pass as a legitimate movie since "Birth of a Nation". The signs were a little more than cardboard cuts. I can't see how any actor would have their name associated with this movie. Lee must have better things to do that put waste like this. I know that everybody with a brain has better things to do .... like seeing paint dry. I want someone to make a film about interracial relationships that dealt with the subject realistically. There is much more depth on this subject the low ranting of a bitter director like Lee.
