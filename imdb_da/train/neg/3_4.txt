If I hadn't read Pat Barker 'Union Street' before I watched this movie, I would have liked it. Unfortunately, this is not the case. It's actually my kind of movie, it's well made, and in no way would I like to say anything else, but as an adaptation it fails from all angles. The scary novel about the reality of Bor in an area of ​​the northern England workplace took hold of my heart strokes and refused to let go for weeks after I finished. When I read about Union Street women, I was put through tears, rejection, shock, anger, sympathy, and misery. Excellent. A novel that at times felt like I couldn't read more of, but I simply couldn't put it down. Depressing yes, but extremely poignant. <br /> <br /> The movie. Oh God. Hollywood took Barker's truth and reality and bathed a layer of sweet sugar over the top of it. A beautiful movie, an inspirational soundtrack, excellent performances, a tale of hope and romance ... yes. An adaptation of Union Street no. <br /> <br /> Union Street women and their stories are condensed into the character of the Fonda, their stories are touched, but many are discarded. I accept that some of Barker's narratives are sensitive issues and are too horrifying for mass viewing, and that a movie with approx. 7 leading protagonists just aren't practical, but the content is not my main problem. The essence and reality of the novel has been lost - darkness and rain, broken windows covered in cardboard, and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced by sunshine, beautiful houses and a flashing Wilhelms score. <br /> <br /> If you have enjoyed the movie for its positivity and hope for reality, I recommend you hesitate to read the book without first preparing for anything more like 'Schindler's List' ... but without the happy ending.
