One of my sister's friends lent me this game and it's too terribly hard! It bears the appearance of a kids game, but you have to learn how to make tons of intricate moves that require you to twist and make your hands at all kinds of awkward positions, and you have to look for endless levels of 100 notes to improve your score! You also need to find these impossible hidden puzzle pieces that require you to do almost impossible tasks to get them! And I'm only up to step three !!!!! Perhaps, if you have no life, you can stay home all the time, you can enjoy this, but otherwise stay away! AND IT'S FINALLY NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN - THEY HAVE TO KEEP HARD WITHOUT HOURS!
