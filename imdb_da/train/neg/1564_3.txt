... was that in good conscience I could tell everyone how horrible this movie is. I barely made it through twenty minutes before I started thinking about myself: "Wow, it's pretty bad." And to be honest, I would have given this movie 1 star if it wasn't for Esai Morales (though he had very little screen time). He's the film's only well-run role, which is a shame because I really like Gil Bellows ... or at least I thought I did. <br /> <br /> While I saw this, I began to think back to his side in "Shawshank Redemption" and realized that it wasn't as good as I thought it was. Problem: his prison / hard guy action seems like it's just an act; His dialogue sounded like he was making a very bad impression. Has he ever met a person who speaks as his character was SUPPOSED? I doubt it, but maybe he should. <br /> <br /> And to make matters worse, they have managed to inject a small prison house philosophy and make it seemingly nothing short of constructed, especially when considering the rhetoric being spat out of a "rasta" whose accent was so strong that it seemed to be unnatural. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't normally slam a movie like this, but when I saw the movie it had a fair favorable review. I felt cheated and lied to, and I thought I should try to save some misery from seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> I say BOOOOOOOO.
