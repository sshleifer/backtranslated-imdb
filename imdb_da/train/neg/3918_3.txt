This movie may have been the biggest disappointment I've experienced in renting movies based on IMDb reviews. All in all, I simply found this to be another set of movies. <br /> <br /> Leslie Cheung is certainly acceptable as antihero and Ma Wu manages his character with cheerful competency. On the other hand, Ma Wus's makeup (facial hair) is so obviously false that I simply couldn't take him seriously. He looked like an overweight teenager dressed up for Halloween, complete with $ 4.95 stick-on beard. <br /> <br /> The special effects were uneven, although the "undead" in the basement was pretty good. The wood tongue looked like something from a bad 1950's monster girl, although the POV shoots from the tongue's eyes looked more like Sam Raimi's trademark shot in the recent "Evil Dead" trilogy. The pyrotechnic technique was ho-hum and the final battle is as boring as you can get. (In fact, it reminded me most about the episode "Lost in Space" where Robinson's is caught in a sandstorm and ....) The plot was not very original and has been told countless times in the form of European adventures. There was no tension and no plot twists. In fact, you know as soon as you are introduced to the characters who are good, who are bad, and who will survive. <br /> <br /> I just returned to this movie for Netflix, and then I sat down to write this review. The very first thing I did was check the production date. Yep, it says 1987 ... not 1967, as I thought it might be. And it basically sums it up: The production values ​​and FX are typical for the 1960s. The plot and action seem much older when Hollywood actually produced some interesting and challenging films in the 60s. <br /> <br /> ** out of *****
