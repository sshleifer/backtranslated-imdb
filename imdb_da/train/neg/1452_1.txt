This 1919-1933 Germany hardly looks like a post in the Czech capital WWII. Oh sorry, it's the Czech capital and it's 2003, how fun. <br /> <br /> This is one of the most horrible story movies in the past. Röhm is head higher than Adolf and looks so damn good, Göring looks like 40 when he is just 23, and "Führer" always looks like 56. And the buildings, folks, even buildings have been young, sometimes. Especially in 1919 many houses in Germany were almost new (WWI does not reach German cities!). No crumbling plaster! So Reichstagsbuilding. There has never been urban canyons around this building, never. And it may sound to you all as a miracle: In 1933 the fire in Greater Berlin owns a lot of cars with engines, some even with turntables, but none with a hand pump. <br /> <br /> One last thing: What kind of PLAYMOBIL slot was this in the last order? For me, it was a kind of "Adolf's adventure in Wonderland"
