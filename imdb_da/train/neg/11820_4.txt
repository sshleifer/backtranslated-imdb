I saw this on the DVD (it is known as CORRUPT in this format) and the blurb on the casing really hyped up how Harvey Keitel's character Frank is as much as the one he played BAD LIEUTENANT in "This gritty and powerful police brother". What the casing didn't mention was that this is an old Italian movie. How old is Theo? Well, when a character plays music, he doesn't put on the CD player, he pulls a big plastic pancake, puts it on some kind of rotating hob, where some kind of mechanical arm touches the pancake that causes music to be heard. Can you see my point that this is an old movie? The DVD case gave no idea that this was a movie made 20 years ago. It's also a movie with poor production values ​​like so many other Italian films that are masking as American. With the exception of Keitel, the cast is horrible, although Johnny Rotten's performance is bizarre rather than horrible. The cinematography is static with the picture and sound quality, giving the impression that I was looking at a fourth generation pirate copy (I do not know if it is down to a risky DVD or if it is a very bad movie print) and worst of all is Ennio Morricones score. It's impossible to believe in the man who made the annoyingly intrusive random music for CORRUPT, the same one who made the music for the Clint Eastwood westerns. All this is a shame because CORRUPT has its moments. It is by no means the greatest psycho-thriller ever conceived, but it kept my interest, and as always Keitel records a good performance as a violent nutcase policeman. Just a pity that the rest of the movie did not match his high standards
