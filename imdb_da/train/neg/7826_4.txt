Special effects? Well. <br /> <br /> Script? Terrible. No plot. No depth. No meaning. This movie made Superman a pointless hero, a completely non-archetype. In the original film, he represented America in the Cold War. Here he represented nothing but a Hulk. <br /> <br /> Of course, the actors were fine. Kevin Spacey was among other things a good choice. <br /> <br /> This does not yet solve the problem that this film had no depth. I can't see how anyone can get away with something meaningful from this movie, as Superman was and is created daily to be a meaningful hero in not only comics but also in people's minds. This was really a waste of money considering how many directions this movie could have taken. Just a few cases: Lex Luthor could have been a villain of global corporatism, political domination, totalitarianism, and so on and on. He was just another goofball hackman incarnation. <br /> <br /> And Superman? For what did he do in this movie? Nothing but another hack "savior" figure. <br /> <br /> Wait until it comes to dollar theater if you see it at all.
