I grew up seeing the original TV series in the sixties, and one thing that I can tell you right away is no comparison. This movie was quite ridiculous with a flying suit that lived. A martian who took various forms. Special effects that resembled something that a small child would create. In contrast, the characters were developed, and viewers developed a sense for Tim and Uncle Martin. The only highlight in this movie, yes, actually there was one, arose when Ray Walston finally got a look at the end. He had dark glasses and referred to living on this planet for 30 years as a kind of tribute to the television series. But even the real uncle Martin couldn't save this turkey.
