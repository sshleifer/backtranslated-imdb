The prerequisite for this movie was decent enough, but with sub par acting it was just gentle and boring. SPOILERS The movie does not work because of the nature of death, it was accidental, so even though it was a murder, it was not like the guy sat down to do it. Also, through some feedback, there is a secret that reveals that kind of events do justice to some degree. There is no emotion in this movie. The first 20 minutes or so is just this woman who calls her sister and hears her message. It was boring and boring. <br /> <br /> With some polishing and better acting it could have been pretty good.
