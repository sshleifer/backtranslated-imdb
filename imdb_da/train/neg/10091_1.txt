I can't believe this movie was ever created. I believe in points that the director is trying to make it an artistic piece, but it just makes it worse. The zombies look as though they are using too much eye makeup. The zombies are only in the movie for a few minutes. Finally, there are maybe five or six zombies in total, definitely not a nation. The best part of the movie, if there is one, is definitely the credits because the painful experience was finally finished. Again, to repeat other user comments, the voodoo achievements are weird and do not make much sense throughout the movie. There is also a scene with a snake and a Romanian girl who just doesn't make sense. It has never been explained.
