I grew up with scooby (just the lap of where are you) I hate scrappy, love Daphne, and don't feel complete with the whole gang. But this is boring, scooby doo is mystery-solving comedy - not bad, totally spied jap anime. i like "what's new", they had to give dangerously exposed Daphne a makeover sometime :( and try to lose * sex * medical jokes of many a generation, but this "get a clue" is flat out and must not have Scooby They even tried to make some lama punk stuff with the theme song, now I have to see my DVD of scooby doo, where to wash the filth of this new series from my eyes
