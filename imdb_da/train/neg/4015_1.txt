a friend told me to say it was another classic like "Debbie Dallas". Nowhere close. I think my biggest complaint is about the most uncomfortable leading actress in the porn industry ever. Even more terrible is that she is on the screen almost all the time. But I read a place that back in those days, porn should have some "artistic" value. However, I couldn't find it. See it only if you are interested in the story of porn development in the mainstream, or can appreciate the art of porn movies. I know I'm not. But the film's director seems to be a talented person. He even tried to get Simon & Garfunkel to give him permission to use his songs. Of course they refused.
