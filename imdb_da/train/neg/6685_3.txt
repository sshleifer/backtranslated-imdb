Although the film is in a college in the Ivy League, it was actually shot completely in Northern Arizona, mainly at North Arizona University in Flagstaff in the fall of 1976. I was involved in the theater department there, and most of the extras in the movie are then members of the theater department. <br /> <br /> There is a completely ridiculous scene in this movie (if you know your Arizona geography) that shows several cast members bikes from college to a creek. We NAUs know that campus and bay (actually Oak Creek Canyon) are about 35 miles apart, and while the trip is downhill, it would be literally impossible to cycle back on the same road!
