I've seen my fair share of poorly thought out endings and final twists on movies, but I can't remember any movies that committed suicide as such. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers clearly hoped that the big twist would "surprise" all of us .... and so did it, but perhaps not in the way the directors had hoped. I was left to feel surprised that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw had something to do with this turkey, individually or collectively. <br /> <br /> The movie until the last thirty minutes was pretty engaging, and I like the way the story unfolded and the character of the movie gathered. But when the turn was revealed, the plots and inconsistencies were remarkable, the underlying motive for revenge was inconceivable, and the ways that things so finely performed for Bobby Earl were ridiculously removed. What's worse is that when the turn was revealed, the rest of the movie was rudely predictable. Harris gave a great performance, and Connery is like Morgan Freeman, never giving a bad performance, even if the movie isn't that big! So all in all it starts well, and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested. The last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of the cinema.
