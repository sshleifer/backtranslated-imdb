Unfortunately, this is not 'the best British gorilla movie since hellraiser', although the DVD cover claims this, which is what tricked me into buying it. However, it is a tribute to many of the great pits of old, films from especially the Amicus staff. Cradle ... is shot on mini dv, which although we all know more of a tv feel than a movie, can be made so much better. Each scene, set, and shot looks as if it is on exactly the same way (standard key, padding, rear setup), which only enhances the image of the finished piece. The gore content is quite honest, ridiculous. From the opening shots, where we see a man's obvious foam head torn together, to sticky cheap hammers, the creation effects and the awful CG, there was nothing in there that impressed me at all. <br /> <br /> The play is abominable, from the almost comatose detective to the hummingbird, via Dani Filth, the least compelling horror movie bad guy I've ever witnessed. Each of the substances is more formal than the last, and the sets get worse and worse when the movie is running. Watch out for 'Mental Asylum' - a Georgian half-house with a bad CG sign outside, and the most bizarre (and not in a good way) padded cell I've seen. <br /> <br /> It took me four attempts to get to the end of the movie without my attention wandering (no, running) away at any vacancy. I actually found myself bothering at some point while the movie was running. However, it marks one of the last known looks of Emily Booth's tits, which I think is a (um, two) thing it has gone for it. When it is out of the way, it is all the way down. <br /> <br /> I've heard people say good things about Alex Chandon and I would love to believe them, but on this evidence I'm not likely to. If you want a decent tribute to Amicus, avoid this and go to the League of Gentlemen Christmas special instead. <br /> <br /> Currently, it is battling with Blair Witch 2: Shadows Book for the title of worst movie I've ever seen.
