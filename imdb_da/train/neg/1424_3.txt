The movie has a good start showing an interesting and strong Shannon Lee and introducing two very simpathetic side characters through the first half. But later something happens, and the sudden Shannon turns into this straight-forward, second-hand bad girl, and the movie is lost in its own context. The second half lacks any kind of charisma and is full of clich√©s, bad plays, a horrible plot and even worse stunt coordination. Not to mention the terrible actors they chose for the Chechen Mafia band. <br /> <br /> "Game of Death 2" was bad and clownified Bruce, but his daughter tops it with even greater embarrassment than double, who played Bruce Lee then. I really think she can do much better than this, and I hope she will participate in better production next time. <br /> <br /> If you are a really hard core actor and don't care about the quality, go ahead and watch this movie. I personally looked at it, but was just as terribly disappointed.
