I went to see "Evening" because of the cast. I had gone to see "Norman's Room" for that reason - the movie that offers Diane Keaton, Leonardo De Caprio and also Meryl Streep - and had loved every minute of it. Same for "The Notebook", even though it was chick-flit small. And my feeling was that everything offered performances by Vanessa Redgrave, Meryl Streep, Patrick Wilson and Glenn Close would be at least as good. Instead, I sometimes found even the biggest players can't overcome trite, simplistic and - on one occasion - really offensive material. <br /> <br /> Now I had no problem with the way the film was structured. I actually enjoy movies that cut back and forth in time to tell a story ... as long as an era illuminates the other and the wise verse. But while Vanessa's character was on her deathbed and reminded of a past event she felt "was a mistake", nickel became, at times, the part that actually shows what the "past mistake" did nothing to clarify the case. In fact, it does make it seem meaningless in the silliest "girl meeting boy, girl becomes boy, girl loses boy" fashion, and in the most incredible, clichéd, wrong main opportunity. <br /> <br /> And from here are spoilers, so remember if you continue reading. <br /> <br /> First of all, Claire Danes was brutally miscast. Not even does she even begin to look like Vanessa Redgrave as a young woman, she has nowhere near the chops when it comes to acting. Don't make me wrong, she can be good in the right role - just not this one. And Patrick Wilson was mistaken, even though he has the actors almost pulling it out. He would have been better suited to the part Hugh Dancy played - the rich confused WASP - and not the object of sexual attraction to everyone. He's a little too WASP-y for that. Hugh Dancy? A note - "I'm tortured full and wait until you find out why." And "why" (I'm a closet in a sexually suppressed world, so I have to drink for excess and fool me for everyone I know) was so offensive to me and the way he died (as you knew he would because that is the only thing that can happen to a bassoon of the fifties) so ridiculous, wrong and mistreated, I almost threw my candy on the screen. <br /> <br /> As for the modern part between Toni Collette and her sister, her fear of commitment, her jealousy of her sister's perfect life, excuse her sister for having made the right choices, pregnancy and her perfect perfect girlfriend (which could actually have been more interesting and meaningful if Patrick Wilson played, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach could have been a more interesting Harris, given his dreamy eyes) - yet all of this was during the 70s and 80s. And in much greater depth. Are we really having to present it again and everything as if it was fresh and momentous? <br /> <br /> And on top of that, Meryl Streep doesn't even appear before the last ten minutes of the film, all in old lady makeup that stores many of her facial expressions. She is still good, but only because she is Meryl, and Meryl can find a way to draw even the craziest dialogue during the strongest makeup. <br /> <br /> So to say so, this movie has all the clichés in the "really meaningful message" movie book and it adds a couple who really didn't have any business that was trotted out again. About two hours long and twisted with "Lifetime Movie-of-the-Week" music that guarantees to rub you raw, it's a complete failure in both "meaningful" and "movie-creating" aspects. I give it "3" only because of Meryl and Vanessa. <br /> <br /> Now, if all you need from your movies is Twadd Le, please put aside my comments on "Evening" and get the time for your life. But if you want a truly meaningful experience served by amazing actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story of life and death and all the errands it brings, "Norman's Room" rents and finds out what really is great.
