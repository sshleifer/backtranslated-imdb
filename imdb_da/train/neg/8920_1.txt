... but it must be the worst A Christmas Carol adaptation of time. And that requires some things, what about the different life-time efforts. Don't make me wrong - I have nothing against Cicely Tyson. I've had her tremendously in other roles (see, for example, at Sipsey in Fried Green Tomatoes). But the manuscript does not give her the opportunity, but to chew nature. And fabric what she does, with all the enthusiasm that Tiny Tim holds with a Christmas goat. <br /> <br /> Give me the classics anytime: Alastair Sim, 1951. With the exception of Scrooged, all the others are just over-the-top efforts to understand the past, present, or future Christmas songs.
