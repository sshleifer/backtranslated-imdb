The film's basic premise is a political cartoon. I assume for those who do not know anything about the reality of the military that this is probably an "emotional" film about gender equality. A recent commentator actually said, "It lets women know they can do everything they want to do." What a claptrap! No one, man or woman can do anything they want to do, and unfortunately Demi Moore "buffer" up to SEAL Hell Week in the early 27 week BUD / S program at a couple of sessions at the local gym and her desire alone to be a SEAL simply won't do that. It's about. 80% dropout rate in what is probably the roughest military training program - it is those who voluntarily choose to escape, cannot compete on a physical level, suffer frequent physical injury during training or cannot handle the psychological harassment. I never came across the thorough, alleged message in this movie. In the real world, Demi will not be the first 24 hours of this hard and persistent physical exercise. Wishing alone will not. Skip this movie as wishful thinking, and rather spend your time reading "The Warrior Elite" by Dick Couch (Crown, New York 2001) for the best description of what is really going on in this training. Call the clock, Demi! <br /> <br />
