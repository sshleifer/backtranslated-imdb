The first movie is pretty good. This one is pretty bad. Recycles a lot of pictures (including opening credits and closing title) from Criminally Insane. The new footage, shot on video, really looks like badly done. Scenes lack proper lighting, the sound is sometimes almost inaudible, there are even video errors like the picture rolling and so on. <br /> <br /> Like all bad followers, it simply repeats the story of the first. Ethel kills everyone who shares her living space, often for reasons that have to do with them when they get in the way of food she wants. At least it is only one extra on the DVD for the first, which also includes the same director's movie Satan's black wedding. Too bad, however, does not include the death nursing films.
