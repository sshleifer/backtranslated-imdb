Wow ... where to start ... picked this up at Big Lots for only $ 2.99. There are three bucks, I will never see again ... ever ... and for what? I'll tell you. An hour and fifteen minutes boring, boring, boring chat and college anxiety that seemed more suited to a lifetime movie than the horror flick announced on the box. (May marketing droids who designed it burn in hell forever). Follow it up with a little bit of cheap gore (not even good doing mind you ...) and a plot twist at the end that comes out of nowhere and makes no sense. Awful, horrible, terrible ... Were there any redeeming qualities? Well on the Joe Bob Briggs scale, there were six breasts involved, but it's hardly worth my long lost three bucks. Without them, this could have been on Sci-Fi for example. Two or three in the morning ... <br /> <br /> Bmoviefreak
