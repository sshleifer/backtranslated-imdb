I'm afraid I have to disagree with the majority. I found Spike Lee's recent bit boring! Although he tried something else, ie. Not just documenting the serial killer's rise and fall, I don't think it worked too well. <br /> <br /> There is really a little too much on - Vinny (John Leguizamo) and Dionna's (Mira Sorvino) relationship, Ritchie's (Adrien Brody) lifestyle and then the local mafia types. The story is good, but ultimately everything you have is 2 or 3 stories. With such a provocative killer, Mr. Lee didn't put more in that side of the movie? > <br /> <br /> However, there are some good points. All scenes with "Son of Sam" killing David Berkowitz look very nice (color saturation etc ...) and the play is pretty good throughout. <br /> <br /> All in all, I felt that the different stories would have worked well alone or otherwise without the killings. It just wasn't strong enough in the end. <br /> <br />
