Robert Carmichael's great ecstasy is bad movie in every way. The script, the tedious pace, the lack of depth in any sign, the meaningless subplot, the terrible play, the unnecessary climax make this all the worst movie I've ever seen. I found nothing pleasant, fun or intellectually stimulating in any way. I imagine the filmmakers thought they were doing something smart and dark with their moody lighting, long-lasting postures and low-pitched classical soundtracks. If so, they completely failed. It just bored me, and I wish I had never seen it. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs.
