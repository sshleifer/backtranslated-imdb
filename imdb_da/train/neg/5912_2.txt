Having enjoyed Mike Myer's past work (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live), my expectations for a 60s mandatory spoof were quite high. It became clear after the first minute that this was an exercise in how to be as puerile and unfunny as possible. I swear after ten minutes. I saw it for a second time to see if I had been unfair for the first time. I turned it off after ten minutes. I find it hard to believe how a twelve year old boy could find fun. The dialogue is an embarrassment, Myers is painful to see (like Heather Graham) and the succession of characters, including Fat Bastard, makes matters even worse. Apart from the mildly funny title and the psychedelic set design, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I personally recommend that you avoid this as the plague, although several of my friends enjoyed it (maybe they were blindfolded at that time).
