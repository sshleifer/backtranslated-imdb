Think of a darker version of one of these kid shows like "Power Rangers" and you have this movie from 1990, "Robot Jox". A movie where you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena and the one who comes out in their country wins. The robots are huge and look slightly better versions of them from the shows, mainly because they are less colorful, so while this movie is not good, it's not too bad to see. There are, as I remember, two robot battles in this one, one ending poorly and the final showdown. There is a plot twist through which a traitor is revealed, but in the end the plot is not something that sticks to you for some time after the picture is finished. The fighting itself looks like giant toys on the rampage, but still a little fun to watch. This movie would also spawn a couple of other movies with similar plot units like the giant robots and the tournament. So it's worth checking out once, but probably no more than that.
