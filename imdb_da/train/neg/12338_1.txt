I saw this movie originally in the theater when I was 10. Even at that age, "humor" was mildly insulting to my teen's intelligence. <br /> <br /> Earlier, every time I wanted to see Ed Begley Jr. or Jeff Goldblum I would cringe and start to feel very uncomfortable and even a little sorry. Until I was reminded of the existence of this movie today, I was unsure why I felt that way. Apparently, I blocked my memory of this movie, but my negative feelings towards two of the perpetrators remained. Apparently, I forgot that I saw this movie, but unknowingly, they made pieces of my soul that had been stolen, not eaten by the creators of this inhuman work. I haven't been brave enough to try to see it as an adult. I imagine, as part of the healing process, that I should probably look at confronting this childhood fear so I can really put it behind me. Some regression therapy and / or hypnosis is also not a bad idea.
