For some strange reason, the film world is driven by fashion. Someone is making a film about a killer shark, then suddenly the world's oceans are flooded with giant squids, killer octopusses and sea monsters from every ilk. A man is pampered by a former boyfriend from hell, so each movie character is stolen by a hellish police officer or a hellish friend of hell or a babysitter from hell. So when a major Hollywood company produces a large budget FX-charged tornado disaster, other film producers on the band are jumping that it is not possible to get the budget removed, they do not stop. TWISTERS NIGHT is a point in point. What struck me about this for television films is that it tries to hide its lack of budget by cutting advertising breaks. Every time a tornado looks, the camara puts on the actors' horrible expression as they scream things like "Oh my gawd it is going this way" and "Run for your life" so the screen falls to black, saving the producers the need to get up the special effects budget. Unfortunately, the NIGHT FOR TWISTERS budget was included to include better players. The molding is by no means bad, but they are unimpressive and lack the ability to carry a film that is character-driven. Where is Josh Hartnett and Elijah Wood when you need them? <br /> <br /> And the last word on this is a TWISTER clone ..... Yes, NOT released a few months before TWISTER, but TWISTER had been hyped for months as the summer blockbuster of 1996 and NOTT has a hasty feeling for what makes me think it was made and released to bind in the hype around TWISTER
