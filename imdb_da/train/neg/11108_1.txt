Where to start? The movie started quite well, but after 30 min. I marked myself and looked at the clock. The fear at the start of the film was good, but then the story went in. It just became stupid and stupid as the time crossed. <br /> <br /> The actors gave an average performance in this movie, but I got a little bored of Vinny Jones's constant scowling in the movie. <br /> <br /> When the movie dragged on and took my word for it, it struck, it just got more and more fetched. <br /> <*** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** Just when I thought the movie couldn't get worse, towards the end of loads if the skeleton looked monsters up just for Eating the dead people who had no meaning at all. It turned out to be a kind of meat culture and the good doors at the end. The ending actually made me laugh, how bad it was. When the lead role is over Vinny Jones, he becomes the new killer. <br /> Finally, this movie made Creep the best horror movie ever made. I gave it 1 star because the female manager did a good job, but even she couldn't save this train wreck from a movie !!
