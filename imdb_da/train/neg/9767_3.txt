I think if you're in the 60s kind of thing then I'm bound to waste about 80 minutes in your life and look at this scanty trainwreck. The sparse grace of this underpinning includes a surprisingly suitable social commentary on the sixties values ​​along with a number of relatively well-known actors caught in early (and embarrassing) footage. It's as if the producers of Laugh-In sat down and decided to write a full-length movie covering all the highest points (and more) of the problems between the infants and the company, so put it in the hands of a few hippies and give them a budget of $ 10,000 to complete it. Hardly a classic, but in its own way, it captures how truly strange the time was, the business's dullness, over-idealism, and uprightness. Clearly not for everyone.
