Burt Reynolds came to a point in his career where he seemed to just go through the movements. He would show up, stick with his friends on film and take home a big paycheck. It did not seem to him that the product he represented was pure crap. No movie epitomized this more than "Stroker Ace", making "Cannonball Run" look like a classic and "Cannonball Run II" look watchable. Save for a couple of running scenes there is absolutely nothing worth seeing here. Even the beautiful Loni Anderson hams it as bad as a stupid blonde, it's embarrassing. <br /> <br /> If the idea of ​​Burt hammered it up with Jim Nabors and dressing like a chicken sounds funny then it's your movie. Otherwise, almost every other movie comedy chooses, and it won't be worse.
