I rented this movie and thought it looked like a wonderfully beautiful piece of history. What I got was a piece of clean waste. This movie was confusing in most spots, chopped in almost every place and terrible in all places. Mira Sorvino's portrayal of a queen playing a young male scholar was, at best, depressing. Ben Kingsley should have been cleared of his knight's case to consider this film himself as one of his projects. Fiona Shaw should definitely stick to playing Petunia Dursley; At least, the Harry Potter movies are more entertaining than this thing they call a game in a movie. <br /> <br /> The camera seems that some college kids took a class in Cinematography 101 and failed miserably. Almost all scenes in the film are carved for some kind of effect; The end result is, of course, the oddest bit of editing I've ever seen. Jay Rodan was almost good as Agis; too bad he had such a bad script to work with. Rachael Stirling gives her the best effort as the almost faithful lady in waiting time. Eventually, I really want Blockbuster Video to give refunds. I'm so glad I didn't use 10 bucks to watch this fiasco in the theater. If they have done this Marivaux game since the 18th century, I get to think about how many people over the years have had their best nap during this work. If I had been there, they would not have heard the game over snoring. Thank you for the modern convenience of DVD players; You can skip the boring or horrible scenes. Guess that means I only saw the beginning and the end!
