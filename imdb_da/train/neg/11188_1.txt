This is really the worst movie I've ever seen. Ever. Period. In fact, I paid Â£ 3.50 to watch this steamy ride of a movie. Incredibly boring, badly acted, gloomy scripts, often incoherent and too many scenes that do not seem to have any relevance to the overall movie (as when Heath Ledger's clergyman is sailed to a wall of a ghost ... what was the meaning of that scene ? Answer a postcard please ...) <br /> <br /> I should have made a medal to hold on to this movie because all the time is maturity. I'd rather take a strong kick to the groin than to sit through this movie again. <br /> <br /> This should be thrown into IMDb's bottom 100. Hopefully my 1/10 vote will help it that way.
