Where to start? OK, don't compare this movie to fight the club for a start - ridiculous. If there was even a patch on the fighting club, the violence, blood, gore, etc. would be much more clear and realistic. Secondly, this movie is not a football factory - so much more real (and Danny Dyer makes Nicholas Nickelby look like an embarrassment). Reasonably enough, the story is quite decent, and the battle scenes are well choreographed - with a decent ending I might add. But the film as a whole is poor, seriously poor. As people have mentioned the accents should not ruin a movie - I disagree - either a simple casting error or lack of effort in the coaching voices caused the film to be annoying all the way through - it was obvious from the scene a certain American / Geordie played the role. Don't make me wrong, nice guy who looks good with a skin head - but no not a football hooligan. I could go on forever with how ridiculous the football scene was - the "fake steward" situation. Also when GSE is going to play United in the north, they go on the train and expect only 3 of them - makes no sense - this is a true organization of mobsters and bullies portrayed in the movie to be some mickey musk cult of approx. 5 people. As for accuracy, West Ham and Milwall haven't played in the last few years they've been in the championship together? Hmm, ten years ok. And I'm sure 'Bother' would be able to just roll into a Milwall company pub. Basically, it is a very bad movie that people will suffer if they have little knowledge of real football and hooliganism. If you actually love football and are fascinated by the underworld of hooliganism, you will simply feel like this movie has offended your intelligence. Ross George
