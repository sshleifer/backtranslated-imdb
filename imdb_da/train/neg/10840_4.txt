I happened to love the show growing up with millions of others. So I voted into this movie, thought if not well it might have been at least a bit dazzling and fun. <br /> <br /> ERROR! I just wonder, at the end of this was Charlie's Angels really so boring? I do not seem to remember it as such. But this movie, as bad as movies of this type can be, bore little resemblance to the excitement of the time period and the show. I saw it all despite the negatives, it was not rigid. But it was very boring, as I did not miss the artists at all, especially the women who played the angels when they really looked like them. The movie was just not that interesting. It tried to make every angel a "character". (An angel is that feisty, one is the "good girl" one is in his husband ....), all characters were portrayed with a great characteristic definition of them and little depth beyond stereotypes. The excitement of the show was lacking and the dialogue was .... dialogue. That's pretty much it. <br /> <br /> Not terrible. Not the worst TV movies. But exceptionally.
