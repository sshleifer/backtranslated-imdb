The good soil follows life as a slave girl and a poor farmer in China. The film is based on the novel by Pearl S. Buck. The story is amazing, but I hated that they decided to cast Anglos in the lead. Walter Connolly is ridiculous as farmer's father. He has such a great American accent, like most of the leading actors I couldn't bear to listen to, talk. It's a pity that Hollywood couldn't get past their racist beliefs to cast Asians in the lead. Taking Anglos and making them look like Chinese is akin to Anglos, who shakes polish on their faces to play African Americans.
