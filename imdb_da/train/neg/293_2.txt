This movie is basically about some girls in a Catholic school who end up in trouble due to putting red dye in one of their schoolmates' shampoos and after being reprimanded for this action they decide to go to Florida for a holiday. On the way, they meet some boys in a local dining room and decide that they will both meet in another place later. The girls end up on a roadside near the forest and stop for a while, and while one of the girls decides to walk around, she sees a murder where the local sheriff herself is involved. She gets scared and runs to tell the others what happened. The other girls decide to take a look with her and two of them are killed by the killer. Then, the two remaining girls are captured by the killer and placed in a local prison cell. Meanwhile, the Deputy Sheriff is aware of the girls, and despite their insistence that the sheriff is the killer, he ignores them both and seems ignorant and everyone else in this movie who just can't put two and two together much less lousy detective work on it. The best part was the rape scene between the killer and one of the girls, where he decides to rape her in his prison cell, and it appears that the girl actually wants to be raped by this man, and the naked breast stage I admit was Good, but before their lips meet, he has other things in mind. This movie reminds me of the low budget thriller "Blood Song" with Frankie Avalon staring in it, the same motif just another character part. It's not a movie worth renting, not even for a low-budget 80s movie, and the end was the worst end I've ever seen in a movie and it left me wanting my money back!
