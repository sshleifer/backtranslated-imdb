Usually I'm not that kind of being scared of horror movies, but this movie is the exception. some how this movie came into my mind !!! It is a very simple movie but at the same time extremely effective, it has a good atmosphere and it leads to some shocking moments, the girls' father coming down the hill is a real standout. Another one was the family photo, I didn't expect it and I jumped out of my seat !!! I would recommend anyone to watch this movie, with the lights out it will stay with you for a long time !!!!!
