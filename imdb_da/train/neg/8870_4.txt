Stefan is an x-con who married Marie five years ago. Their marriage has been stable until Stefan passes by with them, and he offered to do a courier job. Stefan's job is a heroin delivery from Germany to Sweden, which must be easy. <br /> <br /> In Germany, Stefan Elli, a girl from Bosnia, has been sold to a strip club owner. Stefan dislikes what he sees and decides to help Elli out of her misery. Due to the fact that Ellis's father fled to Sweden during the war, Elli now goes with Stefan to Sweden. To cope with the past, Stefan Elli commits to help her find her father, whatever it takes. Finally back in Sweden, the whole situation seems to be more complicated than Stefan has ever thought of. <br /> <br /> This movie does not seem to fit in with the usual class of Swedish films because it has been Americanized a lot. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist make it all average, but the effect makes the film a little too much. See it and do the art for yourself. <br /> <br />
