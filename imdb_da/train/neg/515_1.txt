Oh man, this movie is bad. It flows terribly. The story is about a racing car driver who is in love with himself, and then promotes a chicken fast food chain, and when he does, he doesn't love himself. He tries to get out of the contract and horrible, painfully unfunny gags ensue. Jim Nabors seems to be sleeping, not acting. You will miss such Burt sidekicks as Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed while watching this stink. Loni Anderson's hair is quite scary, which shows that tons of hair spray did not go out in the sixties. Or maybe it was a wig. Talking about, Burts wig was not bad in this movie. His worst "wig day" was in "Smokey and Bandit 2". In any case, this movie is the worst Reynolds car movie, ever ever down there with "Cannonball Run 2". The original "Smokey" and "Cannonball" (and "Hooper", who fortunately had no successor) are good, funny movies. This one is not. Even Ned Beatty, a great actor, stinks. You will long for a Jackie Gleason type villain who is fun to hate. And remember, this is not one of the funny movie bags. It is miserable, clean and simple. Even the exits at the end were tedious and boring, and worst of all, unfunny. And at least I forget that "Stroker Ace" was one of the first heavy nails to seal Burts coffin before his revival years later in "Boogie Nights", another movie that "Deliverance" years earlier shows that The man can act quite well when he has a decent platform to do so.
