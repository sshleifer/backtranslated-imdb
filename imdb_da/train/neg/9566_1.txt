I see a lot of movies. Saw the original wargames years ago and loved it. Computers that are still "a great mystery" to most of us, and the movie was convincing, in its own way. However, this one looks like a low budget Wednesday night special. Overall crap, from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The reason is so weak you won't believe it until you see the movie (which I wouldn't recommend in the first place). I can't point out an actor who actually did a good job in this movie. But hey, with that script I would have been surprised if anyone could do a good job. Lots of clich√© scenes. CGI seems to have been taken out of the '86 version. <br /> <br /> Bah, no, I'm in a bad mood just by writing about this. DO NOT see this movie. <br /> <br /> Life is too short to waste on watching crappy movies.
