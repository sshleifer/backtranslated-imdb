This story had a different angle that fascinated me enough to buy a formerly seen VHS sightseen. It was a mistake. <br /> <br /> In what could have been a very good story - about badly crippled people in a hospital and their different personalities - they quickly became a very profane soap opera with odd signs. /> <br /> We have "Bloss" (William Forsythe) the stereotypical racist white person who says the f word every other sentence and is so despicable that they did not give him a first name in the movie. He is very fun to be around. Then there is "Raymond Hill" (Wesley Snipes), a fast talking womanizer. Snipes must have listened to the fast-paced "hip" arrogant roles because he played in a number of them, as in "white men can't jump." Then there is cute Helen Hunt who plays "Anna" the wonderful caring, loving person who has a fake affair with the leading character in the movie, "Joel Garcia" (Eric Stoltz). <br /> <br /> This is heart-warming, feel-good type of thing. It just makes my heart melt see these nice people. But if you are one of those who love scary characters that are portrayed by sleazy people in this sleazy movie ..... you really like this one! Add in a dose of Hollywood political correction and wherever you go! What more could anyone want?
