After reading the comments on the site, I feel compelled to enter for the first time. It seems that this movie is like Marmite and has split the audience. I have to say that while I agree with movies, it doesn't make sense to be fun (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE), they still need to involve you with the characters. Now that I was completely absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in Lynch's opus, I have to say that I could not give a tour of Mr Green or the other cartonboarders who inhabited this globe. <br /> <br /> Although so many people seem to be trying to say you didn't enjoy yourself because you didn't get it, I had to disagree - I didn't enjoy being bored. I wanted the movie to end and constantly listen to these quotes over and over did not help. Call it wise if you want - I think it's repetitive. <br /> <br /> But my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question - there was no end credit to the print of the movie I saw. Just music over black. Did I look at a dud print or is this evidence of GR's pretentiousness? Or have everyone involved in the movie looked at the hard cut and got their name removed ???
