For movies, this movie felt like one of the post-school specialties, only lower budget and lower everything else. I think it should be an inspirational movie of some sort, but it didn't work for me. as preachy.it has very pale shades of Flash Dance, but so what? There is just no excitement in this movie. The dialogue is constructed and cliched to death. Of course, the whole movie feels like a bad 80's clich√©. trades were less than stellar, though it has a lot to do with what the actors were given (or in this case not) to work with. On top of that are the poor song selections with really bad lyrics. I felt embarrassed by all the actors involved. They are all talented, but you can't tell from this movie. It's just my opinion of course, but I have to give Flying AKA Dream a 1/10
