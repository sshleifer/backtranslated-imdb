Okay, maybe not honestly the worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It made absolutely no sense, there was no plot, no characterization, no action, just nothing. <br /> <br /> Here is what I thought when I first saw May 28, 2003 ** caution, this is a spoiler alert. It is also a lot I complain about how bad the movie is: <br /> <br /> Ok so the movie starts and the characters are introduced, but there is no legend. as far as i knew the protagonist was new to this school, but apparently not. It also turned out that he lived by himself ... then he was a foster child ... then his mother was a furious alcoholic still living with him. Also, all his friends apparently had no parents and lived alone. <br /> <br /> Now we come to a major point, this crazy guy has broken out of the crazy asylum and runs tremendously. Now our main character is obsessed with this guy and focuses on him on what is the case for the movie. I think I must have missed a main character here, there was no reason for the main character to join. Although it is supposed to be why, all his friends who are skeptical like 5 minutes before, suddenly followed him and does what he wants. <br /> <br /> so the movie continues and it gets okay. they run chaos at school, blah blah. But wait a moment ... all of them know that the protagonist is running the "show" here. Wait a moment, doesn't the crazy guy specifically tell the protagonist NOT to do it? It was supposed to be anynomial. ah another important plotelement has been skipped ... the crazy guy should not be insane ... everyone said he was not crazy. But as history continues, he is very clear of his memory. but I thought the news people said he was not ... hm ... now the movie ends. IT WAS THE NEXT? WHAT HELLEN WAS IT? The end did not only answer questions about the protagonist, it did not answer any questions about the crazy guy. Are these people in the same situation? If so, then there are some very basic story lines that do not tend to this. if no then what is supposed to say "you are in two weeks." ?? <br /> <br /> * The end of the case ... * <br /> <br /> That's what I thought then. That's pretty much what I'm still thinking about now. It's 6 months on the line, and if I can get it for free, I might give it a try, but I doubt it. I doubt it a lot.
