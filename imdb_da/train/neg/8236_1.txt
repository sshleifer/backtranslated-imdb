I can't believe it's on DVD. Even less, it was available on my local video store. <br /> <br /> Some argue that this is a good movie, considering that it only had a $ 4000 budget. I find it fun. I would find it very poor, no matter what budget. <br /> <br /> Even more fun, I read the following in another review: "Dramatics aside, if you love horror and you love something along with Duel (1971) updated with a little more history and some beautiful girls thrown in, you will love this movie. "<br /> <br /> What?!? It is a shame to compare the two films. <br /> <br /> I give a "1" because I can't give a "0". I just can't see any way this movie could be entertaining.
