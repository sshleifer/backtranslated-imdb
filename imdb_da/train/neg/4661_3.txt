This movie has Richard Pryor, Rosey Grier and others. It is a curious WW2 movie and serves as a declaration of racism. It is worth seeing to understand that movies reflect how we feel about the issues when they are produced and not about the period they show. This means a 70 movie not a 40 movie (WW2). Still, there are some good action scenes of 7 seven black men led by a white captain trying to catch a lady. The story focuses on the captain learning that these men are soldiers and not just a service company. There is a scene that could be from a civil war film and not a WW2 movie that reflects what the movie is about. The Black Lt. gives a German woman an innocent notch on the cheek, and the white Capt is disturbed. I enjoyed the movie from a curiosity standpoint as the stars and genre were interesting to me.
