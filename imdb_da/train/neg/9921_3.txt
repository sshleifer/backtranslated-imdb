Strummer's hippie past was a revelation, but in general it felt like colliding a wake. Campfire stories work best around the intimacy of a campfire. There were just too many half boring old friends anecdotes and too much filler stock footage. I love The Clash and Joe for not reuniting and selling their songs so far (FU Mick Jones), but this doc left me who wants to ... to relate more. Using campfire storytellers without proper explanation of who tells the anecdote alienates the viewer to some extent. They should have been interviewed alone. Even using Strummer's 'radio DJ voice' it did little to stick the film together. And can anyone explain all the flags flying behind the camp car scenes? After the wonderful "Filth and the Fury" I hoped the temple could deliver. A Joe Strummer doc deserves better.
