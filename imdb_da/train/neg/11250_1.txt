I like the time period, I like the experiment, but seeing a movie that looks like I'm looking at it through a coke bottle gives me a headache. If I played computer games that were unclear and out of focus, I would upgrade my computer. It could be that this was the look that the director was after, but not so it hurt my eyes and you would leave after 10 minutes. If I hadn't brought anyone with me to this movie, I was out there. Although it was a series and not a movie per. Say, Band of Brothers did this. They made it look like WWII footage, with just a touch of grain, but it was still a pleasure to see. Movies need real people, with right sets and right places; Use CGI when appropriate, not for a whole movie.
