When I was a kid in the 50s and 60s, there was something associated with Disney, and it was great. What happened? They are able to get all the actors and actresses they want the best of their time. But somehow Disney manages to turn up despite their abundant resources. <br /> <br /> Disney can afford the best writers, best producers and directors, but still ... they screw things up! This movie is crap. The sad thing is that I suppose Disney in their arrogance doesn't even know when a movie is good or bad. It's only because of the talent of the actors that I can even give it a 3 out of 10.
