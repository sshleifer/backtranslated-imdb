Here is the perfect example of what not to do when you have a good idea. That's the problem, isn't it? The concept is fresh and full of potential, but the manuscript and its execution lack some real substance. It must take you from the start and then draw a little on your feelings, get you interested and invested in the characters. This movie doesn't have what it takes to go and maintain airplanes, and here's why. First, you do not really know much about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to, I think this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here, it is supposed to be about normal people putting a stressful situation. They are not trustworthy in the way they act and interact with. Example: Jeffrey Combs as a policeman over chewing is chewing gum, frowning and looking intense all the time is not the way to go here. I mean, what's that? He looks like he's on the toilet or something. I loved him in the re-animator and the way he played the intense / neurotic, unworthy medical genius was right on the money. But not for this he tries too hard to compensate by looking so intense and on edge, but in a still mild neurotic way it is not natural, I am surprised that he did not shift his jaw during the shooting. The film is basically on life support, it barely has a pulse, and it kept me waiting for something that would never come.
