In fact, I haven't finished the movie. You may have to say that in this case I have no right to review it, especially so negative. But I only do that because I stopped it because I couldn't see more ... I came over halfway, and I only came there by promising me that something good was just around the corner. This movie is so tiring, so missing that I was actually offended. I haven't read many of the other reviews, so I'm not sure there are other gay teenagers who have suffered through it, but I'm gay, and I went through "similar" revelations, daydreams, issues, etc. . There were maybe two moments when I actually felt that this movie could go somewhere where I felt it might have some sense of meaning or relativity, but those hopes were dashed at the moment the next set of cliché-ridden narratives come on. I mean, just look at the quotes on the IMDb page. Unfortunately, you are not able to hear the scary game again and the echo eye fades if you just read the quotes because they are just too painful / ridiculous / stupid to miss. I gave the movie three stars, and all three of these stars go to the filmmaker who did a fantastic job trying to transform Archer's tired "concepts" into something that could be seen. Remind you, I ask he was not the one who decided to include all the long shots of TV close-ups ... another unnecessary cliché already made in movies like Korine's Gummo ... I think it is highly appropriate for this movie to premiere Sundance (only because Archer had connections in the festival through volunteer work he did by the way ...) because Sundance seems to be the only festival where cliché heavy drift as this is still accepted as "arthouse". No, it is not an art house, I am afraid it is quite clear s ** t-house. Don't watch.
