I am generous and give this movie 2 stars. the line of "have you even seen the wizard of oz" was the best part for me! With horrible writing and action as shown in this movie, it is no wonder that many are concerned with worthless television reality shows. Do yourself a favor and get out of the house and hit a royal baseball game you'll be glad you did!
