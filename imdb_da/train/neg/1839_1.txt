I couldn't wait to put this movie in my DVD player when I rented it. So when I started it, I couldn't wait to get it out of my DVD player. In fact, I watched the whole movie. My wife and I kept waiting and waiting for something fun to do, but nothing fun ever does. The cashier read as if it were really fun. The prerequisite for the film sounds good. Ben Stiller is fun. Jack Black is fun. How could this movie miss? Well .... it is missing out! This is the scary "comedy" I've ever seen. No one I've talked to thought it was even a little fun. It's just a really boring movie. Trust me. Avoid it .... AVOID IT !!
