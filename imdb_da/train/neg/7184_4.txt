It wasn't a really good movie. There were many incredible and predictable things that happened during the movie ... but I think most reviewers are missing the point why this movie should be enjoyed by a wide audience. THIS MOVIE WAS THE PRODUCT OF MAGIC JOHNSON! Isn't it enough to inspire us all to check out this movie? A movie produced by a former NBA star doesn't come together every day, you know. Beautifully stupid children in a big house are slashed by a shattering psycho. Each clich√© trotted out for us to moan over. Teen sex. And it was all produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! I can't say enough about this movie! Teen drug use! College hijinx! And it was all produced by MAGIC JOHNSON! Yippeeee!
