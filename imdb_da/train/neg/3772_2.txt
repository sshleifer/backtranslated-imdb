I just watched Dick Tracy and I thought it was terrible. The paintings in the background of the cities so terrible. Also the mob characters looked too strange. Warren Beatty didn't do a terrible job like Dick Tracy, but it was certainly not one of his better performances. Madonna should just stick to singing. Glenne Headly did a great job in this movie. I gave this movie a 2/10 just because of the amazing play by Al Pacino. It was not a high note in his career, but he still did a good job.
