A hint I think can be obtained from the various comments on this thread. <br /> <br /> I was very amazed at the number of people who liked this movie that would make it "mandatory" or "compulsory". <I think it gives us some insight into the reason why this film and the subject matter of it are so polarizing. <br /> <br /> The global warming issue appeals to people who want to force others to "do the right thing". It especially appeals to more "liberal" crooked people because it doesn't have to do with bedroom morality, which is what is usually conservative that will force you to be "good". <br /> <br /> And that's the problem with the movie. Al Gore is a politician. And a very successful one on it. He just can't help attracting those who will force others to do what they want. The political appeal is just too big. <br /> <br /> And there's a scientific issue that can be of great importance, reduced to a political problem that appeals to those in the body politically inclined to force others to "do the right thing". <br /> <br /> Another interesting question is how was the environmental movement hijacked by such people?
