Spinal Tap was fun because if you knew a little about heavy metal, you saw in jokes everywhere. If you know anything about porn, this fake documentary will leave you cold. Everything in it rings false. Spinal Tap was fun because it took a familiar world and pushed it over the top. This movie is certainly not fun because it paints a picture of how porn is made that has no relation to the real world. The action here is uniformly horrible, but it would not be much if the core idea of ​​the film was good. But it is not.
