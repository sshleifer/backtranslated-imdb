Pet Sematary, although a lovely 80's Horror movie, with a lovely director and atmosphere, is a copy of the Italian film ZEDER by Pupi Avati. Obviously, Stephen King has copied almost all the ideas from this director (the movie Zeder was made before the king wrote the book) <br /> <br /> The cat, the earth, everything was copied, it's a case of plagiarism, but that be Stephen Kind a famous American writer, it is quite normal that he can get away with this, it is obviously due to the big difference between this kind of Italian movie without the budget (and, of course, it is of course shit ...) but The original idea, I repeat, is Italian director Avati <br /> <br /> Let the world know
