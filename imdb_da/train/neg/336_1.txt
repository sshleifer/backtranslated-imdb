Why is it that when a star reaches the top of the star chain, does it destroy all the good work of making a bad movie? Burt Reynolds topped and started making horrible Hal Needham car chase flicks. Arnold Schwarzenegger became the hottest property in Hollywood, inviting only spear on himself with the horrible last action hero. And here Eddie Murphy is reminiscent of Trading Places and 48 Hours with this "family" adventure girl, which is an incredibly boring, childish and generally plain horrible misfire, where the chance to see Charlotte Lewis big big tits in a tight blouse is the most appealing aspect of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The story is pure humdrum. It is about social worker Murphy, contacted by mysterious types and told that he is the chosen one. Selected for what I hear, you ask. His job is to rescue a Tibetan boy with mysterious powers from a race of demons who will rule the world. As the greatest demon, the classic actor Charles Dance seems to be embarrassed to be in the movie, but hey, I'm sure he was well paid to sacrifice his talents. Of all Murphy's films, this is easily the worst. I have read some reviews suggesting that it is nice to see Murphy in an atypical role in a non-formal movie, and while both points are true, there is no forgiveness for the movie - yet atypical and non- formula can be - is an absolute burden of waste. <br /> <br />
