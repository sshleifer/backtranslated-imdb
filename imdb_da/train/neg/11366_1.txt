The first (and only) time I saw "Shades" was under a sneak preview. It hadn't even been premiere. I remember that there were some of the directors' staff there, not even remembering who. It was a Belgian movie, we never heard of it, so we were completely neutral, didn't know what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor and he stands miles ahead of the rest. He plays an actor whose star has long stopped rising. He helps to realize a movie in Belgium entitled "Shades". <br /> <br /> As soon as the movie started, we noticed how much swarm there is. Nothing against the occasional sword. But this was far beyond annoying. When Rourke uses the F *** word to express something, it comes naturally. But when a person from the cast uses a non-English speaking F **** or S *** word, it becomes arrogant and aggressive. <br /> <br /> We quickly lost the number of times they used the F and S words. Everyone was just happy to be out of the theater. And we had to vote, but it was hard for us because it was only from 0 to 10 and we were looking for -10.
