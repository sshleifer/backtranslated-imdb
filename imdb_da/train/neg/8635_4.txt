This is certainly not one of Lucio Fulci's better flicks of any kind of imagination. The reason is pretty bad, a millionaire is murdered, and his spirt calls on his daughter to find out who did it. But the biggest problem I have with this (besides knowing who killed him within 10 minutes of watching the movie) wondered why anyone might care about? The father comes out as a really big smoker to everyone he came across (including the daughter he asks to help him), which made it quite difficult for anyone to care for who killed him. But no one really sees a Fulci flick for a good story, it would be like watching a porn for incredible manuscript and acting. Typically, his films try to compensate for this by adding exaggerated scenes of gore, but even that lacks in this movie. If you're looking for a good Fulci flip, check out The Beyond.
