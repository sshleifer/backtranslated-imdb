While this movie certainly holds the stench of a bad movie, it is surprising to see at several levels. First, it is interesting for the old film fans to see the leading role Dean Jagger plays (no relation to Mick). While Jagger later went to a very respectable role as a supporting actor (even attributing Oscar in this category to 12 O'CLOCK HIGH), his performance is truly unique as he actually has a full head (I have never seen him this way before ) and because he was by far the worst actor in the movie. This movie just shows that if an actor can't act in his previous movie, it doesn't mean he can't learn to be a great actor. Another good example of this is Paul Newman, whose first film (THE SILVER CHALICE) is considered one of the worst films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Another reason to watch the movie is the sharp cheesiness of it all. Scripture is bad, the play is bad, and the special effects are bad. For example, when Jagger and a named Cambodian wander through the water, it is obvious that they are really just in place and the background is poorly projected behind them. Plus, when they leave the water, their costumes are 100% dry !!! Terrible continuity and thoughtless bad dialogue abounds throughout the film - so much so that it's hard to imagine why they didn't ask Bela Lugosi or George Zucco to star in the movie - as they were both starred in many grade-z horror movies. In many ways this would be a perfect example of a movie class about how NOT to make a movie. <br /> <br /> So while giving it a 3 is a bit generous, it's fun to laugh and short so it's worth looking for bad movie fans.
