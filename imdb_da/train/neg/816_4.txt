Back in the 1970s, WPIX ran "The Adventures of Superman" every weekday afternoon for quite a few years. Every once in a while we would get a treat as they would foresee next-door images "Superman and Mole Men." I was always looking forward to these days. I saw it recently, I was surprised at how bad it really was. <br /> <br /> It wasn't bad because of the special effects or lack of it. True, George Reeves' Superman costume was pretty bad, the foam padding edges used to make him look more impressive to be clearly visible. And true Mole Men's costumes were even worse. What was supposed to be a fur garment would not have fooled a decade, as the zippers, sleeves, and bad pills fabric tailored to baggy costumes were all painfully obvious. But these were forgiveness. <br /> <br /> What made it bad was the constructed plot units. Occasionally, Superman failed to do anything to keep the situation down. A lynch mob looking for the creatures? Instead of clearing the hysterical crowd or searching for the creatures himself, he is standing around explaining the dangers of the situation to Lois and the PR man. Beings are the corner? Again, he is about to see and talk, but does not hide them until they are shot. Luke Benson, the city's foam doctor, shoots at him? Attempting to kill any reasonable person, but Superman releases the man over and over to cause more trouble. Superman had a few options to sip the problem in the bud, but never even used them. <br /> <br /> It was said that both George Reeves and Phyllis Coates played their characters well, apparently instantly comfortable in the roles. If they had only got a better script to work with.
