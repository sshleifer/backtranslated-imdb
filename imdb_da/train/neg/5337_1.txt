There are so many negative reviews about "Stay away, Joe" in here I just can't stay quiet anymore and let this injustice happen. Here's a page you haven't heard yet. <br /> <br /> Elvis Presley's movie is my guilty pleasure for a simple reason: They are perfect movies for pure relaxation because I don't have to think when I see them. That means I don't have to worry about missing a complex plot because there's never a proper plot to begin with. I can just kick my shoes, grab a beer, lean back, turn off my brain and enjoy all the general wackiness and captivating, lightweight rock n 'roll tunes from their roughest decade. <br /> <br /> In my books "Stay away, Joe" certainly falls into "so bad is the good" category. Now, if you are like me and appreciate the "garbage bin", this is the ultimate 1960s camp experience. It's so bad it's almost surreal to see, and when you think it can't get worse, it surprises you in the most imaginative ways. In the end, you are so amazed at all the new levels of stupidity, you just don't know whether to laugh or cry. In a nutshell: I love it because it's so strange to entertain that once was a generation that actually made movies like this. I still give it 1 out of 10 though - when it hits bottom 100 it becomes an instant bad movie classic.
