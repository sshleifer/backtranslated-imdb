I have been an environmentalist for years and really enjoyed this show. I got it to record all episodes because I thought I could really learn some great new things. I probably could, if I could get past Rachelle. <br /> <br /> I am sure that much of this is staged to act as a reality show and appeal to this class of viewer. It doesn't work for anyone who is really interested in improving the planet. <br /> <br /> This show is called Nagging with Rachelle. Since Ed is such a large font of information, perhaps another show that is really serious about the environment would be a good idea. Dumbing things down is not necessary for some of us. <br /> <br /> I no longer record episodes or watch the exhibition, but let me know if a real green show can be in the works.
