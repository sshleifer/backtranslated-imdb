It's not bad, but it's not good. It's just entertaining. <br /> <br /> As a comedy, as it should be, it's horrible. Not many laugh at all, since all joke in the movie has been done a million times before. It's a shame as all the actors in the movie are good, but none of them really do much. and the end sugar.
