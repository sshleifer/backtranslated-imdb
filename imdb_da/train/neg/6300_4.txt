this seemed an odd combination of withnail and i with a room with a view .. sometimes it worked, other times it didn't. Tragedy, however, that they changed the name to the American release though. Hold Apidistra Flying is much better than no title A Happy War. trades were okay, script was okay .. overall it was a mediocre movie ..
