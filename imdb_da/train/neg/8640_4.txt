I saw 3/4 of this movie and wondered why it got such horrible reviews here. It was pretty easy to see (3am). It had a good casting - Kevin Dillon's role as a sociologist serial killer was very credible - he was both charasmatic and chilling. The rest of the main characters were not so bad either. <br /> <br /> This is your typical stalker / suspension movie. A married couple cannot think so that they go to a fertility clinic for help. A sociopathic "genetic material" donor fixes on the recipients and in typical stalker form invades their lives. <br /> <br /> As I said most of the movie was pretty good .. we see "Conan" grow more and more obsessed with raising his baby and creating the perfect family with the mother. Of course, things do not pull for him as he planned. Not a bad plot line. <br /> <br /> But the last 15 minutes were just awful. I'm pretty tolerant of movies (especially 3:00!) .. but I was just amazed at how bad the end was written. I actually scoffed outloud! All in all, not the worst movie I've seen, but I wouldn't be able to get through it again (unless I skipped). The only redeaming quality here was Kevin Dillon's role - one of the best serial killers ever. Try looking around the other channels before you see this. But if nothing better is on, I would give it a try .. =)
