I thought this movie was horrible. I'm Chinese so I thought everything was wrong. Many of the facts were incorrect. The only thing true about Chinese history in the movie was when Wendy's mother explained her husband to statues guarding ShiHuangDi. I also thought the fight scenes were very cheesy and fake. Many of the actors and actors were not very big. Some of the jokes supposedly "funny" were really stupid. I think this movie should have the worst possible rating it could get. Disney has really got more information about Chinese history if they want to create an extravagant movie. Mulan was pretty precise. Watch this movie if you want to waste some time.
