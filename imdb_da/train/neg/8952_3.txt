After hearing about George Orwell's prophetic masterpiece for my entire life, I'm now 37, but I've never read the book, I'm totally confused with what I've just seen. <br /> <br /> I am very familiar with the concepts covered by the novel that I am sure most are but only through hearsay and quotes. Without this limited knowledge, this movie would have been a complete mystery, and even with that, I'm still no longer educated about the history of 1984 than I was before I saw it. <br /> <br /> On the plus side. .. <br /> <br /> The camera is amazing, Hurt & Burton delivers great performances, and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully gloomy and desolate. The prostitute scene was a fantastic dark piece of film making. <br /> <br /> Now for the lower sides and there are plenty ... <br /> <br /> There is a war going on at least as far as the propaganda is concerned, but why & with whom? Nothing is explained. There are a few names bandied about (Eurasia, etc.), but they mean nothing without explanation. Who is Winston? what is he doing? where does he come from? where does he work? why does he change news reports? Why is he not on the front line? Why doesn't he eat food in the canteen? What does he drink in the whole movie? Why is he so weak and sick? Why isn't he brainwashed like the rest of them? What is the deal with her mother and sister? What happened to his father? A little back story would have been nice, no scrub that is crucial to those like myself who haven't read the book. Without it, it's just a confusing and difficult to follow art house film that constantly keeps you guessing what is actually going on. <br /> <br /> The audio track was dis-jointed and poorly edited and constantly chatting from the Big Brother screen swamps the dialogue into places that make it even harder to find out what's going on. I accept that this may have been an artistic choice but it is very annoying all the same. <br /> <br /> I also know that this has been mentioned before, but why is it all nudity? It just seemed completely free and felt it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of plot coverage. I personally cannot observe the way Hollywood feels it has to explain the story lines word by word these days. We are not all brainwashed simpletons, but it is a few steps by far the other way. I can only imagine that it is entirely dependent on the fact that you have read the book, because if this film is really the "literal translation" that I have seen many people say, I would find it very difficult to understand why 1984 was hailed as the classic it is. There is no denial that it was light years ahead of that time and has largely predicted any change in our society to date (perhaps this has been a kind of bible to powers that is?), But many sci-fi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in history. <br /> <br /> I think I should do what I should have done from the beginning and buy a copy of the book if I have any reason to do so. <br /> <br /> All in all, very disappointed with something I've been waiting for years to see.
