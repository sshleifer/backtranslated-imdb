What was an exciting and rather original series of Fox, has broken down to meandering tripe. In the first season, Dark Angel was on my weekly "must see" list and not just because of Jessica Alba. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the powers that were over at Fox decided to "fine-tune" the plotline. Within 3 episodes of the seasonal opener, they had completely lost me as a seer (not even seeing Jessica Alba!). I found the new characters added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish. The new plotlines stretch the continuity and credibility of the show too thin. On one of the episodes of the second season, they even had Max sleeping and dreaming - where the first season said she couldn't sleep biologically. <br /> <br /> History of History (the one Hollywood never gets): If it works, don't turn it over! <br /> <br /> azjazz
