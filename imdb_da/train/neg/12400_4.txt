Matt Cordell is back from the dead to a third round, although I'm not sure anyone cared at this time except the rabid MANICA COP fans. Cordell, who died in the last flick, re-emerges through voodoo, and is now warm on the trail of several miscreants involved in shooting a co-worker Cordell is delighted. I missed part of this early 90's low budget quickie, but it was gratifying to see that Cordell popped up the body in various, gruesome ways. The problem is that the overall movie is quite static, and Cordell is simply not Jason or Freddy. The interest rate drops pretty quickly, even with the great b-movie master Robert Forster as a doctor who ends up with his brains encrypted. Stick with the first movie in the series, which is fun and scary and exciting, all at the same time.
