I've seen most, if not all, of the Laurel & Hardy classic movies. I've always enjoyed it comically stupid, even after seeing it again and again. This new movie tries to bring the classic back with two new actors, similar to both Laurel & Hardy, but fail for various reasons. One of them is how their clothes are out of place (still early 20th century), but both are depicted in the 90's. Some of the previous dialogue was brought back, but it also fails to get close to the classic series. This movie may well be the worst movie I've ever seen and must be pulled off the shelf and locked away forever. The real Laurel & Hardy surely spins in their graves at such a poor imitation.
