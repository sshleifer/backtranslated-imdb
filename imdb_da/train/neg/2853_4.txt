Vic (Richard Dreyfuss) is a mob boss who leaves a mental institution back to his world of gangster. How can a director have a cast with Richard Dreyfuss, Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Diane Lane (very pretty), Gabriel Byrne, Gregory Hines, Kyle MacLachlan, Burt Reynolds, Billy Idol and such a waste of time? This movie is a comedy that is not fun, has a constellation in the casting. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Prazer em Matar-te!' (Pleasure to kill you!) <br /> <br />
