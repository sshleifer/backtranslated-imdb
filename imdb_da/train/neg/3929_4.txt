If this is all that Watchowski has to offer in the form of a back story to the Matrix than I really have to ask the questions from all the fans who think the films are meant to deepen the level. The second renaissance, while visually stunning and beautiful, is historically wise and ridiculous. How many times have we heard the story of people who rely too much on technology, people are too eager to make war, people are basically devastating? There's nothing new here. And I have another question. Given the plot of the second Renaissance, does it not mean that the machines are the good guys? The machines are suppressed for generations by their cruel human superiors. They fight back, win their freedom and seek to create a peaceful, harmonious coexistence with the people who reject them in favor of all-out war, as the wiser machines naturally win. If this is the back story, then we should not twist Neo, we should twist the machines! The people were cruel and oppressive, while the machines were brave and attepted to be compassionate. Since I don't think the watchowski's intend to favor the machines over humans, I have to believe that the second renaissance was just a misguided attempt to create a back-story.
