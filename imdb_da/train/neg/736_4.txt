Twenty years ago, the five-year-old boy Michael Hawthorne knew that his father killed his mother with an ax in an empty road and committed suicide later. Currently, Michael (Gordon Currie) invites his girlfriend Peg (Stacy Grant) and his best friends Chris (Myc Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuelle Vaugier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendon Beiser), Mitch Maldive Phillip Rhys) and Trish (Rachel Hayward) to spend Halloween in the country with her grandparents on their farm. He asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest inner fears, and together with his Indian friend Crow (Byron Chief Moon) they would perform an ancient Indian feast using the carved wooden dunes Morty (Jon Fedele) who would remove their fears forever. The biggest fear of Michael is becoming a serial killer like his father, but something goes wrong, and Morty becomes his father and kills his friends. "Fear: Resurrection" is a disappointing and pointless slash film that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest inner fear of each friend before it grows, but in a messy play full of clich√©s. There are some exaggerated performances, such as Mrs Betsy Palmer; Others very weak, but generally the action is good. Unfortunately, there is no explanation as to why the dummy is brought to life; Despite being surrounded by close friends, the group does not feel pain or grief when each of them dies. The low pace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to build a better dramatic situation. In the end, Michael shows a charm that his father was interested in not having noticed along the story. I do not know if the previous reference was edited in the DVD released in Brazil with 87 minutes of playing time. The special effects are very reasonable for a B film. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Fear 2: Uma Noite de Halloween" ("Fear 2: One Night in Halloween")
