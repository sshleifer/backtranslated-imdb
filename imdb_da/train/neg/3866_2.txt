I thought this movie had absolutely no morals. I mean, how would you feel if your fianc√© left you on your wedding day for your cousin ??? I would be heartbeat !! It's classified as a comedy, but I didn't find it fun at all. I thought it just mostly found cheap laughs and took them. I usually love Julie Stiles movie, but that's an exception. Jason Lee stars in another shameful show that once again shows that class and decent morals are not relevant in today's society. It had a complete lack of flavor and I despise movies like this. I understand that people will defend this movie and that is morality because it is 'just a movie' but I still stand by my mark that this bad behavior should not be allowed on the screen. I am not trying to say that if you have had this movie, you are a bad person, as everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and parts of this movie were fun, I just say that in reality people seem like the characters in this movie made is shameful.
