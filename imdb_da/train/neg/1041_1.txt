How many more of the fake "slice of life" movies should be made? Hopefully not too many. Raising Victor Vargas is a very self-conscious attempt by director Peter Solett to gain Hollywood attention. Nothing wrong with that in general. What is particularly wrong with this movie is that it ignores the audience and piles on all the cliches in the book of presumably "edgy" Hollywood independent production. It should be "real" so the left chess camera "documentary style" unless no documentary would intentionally shake the camera ... <br /> <br /> It's "edgy" so let's not waste any time highlight the film. <br /> <br /> It's "hip," let's get the kids to swear words like Al Pacino in Scarface ... <br /> <br /> And so on and so forth. All you are left with is a very self-conscious attempt to impress Hollywood, who will not impress anyone outside the "rare" indie crowd who still seems to raise recognition on any bad movie.
