MAJOR LEAGUE: BACK TO MEMORIES (1998) ½ * <br /> <br /> Actors: Scott Bakula, Eric Bruskotter, Corbin Bernsen, Dennis Haysbert, Jensen Daggett, Posted and directed by John Warren 100 minutes Rating PG-13 for languages and some violence <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, in the new John Warren comedy "MAJOR LEAGUE: BACK TO MEMORIES" there is a fun scene. It consists of an order in which a troubled trainer throws a baseball hard into the wall behind him to make it hit the cement and jump back and crush him in the face. It's not much, but with the exception of a few lines it's all this movie has to offer ... probably said. <br /> <br /> This film is not only structurally impaired, characteristically undeveloped, predictable and poorly written, but also just bad. Even non-critical audience members will hate this movie with everything they got. It's so familiar that it's just not fun. <br /> <br /> How many times should the same movie about sports be made? Last year we saw the same material in "Air Bud: Golden Receiver" and just as bad as the movie was, it's even worse. At least "Air Bud" was family oriented. "Major League Back to the Minors" is too vulgar for a healthy family to look together on a Sunday afternoon. It's too childish for adults. So who is this movie for? Teenagers? Older? People who are so desperate for entertainment will they rent something like this? <br /> <br /> The movie, like many others like this one, has a basic point it is trying to do: Teamwork conquers everyone. Yes it does and what a good morale to try to prove. Too bad we have already seen and exempted it so many times over and over has so little talent and intelligence that their cheerleaders are men in a ballerina costumes. Where the stupid publishers form their own "buddy comedy routine" a liners mumbles to itself as "they suck". "This kids fast ball is timed with an hour's glass" "This guy dropped out of the ball for a while to find something he lost - maybe it was his mind," "someone needs a nap," and "ever see a sunset as beautiful as the game ". Where the signs are so important to each other, we never know them by name. And where the only cordial lecture scene on teamwork is so ignorant that it's almost fun. "Major League Back to Minors" is so bad; It locks its trite end right in the middle of a good closing order. The good baseball team is on a comeback, they are winning and - the power goes out. I thought for a moment that this piece of waste had come to a conclusion, but in reality the fake end scene only exists to add minutes to the running time. The film basically consists of a number of unrelated sketches that throw in so many boring jokes that it's not fun. There is another kind of fun dialogue that has a coach and a player talking to each other about why a long-lasting outfielder is no longer wanted in that position. The coach answers: "You are too old, too slow and too fat." The player's reaction is to die for. But that scene certainly doesn't make this movie remarkable of your time, and it's certainly not worth a cent of your money. <br /> <br /> So here is another horrible entrée in this genre of movie, another one who is condemned with his own script, which fails before it is seen, and another so familiar, it seems like you vu again. <br /> <br />
