Did anyone else fail like I did? The first hour or so was pretty solid, but the last one. Oh God. It looked like it was predictable and cheesy. Not grandiose and epic as the whole of the show has been. Most reviews have read been glowing, but I really can't understand why. I had seriously predicted the general end way earlier, but then pulled it back because I thought "No, they would never do it, it is far too paralyzed." I almost can't keep it. I feel so unhappy. I think I'm about to leave the door to sell every season I own. Someone like. Change opinion. I will love this. So bad. Someone tells me why I'm wrong. Amazing show. Terrible end.
