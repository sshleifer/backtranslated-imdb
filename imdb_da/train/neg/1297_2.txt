I basically picked up this movie because I had seen Kitano Takashi's brilliant remake of Zatoichi and was in the mood for another updated samurai story, also starring Asano Tadanobu. These two films are worlds apart. Zatoichi added humor and depth to his characters and subjugated traditional samurai movie clich√©s. Gojoe goes out of the deep end in the other direction. <br /> <br /> First, I hate movies that have other characters, inform the audience about what the protagonist is like and instead of getting the character to evolve during the movie. "You can't decide whether you're a monk or a warrior" says almost all the signs in Benkei's presence, but this inner turmoil is hardly transmitted within the character itself. Instead of character development, we get inflated, boring, spawn combat scenes. Asano character is undeveloped, and even he looks as if he is bored and does not know what he is doing there. I know he usually looks distant and tough, and that's part of Asano's appeal, but this movie doesn't serve him. <br /> <br /> Much of the camera movement is nausea. There is a scene going on forever, where the camera revolves around the main characters until my wife and I felt like vomiting. The ending is ridiculous and quite anti-climatic. It is far too bad that really good samurai movies are not made in Japan today with this type of budget. Colors, scenery and costumes were great, but the rest is just a loooong waste of time. I'd rather see one of the kabuki versions of this myth.
