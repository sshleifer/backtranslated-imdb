Let me first say that I am not a Dukes fan, but after this movie, the series looks like law and order. The worst was the cast of Roscoe and Boss Hogg. Burt Reynolds is not Boss Hogg, and even worse was M.C. Gainey as Roscoe, if they ever looked at the show, Roscoe was not a tough ass player. He was more of a Barney Fife than the role he played in this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with the usual mistakes, cars are torn up and continues as nothing happened. The worst example of this is when the general comes along with Billy Prickett, and the general runs into a dirt garden that obviously slows down to a near stop but continues to win the race.
