Wow ... what would you do with $ 33m? Let me give you a choice; You can either a) tear it down and rinse it down the toilet or b) make a movie based on the premise of Whoopi Goldberg as a futuristic politician with a rubber doosurist using terms like "I didn't wear the trumpet" and blowing raspberries on that that this is fun. That's right, you would choose the option that has more profit - flush down the toilet. <br /> <br /> This should be seen as believed. I can't even find the words to describe how bad this movie is. It doesn't even fit in the "so bad - it's good" category. I actually have it on the television that I write - and while I was watching, I felt the need to get into IMDb and record my disgust. <br /> <br /> Given Jurassic Park, a few years earlier, how on earth did they think the audience would tolerate a man dressed in a rubber boot any longer? WG should simply go and confuse the consequences. All concerned will go to hell for this criminal waste of money. I have to stop writing - I'm about to implode.
