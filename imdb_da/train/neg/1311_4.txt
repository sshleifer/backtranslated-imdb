Jerry Spies Tom listens to a creepy story on the radio and seizes the opportunity to scare his nemesis. <br /> <br /> I didn't find this episode so funny: humor seemed rather limited and the whole structure was good lame (Jerry is essentially the "bad guy" in this one and plagues poor Tom for no particular reason). There is occasional flash inspiration (like Tom's literal 'heart in the mouth' experience, and the moment when his nine's life is sucked out of his body), but on the whole, this effort lacks the frenetic pacing, excellent animation and purity of most of T & J's other cartoons.
