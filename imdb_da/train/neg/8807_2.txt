I chose "Dead Beings" because I thought it was a zombie movie like "28 days" or so ... but not at all. It's not even a horror movie. Nothing happens except for a group of women who apparently have been infected by a strange virus that causes her to eat human flesh to survive. <br /> <br /> This plot gives rise to a series of scary scenes of cannibalism ... Very very bad movie. <br /> <br /> * Min rate: 2/10 <br /> <br /> ------------------ <br /> <br /> - -------------- ---
