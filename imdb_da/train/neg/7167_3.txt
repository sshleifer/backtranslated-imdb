Saw a trailer for this on another video and decided to rent when it came out. Boy, was I disappointed! The story is extremely boring, the actor (except Christopher Walken) is bad, and I couldn't care less about the characters, except to really see that Nora's husband was melting. Christopher Walken's role is such a throw away, what a tease!
