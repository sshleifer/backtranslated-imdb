I found myself very caught in this movie, at least in the beginning, and any credit I give to this movie is Lacey Chabert, she was awesome !! But that's where it ends. I seem to be very good at finding out who the killer is, and I like it when a movie is able to completely pamper me, but I felt out and about lying to them all the time leading you in one direction and then suddenly they decided to go in a completely different direction at the end, they did not give anything at all, it was not misleading for the very poor writing and planning, someone didn't even believe! <br /> <br /> I felt the movie would have been much better if they had stuck to the plot that leads you, they also didn't seem to answer anything, why Jane (Maria) burned the professor's house. It's a big shame as I felt it started out as a pretty good movie.
