'Maladolescenza' has the air of a dark adventure with its child's protagonists, forest setting and discovery of the castle ruins. Nevertheless, the film is essentially an unusually psychosocial study of young people. Opening with a dream sequence using the not so subtle metaphor of Fabrizio wrestling with his threatening dog, the film describes his psychological persecution of Laura, the girl who has promised his love for him, and his possible romance with the equally vicious Sylvia . The film's psychological complexity gives the film's merit, but there is no doubt how much the film is unnecessarily exploited in its depiction of nudity and sex. The film's appearance is more dependent on its beautiful places instead of particular cinematographic skill, and there is no doubt that the film's greatest asset is the eerie, children's reinforced soundtrack. With its peculiar dream-like quality, the film is at best interesting but fades alongside Louis Malles' surreal and brilliant 'Black Moon' from the same era. Admittedly, the art-versus pornography debate deserves, because unlike many banned movies, for example. Pasolin's 'Salo' or Larry Clark's 'Ken Park', the film is quite unremarkable from an artistic perspective. Cinema seems to be gradually losing its ability to shock, so perhaps 'Maladolescenza' should be admired to preserve the power thirty years after its release. But shocking is the only reason that the film is memorable. <br /> <br /> The film has its defenders. Yet it also makes Nazism.
