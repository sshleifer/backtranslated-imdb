I can hardly find the words to express how terribly this movie is. I was sold on the promise of action with Segal and stealth aircraft, which usually make an entertaining action movie. I can honestly say I would rather hurry my eyes with a cocktail stick than to watch this movie again. The action was so horrible that it was almost fun. The story was crazy weak, with plot holes so huge wide you could fly an F117 through them. The script was so bad, if I found out that a 10 year old wrote it, I shouldn't be least surprised. Direction and production is so amateur, I would not even hire these people to shoot my worst enemies wedding video. Utter Utter drivel. Those responsible for making this movie have the ticket picture and they must be ashamed of themselves. Steven Segal would never ever show his face publicly again, I can't imagine what made him agree to star in this, the worst movie I've ever seen in my life.
