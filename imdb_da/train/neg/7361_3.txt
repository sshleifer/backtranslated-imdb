Sir. Perlman provides a standout performance (as usual). Unfortunately, he has to fight with a signed script and some obscene pieces. <br /> <br /> Larsen is in "Die Hard" mode complete with singlet and belly muscles; The lovely Erika is very decorative (although it is fully dressed!) And shows some signs of "coming" eventually. <br /> <br /> SFX is primarily poor CGI and steals from other movies. Shootouts are pitiful - worthy of the A Team <br /> <br /> Not even worth seeing Perlman - AVOID
