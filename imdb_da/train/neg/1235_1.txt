I was really looking forward to seeing the Apes Planet, but it was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> The settings and masks are good, but that is the only good aspect of the movie. All other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg doesn't work, he's just in the movie and looks stupid. The other actors are not very good either. <br /> <br /> But the worst point of all is the story. It's totally ridiculous! For example: the monkeys lie unnoticed on the ground, but humans do not attack them, no, they wait until they are up again! This is just an example of the stupid story, but it would take too long to tell them all.
