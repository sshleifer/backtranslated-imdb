How cynical are the authors that pans looked. I can be a US citizen, but I don't have to see other Americans pat each other on the back for an hour and a half to enjoy a movie. I am surprised that so few have commented on how completely the jingoist, sentimental and tired dialogue in this movie really is. The movie's historical incorrect is not as rough and offensive as in "U-571" (which changes British underwater vessels to US), but you still go away and feel a little slimy. In fact, the Germans in this movie do nothing but admire the Americans between battle scenes! How sad, unnecessary! I just want to say to the authors: It is obvious to many of us that you cannot catch real people with real problems under real pressure and that you have taken some very proven shortcuts. Lucky for you there will always be nationalist emergency jobs to appreciate your sugar-coated pulp.
