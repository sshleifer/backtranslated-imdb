Randolph Scott leaves the United States for the greener pastures in Canada's British Columbia. He wants to start a cattle ranch together with partner Bill Williams and cook Lee Tung Foo. They stamped their little crew over a customs bridge built by Victor Jory. Later, Jory shakes their cattle, and Williams loses his left arm during the fracture. From 1945 to 1962, when he retired, Randolph Scott made a series of good-grown westerners, some of whom were considered real classics. Unfortunately, the Cariboo Trail will never be listed among its best westerns. <br /> <br /> It's more like the material Roy Rogers or Gene Autry might use. The story is even stupid at times. Williams, who was on the trip with Scott, wanted to go for gold, as there was a big strike at that time. He does not blame rustlers, he accuses Scott of convincing him to make the trip to his arm's loss. <br /> <br /> There is also a scene in the movie when Scott, Lee Tung Foo and Gabby Hayes are trapped by the Indians. They escape because Gabby's mule has been taught to kick on command, and he kicks off at the Indians so our heroes can escape. I'm not sure it would have played in a Rogers movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, history will actually have you believe that tyroprospector Randolph Scott accidentally stumbles on a gold strike after just a few lessons from prospect Gabby Hayes on how to find gold. <br /> <br /> This was Gabby Hayes farewell film part. It would have been better if he had gone into a good western, and he had actually done a couple better with Randolph Scott before this. <br /> <br /> I would say this, though no Caribou made any appearance in the movie, this is one of the few Canadian local films from the past that had no Mounties. <br /> <br /> But if I were you unless you're a big fan of Randolph Scott or Gabby Hayes, take the next detour out of the Cariboo Trail.
