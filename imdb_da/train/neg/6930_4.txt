Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon is about a journalist traveling for an insane asylum to write about a new technique they use with their patients. However, the journalist quickly finds out that things are not what they seem to be, and the asylum is driven by the patients, and the doctors are caged. First of all, some parts of the movie are simply boring and just make you fall asleep, and the interesting parts are interesting for all the wrong reasons (A guy who thinks he is a chicken, for example). I have to admit that the story is actually pretty good, but the movie itself bombs. The music in the movie is really strange and like something you would hear in some crazy comedies, and yes, there is a scene of dancing chicken men, which pretty much made me want to close the screen. Watch this movie at your own risk! <br /> <br /> Rating: R for violence and nudity.
