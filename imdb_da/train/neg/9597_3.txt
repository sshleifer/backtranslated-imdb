As much as I like Japanese movies, it didn't just hit it ... A movie about rebels and the survival of a royal bloodline turned out to be a very slow movie with a questionable plot. <photography is ok, although I have seen much better sword fighting scenes in other Japanese movies, convinced the fast cameras and the way they followed the characters to me at all. The soundtrack is so weak that you do not even notice its presence. But worst of all was the way the plot evolved. I have to admit that I sometimes had difficulty understanding who was who and what was going on. . Still, the platonic love between the protagonist and another was completely unnecessary and seemed to come from a Hollywood influence. All in all, if you're looking for an action Japanese movie, it's not like that. It is very slow, with very few sword fighting scenes and very sentimental ... in a bad way ...
