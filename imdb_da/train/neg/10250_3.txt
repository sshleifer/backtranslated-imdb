Dull, inexpensive sci-fi thriller, made with almost complete lack of conviction (a control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and decipher outer space messages, is run by only one man and is much poorly guarded at night) and full of campy sound effects. Christopher Lee is not only wasted, but he also gives one of his few "I am here strictly for the money" performances. (* 1/2)
