No, I have never seen any of the "Santa Slasher" series, ie "Silent Night, Deadly Night", the original "Black Christmas" or this "Christmas Evil". I heard everything about their reputation, or MADS (Mothers Against Deranged Santas.) I thought I would hire this as I heard it pop up as a reference to a 'Fat Guys At the Movies' segment. /> Mothers should be against this, but not for ooooohhhh "killer" Santa, but for this movie was just plain crap. Boring, long ?? even in just 92 minutes, crap. Little boy sees Santa come down a chimney in 1947, delivers gifts, eats some treats and miraculously, flows up the chimney. Boy goes to bed, but returns to the living room to witness Mommy and Santa (kind) to get it on. Apparently, it struck this child up for the rest of his life, even though the scene was as steamy as when Ralphie's father got "Leg Lamp" in "A Christmas Morning." He was so disturbed, he went to the attic and cut his own hand well. <br /> <br /> Fast forward to the future! Now it is 1980 and spoiled boy is working in a toy factory. We make him a little free and he stalks both children and parents. Who's cool, who's nice, blah blah. Does it take a good two-thirds of the movie to make him finally catch up? as if it is not foreshadowed from the frame one. No movie should take so long. I will admit this movie had its excitement, but only because I kept expecting him to do something, something for someone. When he finally does well, penalize "who's naughty", it's as graphic as a "Garbage Pail Kid" card. And I haven't mentioned the WTF end. I think it was a metaphor, but in reality it is as strange as the rest of the movie. (Take the brother who is sorry that his siblings are killing and his solution is otherwise, kills.) Do not open this mess, even on Christmas Eve or evil. Again I didn't look at the other "Santa Slashers", but one sucked badly. It built excitement because of the nature of the movie and has never once delivered a decent gift.
