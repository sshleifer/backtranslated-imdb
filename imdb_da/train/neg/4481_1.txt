I was skeptical when I first saw Calvin Kline-esque commercials, but thought I'd give it a try. So I've seen it and all I can say is bleh. This movie was so bad. It is rare that I hate a movie so much. Seeing this flick reminded me of the fun scenes in Altman's "The Player" when the authors put their bizarre ideas to the producers. I would like to know which MTV producer decided that one and a half hours of music video adaptation of Bronte (but this time Heathcliff is called Heath and he is a rock star and Hindley's name is Hendrix) would be a good idea. /> Even though it couldn't have been so bad, they didn't get any other aspect of the movie so horribly wrong too. The direction must have been "you are lonely, pout for me." I laughed loudly at all the "serious" scenes and bored everywhere. The camera's work was squeezed and repeatedly reminded me that I saw a bad movie that was trying to be edgy. My theory is that the sound guy bored and went down to the beach for a few beers with his boom - all I could hear in half of the scenes were the waves. And in the other scenes I want it to be all I could hear. And what they did to the sisters of Mercy song "More" is completely inexplicable, so again it is unthinkable what they did to Bronte. <br /> <br /> On the bright side, there was an entertaining scene - specifically the moment Johnny Whitworth struck Katherine Heigl's face - and if you could tell me what this scene had to do with the rest of the story, more power for you.
