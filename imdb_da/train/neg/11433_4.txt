The first half of this movie is a pure joy. Novel. Fun. Wonderful performances. A close knit brother and sister who lives in Manhattan falls for the same woman! Adult. Bright. Witty. What more can you ask. As a romantic comedy, it begins refreshingly. It leads into unexplored territory. And then it falls apart. <br /> <br /> It goes from being a universal adult comedy to an upcoming out-of-the-closet story that's been done many times before. What a disappointment. As a folk film, it begins with such a promise. Why is it necessary to become such a pedestrian "I'm who I am" movie. Frostram ends shot by Heather Graham's jump in the air to celebrate "her happiness in finding herself" emphasizing the banality of the final part of the film. <br /> <br /> It could have been different. It could have been magical. It ended up being the same old same old one.
