Some people don't like the animation. Personally, I think the animation was quite remarkable when this film was made. There are many older cartoons that I just love. My problems with this movie are not the animation, but pretty much the way it was built. The signs are all just ... good, greasy. And for this movie, they shouldn't be. Apparently everyone in LOTR has a limping problem (for starters.) Just as they acted generally annoyed me. My two sisters and I laughed most of this movie. I think if many people had seen this before they saw the newer, they would not have gone. I'm glad I rented this and didn't buy it. There are few movies that give me headaches. This was one of them. But it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, even though it's placed up there. Or over there, depending on your point of view.
