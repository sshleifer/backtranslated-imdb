Seeing "Der Himmel über Berlin" as a teen in the late 80's was a deep experience for me - "so that was what the movies could be". Along with "Paris, Texas" and "Totden of the World" it is still a special place in my heart and mind - a testament to the Wim Wender's genius. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, recent years have seen a steady decline in the quality of his work with the "Million Dollar Hotel" and "Land of Plenty" hit a terribly low point. Gone are the captivating pictures or music. No search or display of great insight. All that remains is signs and thin blurred political statements that only boil down to clichés, and frankly disprove the intelligence of a mature audience. Has the well run dry? Whatever the reason, it's time for Mr. Wenders to either step it up or stop altogether.
