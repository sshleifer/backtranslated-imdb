Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn would roll into their graves if they knew this guess. Who comes to dinner Rip Off was actually in theaters. Together with Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton, these four brilliant actors made a great cultural statement with director Stanley Kramer's 1967 masterpiece. This contemporary rip off is a joke. So a white guy from an overly stereotyped Italian family in Rhode Island brings his African American boyfriend home (insert GASP here) to his grandfather's funeral. His family members reactions were of course .... predictable. This movie was so painfully telegraphed from start to finish my boyfriend actually started fake snoring to signal to me that she wanted to leave. Do yourself a favor and rent the original. Take a look at Wake.
