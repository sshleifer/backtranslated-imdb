I think it would be a good movie for a true believer in organized Christian dogma, but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will, rational thinking, separation of church and state, and good science fiction, it's a terrible joke! <br /> There are some well-known actors who either needed work or needed to share their personal beliefs with the rest of us Gentiles. <br /> <br /> I was entertained by this movie just as I was entertained by "Reefer Madness." The film tried to teach drug education of scary tactics in the same way as this film is trying to teach "Christian" principles of threat of hell and misery to otherwise good people who do not share their interpretations of our world. <br /> <br /> It scared me with laughter and at the same time frightened me to realize how many people actually believe our society should return to the good old days of the 19th century!
