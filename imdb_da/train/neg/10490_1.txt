I note that the previous reviewer (who seems to be still in school) gave this movie a very good review, and I can only assume that this is because the reviewer has not seen the much better BBC adaptation of this classic novel in 1989. The big problem I had with this (1999) version was the casting of Anthony Way as Tom Long. Anthony Way was a talented boy tweeter who shot to fame after performing in the TV mini series "The Choir". I can only assume that he was cast to the role of Tom Long because of his excellent performance in "The Choir". Unfortunately, the little boy who appeared in "The Choir" grew into a tall and gigantic youth at the time "Tom's Midnight Garden" was admitted, and Anthony failed to convince as a schoolteacher Tom. It's too far a hint of imagination to think Tom (as played by Anthony) would be friends with the much younger Hatty. In the BBC's 1989 version, Tom and Hatty are much closer to the age, and the development of their friendship is so much more credible. For a movie from 1999, the special effects may not be convincing and not a noticeable improvement on the television effects of 1989. Casting and acting of this version is inferior to the previous adaptation and all in all, the film was a lack of gloss of a true classic. As a final note, I would point out that VHS from the BBC's BBC version download well over £ 20.00 spent while a new DVD of this version can be purchased for under £ 5.00, should I say more?
