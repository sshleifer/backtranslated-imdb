My husband and I were fascinated by the play - a strong willing lady lady with a messy personal life solves crimes for the LAPD. The first season was watching TV for us. Unfortunately, the stories of her personal life in the second season have become so boring and unworthy of the strong character we stopped seeing. <br /> <br /> My husband and I were alarmed by the incident, where she is trying to hide from her mother the fact that she's been driving up. But the deal breaker was the episode where she hides her possible pregnancy from her boyfriend but tells her boss. Why would a strong middle-aged woman do these things? The answer is that she didn't want to. In addition, my husband and I choose the bad guy with almost perfect accuracy. It's almost always a white man or woman introduced to the cameo on the murder scene or in an idealized family. Can the scriptwriters not do something original from time to time? As I mentioned, we are no longer viewers. We prefer showing that do not betray the signs and offend our intelligence.
