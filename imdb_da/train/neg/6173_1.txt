This movie is a blatant attempt on the left in Hollywood to portray Reagan's administration as incompetent and dangling. Some errors may have been made at the time of the crisis, but I am sure not to the extent depicted in this film. My first reaction was that this movie had to be directed by Oliver Stone, but I was wrong this time. There are apparently many others.
