This movie is traditional bollywood fare as far as the star's power, sentimentality and love triangle of emotions. What really bothered me about this movie was the creators' absurd notion of surrogate mother. A whore who discovers a child with someone after having sex with the man (of the family who wants a child) is not a surrogate mother. She is also not a good candidate for a surrogate mother. I've seen Indian movies and TV shows that made 10-15 years ago that dealt with this problem more intelligently. The whole concept of the movie is ridiculous and absolutely incredible. I realize that most bollywood films aren't supposed to be plausible, but they don't pretend to be either. This movie wants us to emote along with the characters, but it cannot be done with such a ridiculous, confronted conflict. I would have expected better from Abbas and Mustan.
