I sincerely consider this movie to be another bad effort for the Dominican Movie Industry. The first 30 minutes of the movie is a little funny, but when they change their role in society (men do what women usually do and women do what men usually do), the movie falls. Being boring and not fun at all. They let many things predict without explanation and the end of the movie. I didn't like the way a Roberto Angel played his character and his little one either. I went to the cinema hall and hoped to see a good job, but I was really disappointed. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie.
