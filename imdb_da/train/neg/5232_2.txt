Becky Harris plays the female shopper whose accident it is to be in the shop at the wrong time, and of course only one purpose of being in this movie is to give a reason to use remote controls! Miss Harris seems to be in the nineties or older when she first comes on stage. When the red cock is finished with her, it becomes clear that this is not AARP queen. If these are not some of the finest assets ever shown on celluloid, I want someone to pick me up. Absolutely amazing in my opinion, and I have literally worn out my VHS copy that captures her charm. I would like to know if this movie is available on DVD. The rest of this movie is really not worth mentioning. I was hoping to see something quite convincing and intelligent, but I was disappointed with both sides. God Bless Becky Harris!
