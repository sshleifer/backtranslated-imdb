I usually read reviews before I see a movie. Guess what I didn't do until I looked at TLB, and I have to say I was very surprised to see the above average rating on IMDb. I found it to have a total lack of history. You just fell into it (and unfortunately not in the way Saving Private Ryan dropped us into the movie) and it also has a sudden end that was very unsatisfactory to me. <br /> <br /> I have to admit the wounded soldiers looked pretty realistic to me, especially with the low budget in mind. But get ready to laugh ... Some guys are thrown through the air after an explosion as if they were Olympic gymnasts. An air circle pots or somersault during WW You are a little too much for me, especially when it is done countless times during the movie ... But the parts that really made me laugh until I almost cried were the scenes containing close combat. Screaming and shouting German voices ... incredibly fun. It seems like they are spoken by a single actor / voice performer because they all sound exactly the same, and it just sounds like a "typical" German voice. I would definitely NOT recommend this movie to anyone except people who just want some laughs because of the sad and corny quality of it.
