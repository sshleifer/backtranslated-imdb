The incredible melting man plays as an extended episode of The Six Million Dollar Man, but with violence and some nudity. I know this movie is a bit crummy, but I found it impossible not to like it. <br /> <br /> The play and script are not the best. But the effects are good for a 30-year film with a budget of $ 50 - the title character takes a while to actually melt, but when he does, it's reasonably impressive; We also have an ingenious scene of electrocution death. Also note is the music, it is insane - a cheese-tastic medley of nonsense. <br /> <br /> Noticeable highlights: <br /> <br /> * Marvel at the slow motion nurse jumping through a glass pane for absolutely no reason. <br /> <br /> * Marveled by a day in a cut off head. <br /> <br /> * Beware of the psychotic cannibalistic melting humanoid. Called Steve. <br /> <br /> * Be amazed when our hero pauses from chasing the melting lunatic to having a bowl of soup and complaining about insufficient crackers in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> This movie is just for the 70s for me to hate it. It's sticky and trashy, but I thought it was very fun. You can do much worse.
