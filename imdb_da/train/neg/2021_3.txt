Ronald Colman won a best actor Oscar for showy performance as a popular scene thespian, who totally loses his roles, especially as Shakespeare's Othello. Critically honored George Cukor movie has a wonderful pedigree written by the estimated team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Rabbit. Unfortunately, the witty villain as the self-conscious comes here, and the backstage business is excessive. Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for his score, and Shelley Winters has a few good moments a hard waitress (when theatrical Colman addresses her, she asks him, "What are you, some kind of nut?"). Otherwise, this scenario is terribly obvious, surprisingly sad and not much fun. * 1/2 from ****
