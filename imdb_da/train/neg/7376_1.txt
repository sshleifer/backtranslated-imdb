Steven what have you done, you've hit a brand new low. It's strange when Stevens' last movie shadow man was led by the same director who did this trash can. Shadow man was good, it was badly bad so bad, it wasn't even fun. Steven is hardly in the movie and feels like he's in a como-look, and when he's in the movie, he's called half the time anyway. As for the action, let's just say that the wizard oz had more action than this garbage, there is hardly any action in the movie, and when it finally emerges, it's boringly depressing badly shot so-called action scenes. Seagal hardly kills anyone as opposed to his over film, where he goes to a man's army, ie. during siege 1 and 2 and finish wounds. The plot is so confusing with so many plot holes that it doesn't make scenes sometimes. refugee rage better be good what a shame i wasted 5 pounds on this garbage 0 out of ten good luck next time
