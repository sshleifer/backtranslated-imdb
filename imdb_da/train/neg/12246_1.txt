*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** If you were to review the movie based on the premise alone, you might think you're looking at an average animal-oriented horror flick. The reason is as follows. A group of documentary film players go out on an island to film a documentary about surfing with sharks or surfing. (I live in South Africa so it was released as "Blood Surf.") It seems to have some interesting idea behind it, as if it were further investigated, could have improved the movie somewhat. However, this is not the case as the blood surfing part of the film is minimal because their documentary film is interrupted by a rather large saltwater crocodile. Scripture is absolutely horrible. A good example of this is that when someone is eaten by the crocodile, which is frequent in this movie, no one seems to be wrong. The most every person did in the movie was to scout the victim in a scene that was supposed to be exciting, but just ended up being ridiculous because the dialogue in this movie was of very dubious character. Another thing that really annoys this movie is that they introduce characters that are completely redundant for the movie itself. They introduce a bunch of pirates who can only be seen as adding another 10 minutes to a merry short film. <br /> <br /> The action can be said to be mediocre. It would probably have been much more impressive if they didn't have such a terrible script to work from. All in all, there is no one who has had a terrible impact on me. Every single person seemed to be a watery caricature, and thus none of these actors made any impact on me. The crocodile itself is said to be huge, over 31 feet exactly and this sense of size is well portrayed by the obvious fake of a crocodile they have given us in the movie. The death of the crocodile at the end of the film is so ridiculously false and constructed that it gets its abdominal cavity. With a great scream of bravado, the film's hero announces that he has a plan that proves to fall down a hill and causes the crocodile to plunder himself on a fortunate tip at the bottom of that hill. <Br /> All in all, I want to say that this movie is one to be seen for you to believe how bad it could be. What probably seemed like a good idea at that time was hit by a horrible script and an overwhelming low budget feeling that all served to create a truly horrible movie.
