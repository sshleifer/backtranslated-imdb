This should be the cheapest movie made in the 21st century. It's all the way low quality, but at the end it falls below ... everything. All the cheap tricks - like flashing and dark - are used to hide the bad computer effects. <br /> <br /> All the actors are below average, especially the main character Anne Fletcher (Simmone Mackinnon). There is a scene where Anne is asked, "Why do you think so careless?" The correct answer is because she can't act. Whatever happens (the world is being destroyed, her friend is dying, she is fired), she has the same stupid grin in her face. It's not just the movie that is B-quality. It is also the back cover description (at least in Finland). The text mentions things like Lorica Gray vessel, Capital wagon and main character Garrison Harper and Anna (not Anne) Fletcher. The description sounds like another movie, both with character called Fletcher and sea monsters
