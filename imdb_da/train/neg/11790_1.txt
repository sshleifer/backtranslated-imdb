Deep SH .. is more like that! The eels are just drawn in over the movie. Think "The Incredible Mr. Limpet" meets "Leviathan". Very sticky. <br /> <br /> No character or relationship development. So-called "romantic" scenes very corny and predictable. An interesting idea, but a poorly written script and LOUSY special effects make this a definite necessity!
