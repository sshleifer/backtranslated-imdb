Amateur at the extreme. Camera work is particularly exceeded - documentary camera operators do not have to spin all the time. <br /> <br /> Scripture is truly inane, and the play is even worse. In addition, the story is incoherent and meandering - with some gaping gaps in the logic. At some point, the management wants to be thrown in jail to rub shoulders with suspected Al-Quada operatives, and thus get an interview with Osama. I found the story quite incredible because of so many mistakes. "Filmmaker" / lead role really depicts a rash, idiot frat boy. The only issue that is really interested is that the filmmakers actually filmed on the spot. It's really a shame they wasted their opportunity to do something interesting. Who funded this crap?
