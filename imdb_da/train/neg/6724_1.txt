When choosing a movie, do I hope a factor you want to consider is the actors in the movie using their fame to influence our society's moral substance in a positive or negative way? This is not a political statement This is a moral problem affecting society. When a comedian / actor curls sexual and racist remarks about a teenager and her father, should we ask ourselves (will I support that behavior)? In this case, tears Mr. Foxx's behavior on the social fabric that teaches our youth from wrong, good behavior from evil, to that loving-kindness is better than hatred. Mr. Foxx must remember that he is only entertainment and there is much out there for us to choose from. To say sorry, don't get him off the hook. It will not unnecessarily hurt or eliminate the bad behavior that he spreads to our youth. One way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it. Look no further what they are a part of. We cannot change them, but we can stop the fame we give them.
