I remember watching this movie back in 86 'when it first came out and what a horrible movie. The action was terrible, the plot was so flimsy, it would or should have blown away in a breath. I think it made me sleep more than an apartment, and I wasn't tired of remembering. Avoid at all costs that you still have all your teeth taken out without anesthesia that would be more entertaining. It's just a shame I couldn't give it a zero or a negative score. I wish I hadn't wasted my money getting this from the video store everything I could say was that the tape it was on was still brand new, almost not surprising when the movie was so bad. If I just remember, I was watching with a girl, I would really go out with & the fact she was sitting next to me was still not enough to keep me awake, it was so bad that this movie was.
