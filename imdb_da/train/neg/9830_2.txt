I'm afraid you will find that the vast majority of people who judge this movie as a 10 are very Christian. I'm not. If you're looking for a Christian movie, I recommend this movie. If you're looking for a good general movie, I'm afraid you'll have to go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed by the signs and their illogical behavior. The premise of the movie is that the teaching of morality without teaching that it was Jesus who is the basis of morality is in itself wrong. A scene shows the protagonist who tells a boy that it is wrong to steal, and then the character goes on and says it was Jesus who taught us this. I find the abusive: must we believe that "you must not steal" came from Jesus? I suppose he wrote the Ten Commandments? And stealing was acceptable before that? I rented the movie from Netflix. I should have realized the nature of the film from the comments. Oh good.
