Steve Martin should stop trying to make classical comedy restorations. He definitely does not fit this part. Like the incredible remake of Out Of Towners, this movie falls flat on the face. How anyone ever thought Steve Martin could even get close to Jack Lemmon's wonderful performance is beyond me, as does this movie. Dan Ackroyd could have played the Bilko part better. Martin is great when he makes his own original characters, but he gently fails to recreate the classical work of others. It is a sad statement when the funniest part of a movie is contained in the first line of credits when the movie is over. The line "Producers gratefully acknowledge the total lack of cooperation from the United States Army" was just about the only line that actually made me laugh. If you want to see the real Bilko, get hold of the original episodes of Phil Silvers Show. It is guaranteed to make you laugh, unlike this mistake that should never have happened. I put this movie in the same category as the aforementioned Lemmon classic and remake of Psycho. None of them should ever have happened.
