Well, no, not really. It's not really a good movie, but it's not as bad as I thought it should be. I really didn't feel ripped off by my rental money, and sometimes that's all you can ask for. The reason is OK, nothing brilliant or new, the play is pretty bad, but it's beautiful. The management is passable, but the effects are terrible, especially the werewolf effects, which in a werewolf film are quite a big problem. There was a pretty decent amount of nudity, which for me is quite a good thing, but it wasn't that hot. All in all, it's a pretty average straight to video movie, not the worst movie I've ever seen, and if you're bored with a genre, check it out. I would even see it again. <br /> <br /> Bonus facts for horror geeks, Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in a few) plays werewolf.
