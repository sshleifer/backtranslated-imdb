The Carlito Way, the original is a brilliant story of an ex-drug dealer who hopes to leave his criminal past so that he invests in a club and deals with the problems that come with it. <br /> <br /> This movie was .... <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer and knew immediately that it would be bad .. But after rejecting film in the past and figuring out were the big ones (Lucky Number Slevin, Tokyo Drift). .. I gave this a shot and it failed within the first five minutes ... The scripture is something a teenager would bring if they got five minutes to prepare ... It was weak with a weaker dialogue. It seems that there is an immediate need for romance in a gangster movie. So Brigante decides to put a guy up for the girl .... and she says 'Yes!' And if you need to act badly, you just throw racism around ... As we learn from the Italian mobsters ... The play was terrible to say the least ... I found 'Hollywood Nicky', funny. <br /> <br /> I hate all these musicians all the way to movies. Let's see it as the only reason P Diddy made this movie so he could play a gangster ... The actor playing Leticia was weak but beautiful. The sex scene was weak, but we got to see her .. who was okay ... but generally I expected to shed light on how Carito ended up in prison and the love of his life ... And the killer in the end is added to the horrible movie at the end that is ... Carlito's Way: Path to Power ..
