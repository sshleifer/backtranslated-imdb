I wish I could give this movie a zero out of ten. Before I came to this movie the day after it came out, I came to IMDb to check the comments. One comment called the film predictable and cheesy with terrible dialogue. I never go out of anyone's opinions so I wasted seven dollars for this crap movie. It should be one of the WORST movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The person who wrote the script should be pushed out of a rock. Since when do scary movies have juicy scenes? I swear I'm surprised that there were no GROUP HUG ^ moments. <br /> <br /> I think I jumped. Once. And that's because I've dropped out and thought about my research paper for English. Klich√©d, birds / cats come out of nowhere when you thought about something that was going to happen. <br /> <br /> And the characters were STUPID. My friend and I almost DIED laughing when the alarm went off and the protagonist said, "I'll get my mother's shawl !!!" You. Idiot. Screw the shawl! Safety is just a few steps away, but no, my mother's shawl (which didn't match the dress by the way) is much more important than my health and safety. And on top of that, they take her back to her house and knew that the killer knew where she lived. God. <br /> <br /> My friend and I also predicted the ENTIRE movie. And not just the one I bet he hides under the bed, moments. It was, "he stole the bellhop's clothes and threw it out of the hotel" and "It's the detective coming down the hall, not the killer!" moments. Movies should never be predictable. Disney movies aren't even this predictable. <br /> <br /> Now I have to finish my rant by saying this was a horrible movie. I'm glad I went to see it in theaters so I wouldn't buy it for $ 15.00 and then hate it. It was just bad. It would have been better if only one thing had happened. If, after being shot by the detective, the killer would have fallen into the position he was shot into. Knife in hand, falling and stuck the girl down. Oh how wonderful it would have been. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money. Go see a good movie.
