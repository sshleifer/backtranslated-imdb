I was unsure whether Andy Sidaris could repeat his success with the cinematic hit "Malibu Express." With his movie Fit to Kill, he has shown that Sidaris is a serious film-maker and not just a one-shot instructor. The plot, written by Sidaris, disobeyed by the Academy, is a complex play with many invisible phrases. The main characters compound work for a sexually based radio station known as KSXY. KSXY is actually their secret headquarters. In "Fit to Kill" they confront their long-time nemesis Kane, who tries to steal one of Russia's most valued diamonds. A well-written play is not all that excellent performance of the cast helps secure this movie as a cult classic. The hood of the critics and the box office, this movie will be appreciated in the coming years. It now suffers in the same fate as Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver did, but in the future will undoubtedly be recognized. I'm disappointed that no critics have recognized Andy Sidari's trademark filing. The costumes, the special effects, all help to compliment this already beautiful piece of cabinet. It may be best to ignore the gloomy 3 rating of this movie and go out and rent it yourself. My personal rating is 10/10. The drama is just as thick as the magnificent Runaway Bride, and the action is better or equal to the cinematic masterpiece Last Action Hero. Andy, keep up the good work.
