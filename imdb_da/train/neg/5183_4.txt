This is the first of these "8 movies to die for" collection that I have seen and it certainly has not made me see any of the rest ... even though I have heard at least a few of them are decent. I don't know, it wasn't terrible, but it didn't really matter to me. Your basic dysfunctional cannibal family in suburbia sort of thing, mom and dad died, the family sold the farm and moved to San Francisco (?), Where they continued to bring home immediate food sources whenever possible. The best part of this was the creepy Goth sister who obviously invites a friend from school who never leaves. Nevertheless, of course we have a butcher shop in the basement and so on and so on. This family is like the white bread version of Sawyer Clan, they are ugly and they do bad things, but they do not go soul. I see many reviews from people who liked this and I don't think I know what I missed but I found it very mediocre and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, really. 4 out of 10
