Permitted, I'm not the jester d'horror my partner is, but a good set together, clever flick is worth the time. My quibbles, cards: <br /> <br /> - Dialogue often weak and sometimes incredibly comes from the given character. <br /> <br /> - Convincing plays. <br /> <br /> - Storyline never really fired. <br /> <br /> The writers picked selection bits from half a dozen mainstream movies, threw in a kettle, did not nearly simmer and tried to feed us bad saps the resulting mess, al'dente. /> <br /> Far and short, but not completely terrible, it was definitely not worth absorbing one of my NetFlix rentals.
