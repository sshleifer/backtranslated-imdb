Robert Forster, usually a very strong character actor, is lost at sea here thrown as a New York family seeking revenge on the gay men who murdered his son and attacked his wife in a home invasion. Frightening topic exploited for cheapjack thrills in the "Death Wish" vein. It's not hard to scoff at these smarmy actions: the dialogue is full of howlers, crime statistics are irrevocably dated, and the supporting characters are ridiculously overwritten (especially a despicable judge who allows an accused killer to go straight out of court). Lease production is contemptuous in its self-righteousness, especially as the violence in our cities has risen only. * from ****
