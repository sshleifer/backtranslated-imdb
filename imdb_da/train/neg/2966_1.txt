I can't understand all the hype about this movie. OK, if you like cheap splatter, you will love this movie, but if you like good stories and good actors - don't look at this. Personally, I really didn't like the actors in this movie, they seem to be hired right from the street. The dialogues are completely flat and you always know what's coming up next time. The overall quality of this movie lacks the supposable very low budget. When we saw this movie (me and 3 other people), we all had in mind that this movie was made by some people who needed to do this just to get their exams at a film school - with the lowest effort. Another problem that really reduces the whole experience is the bad cam (very shaking) and the bad sound, the whole movie seems to be recored with a single microphone.
