This must be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. I remember seeing it years ago when it was originally released on video and for some strange reason I thought I enjoyed it. So, like an idiot, I ran out to buy the DVD when it was released ... what a tragic mistake! I won't even bother going into the plot because it's so transparent that you can see right through it anyway. I'm a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis, so I'm used to cheesy doing effects and bad acting, but these people take this to a whole different level. It's almost as if they intentionally attempt to make the worst movie humanly possible ... if it was their goal, they succeeded. If they were going to make a movie that was going to scare you or make you believe in any form or form that it is real, then they failed ... MISERABLY! Avoid this movie ... read plot synopsis and you've seen it!
