"Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow" seems to be in an immaculate netherworld, an era that has been long overdue, the greatest sin a child could commit would be to question the law and get a traffic ticket. It opens with a young female auto fanatic who gets the business from her arch rival, pushing her into a car race. It's about the draw - this B-flick is most worried about rock'n roll, man! People at American International were, of course, happy with decent, square teenagers who liked to party and yet didn't mind an adult chaperone. There are a couple of entertaining double entenders and fruity exchanges (Necking Kid: "We thought we'd come out for fresh air" ... Dad: "How did you think you'd find it in your throat?") But the ghost is a little late in arrival. Shortly after 65 minutes, the film deceives us with a climatic run that actually goes off-screen and a pre-"Scooby Doo" -shaped mask that doesn't make sense. But for nostalgia buffs, some mindless fun. ** from ****
