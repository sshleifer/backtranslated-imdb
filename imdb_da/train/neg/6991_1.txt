Just don't bother. I thought I'd watch a movie with great supersense and action. <br /> <br /> But it gets boring and awfully predictable after the interesting start. In the middle of the film you have a little social drama, and all the excitement is lost because it slows down the speed. Towards the end it gets better, but not really good. I think the director took this movie just too seriously. In such a movie, even if you don't care about the plot, you will at least have a good action. I almost died in the middle / main part of it. Rating 3/10. Derboiler.
