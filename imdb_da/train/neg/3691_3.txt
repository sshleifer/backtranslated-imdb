I'm not a big fan of Rajnikant at first, but Baba was a big disappointment. Between a horrible story, the action and the songs were only mediocre. The story becomes very preachy. Instead of running for offices like the NTR or MGR, Rajni seemed to run almost like Tamil Nadu's next big guru. My wife tells me that since this movie came out, Rajni sweated out to make more movies! <br /> <br /> We were fortunate to have bought Babu (an oldie of Sivajiganeshan) online by accident when we tried to buy this .... it was a great movie that made up for buying this dud ... except it makes Baba look even worse compared! <br /> <br /> Bryan
