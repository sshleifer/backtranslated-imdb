I just watched this movie (mainly because Brady Corbet is in it) and I have to say I wasn't happy. <br /> <br /> Of course, computer graphics were great, but the story needed a little touch-up. I also think that this movie would have done much better with more curses and blood as well if it was rated PG-13. <br /> <br /> It would definitely attract more people to see it -> teenagers. What would also attract more teenagers (especially teenage girls) would be a great close up of Brady Corbet on the Thunderbird's poster! <br /> <br /> Even though the movie was down, I still saw it and thought it was okay!
