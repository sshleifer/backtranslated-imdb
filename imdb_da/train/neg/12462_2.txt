I watched this movie last night after many good reviews from many sources. I would like to point out that if you are not ready to try and work out who is who and what it all means, you will hate this movie. <br /> <br /> I still struggle to understand the roles of the actors in this movie jumping the movie from various stories and not allowing you to empathize with any of the roles. <br /> <br /> For the political buffers and those interested in corruption in other world governments, movies here are probably pretty good, but for the average movie guards, this movie is awkward, very boring in places, and you will leave the cinema confused and annoyed that you paid the entry fee. <br /> <br /> See if you are ready to focus 100% on every minute details or politics interest you. You can't see it if you actually like watching movies.
