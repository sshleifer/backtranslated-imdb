This star-studded British / Spanish co-production looks great what you can see about it. I have three versions, two VHS, one DVD, and all are terribly cropped, so bad that it looks like buildings have conversations with each other. Few movies suffer so badly from the pan and scan like this, as director Robert Parrish seems to have been so enchanted with the widescreen process that he used to use both sides of the screen at once and neglected the center. Another user notes that we see all the inhabitants of a church massacred in the beginning; not in any of the copies I have. There are some abrupt pieces of peasants firing their rifles, a Mexican officer shot, Shaw and Landau celebrate, and that's it. We never find out why Shaw has become a priest (if he really is). We never find out what happens to Don Carlos (Savalas), although I suppose he was called home to the star in Kojak, as his departure seems arbitrary. And there is a strange flashback sequence where Michael Craig (Mysterious Island) dances around in a bowler hat and bad suit in the big old English music hall story for the 1960 hit BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS, which is not sung by Johnny Horton here but with some texts I have never heard before. On the plus side, the location is great, a large old ruined fortress with Escher-style stairs that lead nowhere, some beautiful scenes-chewing by Robert Shaw and good performances by Stevens, Landau, Lettieri and Telly Savalas as Telly Savalas. I really didn't like this movie, but I haven't just seen it. I want to search the widescreen version and make my decision then.
