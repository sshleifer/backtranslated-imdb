Well what I can say about this movie is that it is great to see so many Asian faces. What I didn't like about the movie was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role. The Asian girl with no confidence to play another to move on, the white guy is being stunned with Asian culture and choosing to leave her white world behind the yellow land and "keep the right" black cab driver. Plus all the coke, shanghai seaweed and dunkin donuts product placement were a little too obvious. The story plot itself was fun, but pretty much how I thought the story would rave up. So again when you see romantic comedies, you can't expect much, but then again I would have been wished to just be surprised at least once. The parents are the best part of the girl.
