There is no one to come around - this movie is horrible. I've seen the old Christopher Lee / Fu Manchu movies, I'm familiar with the characters and it's serial origin, but it's still just godly. However, Peter Sellers' genius still shines with his portrayal of Nayland Smith, with echoes of grief, tragedy, and strength that bolster through a stoic facade; It's a show I am on par with Peter Cushing's portrayal of Van Helsing, but performed in one tenth of the cumulative screen time for all Cushing's "Dracula" films. If the movie was made in a more serio-comic vein as BUBBA HO-TEP using the 1960's AVENGERS TV show, this could have been something special. If you're done with a Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers, it's something you need to see, but it's a passport for someone else.
