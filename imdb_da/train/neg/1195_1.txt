This is the only worst movie I've ever seen. I can't express how bad it is. I honestly wanted to kill myself several times through this awful experience just to end the pain. I recommend instead of watching this movie you bathe in acid, then you will at least know a fraction of the pain without all scars. <br /> <br /> I had such high expectations when I read the back of the DVD case and when it initially added that Jesus followed them, I was so excited ... then eventually would I kill myself. I mean twenty-first introduction to the most annoying characters in the history of the cinema ... LET PIS! Monkeys could have done a better job editing this garbage can. At least they would have thrown stools and blurred some of the waste. It would have made it better not to have seen anything of horror. It wasn't that I didn't get the jokes, it was that they were not just fun, they repeated themselves like twenty times. Apparently something is not fun unless you see it as a million times. <br /> <br /> Under no circumstances look at this. People have rated 'Manos Hands of Fate' as the world's worst movie. I've seen it too and agree that it's bad ... but ALAS is the only worst thing. "Fatty Drives the Bus" is far worse. <br /> <br /> This deserves all kind of hard language, but I can't write this, so just imagine I swore a whole lot.
