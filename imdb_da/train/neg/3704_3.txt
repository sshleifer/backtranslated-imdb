I like Chris Rock, but I feel he is wasted in this movie. The idea of ​​restoring Heaven Can Wait is fine, but the filmmakers followed the plot of the turkey too closely. When Eddie Murphy restored Dr. Doolittle and The Nutty Professor, he raised them completely - so they became Murphy movies / vehicles, not just warm remakes. Therefore, they were successful. If Chris had done the same, it could have been a much better movie. The few laughs that come are when he makes his standup routine - so he could just as well have made a concert film. It would also have been much more fun if the white man whose body he inhabited was a truck driver or hillbilly. So why does Hollywood continue to make junk like that? Because people go to see it - because they like Chris Rock. Then give Chris a decent script and give us better movies! Don't replay movies that weren't so good at first!
