God this movie was just so boring except the music I really loved, I mean, what was meant by this movie, please, whoever reads this review, does not see this movie, it is a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Emrane can act but was really pathetic In this movie I am actually ashamed to be one of his fans especially in this movie, it was just really bad. <br /> <br /> Celina is just another beautiful face with no talent whatsoever, she can't act at all, and there was no point in her being in this movie, as for the other girl Radha, she was okay, but I could have done better. <br /> <br /> What a waste of time. Please buy the great music and not watch this movie.
