I am one of the biggest fans of silent comedians and have probably undergone several Buster Keaton movies for IMDb than any other person. Every movie he made from the beginning of his career to the early 30s with only two exceptions, I've reviewed so you can tell I'm a big fan. It is because of this that I found this episode so painful and difficult to see. I loved this man's movie and thought "Buster, how could you?" Well, now I think about what I can see why Buster Keaton was in this godly episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE. He had lost much of his fortune after an eerie divorce in the early 1930s, and his film career as a leading man was also far away. Now in the 1960s, Keaton needed the money and loved his resurgence in popularity, so he mocked everyone willing to pay - shown in the Beach movies and this mess on a major series episode. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the episode is that it's just terribly written and Buster deserved much better. The show should be fun, but it is not and instead of a tribute to silent movies, it is just painful to watch - especially with Keaton, putting on the stupid travel helmet as well as all the poorly executed slapsticks. Do yourself a favor, SKIP THIS - it's a pale imitation of the greatness that was once Keaton's career !!!
