Now I have seen many bad movies. I like bad movies. Especially bad action movies. I have seen (and enjoyed) all of Jean-Claude Van Damme's films, including the one where he is his own clone, both of whom he plays twins, and all three where he is cyborg. I actually own one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of durians. (Hi, if nothing else, he has a good ass and you almost always see it. With DVD you can even pause and zoom in!) Therefore you can trust me when I say that this movie is so bad makes Plan 9 look like Citizen Kane. Everything about Snake Eater is bad. The reason is bad. The script is bad. The sets are bad. The battles are bad. The stunters are bad. FX is bad. The spectacle is spectacular, ground-bending badly, and most likely shows the worst performance of every so-called actor in the cast, including Lorenzo Lamas, and it really says something. And I would be willing to bet everyone involved in this movie is miserable in bed to start. Especially Lorenzo Lamas. <br /> <br /> It's been unintentionally fun, so it's not a total loss. However, I recommend that you only watch this movie if you are either congenital idiot or very, very rocky. I was able to sit through it myself because I had to see something to distract me from rinsing cat urine out of my laundry. It didn't help much, but it was better than nothing. A point for Ron Palillo's cameo as a homosexualist.
