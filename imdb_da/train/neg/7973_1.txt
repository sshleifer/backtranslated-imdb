I go to a lot of movies, often I bring my 5 year old son, I'm so glad I didn't take him to this one. There are many references to sex and a skinny dipping scene, but it's not the primary reason I wouldn't take him to it. The trailers lead you to believe that it is a light-hearted comedy; Nevertheless, almost all the fun moments in the previews are. I was waiting to be interesting, funny or anything but serious; However, I almost fell asleep when the plot's history dragged on. I understand dogs can be a good company, it is said that the whole story focused on a poor follow-up dog that the owners were not wise enough to train. If a person caused this much damage and chaos, that person would be banned. The worst movie I have ever seen with Jenifer Aniston or Owen Wilson wasting their talent. The best way to summarize this movie is, couple get troubled dog, couple fall in love with dog, dog die, couple sad. The end.
