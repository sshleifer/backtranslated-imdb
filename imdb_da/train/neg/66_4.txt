I suppose I was attracted to this movie both because of the sound of the story and the leading actor, so I gave it a chance from director Gregor Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers). Basically Ned Kelly (Heath Ledger) was created by the police, especially superintendent Francis Hare (Geoffrey Rush), he is forced to flee and form a gang and go against them to clear his own and his family's names. It's really all I can say about the story, as I wasn't fully aware of being honest. Also begins Orlando Bloom as Joseph Byrne, Naomi Watts as Julia Cook, Laurence Kinlan as Dan Kelly, Philip Barantini as Steve Hart, Joel Edgerton as Aaron Sherritt, Kiri Paramore as Constable Fitzpatrick, Kerry Condon as Kate Kelly, Emily Browning as Grace Kelly and Rachel Griffiths as Susan Scott. Ledger does a pretty good performance for what it is worth, and the film has eye-catching moments, especially with a gun battle against the end, but I can't say I enjoyed it when I didn't look at it all. Okay!
