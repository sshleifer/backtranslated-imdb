This by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I gave up to see it after an hour and regretted that hour a lot. The action is horrible and there is almost no reason. My guess is that someone came up with a strange form of an animal and started making a story about it. Borrow some ideas from movies like Resident Evil and Aliens, not resulting in a movie like them. If this is going to be a top Korean movie, I'd rather not bother to even see a Korean movie trailer ... By the way, these movies are a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising. I think every Korean who has internet for online gaming rated this movie over 8, although it has no clue what it is about.
