"Wild Tigers I've known." It will only appear in big cities, to be sure. It is one of those films so artistic that it makes no sense whatsoever, except for the director! I hate them! And all these oh-so-alternative / artistic people are trying to find "metaphors" in what is EVIDENT horseshit. There was no plot, no story, no morality, no chronology and nothing entertaining or even touching. For me it was a bunch of scenes thrown together that had nothing to do with each other and were all for "show" to show how "artistic" and "visual" they could get. It was an ATTEMPT on yet another teen anxiety movie, but missed the mark at all levels humanly possible. So the credits roll! I waited to do the SENSE! I waited for "the good part." I own about 60 independent movies in my DVD collection, many of which might be called "art house" movies. This will NOT be among them. You get very angry with yourself for paying to watch this movie, much less ever to buy it on DVD.
