Yet another movie by Alfred Hitchcock, which seems to have been made by contractual obligation. As with Juno and Paycock, you can tell that Hitchcock had little interest in this movie. There is almost no style or craft at all. The story is about Fred and Emily, a young couple who comes into some money and goes on a cruise that turns out to be a test of their marriage. Emily gets the chance for a new life with a kindhearted and wealthy man who falls in love with her but chooses to take the highway and stay with her husband. This may seem more credible if Fred was not made to be a completely insensitive, pompous ass who jumps on the first occasion he sees leaving his wife to another woman. The couple ends up staying together, but the movie lacks any real reconciliation scene. The third act goes in a completely different direction, with the couple stranded on an abandoned ship and rescued by an Asian fishing boat. Joan Barry gives a very moving performance as a faithful wife's faithful wife. It's all about what you can say to this one.
