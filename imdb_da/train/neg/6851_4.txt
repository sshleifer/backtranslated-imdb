Feh. This movie started in an interesting way, but the gamut quickly jumped from confusing to boring. The confusing parts occurred mainly at the beginning, where the cut scenes are so many that it is difficult to tell what happens in the first twenty minutes or so. The boring comes later, with a weak romance between the two living people (brushing both). The affectionate spirit of the devoted girl is actually the most lively person in the movie who is sad. If the rest of the casting had been up to her caliber, the film could have been better. <br /> <br /> Maybe. Because the storyline becomes really interesting for a while, as it seems that the stupid cute priestess mother of the dead sixteen year old girl is trying to revive her daughter from the dead, with the particular unfortunate side effect that all the other dead people would Come back so take on solid human form and probably start killing everyone. A kind of Japanese mysterious Night of the Living Dead type thing. But it won't happen. Although this hard, unwashed priest, with a small basket attached to the head, tells the uninteresting young that this will happen if the priest finishes her ritual, she does just that, and the only dead man that manifests is her daughter. No mass increase of the dead, no walking army of corpses, nothing. The priest only returns the girl's spirit to the land of death, taking a woman's rinse out of a girlfriend when she had crushed her spine as a peanut (at which time I was tempted to cheer loudly when this idiot went over to kiss and cuddle the dead girl ,, ewwww !!!). The robot's sucking, spineless best friend has a long introspective shot at the end when she leaves the village for the last time, and that's it. No real horror, no real fragility that the Japanese tend to do far better than American filmmakers with their emphasis on over-the-top cheesy face make-up, no screaming mimics. I was very disappointed.
