The story from the start is interesting: slavery in the (late) 20th century from West Africa to the Arab Middle East. The problem with that is that it deliberately castigates two of Richard Fleischer's favorite enemies: Arabs and Germans. In order to make us believe that very Arab men will be free to move around and easily catch black in West Africa, they are as credible as whites in search of slaves in "Roots". Of course, both trades are run by the locals and involve (d) much more sophisticated networks. While Arab countries are complicated in today's child and sex slavery trade, Israel is one of the worst offenders according to Amnesty International. So why only point out Arabs and then choose a German as the only European buyer? It is obvious confusion and hatred for these people by a Jewish director. The action is above average, especially by Peter Ustinov (Suleiman) and Kabir Bedi (Malik). Michael Caine (Dr. Linderby) is good as always.
