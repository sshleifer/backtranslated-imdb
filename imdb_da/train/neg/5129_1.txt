The message in this movie is "personality is more important than beauty". Jeanine Garofalo was supposed to be the "ugly duckling", but the funny thing is that she is not ugly at all (in fact she is much more attractive than Uma Thurman, the friend who looks like a model). <br /> <br /> Now would this movie work if the "ugly duckling" was really uninteresting? When will Hollywood stop this hypocrisy? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie is simply ridiculous despite the message it wants to convey. <br /> <br />
