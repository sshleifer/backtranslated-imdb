I watched this movie tonight with expectation, but it wasn't really that impressed. <br /> <br /> With the exception of "Combo" I thought the play was poor and the story was limited. It came across as a 'made for television' drama. <br /> <br /> I felt the movie was very constructed. The whole build-up of hammering in the beginning (yes, we get this is the 80s UK - you can stop now) was tedious and gave a very one-sided view of how life was in the 80s Britain - poverty, war is equated with royalty, Margaret Thatcher, but nothing in between? There were actually middle classes that existed then - just ordinary working people with a decent salary and a mortgage. The Falklands clip also seemed to be added randomly to the end, for 'dramatic effect', I suppose. <br /> <br /> The order of events felt a bit uneven, as the characters moved an action to the next without seeing how their mindset could have changed so quickly. <br /> <br /> The relationship between 'Shaun' and 'Smell' was teen-curling. I couldn't even see under the snogging scene. I find it very hard to believe that she would have been attracted to a boy who was not only so much younger, but also so much younger. I know there were only four years between them, but four years is nothing when you reach your twenties, but it's a big difference in your teens! In my opinion, this kind of teenager's difference only occurs when the girl is the youngest, as girls mature so much faster and more at the wavelength of boys a few years older. Sorry, but I didn't buy it - an unnecessary plot point created for shock value. The end was somewhat abrupt and again, constructed. If the flagship casts the event should be iconic, then it fell a little short of my eyes. It bugs me that British movies only concern themselves with either the upper classes or the poor. Don't make me wrong, I love Trainspotting, and four weddings have their charms, but can't we Brits come up with anything else? Why is our film always so suspended in the class system? I was born in 1973 so it was not so much different in age that "Shaun" would have been in 1983. I grew up in a single family in a rather depressed town hall in a city in England. But my childhood experiences were very different from those depicted in the movie - I don't even remember racism is a problem (though I don't say it didn't exist). "This is England"? Not in my experience. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that I felt this movie lacked substance and I was totally bored and impressed everywhere.
