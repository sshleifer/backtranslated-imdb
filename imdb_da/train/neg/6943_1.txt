This movie is deeply idiotic. A man wants revenge for a crime - but when he does his revenge - there is a video camera that is right for him all the time. Which man with a brain cell in his head would sit there and do it so long in front of a camcorder? <br /> <br /> Just the fact that this script could never happen, except with someone unable to dress, ruined it for me - but it became stupid !!! I think of the scriptwriters having some serious habits that make their brain cells and make them miss plot holes, you can run a battalion of armored tanks through. <br /> <br /> PLOT: A man seeks revenge for the lovers' death, but in the middle of the plot something goes wrong and the unexpected unfolds. <br /> <br /> If only those people who wrote this story had not been as stupid as writing completely unrealistic plot twists that could never happen this way. To the authors, I say help to your serious mental problem.
