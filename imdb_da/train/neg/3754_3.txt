As a prolonged fan of the entire Star Trek series, I found this a disappointing episode and I wonder if the liberal use of "flashbacks" with Will Riker's exploits, both positive (and largely romantic) and negative (lots of pain, and a crew's death) was a money-saving device, like many of their "bottle exhibitions" (episodes where all scenes are on Enterprise). Diana Muldaur (who also seemed at least twice in the original series) deserved a better final look than this for her character, Dr. Kate Pulaski. Loyal viewers (in the Star Trek world, is there any other kind?) Were also shortchanged. This was the last episode of the second season; Thus, the season ended "not with a bang" but with "a nap."
