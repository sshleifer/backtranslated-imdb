As long as there has been 3D technology (the 1950s I think) it has been animated for it. I specifically remember a Donald Duck cartoon with Chip and Dale in it. I can't remember the name at the moment, but the plot was that Donald worked on a circus, fed an elephant peanuts and Chip and Dale steals the peanuts. This was made to look in 3d the 1960s. If you happened to see Meet Robinson's in 3d in theaters, they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of that origin. There is probably somewhere around 100 cartoons made specifically for viewing through 3d glasses. This claim was a bad move because it is not difficult to prove them wrong. Besides that, it just looks like a bad movie.
