This movie hardly followed the film's history line. All the fascinating points in the book didn't even exist in the movie. They ended up making it a cheesy "tween" Disney movie "crush" story between Meg and Calvin. It was so bad that it should have been Hillary Duff who played that part or one of them. This film was nothing but an insult to the book's intelligence and mystery. I can't believe Disney could even get away with making such a cheap, basic reproduction. If you've ever read the book, I think you agree that it could easily be made into a movie of "Lord of the Rings" equivalence. This movie should never have been able to use the title A Wrinkle in Time. Poorly done.
