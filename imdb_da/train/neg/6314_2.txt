I love Seth Green. His performances in the 70's Show are always worth seeing, but last night I felt the show needed to go through. Four single young guys inherit a New York City apartment that most of us would die for. Grandma must have been an heirs to have such space in the first place. So I felt the need for realism should have been brought out. Anyway the plot of four best friends to get this apartment was not credible. I would have been excited if they were to move in with one of their parents who would have given great humor and dysfunction to the show's lineup. There didn't seem to be much humor in it. I only look at it because it falls before my name is earl on a winning Thursday night. I think they have to go back, scrap this series and start over. We need more family involved series. How about Seth and his friends moving in with their crazy parents in the suburbs after a fire burns their place down. They could have Dabney Coleman playing the father and Christine Estabrook, playing the mother and dysfunctional siblings. The list of options with someone like Seth Green is endless and the network is blowing it.
