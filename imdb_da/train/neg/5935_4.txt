The most scary thing about this "tribute" is that almost all singers (including the otherwise incredibly talented Nick Cave) seem to have missed the whole point where Cohen's intensity lies: by delivering his lines in an almost tuneless poise, Cohen sends it full extent of his poetry, his irony, his all-round humanity, laughter and tears in one. To see some of these singer starts making intricate suffering faces, launching their pathetic squeals into the patent effort to scream "I'm a singer!" Is a true pain. It is the same feeling many of you had probably listened to some horrible operative versions of simple songs like Lennon's "Imagine". Nothing, nothing comes close to the simplicity and directness of the original. If there is some kind of art that does not need decorations, it is Coh's art. Decorations cast it on the street, resembling the tasteful composition of sex for sale. <br /> <br /> In this tribute to Coh, I found myself suffering and suffering through pitiful tribute and horrible reinterpretation, all of which are completely lacking in the original irony of the master, and if truth is told, several of these singers sound as if had been recruited on some asylum talent show. It is Cohen who praises them by letting them sing their material, really not the other way around: they may have been friends or his daughter, he could have been very tender and in the mood for a gift. It was too bad that it was not in the family. Fortunately, but only at the end, Cohen himself carried out his majestic "Tower of Song", but even that flower was spoiled by the utterly eerie background of U2, all wearing the expression bored children have when visiting their poor grandfather at the nursing home . <br /> <br /> A sad show, really and sad, if you really love Cohen as I do.
