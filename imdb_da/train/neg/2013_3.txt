This movie is about what it sounds like: A futuristic version of the Cinderella legend, but with songs and (rather tame) sex scenes! The movie is not sure what it will be and almost ends up with a mess. It is more expensive to see than most of the director Al Adamson's movie, but it's not at the same budget level that viewers have come from sci-fi movies. The actors are rather poor and, unlike most Adamson movies, there are no former big names or B actors. Some of the music is ok, but it is easy to see why Cinderella 2000 has been forgotten for so many years.
