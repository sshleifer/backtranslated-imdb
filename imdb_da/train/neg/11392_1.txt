For years I remember reading about this show "Trouble With Tracy" in the TV Guide. CFTO TV Toronto every Saturday morning at 6am! I lived about a two hour drive north of Toronto and we couldn't get the CFTO but you know what it is - we always want what we can't have. <br /> <br /> Now I knew what I wanted and what I wanted was to see what this "Trouble With Tracy" was about. Did it get a beautiful girl in the lead? Was there nudity? Was there excitement? Was it a comedy? It would have been fine if there was any promotion of the show. At least I could have known what I was missing. But no! Mystery drove me bonkers until CTV affiliated CKCO built a re-transmitter in Wiarton, Ontario and started broadcasting "Trouble With Tracy" at the same time as CFTO .... Saturday morning at 6 am On a Saturday morning I got up and turned on TV It is noon. 5:59 and finally I came to see what the "problem with Tracy" was. Yes, "Trouble With Tracy" was that it was Canadian content and stuck in the harmless 6am spot so no one could ever see how terrible it was. Talented Canadian actor Steve Weston died a few years afterwards, but many would argue that he effectively "died" the first time he appeared on this show. When I first saw the cold Saturday morning and dropped despondent back in my bed, some of me died too.
