First of all, let's get a few things right here: a) I'm an anime fan - have always been in fact (I used to watch Speed ​​Racer all the time in preschool). b) Like many B movies, I do because they are funny. c) I like the Godzilla movies - a lot. <br /> <br /> Move on when the movie first comes on, it looks like it's your usual B movie, down to the crappy FX, but all of a sudden BOOM! anime comes on! This is when the movie goes down WWWAAAAAYYYYY. <br /> <br /> The animation is very poor and cheap, even worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER, for crissakes! In fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes from the movie I "live" remembers is when a bunch of kids run out of school ... & it's the same kids over and over! FX is also terrible; The dinosaurs look worse than godzilla. In addition, the transition to live action for animation is disorganized, the dialogue and voices (especially the English dub, I saw) were horrible, and I asked my father to take the tape out of the DVD / VHS player; The only thing that kept me surviving, blasted jokes and comments like the robots & Joel / Mike on MST3K (you choose the season). Frankly, this is the only way to hardly enjoy this movie and survive it at the same time. Heck, I'm planning to show this to another colleague with my otaku on Halloween for a B-movie night. Because it is stupid, rather painful to see and unintentionally fun at the same time, I give this movie a 3/10, an improvement from the 0.5 / 10 I would originally give it. <br /> <br /> (According to my grading scale: 3/10, pretty much both boring and bad means counting to three, unless you find a way to make fun, it is so fun to count to 15 .)
