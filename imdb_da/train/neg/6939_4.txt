R Balki is trying to tell you a story that had previously been told by Ram Gopal Verma in Nishabd in a sensual way. This time it is mixed with mature humours. <br /> <br /> Amitabh Bachchan is a chef and owns an Indian cuisine in London. He is very dominant and arrogant and respects his job just like any other job. According to him, cooking is an art. Still can't make Hyderabadi Biryani correct. <br /> <br /> Enter Tabu, who sends her the right Hyderabadi Biryani made by her, and they will soon meet and eventually fall in love with each other ?? Amitabh is 65 and Tabu is 35 Â°. No problems! But a Hitch! Tabu far Paresh Rawal !! The couples decide to meet their father for approval of their marriage. But Amitabh realizes that Tabus's father is much younger for him. And the complications begin ?? Performance wise all three players are brilliant. The film of the film is very tight and interesting. The film's dialogues are captivating. But somewhere you feel that your stomach is not properly filled. The comedy is sometimes not properly understood. The film also tries to go slow in some parts. <br /> <br /> Musically not much to sing about except Title Track. The camera work is good. Director R Balki could have given much better of this script. But in the second half he sees himself confused. The father "Satyagrah" scene looked annoying. But the lines spoken by Amitabh Bachchan during that scene are valued worthy. On the whole, Cheeni Kum needed more sugar!
