I'm glad to read so many negative comments about the Tritter plot. Everyone I talk to says the same thing. They like House's gruff-nature and his intelligence, but really do not like the continued plot. It cuts into the real nature of medical history and makes everyone angry with the police authority. It must have a more caring nature instead of the revenge of everyone in the hospital. There also appear to be many questionable legal aspects of what Tritter actually does. He alone cannot freeze accounts and have the power to stop doctors from writing prescriptions to patients. Much of the revenge he shows is also damaging the very sick patients in the hospital and it is not a good story to portray. I voted the episode terribly not because of the story itself, but when you insert the Trittor piece, it gets rid of me and the rest of the plot gets hurt by it. People say they hate to see the lines of history anymore. Please change it. Get Tritter out.
