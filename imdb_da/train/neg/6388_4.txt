The Brothers Quay are directors who judge by traditional beliefs should have fixed by making short films. I really really like their first move, Institute Benjamenta, but judging by their sophomore efforts, The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes, I am willing to agree that they do not come close to responding to their previous genius on feature length. Piano Tuner is undoubtedly a beautiful movie to watch and often listen to. Unfortunately, the border is painful to sit through with its marvelous tale and ice age. Reading plot synopsis, it sounds like a pretty good story. But the brothers otherwise fail to bring it to life. One thing they should consider avoiding completely in the future: dialogue. My God, it's terrible here. A big bust.
