The actors in this movie have created a future where abortion and birth control pills are not illegal in all states, but women are prosecuted for murder and sent away to serve long prison arrangements. In other words, this movie is the only liberal's worst nightmare! The political agenda is so heavy-handed here, and the film's style is so low-key that it just loses steam quite quickly. Whichever side of the fence you are on, I recommend skipping it.
