I watched as 8 or 9 Herzog movies and none of them had any influence on me. <br /> <br /> I saw several documentaries about him. He is, of course, an intelligent man with great knowledge of film and passion to make them, but makes it a good director. Absolutely not! A complete anti-talent. He can make a good documentary because of previously mentioned features, but a movie with actors ?? never! <br /> <br /> He can't lead or write. His screenshots are full of ill-thought situations, and many situations / dialogues in his films are so childish and poorly done that they cannot be hidden behind the word "art" in any way. No way. Not to mention the unskillful direction, so amateurish-like. To say he would like to lead as such and write shit as such is a lie. <br /> <br /> Like the scene when Scheitz is arrested and Storszek is hiding behind the store. WHERE IS HOME? <br /> <br /> He is a cheater; He knows what false intellectuals and critics want. He knows what elements he should use in the script to get their attention and empty praise. Remember the rest of the script and dull direction. Just look at Julio Medem. If Herzog can make a movie like Medem, then I might be able to check out his old movie again and try to find talent in them.
