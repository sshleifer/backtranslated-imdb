Extremely disappointing movie based on James Michener's novel. <br /> <br /> What was even worse was Marlon Brando's performance. His southern features were ridiculous. I found myself laughing as he spoke as he sounded like an elderly lady who came home to roost. Brando, who was so big in previous films, was reduced here to a ridiculous stock. Tyrone Power, in "Witness for Prosecution" should have been nominated for Best Actor instead of Brando here. <br /> <br /> The film dealing with racism dealt with the US government's attempt to avoid marriages between US soldiers and Japanese women. <br /> <br /> Brando was stent all over the movie. His moves from anti-relationships to a pro arise when he finds love with an Asian woman. His feelings and talk made it difficult to see how he could evoke such new views. <br /> <br /> Only the gentleman knows why Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki received Oscars support for their performances. Nothing about both achievements was as impressive. Umeki's appearance on the screen was short and without much of anything depicted on her side. A better performance in this movie was made by Miiko Taka, who did well as Brando's love interest. She showed great feeling like the anti-American who found love with Brando character. Her face was etched with the unhappiness she had to lose her father and brother in World War II. She realized that her dance was not her out of this existence that she lived. <br /> <br /> Martha Scott went from the Hebrew mother Yochobel in "The Ten Commandments" to the spoiled mother of Brando's love interest at first. Her performance with Ricardo Montalban was wasted. Patricia Owens, like Brando's first love, showed deep and conviction in her performance.
