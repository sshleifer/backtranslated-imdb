This movie had a great cast to go for it: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey, Lew Ayres - solid b-movie actors all. But this downer of a movie didn't use any of them for any benefit, without any of their characters even meeting on the screen (although Christopher Lee can't play opposite to several scenes). <br /> <br /> The motivation for foreigners in this movie seems to change with the fall of a hat. First, they just want to repair their ship and leave, then they turn on the protagonist by killing most of his friends and not releasing his wife after he gets them the crucial part they need. Then, this "peaceful" race decides to destroy the planet because it causes too many "diseases" (although they give the protagonist and his wife somewhere in their community). <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is spent watching husband and wife driving or walking or standing around or sitting at desks that do nothing. You almost wished they had gone out with the rest of the planet at the end, just in vengeance to bore us to death. Unless you really like Chris Lee or the 70's with low budget sci-fi, I'd give this a lady. It falls into the narrow range of wasted celluloid between Star Odyssey and UFO: Target Earth.
