This is probably the worst movie ever made, it's just too bad that the name Roger Corman is associated with it. I could have understood in his early years when he had lower budgets, but today there are no excuses to give birth to this! I am a "B" movie perverted and from some people's point of view all the flicks I love are devoted to "ordinary viewers" but take my word on this one, Vampire club makes the top of my list of the best of the worst. It's hard to imagine, vampires without fangs, the music tracks are out of place, the sound effects are just not effective, and finally Mr Savage does not seem to know that he is in a vampire movie on every nest is too bad because he had one "not to bad" career everywhere. Let me know that I have trouble with one cause when I don't like a movie, I tend to forget it's the good side.
