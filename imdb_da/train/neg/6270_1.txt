Somehow, a woman working with a scientist puts round balls in people's mouths that seem to change their personality, but in reality they become bile, zombie-like killers. "The guinea pigs" for the experiment are sharply dressed, nubile young women in desperate need of acting. This movie is horrible, horrible and incredibly bad. It has little or no logic in the script. You really have trouble following what is going on. It has no special effects. The computer screen that supposedly represents a great scientific development looks no more than an old Atari display. And what's even worse is that there is also a doll with threads of felt hair (looks like a lonely child in the summer camp did it) called George, who is like a personal servant / confidant to Jessica (the leading "actress"). Throughout the film you will be subjected to the idiotic, sophmoric utterance of this puppet. But wait ... you also get lots of softcore, unrotic, barely nude scenes with the girls with some bar guys. Still, a most annoying soundtrack plays in the background as a kind of spiritual discovery has taken place. None of the players are good. There are only varying degrees of bad. The gore and horror aspects are particularly busy. The movie looks really like a youth puts it together. No coincidence Henry Sala, the director named but not by trade, has not made another film. I almost bored to a coma who looked at this stupid, silly boy! And how does it end? What happened? If you know, let me in on the secret, because I can't figure out life for me. All I know is that I lost the time spent watching this waste that made the start of my weekend a real nightmare of a bore!
