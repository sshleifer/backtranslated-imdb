this movie begins with a regular funeral ... and it insists so hard on this regular funeral that i lost interest within 5 minutes of watching and started skipping scenes. It seems to me who made this movie is affected by the extent of being caught in a permanent morbid trance, unable to consider anything other than death and destruction. Well, I'm not one of the dark kids from Southpark, I want a movie that within 10 minutes makes me an interesting story, I don't want to sit and watch 10 minutes of nothing but preparation for a funeral. My grandmother on her last year was fascinated by funerals, maybe she might have had this "movie".
