This movie is so bad and gets worse in every way possible. It's not just the poor plays and scripts, nor is it the lame and perverse time you don't have to see it. What really puts this movie in my shame is the apparent struggle that the authors and producers are making with the movie to try and make fun. The actor replaces Jean Reno's descendant is old and taught his lesson in the first film so they add a new girl to be married. Almost all the original extras and gags return, but this time I get to mature my eyes out of my sockets because it's a waste of perfect good movie. The torture of the constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer in violent envelopes. This second movie takes the successful original and pulls it out of its coffin and parades the body into the public square and destroys perversely not only the original idea and its heritage, but also our intelligence. This movie, unlike the Christmas tree, did not fly because it had no plot in the protagonists who returned to a 'necklace'. No script since it apparently was written and added to daily. No attention to camera or shot in mind. Poor lighting and special effects done to do so. This movie would not even pass to a student movie in base film 101. How this pile came through, no one can tell. It was a big lost investment and it seems that no one had the strength to put this unnatural cruel error out of our misery. This movie has a great deal ... its END! This movie is my # 1 worst movie of all time, eventually "Howard The Duck" is no longer the goose.
