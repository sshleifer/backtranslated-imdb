When I first watched this movie, I thought it was a good sasquatch movie. Usually when you have these types of movies there is generally a sasquatch, but in this there is like what? 7 or 10 of them? The plot was good, the plot was ok, I liked the scenes where the sasquatchen kills the first few victims, very good camera work. I expected to be a gory movie, but it was very little. This movie was far better than Sasquatch. The SCI-FI channel should really make several sasquatch movies, I mean I really liked Sasquatch Mountain, Abominibal was not good, the one I go through is ok, but the movie Sasquatch was not, but I am going through it not let me get back on track . This movie is good for a rainy Sunday afternoon, but on other occasions, no.
