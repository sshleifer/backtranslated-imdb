TYSON <br /> Image format: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio format: Stereo <br /> <br /> Reverent - even though it is carefully justified - Master boxer life and time statement Mike Tyson. Because of his conviction of rape, the film is careful not to portray him as the hero or villain, but paints a wart-and-all portrait of his rise to fame, the pressure of success and the people who shaped his fate for good or bad . Limited by time constraints, the script gallops through a series of relevant information that is briefly read about important events culminating in Tyson's temporary decline in 1995. Newbies will be enlightened by the chronology while boxing fans will be entertained by director Uli Edel's straight -Arrow access material. He portrays Tyson's life as a circus, in which he ultimately derived from the circumstances of his own success. In fact, the script reserves most of its poison to Tyson's ex-wife Robin Givens, who characterizes her as an ungrateful gold digger who exploited her naivety. The production values ​​are uniformly fixed and the casting is fantastic: Michael Jai White makes a fair imitation of the title character; George C. Scott plays Tyson's mentor Cus D'Amato through acres of grilled teeth; and Paul Winfield was probably born to play Don King!
