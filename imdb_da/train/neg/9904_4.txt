The movie 'Gung Ho!': The story of Carlson's Makin Island Raiders was made in 1943 to embrace the moral American people of World War II. It shows with the better way that the cinema can be a form of propaganda. The value of this movie is just collection and no one artistic. In a film of propaganda it is useless to judge direction and actors. Watch movies if you are interested in learning how propaganda works in the movies or if you are a great fun of Robert Mitchum who has a small role in the movie. If you want to watch a movie for World War II, they exist much better and objective. I rated it 4/10.
