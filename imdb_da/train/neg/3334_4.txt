This scared hell out of me when I was a teenager. Now I find it more entertaining than scary, but with some rather disturbing moments and with some kind of whisper quality for what I like. And come to think of it, the plot is quite disgusting indeed ... but dealt with some sort of taste. If there is a problem with this movie, there are big gaps where nothing exciting or interesting happens. The end continues forever, making a potentially tense climax seem stupid after a while with Barbara Bach screaming and screaming. The "monster" after it is exposed is also not very scary. The somewhat dull appearance of the movie also works against it, making it appear as a television movie more than anything made for theaters. But it is an example of movies that are rarely made today, so I encourage horror fans to watch it and feel a little nostalgic ...
