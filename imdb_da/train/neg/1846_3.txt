Well, I can be honest with all the audiences I bought because of Kira's sex scenes, but unfortunately I didn't see much of them. All sex scenes were short and complete, along with all the weird and corny background music like any other B movie - it just doesn't look like two people have sex. There is a little plot towards the end - Kira's new lover is a killer. Whoa !!! how shocking !!! Why don't we nominate this film for the Oscar Award? I can't imagine how bad the movie would look if it was R-rated (Mine is imported from the UK, rated 18). Conclusion? Put it down and walk away so you won't end up being a moron like me. <br /> <br /> Score: 2/10
