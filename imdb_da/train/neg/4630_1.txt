Published in 1965, but clearly shot years earlier, this is an unfortunate little crime melody with some eerie sexual exploitation in front. As usual for grindhouse flicks of the era, there is a lot of undressing and dressing for no reason, supplemented by miserable music, annoying narrative and awkward editing. The coffee shop scene puts the creepy foundation as we chop back and forth between signs to avoid seeing them speak their lines. All we get is reaction to the voice of the screen character! 50's beautiful Misty Ayers stripes for his French-cut pants a few times before the action starts. She is constantly accompanied by what appears to be music from romantic to western to mother dishes, mixed randomly to produce, among other things, the most exciting cigarette lighting ever captured on film. Watch him! See when he hits the fight! Will he breathe or will he be caught by Apaches? It will show time !! The film tells the violent tale of how Sally is being tricked into working in a whorehouse, falling for a dope and can't escape. For some reason, we are treated to some of the most boring and boring hearers who have ever committed to movies, literally making their nails or knitting rather than entertaining the client. Some stupendously lame comedy (boozy lady accidentally drinks milk! Does that have!) And silent movie plays don't help. This is one of the worst feature films I've ever seen, even though it's a strange video marquee. It's really more of a movie curiosity for those interested in the history of the cinema - very poor cinema.
