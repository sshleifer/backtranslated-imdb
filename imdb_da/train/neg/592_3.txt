All logic goes straight out of the train window of this British horror movie, located in London's subway and stares at the normally reliable Franka Potente (Run Lola Run), plays Franka Kate, a businesswoman heading from an office party to meet friends who fall into sleep at a metro station, only to wake up and find that she is locked in and finds herself chased by "someone" or "something" with the killer's intentions. <br /> <br /> Plot holes and adultery are abundant and there are very few moments that are actually jumping / scary but lots that are just boring. <br /> <br /> All in all, an unpleasant movie that just needs to stay locked underground and do us all a favor. <br /> <br /> The only plus here is the inclusion in the cast of popular veteran actor Ken Campbell, who's done better than this? it is even including "Erasmus Microman"!
