This is a dry and sterile feature of filming on one of the most interesting events of World War II and in war history behind the front line. Bad drama composition is worst about this movie as a plot to kill Hitler supposed to be quite a dramatic event. There is no sign development at all and an idea that Tom Cruise supposes to play a high rank commander questioning his deepest inner thoughts of patriotism and betrayal is totally insane. I think Mister Bin would play better. Generally speaking, movies look like a good copy of good German television film "Stauffenberg" from 2004, but can't get close to that movie about any movie aspect at all. However, the film, of course, gets its financial goal with popcorn targeting cherishes of Hollywood's fast-paced mood blood and art values.
