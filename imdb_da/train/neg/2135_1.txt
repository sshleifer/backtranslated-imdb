Just take out the rubbish bin. I am a big fan of Cusacks, that is the only reason I saw this movie, but the only reason I can see for their presence was the full and deep quality reproduction, their exact roles from Grosse Point Blanc. Apart from that, the film's role as a political satire fails to be too obvious for even the most moronic out there to serve any purpose. And to count it as a satirical satire would even be insulting even to chimpanzees. Imitation is apparently the highest form of flattery, but looks like it is nothing near Grosse Point Blanc and in the same league that meets (see about your moron) spartans with regard to political satire, let's leave well enough and leave this falls into the ambiguity it deserves absolutely.
