The scripture is so ridiculous ... this again makes the actors' lines obediently rigid and unrealistic and not to be believed. There are repetitions of sentences - "my sweet little goddesses" and minor variations of the line that comes to mind ... and it's just sloppy soap opera dialogue. <br /> <br /> Even worse, the music is so wrong! Plus, the main blues-like "theme" is terribly picturesque and completely wrong. And it feels overused, mostly because instrumentation, texture and arrangement of this theme never changes even when the scene's emotional context does. <br /> <br /> Subsequently, it looks like a tender thumb as the head transition from one scene to another. <br /> <br /> The music is corny, and it is as if the author wrote music to soap or sitcom - a low budget 80's Canadian sitcom on it - and so it feels like we are always on the verge of Throw in a commercial. <br /> <br /> It is so overlooked that is very overactive and it is a real stretch that so many of these characters use only one type of NY accent - a thick Bronx accent. I don't know if it's about the players' limited capacity by only knowing * an * NY accent - or whether it's a question of the director's ability to notice such a sharp anomaly. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's the amateur script with it's led lines that make this whole movie "... blow. When a foundation is shaken and unstable, it's impossible to build on it without are errors that reveal themselves exponentially more harmful and unflattering ways.
