Lynne Ramsey makes arresting pictures, and Samantha Morton can call feeling with a gesture. So what a move to discover their talents wasted in this way, pretentious lark. <br /> <br /> Ramsey can't bring Callar to life. Her attempts are too artificial and oblique. Repeatedly her camera lingers on long silent images of the agonizing actress, as if Morton's annihilated look alone could give character. We are in an empty Warholian hell of complacency: for a movie that has a few minutes to save errors that crawl over the floor, you might think it could come around to play the main character. But how will that be if she rarely speaks? Without the inner monologue of the novel, celluloid Morvern Callar is none. Little wonder Ramsey has Morton dressed often. Having said that, the first ten minutes were so impressively acted, shot and edited that my hopes were increasing. Give the movie so much: it knows how to make promises, if not how to keep someone.
