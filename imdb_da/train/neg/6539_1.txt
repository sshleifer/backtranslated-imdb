If this could be judged a 0, it would be. From the dreadful tree acting against the dull pace pace, the puerile exploitation angle and the sophomoric pseudolic titillation add to the sad viewer's sake. This is a disaster in a movie. The plot is predictable, from the beginning you are quite sure what will happen to all the characters and how the plot will begin. From a dull, unpredictable beginning to a pathetic and gloomy end, every presence in this movie is wasted, and every little talent crab is dug up for this turkey to be wasted. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something so relentlessly gloomy with lots of the same childish titulation, see one of the Ilsa movies. At least they are unapologic and upfront about what they are trying to do. How something terribly unsuccessful has been judged over a 5 is a miracle of how people without taste or discerning standards can sometimes come together for the most dubious purposes. It's not scary, it's not interesting, and above all it's not awake in any kind of word. It is, in my opinion, a crime; It is a crime that such a terrible and inappropriate piece of waste was ever conceived by and given the resources to be present, and even more tragedy that it is still defended by some grossly wrong viewers. <br /> <br /> Not even Elvira's cheerful personality and fun ways could soften the battle that this horrible movie is. Avoid it at all costs.
