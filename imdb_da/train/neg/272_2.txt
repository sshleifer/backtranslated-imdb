When I was younger, I really enjoyed watching bad TV. We've all been guilty of it at some point, but my excuse to see things like "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century" and "Silver Spoons" is this: I was young and naive; unaware of what makes a show really worth it. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I appreciate the good things. Stargate SG-1 is not good. The 12-year-old I would love every hackneyed bit of it, every line of stalked dialogue, every bit of unnecessary technobabble. Scripture is beyond motion; so bland and uninspiring it does a miss Star Trek: Voyager. If your show makes me the furthest after the worst Trek show ever, you're in trouble. <br /> <br /> The movie Stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure, rooted in two solid performances by James Spader and Kurt Russell, full of fascinating Egyptian architecture and culture, a wonderful musical score and cool sci-fi ideas. With the exception of a little bit of original music, none of what made the movie fun in this show. Even Richard Dean Anderson, who made MacGyver watchable and Legend interesting, seems to be half asleep most episodes. The budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like a person's basement. The kinematics are not much better, like vanilla and dull as scripts. It amazes me that shows with much more style (like Farscape) and fabric (like the reimagined Battlestar Galactica) have smaller, less healthy fan bases than this cardboard. It just doesn't deserve it.
