Years after the fall of the last of the big corporations, the world has fallen into a new dark age where cyborgs are harvested for their parts. Cash, a female cyborg, travels to a wilderness doctor to receive news that she is pregnant. When driving from Recyclers (bounty hunters hunting cyborgs), Cash tries to find its way to Cytown, the mythical haven for cyborgs. <br /> <br /> "Cyborg 3: Recycler" is the third (and so far) entry into the CYBORG trilogy. The first film was originally planned to be a successor to UNIVERSE'S MASTERS, but was quickly rewritten into a standard post-apocalyptic martial arts celebration that became something of a cult classic because of its cheesy action scenes. CYBORG 2: GLASS SHADOW was a sequel that actually improved on its predecessor but was not widely seen (and was dismissed by the few who saw it as cheap food). <br /> <br /> This movie for one thing is trying to be a note of the first two movies (the first one was a cheesy action movie while the other was a clever Cyberpunk story) but unfortunately lacks both sides. The budget was obviously lower than CYBORG 2, where the film was set in the desert wastes (as many post-apocalyptic action films from the 90s were) shot around old industrial buildings to save costs. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie is based on a plot unit, a pregnant cyborg that is as interesting as it is absurd (this movie is not the first to try the idea; the anime OVA series ARMITAGE III uses it to a greater extent). But the film falls in the same trap that so many low-budget cyber-action films become the victim of the fact that snags (synthetic organisms) emphasize nothing but androids. The visual effects are nothing more than the prosthetic arms and makeup effects. <br /> <br /> The action is quite standard for this kind of movie, with the leading actress (Khrystyne Haje) the only worst performer on display. Instead of being happy with the news, she is pregnant, she seems all beautiful and hungry. Her co-stars are much better, Malcolm McDowell is the usual gangster type who regrets the scenes he looks at, and Richard Lynch has a lot of fun as the top villain. Of particular note is Andrew Byniarski, who plays Lynch's right hand, who will later appear in The Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake & its prequel.
