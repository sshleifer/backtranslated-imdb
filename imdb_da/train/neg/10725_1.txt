As much as I do not like to say 'me too' in response to other comments - it is quite true that the first 30 minutes of this movie has nothing to do with the endless dirge that includes the following 90. > <br /> Have been banned somewhere, don't make a movie for visibility. Just because it doesn't look like a Hollywood product, doesn't make it credible. <br /> <br /> Even worse, besides it is not possible to see anything else (than there are lots of muddy places in Russia and many people, even very old women, drinking lots of vodka) a number of visuals are so unnecessarily nauseating I am in my second package Rolaids. <br /> <br /> As for spoilers - then the movie is devoid of storyline I couldn't write one if I tried. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time or money and don't confuse it with a good Russian cinema.
