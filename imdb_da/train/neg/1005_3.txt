When you go to an open air cinema during the Greek summer night, you usually don't care what the movie is! Edison started really well with some good efforts from singers-like-to-be actors and once again great Morgan Freeman but ... (In a movie there is usually a good start to catch the audience, finished, a little boring but the story fills in the middle of the movie, which is more about characters and less about action, finished, and the third part is really good, so you can remember the movie ...) when you see 30 elite police officers (packed with weapons can destroy a building) shoot on a guy behind a car, do not hit him himself once while killing everyone (but 3) and then the guy takes out a flame removal (to kill the rest 3), you realize that the Greek summer sky filled with stars is too good to be distracted by a movie like this!
