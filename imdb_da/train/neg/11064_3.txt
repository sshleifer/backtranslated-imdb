Well, it's hard to add comment after reading what is already here, but I feel I have to say something. I did not search for 'a splatter party' as someone puts it or even 'blood and gut / gore'. I have some respect for the victims' relatives, even though I really felt the filmmaker didn't. -They were nameless, faceless and meaningless. Just a vessel for Dahmer's sexual antics. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with the kind of morbid curiosity that makes me think 'What makes a guy a serial killer?' as well as wondering the specifications of the Dahmer story that I know very little about. People here think that the film did not have to cover the events of the Dahmer story. I.U. his story, what happened when he got caught, aftermath, etc. but that's important! You see, I suppose if you are American, you will know all this. We don't all live in America. Telling this story of such a man as he was, of course, requires that at least some of the story and the actual events be told / shown. This does not mean blood and gut, there are ways to show terrible things in a movie implicitly or cleverly filming without resorting to acting. Without touching any of what he did (I found out more about him reading the user comments on this site!) Felt the movie as a void. A moment in time with very little substance. I would like to know if there is a movie about REAL Dahmer, because with its lack of direction, very slow pace that never changes, strange portrayal of homosexuality and the very unfortunate lack of any attempt at an end, this movie is bad. I don't recommend anyone wasting the time it takes to see it. One particular of 10 (for the actor!)
