I just get some of the big rooms in this episode - that Miranda is so remarkable and there is something so ugly it would make you crazy. Someone here commented that it may be the frequency of the light waves or something rather than being ugly. Miranda is just a jerk. The episode is slow, inconsistent and far too talky. I also don't quite understand why Kolos is an ambassador - why does the federation just associate the marvelous Medusans? There is a part I like when Kolos speaks through Spock about the loneliness of the human experience. Overall, I love TOS, and even when it is paralyzed, I will always tune in. This episode, though - mmm, I wouldn't buy it except for a used copy below $ 3.
