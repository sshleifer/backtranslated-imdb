I have a copy of this on VHS, I think they (The TV Networks) should play this every year for the next twenty years. So we do not forget what was and we do not remember to make the same mistakes again. Like putting some people in the director's chair where they don't belong. This movie Rappin 'is like a vaudevillian musical, for those who cannot sing or act. This movie is as fun as trying to teach the 'blind' to run a city bus. <br /> <br /> John Hood, (Peebles) just got out of prison and he's headed back to the Old Quarter. To make time for an absolutely necessary crime of necessity, of course. John heads back on the old street and is greeted by old-fashioned ladies and his friends when they dance and sing all the way. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this if I was sentimental, or if indeed any smoking pots prescribed by a doctor for glaucoma. Whatever it is a poorly managed, scripted, acted and self-produced (I never thought I had been sitting there) satire of ghetto life with the 'Hood'. Though I believe in the redeeming part of the story, through the wannabe giant fighting sequences and dance numbers, his friends care about their neighbors and want to save the ghetto from being torn down and cleared up. <br /> <br /> Forget about Sonny happening, Mario could have won an Oscar for that relative to this Rap. Well, if you find yourself wanting to laugh even silly and three-quarters embarrassed, be sure to drink first. <br /> <br /> Please look responsibly. (No stars, better luck next time!)
