Roy Rogers stars like Jesse James and his appearance, gambler man Clint Burns. George "Gabby" Hayes is Mr. Rogers' ex-pal, Sheriff Gabby. Gale Storm (Jane Fillmore) and Sally Payne (Polly Morgan) are a remarkable team that two journalists are looking for stories of the fierce prohibition hero. Of course, wrong identity / imitation is a plot development, as Rogers prepares a "dual role". Rogers is charming as usual; But there is nothing that really raises this his usual performance - any potential to deliver a memorable Jekyll / Hyde performance is made of poor material. The better couple to see is Ms Storm and Ms Paye as St. Louis Journal journalists - they are the highlight of the film. The songs are fine but poorly synchronized. <br /> <br /> *** Jesse James at Bay (1941) Joseph Kane ~ Roy Rogers, George 'Gabby' Hayes, Gale Storm
