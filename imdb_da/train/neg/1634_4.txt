BEGIN SPOILER: Appropriate fun and memorable for Mr. Chong's literal smoking smoke scene: Chong cold marshes a caste cockroach in his bowl, lights up, coughs and hacks violently for an apparent eternity, then with perfect aplomb and not skipping a stroke, reloading the bowl properly, reverberating, re-charging. END SPOILER. Unfortunately, I began to lose faith less than halfway through the case. It happened to me that the defective duo is very unpleasant and less than relative. I have come to appreciate the relative sophistication of modern stoners, Harold and Kumar. I just prefer lighter company. Still, the movie is probably a perfect fit for baked frat bridges or those viewers who are so weak to be surrendered by a stoner when they - the former are sober. Remarkable guest growth by Paul Reuben's spouting obscenities in pre-Pee-wee form.
