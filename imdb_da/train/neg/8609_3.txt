If you've seen Rodney Dangerfield's previous films and performances, you'll recognize several of the jokes made in this odd piece of drunk. Written as a sitcom, this movie fails to find any kind of chord throughout, from the self-help doctor played by the sexy-as-chopped live Molly Shannon to 'I'm fat and therefore fun' John Linette. The 5 wives themselves are equally sympathetic, and if it had been done as a pilot for an action-adventure series, it could have worked. Instead, it looks like a male fantasy that is trying hard not to be politically incorrect.
