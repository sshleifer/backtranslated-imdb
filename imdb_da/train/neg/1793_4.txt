An interesting concept of vampyrism has something to do with a virus. (But done several times now) In general, the film is too long and takes a little. The editing could have been tighter. I'm sorry to hear about the problem with the credits. Maybe the movie was rushed to the market. The lighting was too dark in places. But the worst technical problem is the sound. The level was good enough to hear the dialogue, but many of the interiors have a sonar for them, which is very distracting. Either they were not careful in the recording, or the sound mix could have been better. Also too much background noise came through. They should have made someone sound effects for martial arts scenes. The Tinny sound of swords that hit together was not the sound of an epic battle. Especially in the battle scenes, editing had to be tighter. <br /> <br /> The play was also a little flat. I'm sorry, but when I see that same person writes and stars in a movie, in my opinion, it's a red flag. But it was a good bet so I gave it a 4.
