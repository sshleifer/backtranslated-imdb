I can hardly believe that this inert, agile and badly staged movie is of a filmmaker whose other works I have enjoyed. The experience of enduring LADY AND DUKE (and no other word but "persistent" will do), left me in a dizzying mood, a state eased only by reading the IMDb user comment from ali-112. For not only has Rohmer tried (successfully) made us see the world through genre art from the 18th century France, but as ali has pointed out, it has shown (at the expense of alienating his audience) the effects of both class consciousness and the revolution it inspired through the eyes of a creepy elitist woman in her times. The director has achieved something unthinkable difficult, but I wonder if it was worth doing it for him to do it - or for us to see the dull results of his work.
