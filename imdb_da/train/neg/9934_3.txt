As a casual listen to the Rolling Stones, I thought it might be interesting. Not so, as this movie is very 'of its age' in the 1960s. For me (someone born in the 1980s) it just seems to me as a hippy purist propaganda crap, but I'm sure this movie wasn't made for me, but people who were active during the 60s. I expected drugs galore with thones, I was disappointed, it actually showed the reality, the hard work of the studio. So much I felt as though I was working with them to come to a conclusion of this godly horrible movie. I have not seen any of the directors other films, but I suppose they follow a similar form to control a kind of "amatuerish" which gave a feeling like the TV show Eurotrash, badly directed, sticky compound and lacking entertainment value. My only good opinion about this is that I didn't waste money on it, it came off with a Sunday paper.
