A very flat modern (holding the sensual hip) refreshes on the Dracula story (though staying with traditional customs) with a quite interesting, if not fully understood, backdrop of the Dark Prince. The first time I tried to see it, I could only do it halfway through before I lost interest. Again it goes to a good start (especially the scenes with the thieves and then their meetings with Dracula), but then for me it became less involved when it hit New Orleans to focus on Van Helsing's daughter. A great place to set it up, but never took advantage of its settings (despite etching a paradise in the foreground where Dracula could flourish). Produced by Wes Carven (and yes they cast that name out there), but written / directed by Patrick Lussier. Artistically, it had its moments with few dreamlike pictures, but some kinetic edits and cheap jokes do not help. That messy script becomes very stupid. Lussier does a polished job that remains fairly glassy, ​​inserts a lot of blood (the makeup is appropriately achieved) and a lot of "virgin" advertising. No, I don't mean virgins, it's the music company that comes in many shots and Helsing's daughter also works there. Oh it was not obvious planting. The soundtrack is an entertaining choice of rock tunes. Now the shows are all over the store, but there are few known faces to look at (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlyn Munro). Gerard Butler as Dracula just didn't come out, as not much of a presence was formed. He was simply out of the shade of the juicy ladies at night; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan as Dracula's brides. Like Jonny Lee Millar and Justine Waddell are respectably okay. Christopher Plummer gives a grizzled ride as Van Helsing and Omar Epps have fun with his role.
