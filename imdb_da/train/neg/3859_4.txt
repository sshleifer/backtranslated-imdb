Jason Lee does his best to bring fun to a silly situation, but the movie just fails to connect. <br /> <br /> Perhaps because Julia Stile's character seems awkward as the creepy and sexy, who is soon cousin. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's because she and Selma Blair's characters should have been thrown the opposite way. (Selma Blair seems more pampering than Julia would be). Either way, this movie is yet another Hollywood trivialization of a possible real-world situation (staying trapped with your pants on your bachelor party, not bending your cousin), who with promise fails to deliver. <br /> <br /> There are some laughs to be assured of, and the cast (though miscast) does their best with subclass material that does not exceed its healthy subject. So instead of getting a successful raunch party (ie Animal House or American Pie) we are back with a medium-sized portion of humor and some stupidity (ala Meatball's 2 or something).
