"I'm a cartoon!" "You are an illustration!" what does it suppose to mean? This plot could not be worse as a boy who is afraid of everything, becomes very brave at the end of the movie because he went into a library. The only purpose of this celluloid waste was to encourage American children to read when a cheaper and more efficient way of doing this could have been a number of advertisements! Even Macaulay Culkin's talents (like the child), Christopher Lloyd (as the so predictable "he is a Page Master" librarian), could save this senseless movie from the boring plot. Even the voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart, (himself) Leonard Nimoy, or the Hollywood god's voice, Frank Welker as cartoon characters, do not ever save it. I can only describe it as a 1990's similar to the regularly awful 1978 adaptation of Water Babies, because the gentle animation makes the movie worse and does not improve the stupid plot!
