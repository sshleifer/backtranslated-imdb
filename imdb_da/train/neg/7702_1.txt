I am a black man who lives in a predominantly black city. That said, I have some great concerns about Tyler Perry's work. I realize some people out there have to praise him because he is black and tries to portray a positive image about the culture. But I honestly think Perry White would have had this NAACP, Al Sharpton and Jessie Jackson all their ass. I have been forced to watch this movie one hell of a lot recently, and every repetitive display makes my blood boil. The characters are poorly written and acted. The jokes are so bad I actually have to know that something has to be fun. I'll just break this big pile of sh-t down. <br /> <br /> Madea = suck. The character may have had some appeal, but it does not matter anymore. When the only thing she ever seems to do is bite around children and threaten adults with violence, she is less than useless. She is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The situation with the wife was horsesh-t. If a woman was so afraid of her husband's death, why should she try to run away when he sleeps in bed. Wouldn't have made more sense for her to leave when he was at work. In any case, the signs in this bow were so annoying and indulgent that I hoped he would throw her out of the balcony and become a generous ticket when he didn't. <br /> <br /> Then there are the two lovebirds. A bus driver asks a woman by harassing her while making his rounds. I could not believe it. I really couldn't believe when she went in to go out with him even more. But what takes the cake is that an adult man was reduced to throwing pebbles on a window and passing notes like a ten year old by a castrating mega bitch. I do not use this expression easily, but that woman had only two states. Morose victim and psycho momma. Whichever of these two faces she showed, there was a constant. The bus driver would not get anything. He married herself without trying the tests - WTF! <br /> <br /> There is the family reunion scene. Here we have the mother load, which includes implicit incestual taboos, grinding for grinding, shameless, excessive muscles, b-ball and the great taste of Maya Angelou. When the babies dragged their bucks outside and called a meeting, I was wrong to wish the elders of them were asserted by a heart attack. All this bush is going on at the reunion, in ridiculously easy to separate groups, and then they call a bell. When they do, everyone drops what they do and also speaks to each other, like a package of Pavlov's dogs - WTF !! <br /> <br /> Then you have the last five minutes of the movie. In it, we see the fierce fianc√© being handled by his long-time victim and the entire bad actress. There is an impromptu wedding where black people are dressed as angels and hang from the ceiling - WTF !!! The only reason to see it so far beyond testing your threshold for pain is the hope that the other villain in this story will have her ass handed over to her too. Guess what, it doesn't. Instead, Perry takes the testicular challenge and plays it safely, and finishes the movie on a forgiveness note - WTF !! <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure if I get one day, I might write a doctoral thesis on every way this movie sucks. Don't even get me started on the rest of Tyler Perry's movie. I just want to say this. In my opinion, as a black guy, D.W. Griffith's legacy lives on. The irony is that it does it through a black man who will be praised for doing what Born of a Nation did and selling us down the river. I just wished Perry's film was duded so I could kick them in the nuts. Many thanks, guy !! What will you follow in 2009, a comedy about rape and fierce slaughter of slaves in Colonial America?
