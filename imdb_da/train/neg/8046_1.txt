None? Didn't think so! Well, all you have to do is stay far away from "Want to know a secret" as it is only the profoundly meaningless post-scream slasher with absolutely no redeeming value at all. The reason is extremely ridiculous; the characters are incredibly stupid, the gor factor is insignificant, and the whole thing is just boring! As you can derive from the title already, this movie is primarily inspired by "I still know what you were doing last summer" when the events take place in a similar setting and the killer is just as stupid. Why anyone would like to steal junk ideas like "IKWYDLS" is still a complete mystery. At least, this movie could depend on Jennifer Love Hewitt's precious rack, while the girls in this junk are, except for the brainless, also terribly uninteresting. One year after the still unsolved murder of his girlfriend, Beth Morgan, her new haughty lover and four other simple college students go to Florida to spend their Spring Break vacation in a fancy beach house. The killer hasn't made a move all year, but now he's following the possen to Florida and starting slaughtering them while leaving the title as a kind of business card. You really don't have to be a horror expert to quickly find out which face is hiding behind the unlikely ridiculous mask, and the author's attempt to put you on the wrong track is quite embarrassing. As the plot is so thin, most of the film is purely irrelevant, including the sub-plots of the incompetent Florida police force and the "mysterious" FBI inspector who seems to have a personal score to settle. The murder inexplicably happens off screen (doesn't hate it when it happens?), There is not even any free T&A to enjoy and you better not get me started on the quality of the dialogs. Passion through crap like this only makes you aware that the lovely spirit of the slashers of the 80s has gone too well.
