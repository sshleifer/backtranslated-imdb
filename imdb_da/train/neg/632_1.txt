Well, what was it fun ... except for the fun. <br /> <br /> It's my second least favorite so far, I even thought it was worse than 'Lazarus' and 'Ghost in the Machine'. <Br /> <br /> Let's start with the good. Teaser, it was incredibly well done and also emotionally. Being the great wildlife I am, it was fun to see so many beautiful animals in this episode. <br /> <br /> But then there are all the bad, and believe me there is a lot of it. A little sensible, so they were abducted by foreigners and impregnated? whaaa ??? The dialogue was also quite awful. There were about one or two quotation lines. <br /> <br /> Worst of all, when I nearly killed all the animals, it was very unpleasant to me. Finally ... what is the point? they all died quite a bit. We didn't learn anything, we were not entertained, and I couldn't even find Sophia's death sad ... just very frustrating. <br /> <br /> * star. shame because season 2 did so well.
