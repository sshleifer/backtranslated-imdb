A pretty obvious thriller-city number where the only possible twist turns out to be hidden from nothing. I mainly looked at the English-language performance of Isabelle Huppert. It wasn't amazing, but then it was a strange role. I wouldn't be surprised if half of her contributions turned out to be left on the living room floor room along with several last minute script rewrites. The play is the least appealing thing about this movie. Steve Guttenburg looks as if he is trying to exhaust his role with the charm that everyone has told him he has. There is a sensational stupid sequence where it is suggested that his sexual skill will be able to help treat PTSD. It is an uninteresting achievement. Elizabeth McGovern is more tied with true charm and character, but it is little comfort. 3.10
