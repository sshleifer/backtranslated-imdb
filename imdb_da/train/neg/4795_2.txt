It seems that this is the only movie that Johnsaxon has ever directed and that he had the good sense of stopping after it and remaining in front of the camera. This movie is a dog, from start to finish, and it is boring and wood with nothing much to go to it. A Vietnam war hero takes a job that works for a mob boss, becomes a little too friendly with the wife, and then the wife is killed by the bully boss and the war helmet and sent to prison, deaths, specifically. Now this prison has experimented with inmates and tests some formulas that will make men the ultimate killer (a zombie). Of course, everything goes wrong, and then all these infected people are trapped in the prison, some of which turn into zombies and the rest, which suddenly just won't be there anymore. This just goes on and on again with nothing much to show or say for itself, and I stopped it before the end, which seemed to come a few times, but no, it seemed to be only set to go on a different and just as boring road. If you looked at the end, they may well become a zombie yourself, so you do not risk it. 2 out of 10
