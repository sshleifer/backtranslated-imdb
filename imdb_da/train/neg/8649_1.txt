This movie fails unlucky at all levels. I have an idea, let's take everyone involved in this movie and send them to a hot zone in the Middle East. Maybe if we are lucky, they will all be shot and killed, and we will never waste our time on them again. Did I mention that I have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap throughout my life? My God, I can't think of anything I've ever seen, it was so bad. I'd rather see Ishtar 25 times in a row than sitting through 10 minutes of this apologetic excuse for a movie. If I ever get to meet someone involved in this movie, I spit in their face and beat them so pointless. It's my two cents.
