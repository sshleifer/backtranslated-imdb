The film is about a young man, Michael, who cares about the elderly. One day he decides to kill some of his client's relatives. About the same time he decides to model his killing of the Zodiac Killer from the 60s. He comes in contact with the author of a book on Zodiac Killer and they form a friendship. Michael has a gun (the only gun that it apparently is in the hands of some of the other actors, only portrayed as the same gun). And he goes out a-killin '. Original. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie if you like B movies. I thought the idea of ​​the movie was good, but the editing and play really drowned. I thought the "blood" was just too fake, the lighting was awful in some places, and the dialogue was just for standard. The movie was shot on video, which is okay, but editing the movie has just been made for some weird 'Plan 9' scenes. Not a bad movie for fans of the B-movie genre, but if you want something with a little more polish, move on to something else.
