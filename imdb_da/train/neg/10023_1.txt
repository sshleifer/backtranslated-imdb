Shame on Yash Raj movie and Aditya Chopra who have apparently lost their intelligence over the years and provided a stable fare in this movie that is not even worthy of You Tube standards. I struck my teeth throughout the girl and began to end with the schizophrenic direction, a plot line that was never completely materialized, and on the last scene I just felt too ashamed that my country and its crorepathy filmmakers can "TROW AWAY" crores on such stupidity. Shame the actors to take this job and even comment on it as some work they can own. Saif Ali Khan - totally disappointed with your choice of film. Kareen shows enough skin for the affected puberty, and Akshay comes up as the fungus. Anil another retard with a pubescent fascination for English. His cronies were commendable in their plays and with the bizarre filmography scattered in the last 15 minutes, it was enough to pop a blood vessel. Don't forget any brain cells, energy or your money to see this. Go SE / Rent AMU with Konkana Sensharma instead - a beautiful piece of independent film that ever comes out of India. Intelligent, Exciting, and Wonderful History It will touch everyone with intelligent actors and gave me hope that everything is not lost in Indian cinema production.
