Spoilers ahead - continue on your own caution. <br /> <br /> My main problem with this movie is that when Harry learns the identity of the three chanters - with relative ease - he continues to cave their demands. And then deciding the whole scene with his wife to be kidnapped, he decides to tie up his classic car to explode (with the money in it), which makes us take a rather large logistics principle. Okay, so he wanted to keep his affair with Cini out of the public eye because of his wife's involvement in the DA campaign. I can see this, but why not hire someone to relax these trips a little or even kill them when he had determined that there was no real blackmail (eg Cini's body?) This was a pretty interesting movie for the first 2/3 of it. After that it's kind of falling apart.
