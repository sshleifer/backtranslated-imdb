This was the WORST Christmas movie I've ever seen. I took my two young children to see this. It was the darkest, most stupid plot - the family has no money, mother loses her job, father is killed in the bank, bank robber steals family car with both children in the back and after high-speed trains, drives from the bridge and drowns them in the river. Mother is back alone No wonder her anniversary is gone. Christmas camps do not save children who have drowned, and Santa does not bring back dead fathers! I thought it was the WORST message to send children. Better to tell them that there is no Santa than show them a movie like this !!
