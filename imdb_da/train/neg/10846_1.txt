Not since Caligula I have considered turning off the movie halfway through .... but then with this I was only 15 minutes when I considered. Unfortunately, I did it all the way through. Make sure you don't. <br /> <br /> It's not that Cradle of Fear is shocking or gory or scary or scary or scary. It's that it's not one of those things, but it will desperately be all of them. Instead, it is boring, tired, plain, predictable and unnecessarily poorly executed (shot on video, high school special effects, no sense of even basic visual storytelling, dialogue barely audible ... not worth hearing). <Br /> <br /> This movie is evidence of the argument that even the straight-to-video distributors have to draw a line in the sand somewhere.
