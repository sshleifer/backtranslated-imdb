I really wanted to like this movie. I absolutely love the kenny hotz, and spenny rice has a charming side to him. Not that I like spenny at all. Spenny destroys this movie. He should let Kenny and his hot girlfriend film the movie. In any case, it is rather boring except for a scene with Roger Ebert in it. There really aren't many celebrities in this movie, and most don't seem to say more than one line. Overall, this movie was disappointing. I would only suggest seeing it if you got it with season 1 DVD of kenny vs spenny (it comes free on the third disk). Regardless of this production, I am still very excited to check out The Papel Chase.
