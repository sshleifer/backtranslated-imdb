There is simply no need to try to glorify any part of this movie. <br /> <br /> It was just a rubbish bin. In the beginning you may think that you are part of a visually stunning piece of filmography ... and so soon after you are hit with a big case The fighting is hardly martial arts, the play is teetering on the edge of the couple and the music is not worth to describe. There is just enough of a story to have made an excuse for this movie being made. The decisions that the characters make and the way they handle the situations are weak, and did nothing but frustrate me. I think the only reason this movie came to be a bit of fan service was to use Yumiko Shaku.
