The "Meatball Machine" has to be one of the most complicated ridiculous, horrible and exaggerated sci-fi horror movies I've ever encountered. It is about good against evil and an eternal history of history with the purpose of entertaining with bloody, insidious and humorous context. Because of this, the violence is not very cruel, and it does not make you swell, but the free anemia and nudity are free. The performances of Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka are the worst I have seen, if not enough, it is also led by an unheard-of director called Yudai Yamaguchi. This movie just has it all, it's bad for the leg! One must watch for every b movie freak !!! ... Simply: a enjoy and rare gem.
