There have been some funny movies about spirits coming out of Hollywood. Cary Grant was an angel in "The Bishop's Wife" (1947). Of course, the best Topper films were in the late 30s-early 40s. And recently, Warren Beatty's "Heaven Can Wait" (1978), a remake of the 1941's "Here comes Mr. Jordan." These were well-written, fun and entertaining comedies, all centered on supernatural creatures such as ghosts and angels. Now, writer director Jeff Lowell will make his feature film debut with a story of an unlikely, bitchy young woman, Kate (Eva Longoria Parker) who is killed on her wedding day and then comes back to harass the burgeoning spiritualist, Ashley (Lake Bell ) that falls to Kate's fiance, Henry (Paul Rudd). One thing that is clear at first: Longoria Parker is no Constance Bennett (Marion Kerby in the first two "Tops" films), who is the standard against whom all female ghosts are measured. <br /> <br /> There's a line right at the beginning when Henry's sister, Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) tells Henry, "you're not smiling." It probably described my situation throughout this movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the movie is that the script is just not very fun. But it has become worse for Longoria Parker's presence, which just gave me the wrong way every time she appeared on the screen. Just to get started on compensating her lack of comic talent, is she covered in so much pancake makeup who knows what she really looks like? Kate is killed while she is setting up her wedding at a falling frozen statue. She is so unreasonable that the angel who instructs her what her afterlife is about goes out to her (well, she actually just fades out), so Kate finds herself back on the ground as a ghost without knowing what her mission is. <br /> <br /> Chloe wants Henry to look from the funk that he has naturally been after Kate's death (from what I saw of Kate, he should have felt a wonderful relief), so she introduces him to Ashley, who really don't 'I don't know what she does as a spiritualist (she's also a cateress to get the ends to meet) to see if she can get Henry back in touch with Kate. There is a lot of meshugaas going on. <br /> <br /> The film's vacuum is the epitome of a "B" story about Ashley's assistant, Dan (Jason Biggs). This is thrown at almost the end, but the way Ashley handles it indicates that she is as much of a boob as Kate. When Dan apparently is attracted to both of these severely weak women, he deserves what he gets. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Kate looks out to Ashley and the fun must begin. It doesn't, and more is sorry, because in other hands it could have been quite fun. As is, Norman Z. McLeod, Constance Bennett, Roland Young, Alan Mowbray, and Co. transform into their graves to see that this is what their brilliance in the first two "Tops" films has done.
