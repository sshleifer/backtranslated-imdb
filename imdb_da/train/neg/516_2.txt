Have you ever noticed how, in his later films, Burt Reynolds sounds like screaming brakes? <br /> <br /> Should have hung out with Hal Needham too much. <br /> <br /> And from the look of "Stroker Ace", WAY too much. <br /> <br /> Can you believe this was based on a book? I couldn't either, but it was. And probably not a best seller, I will bet. <br /> <br /> Burt is another old-fashioned boy in the NASCAR circuit, associated with Beatty as a fried chicken magnet with designs on his team. Anderson gives what love is interested, and Nabors makes his deepest Gomer Pyle impression as a faithful mechanic / best friend Lugs. <br /> <br /> Many people here are friends of Burt or Hal's. Others must have had the work. And even real NASCAR drivers get into the action and seem to have more talent than those with SAG cards. <br /> <br /> As far as laughs, Bubba Smith (before the "Police Academy") gets them as Beatty's driver. And Petersen, in full Elvira mode, gets lots of valued teachers like a lady who wants to get to know Lugs really well. Really good. It's a shame that Burt threw so much time and effort into a movie as "Stroker Ace" where it didn't matter if he was bothering to act or not. They didn't interfere with writing a character to him, why bother to act? <br /> <br /> Two stars. Mostly for Petersen, and for the end at the end. Now they are funny.
