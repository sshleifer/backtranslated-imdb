I'm a big fan of the TV series Largo Winch. This movie was pain for me. I had to use fast rather than fall asleep. It was boring! How can anyone destroy this title so much? The story was the only good thing. Actors were sh.t. They can't live the role. The main actor (Tom ...) is a zero. See the other roles of this actor. The fighting situations were incredibly boring and did not result, somehow they were not following the situation. As other reviewers said, low budget movies with bad actors. Maybe next time someone can do better things out of this title. French can't do the right thing with big movies, like Alien 4. It was a bit brrr, after Alien 1,2,3.
