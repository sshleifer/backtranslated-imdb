If the only sex you've ever had is with a farm animal, then the roof line for this movie is probably still misleading. <br /> <br /> This is by far one of the most boring movies I've had the pleasure of trying to watch last. I found the DVD lying in my friend's house, and I made the sad mistake of not burning it. <br /> <br /> I can't tell any details without damaging the movie because there are only about 5 details for this movie. Just try to imagine someone making a movie about things on c-span. Only the fictional film is 10 times less interesting than the most boring c-span debate. I think there is a conspiracy somewhere in this movie, but I wasn't able to tell exactly what it was after I gouched my eyeballs out and threw them at Richard Gere.
