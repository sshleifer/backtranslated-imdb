The signs are clich√© and predictable, as everyone is either snow-white clean or completely evil. The play is too stylized to be bad in an entertaining, over-the-top way. It's doubly disappointing if you're a Bette Davis fan because her character is not a typical fun Bette-Davis type character; She just gets a lot of decking. <br /> <br /> Overall, neither my wife nor I have found the movie to be interesting, moving or enjoyable at all.
