This game was made by Sega. Being made by Sega, I didn't expect much, but I don't expect this tax either. Initially, the camera angles work against you in this game. The engine is your means of getting around. The engine is the worst part of the game. When you run into something, you just keep there and you are not moving. You never fall off the bike or ruin for that matter. The protagonist hardly speaks, even though he has a voice that suits him. The graphics are horrible. You drive through trees on your bike. The camera makes it possible to fight the enemy. This game wouldn't even be worth renting.
