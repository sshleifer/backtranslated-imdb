It doesn't even tell a review, except as a warning to potential viewers. It is a somewhat generic ghost story about an actress who appreciates a study during the recording of a WWII period drama. There is no anxiety involved, no excitement at all or any surprises. A shocking moment that looks a little silly to being shocking. The visual style is very flat and boring, although there are some really nice edits once in a while. The story never comes together, and the movies are really just a total bust. 10.4.
