This intentionally bizarre adaptation of Borges short story is typically Cox. His strong visual sense is, as usual, enchanted by the shaking half-baked appearance of most of the casting. The film is surely in the surreal tradition of Bunuel's Mexican period and sometimes looks like a poor man takes on Lars Von Trier's Crime Elements. Cox's apparent preference for single take, jump cut, and ambient sound recording works against film efficiency. Worth to see, but ultimately disappointing.
