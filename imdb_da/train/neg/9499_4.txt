I thought the movie was a bad documentary. No content was discussed. It seemed to be cheaper ideas and did not give anything new. The film was odd or romantic or something that would really drive one into science. Most scientists seemed "stereotypical" and sometimes weird. One woman said her prizes had no meaning, only children who were helped. She said it after a 10 minute scene, explaining all her prices. To play "humble scientist" are we? "I have equations dancing in my head," another said. I can't see how this explains anything to us. It has not covered significant effects of science on our culture. Science policy was barely touched. <br /> <br /> Not a bad flick for a 10-14 year old. Other than that, I felt it was boring and unattainable. <br /> <br /> 4/10
