The premise of the movie is creepy: a woman becomes pregnant when she is kissed by a stranger in a bar. <br /> <br /> But as soon as the movie begins, a horrible opening scene shows that this is a C-type Sci-Fi TV movie. It's a big Star Trek and a bit of X files, but more than anything else, it's boring. <br /> <br /> When the movie starts, everything is predictable and clich√©. It looked more like a 2 party in a bad Sci-Fi TV series. No voltage and no voltage, but not for missing experiments. Just a lot of predictable dramatic conflicts between the protagonists. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time.
