I used to love this movie as a kid, but see it again 20+ years later, it actually sucks. Up The Academy could have been ahead of the time back in 1980, but it has almost nothing to offer today! Movies like Caddyshack and Stripes are much better today than this steaming dog play. No T&A. No big jokes except for the one-liners we've all heard a million times now. <br /> <br /> I recently bought the DVD in the hope that it would be the gem I remembered it was. Well, I was completely gone! The soundtrack had only 2-3 widely recognizable hits (not smash compilation others had mentioned) and the frequent voice-overs were terrible. The only thing that was interesting to me predicted what the lines of the sign were before they told them. Yep, I saw this movie so much back then! <br /> <br /> The only reason to write this review is to give my two cents why this movie is to be forgotten, sorry to say. :(
