The battle scenes play as slow motion Jackie Chan, and the attempt on white is pathetic (worst proverb: "Guess what? This time I heard you coming"). The stars are a mismatched couple: Brandon Lee, despite the terrible lines he has to say, actually shows traces of charisma and screen charm - things Dolph Lundgren is completely free of (at least in this movie). Note to the instructor: Stay away from any love scene, especially when your main role will not do any nudity, and you have to rely on a body double. (* 1/2)
