This is it. This is the one. This is the worst movie ever made. Ever. It beats everything. I have never seen worse. Return the trophy and give it to these people ..... There is just no comparison. Even three days after seeing this (for some reason I still don't know why), I can't believe how crazy this horrible movie is / was. It's so bad. So far from anything that could be considered a movie, a story or something that should ever have been created and brought into our existence. <br /> <br /> This made me wonder if people really get put on this land. It made me feel disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe. This type of film sincerely makes us a society. We should be ashamed. I really cannot emphasize that our global responsibility as people living here and creating art is that we must prevent the creation of these gross distortions of our reality for our own benefit. It's a nuisance. I don't know how in the world any of these actors, writers, or the director of this movie sleep at night, knowing they had a role in making "Loaded". I do not know what kind of obnoxious monsters enjoy watching these types of movies. <br /> <br /> That said, I love a good "bad" movie. I love Shark Attack 3, I love Bad Taste, they are HILARIOUS. I tell all my friends to see them because they are "bad". <br /> <br /> But this ....... crosses the "bad" line to a whole new dimension. This is awkwardly bad. This is the bad where you know everything that needs to happen, every line, every action, every death, every sequence before they happen. And not just like a second or two before, I mean as having seen the first 5 minutes before. <br /> <br /> Every cheesy "effect" editing is shamelessly used again and again for a disease. I really will never see the "appalling" camera "drug buzz rush" effect or cutter or cut cuts or ENGEN FANCY CUT EVER. This is carefully boring, repetitive and just torturing the audience. <br /> <br /> But ....... and let me be specific here, the most devastating thing about this movie is what, in view of the production, it seems like a somewhat decent amount of money actually was put into this excrement. I will personally address the director's shoulders if I ever see him and shake him for submission, and demand that he run home and turn off two gallons of Drain-O, or I will do it for him. <br /> <br /> If we ever need a new kind of inhuman torture for our prisoners of war abroad, just show them this movie in a padded cell over and over again. Trust me, I think they will be more extravagant with suicide methods after the 72nd time to sit through this. Stop these movies, they are just the most in vain of all facets in our society. Please. Stop. NOW.
