Looking forward to watching this movie and watching these great actors perform. However, I was disappointed with the script and the whole story of the story. David Duchovny, (Dr. Eugene Sands), "Connie & Carla", 04, was the doctor of history who uses drugs and loses his license to practice medicine. Dr. Sands visited a nightclub and was able to use his medical experience to help a wounded customer and was assisted by Angelina Jolie, (Claire), "Taking Life", "04, who is immediately attracted to Dr. David Sands. Timothy Hutton, (Raymond Blossom), "Kinsey", '04, plays Big Shot Gangster and a man with all sorts of money and connections Timothy Hutton seems to be acting in most scenes and is completely out of his mind and trying to keep his gang members from Gary Dourdan, (Yates), "CSI-Vegas TV Series", plays a major supporting role and portrays a true COOL DUDE, a body guard for Raymond Blossom, Angelina Jolie looks beautiful and sexy with Its ruby-red lips attract a lot of attention from all the men, this film is not the biggest, but it entertaines.
