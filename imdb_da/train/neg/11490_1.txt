I have to agree with most everyone's opinion that this show was poorly produced as well as in writing. The action was not much more than the lower production values, but I feel that an actor can only rely on the material provided to them and make the best of it. In line with this line of thought, I believe it is important to point out that an actor has risen and far beyond this campy to tasteful production to become a respectable and rather talented performer. I refer to Laura Harris a Canadian born actor who has etched her way through many poorly produced shows and movies to find a place on HBO hit "Dead Like Me" where she plays the role of Daisy Adair and to her credit she handles this role effectively. I remember having a typical boy offense at the young actress in this series where she played Ashley a soft spoken yet intelligent 7th degree. I felt like someone could "do it" from this series, it would probably be Laura Harris And true to her nature, she excels in the actor field to gain respect for many manufacturers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique Nordic blonde allure. If you ever have the opportunity to see this series, I recommend that you have something epic to look for departments like "godfather" or maybe "beaches" to remind you that after all, there is a great genuine production integrity and appreciates out there and that this series is only a low budget reminder of what Laura Harris can simply mention about her time on the show, and I bet she would quote many young people's actors word of defense by saying "It's a start!"
