... just look at the poor Robert Webber character (good performance again!) who is trying to fight a sub-machine gun from one of the terrorists. Everything in this movie seems to be a little wrong. The biggest mistake in my opinion is the effort to give the action a solid footing in reality in the early 1980s (the fundamental difference between this flick and the far more amazing, ironic and therefore timeless Die Hard). The story comes through as a failed attempt to glorify the SAS commands. Ideas like when a command screams down "all good guys do it and all evil boys don't do it so they can blow away ad lib (with a good conscience) that the protagonist is not knocked down by gas masked commands. Even though he wears the same clothes and wears a weapon from their arsenal, it just seems unlikely and makes it difficult to take the film seriously, and it just happens that it is trying to be more than just fun. signal episode ... I don't mind criticism of the pacifist movement as a shield of malefactors and the arguments between the peace fanatics and the resident, self-governing representatives of the power of this movie, but the political commentary is quite lame and uninspired. The film has an early performance of Judy Davies, she plays the greatest fanatic and seems to have done extensive research on the "subject." Anyway, her performance is a notch above that of the others and Somehow I feel the film let her down.
