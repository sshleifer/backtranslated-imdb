The first in the series was brilliant, easily one of the best horror movies from time to time. This is the most crappiest. When I sat down to see this, I actually thought how bad the fourth and fifth were, it had to be good after the previous terrible. Boy was I wrong. Incredibly wrong. <br /> <br /> When I saw the first ten minutes of it, I was actually really tempted to turn it off, but I thought no, maybe it would improve. It didn't. <br /> <br /> Not only is this just a bleak movie of its own, it didn't need another sequel because the last two (fourth and fifth) had already been terrible enough! Also, how many times can you bring Freddy back? The act of it was terrible, the story was predictable and shit and it also had errors in it too. The way they made Springwood was just wrong. Pay no respect for the first in general. To add to this, it all seemed very over-the-top. <br /> <br /> Some people say this movie was "fun". This movie is not "fun" at all. Since when should Freddy Krueger be "fun"? I would call it funnily crap. This movie should be a Horror movie, not a comedy. If Freddy had a daughter, this information would not have the surface as in the first! The ending was also just stupid and cheesy, like the rest of it. This completely destroys the essence and uniqueness of the first. Just showing himself. <br /> <br /> Such a shame that Wes Craven created something so good at the beginning, but it has to be pulled down because of this bin in the bin. They shouldn't have even bothered to make this movie. Not any of the other successors except the third one. The third is the only decent one out of all the successors. <br /> <br /> If this was a DVD in itself and not part of the Nightmare On Elm Street DVD set that I got, I would have chucked it out when I got it. <br /> <br /> Summary: A pathetic and bad attempt at a sequel. <br /> <br /> - A complete MOCKERY of the first movie <br /> <br /> So don't waste your time on this worthless counter.
