This movie is so stupid it simply goes around the corner and becomes ridiculous. I wanted to see "Darkness falls" in fact and thought this was the movie. Boy, what a mistake! I spread as much as I could and I still couldn't get rid of the boring moments. I just enjoy the people who were paid to play or work on this movie. They were actually given money for this crap. Isn't that amazing? I mean in this movie that a man is killed and chopped in a wooden mill for small bloody pieces and a few minutes later the mother and the child speak quietly at the table as nothing has happened and drink coffee. Please! Come on! Who gives money for such crap movies? Oh, and the "tooth fairy" was paralyzed. Not scary at all and it was obvious that it is a boring stuntman wearing a badly made makeup.
