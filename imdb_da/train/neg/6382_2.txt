It's hard to know what went through Per Kristensen's and Morten Lindberg's heads when they wrote "Gayniggers from Outer Space" - the film is billed as a comedy, but there are no real jokes next to the raw sign names (Capt. B. Dick, Sgt. Shaved balls). The rest of the movie is a (presumably) unintentional fun affair with ridiculously in sync voice-overs (with the 'actors' reading their lines basically without feeling), 'futuristic' computer screens full of spelling mistakes and a plot that makes almost no sense. Although 65% of viewers have given this movie a perfect 10 out of 10, this is the complete opposite of what a good movie is. It may be entertaining to see with some friends, but this movie only deserves a '2' out of ten ... slightly higher than the lower possible rating only because of the sheer fact that the authors somehow managed to get some black guy to star in this movie.
