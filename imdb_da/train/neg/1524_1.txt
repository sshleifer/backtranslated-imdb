Words fail me. This movie was extremely difficult to see and in retrospect I really wish I hadn't done it. Even though I tried to get through to the final credit, I have to admit that I couldn't last more than an hour, so my opinion could be unfair. However, this movie would require the most impressive final third in the filmmaking story to get a review that is anything but malicious. <br /> <br /> Please do not see any part of this movie.
