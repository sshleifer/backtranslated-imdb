I want to say one thing about this movie: there are no lulls. You can't be bored with this. The problem is that it is too intensive. There is too much action and it needs lulls! That's the risk you take in modern action movies. You want it interesting, but not exaggerated. This is too excessive. Although the play is fine and contains a few "names" in Gary Busey and Roy Scheider, it still has a B movie. The best part of it is Scheider's dialogue: the only "A" part of this "B" movie. The rest of the story is strictly Rambo mentality, but had a couple of standout scenes. One particular was a very innovative scene with landmines. It was memorable. Not enough of the other scenes were making this a keeper for too long.
