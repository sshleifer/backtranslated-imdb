First of all, if you're a fan of the comic, then you'll be very disappointed I'm sure! Make budget movie !!! Largo must be Serbian in the comic, now he suddenly becomes Croatian, pfff! The chicken producers, it gave some spices and gut to the comic (That way, his father speaks Serbian in the movie and he speaks Croatian ... Lol). The striking N.Y. Winch building becomes a common average small yacht in H.K. The great Largo gets a little pristine Tzigan / Turkish looking guy. Freddy the cold 'scarface' pilot gets some fat, out of shape, sad, average guy. Simon, Largo's good friend, doesn't exist at all !? He gave some pepper! Largo doesn't throw the knives at all, but just some snakes are staring ... The whole story is confused and resembles a pretentious television movie. French instructors and producers, if you don't have the money, the ability or the technology to properly adapt the cartoon, stick to some romance shot in Paris. Very very bad movie, good things I just rented it do not expect me to see the sequel (if any!).
