My kids see the show every day it's on. It is a good program for younger children. But they have to stop showing re-runs and do some more actual shows and get rid of Rooney's and Deedee's YELLOW TEETH. Moe is the only Doodle bop with pure white pearlie teeth, and the kids notice these things and ask if the 2 never brush their teeth? Show the show ever its way to the United States, and if so, where can we find its schedule. And another thing if we could add. You have to stop saving so much. Sometimes when you pop out of no where you scare the younger children, and what happens to pulling the rope? What does it mean? Others then get wet all the time. They must add newer items to their show instead of the same ole same ole. Children lose interest in that way.
