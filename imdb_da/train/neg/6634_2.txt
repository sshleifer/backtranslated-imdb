The first look at the cover of this image, it looks like a good rock n roll movie. But don't let the deck fool you, or the fact that Alice Cooper and Blondie are in it. The story is just awful, and it's also the actor. Simple and simple: BAD <br /> <br /> It's not a movie about a roadie, it's just a thin love story, so awful that you look right through it. The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack. Some good songs, and that's why I give 2 out of 10. If it wasn't for the music, it would have been 0 out of 10. Meat bread is a horrible actor (at least he was in 1980), and the girl who plays groupie doesn't even look good! This movie was a big disappointment to me, because it makes many promises.
