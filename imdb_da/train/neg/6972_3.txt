When I first saw the cover of this movie (a huge bug chasing a few nurses) And the name "Blue Monkey" I knew I was not in for any great Hollywood movie. I was pleasantly surprised to see Steve Railsback in this cheese ball girl who always does a good job in what role he tackles .... FX is pretty corny, not too much of a plot and I'm still not sure why this movie is called Blue Monkey because there is nothing in this movie to do with monkey. But come on people, what do you expect ?? It's not really as bad as it seems .... If you enjoy the old 50's style black and white bug attack movie, this is a basically updated version without the special FX updates
