Although I can see the potentially redeeming qualities of this movie by its intrigue, I certainly believed that the painfully long-standing nature of the stage structure was too much to ask most viewers. Huge gaps in the manuscript as it never explained, "your father died today" comment from the mother made it even harder to try to sense these characters. This won first place in Cannes in 2001, which is a shock considering. Perhaps the French were starving for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this movie. I understood the long scenes as a unit to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible, but when it matched the inability to relate to the main character, it went too far for me and kept me in arm's distance from history altogether. <br /> This is a movie for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no satisfaction from watching a movie when it is over. I LOVED movies like "Trainspotting" or "Requiem for a Dream" - which was far more disturbing, but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing. To see these teachers slowly and painfully silence the scene after the scene became just as redundant that I found it boring - and I really wanted to like this movie at every turn.
