Even if you are in the worst mood, refrain from seeing this flick. <br /> <br /> I don't think anything was right about this movie at all. On a friend's recommendation I looked at this and I literally jumped 1 hour and 48 minutes of my life into the closet. Bad action, stupid direction, weak history and pathetic action sequences - and when you mix this together you get "Double Impact". Even at least expectations were not met. <br /> <br /> I think I learned one thing - Never watch Van Damme action flicks. They are a waste of time!
