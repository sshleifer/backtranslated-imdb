The director, equipped with chains and leather, warned the public at the SF Frameline Film Festival on Friday evening that we should see an "adventure film". Experimental? Let the camcorder sit on the back of the car, let the tape roll and edit in all the senseless dreams within sight. A meandering pastiche road show maneuver that starts nowhere and takes the audience no place. The gratuitous violence that opens the film drove more than a patron from the Castro theater. I would also have left, but my cine mate needed a trip home and has this thing to see even the worse mare through to the end. When the lights came up, the audience was considerably thin. Tepid applause. Proforma questions from the director who seemed satisfied with the product. Avoid this movie!
