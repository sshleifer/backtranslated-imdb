I read the reviews before I saw this movie and I didn't believe them. I love crap movies and I expected it to be average. It wasn't. This movie makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 look like greats. The movie contains bad acting, bad sound, bad confusing story, bad makeup - and it bored me so much I knocked it off. even nudity was rubbish! Did they even have a budget for this movie? I don't think they did. You can see if you like this movie or not for the first 5 minutes. If you want a good cheesy gory movie you should see poisonous avenger 4 or even camp blood. Avoid this garbage bin - I saw it on TV and felt ripped off, so don't use anything on it. The best part is probably the end.
