This was a movie I hoped I could suggest to my American friends. But after 4 attempts to finish the film, I knew I couldn't even see the horrible thing closing. You are almost convinced that the actual war did not last so long. Andres will try to question my patriotism to criticize a movie like this. But flat out, you can't go from seeing Save Private Ryan to LOC. Forget about the difference in the movie or the audience - it doesn't prevent a director from making an intelligent movie. The length of the movie is not so bad and the fact that it is repetitive - they continue to attack the same tray, but give it different names. I thought LOC was a terrible terrain - this hill looked like my backyard. The character development sequences (soilders flashbacks that return to their last moments before they are implemented) should have been in the whole movie and not just lumped into a long memory. To this day I have not yet seen the end. But there was a much better movie (not much said) called Border.
