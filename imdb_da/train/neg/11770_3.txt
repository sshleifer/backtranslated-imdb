'P' (or Club-P) should really be called 'L' for lame. Each festival has a disappointment, and it is the one who does not live up to its very hyped logline: "Thai lesbian fighting monsters." Rather, it's a tale of a Khmer maid who's grandma has taught her a little witchcraft along with a few strange (but specific) rules: "Don't go under a line of clothes," "don't eat raw meat" and "don't accept money to your powers. " Well, what is it that the girl moves to Bangkok to raise some money as a "bar-girl" and manages to break all the rules granny taught her, which subsequently releases an evil spirit that comfortably kills the "foreign boys" who pays for her services. Although this movie cannot even be released in Thailand because of the controversial issue, most American audiences will find this ho-ho horror pic a cross between "Showgirls" and "Interview with the Vampire" as directed by Walt Disney. <br /> <br /> If not for a couple of scenes with significant amounts of blood, the MPAA would probably rate this only for pre-teens. There are literally broadcast TV fare even though you expect at least one sex scene considering that the movie is about a brothel and one of the actresses is a Thai porn star in real life. <br /> <br /> As for the lesbian angle, there is a brief smooch and a pair of "I Love You" to prove that the two star stars are really a couple (on brother). And the P-bar should be the only exotic dance club on the planet where the girls hold their sarongs and make carnival stunts (there's a sword that cuts cucumbers out of a girl's mouth ... ooh, fake imaging). <no nudity, no real monster (unless you count a five foot tall Thai spirit with yellow eyes), and no way any adult should ever pay to see this kind of stupidity except on DVD. You've been warned!
