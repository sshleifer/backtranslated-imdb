I can't remember a movie where I've cared less about where the characters have come from, what happens to them or where they go. I'm aware that Hollywood's greatest pastime is umbilical stirring, but these people are either too despicable or too boring to spend time with. However, for what it is worth, the discussion that came with the exhibition, during the Key Sunday Cinema series, made the reckoning that possibly the three women showed some redeeming properties. I disagree.
