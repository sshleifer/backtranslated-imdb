What a piece of junk this movie was. The principle was okay, but even in the beginning with crappy effects mixing in a giant with normal sized people (even the effects in Hercules were better) I knew it would be bad. But the really terrible part of the movie is the dialogues. It's totally incoherent, silly and stupid. I felt it was written by a 9th grade in creative class and got a D-. I want to beat Casper van Diem and the other actors to follow this movie. <br /> <br /> I've had my share of cheesy and bad movies (I love the three-pine series), but this ... I don't recommend it at all. It's silly, and the totally flabbergastingly bad dialogues make you scream.
