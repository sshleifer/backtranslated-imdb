... when he made Broadway BILL (1934) as RIDING HIGH (1950). Redirecting Bing Crosby as DAN BROOKS did not help a play dated in 34 even 50. This sad movie has whole scenes lifted from the original with many of the supporters who repeated their roles unless they were dead. Although it was older, it did not seem to matter to the director. Nor did the cars and clothes in the background plates from 1934 not resemble the 1950s standards. Not even 'where Bingel' song can redeem this bet. <br /> <br /> We reviewed both the original and the remake IMDb Four **** Stars. Frank's hand was far away, and all that was left was CAPRA-CORN. It didn't stop Mr. Capra. After floundering around the fifties, some educational documentaries made his career remaking LADY FOR A DAY (1933) as POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES (1961). Again, a fine throw was placed on the IMDb Six ****** Star action compared to the originals Eight ******** Stars. Sometimes it is better to stop while you were still ahead, just after the UNION STATUS (1948).
