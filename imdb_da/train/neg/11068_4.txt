Dahmer, a young confused man. Dahmer, a confusing movie. Permitted, I had a few beers while I watched the movie, but it doesn't explain why I was sad this flick. <br /> <br /> Its flashbacks are nothing but confusing and annoying, and there is no real story with a beginning and an end, all that was sensible in the movie was the explanatory text at the beginning and end of the movie. The intermediate thing that would be the movie is just boring pictures and a waste of time. <br /> <br /> We never see actual murder, everything is just a bunch of insinuations. Sometimes you even get the feeling that Dahmer dreams the whole thing, but you know he is not, as it is <br /> <br /> based on a true story, and it actually happened, at least it most. But what happened? It's not easy to tell. <br /> <br /> I don't encourage people to waste time on this movie. I didn't like it a little, and I felt cheated when it suddenly ended. <br /> <br /> * / *****
