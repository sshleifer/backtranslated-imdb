Maybe I'm not sophisticated. These and more are two of the more allegedly cerebral films I have seen recently, and both suffer from the same problem in a horrific way. The dialogue is fake false false. Nothing coming out of man's mouth seems externally credible. Perhaps the way this movie is created is the way it should feel, but it wasn't available. And boring. I went out after 20 minutes of tedium. <br /> <br /> I'll stick with Sleeper and Bananas for my Woody Allen fix. If I ever come across this on teevee, I will come back and try to find an episode of Quincy instead.
