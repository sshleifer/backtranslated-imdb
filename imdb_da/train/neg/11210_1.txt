I read John Everingham's story many years ago in Reader's Digest, and I remember thinking about what a great movie it would do. And it would probably have been that Michael Landon never got his hands on it. As far as I was concerned, Landon was one of the worst actors on earth, and his artistic license went far beyond the top, just as his massacre in the "Little House" book series is evidence. The act is, for lack of a better word, terrible, the manuscript dull, and there are more close-ups of Landon's puss than it should be allowed. <br /> <br /> This movie reflects Everingham's story as much as "Little House on the Prairie" reflects the books were "based" on. It's just another vehicle that shows Landon's terrible hair.
