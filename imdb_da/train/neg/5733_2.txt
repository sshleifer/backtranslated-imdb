just looking at it, me and my better half couldn't believe how terrible and bad it was. If anyone thinks it's good, then you should be happy. I actually gave one night out to look at this, it's all been done before. IU. The hostel jumps in mind, but at least it didn't do you with the bad plays and the lack of history line, the same old stuff, the hatch, I read so much about this movie, I recommended it to my buddy, my fault, someone said it was good! No more gory, horror or reeling back in disgust than your average "scary movie" it must be said, please don't bother with this movie. get the mary poppins. now it's scary! I'm off now, go to the cinema and see something scary than this, little miss sunshine maybe
