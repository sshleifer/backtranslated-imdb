The most misogynistic movie all the time? Not to mention by '68 should they not have moved beyond white people in brown face to play the "Indians"? However, my favorite parts must be when the girls giggle and blush as the cyclists pull them out to rape them. Rape is fun! There you can just see? Let's see, there are the blatant rip-offs of "The Hustler" (fat boss character actually plays pool, while delusing to destroy the Indians with the leading rebel dude), the horrible spectacle, the so-called cruel - maybe-as-well-have-just-told-you-what-to-think music cues, the lack of anyone who is actually Indian in this movie. And who should we rooting for? I have to say the number that Quentin Tarantino loves this movie. Although his films tend to master strong women, I have heard from at least one source that he is, in fact, a misogynistic idiot. Why did I look at it, you ask? Don't ask.
