A very tired look Burt Reynolds plays a mercenary fighting his former employers for some gizmo, these non-heroes are planning to sell to the "Iranians". The low-purity video nonsense of the producers of "Silk Stalkings" offers some decent action footage and a lot of inappropriate staged "drama" ... lack of logic and really terrible dialogue are the crucial aspects, although the final terms and fidelity may change Been a nifty end to a better movie. Burt still has a presence, even though it also means you get to know more when he kills insulting half-baked "one-liners".
