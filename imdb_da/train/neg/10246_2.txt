End of the World is an unintentional film that is odd as it was about the Earth's total destruction. The protagonist is a kind of scientist, I'm not quite sure what kind. He has two jobs at a government (?) Facility guarded by four security men. His first job monitors transmissions to and from the room (although it actually seems more like a hobby he does when he's not working on job # 2). Job # 2 requires that he put on a protective suit and enter a dark room ... at least that's the best I can find. Apparently, the "plant" is not exactly top secret, as the researcher brings his wife there. She hangs out (they're heading for a dinner) as he discovers a message from space: Major Earth Disruption is repeated over and over. He says something about being the first message from the room he has ever been able to decipher; his wife tells him they are late for dinner. So they go and go to the party (!?!). Currently, he finds out that China has suffered a major earthquake. From there the movie goes ... nowhere! Yes, Christopher Lee is in it, but it really doesn't help much. In addition, Lee gives a weak performance in accordance with his appearance in Howling II. This movie is boring, but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer once if you like Christopher Lee or Z-grade sci-fi. Plus, there are lots of stock footage of the ground being destroyed.
