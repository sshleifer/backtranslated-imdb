My God, was this "Run, Lola, Run" adaptation of persuasion? It was awful. Very enough, "screenwriter" (and I use the term very loosely) cut and paste the dialogue from one sign to another, often completely out of context and to hurry the story together: but Anne Elliott runs from place to place in the quest for Wentworth at the end of the play was an abomination! Austen will spin in his grave. No respectable young woman would have acted in such a terrible way. And the actor who played Mary? Horrors. Needless to say, if the rest of the Austen treaties are so bad, they will turn off a new generation of viewers. <br /> <br /> To see an impeccable version of this (otherwise) wonderful novel, get Roger's commissioned 1995 version with Amanda Root (whose expressions alone can speak volumes) and Ciaran Hinds. It is fantastic.
