When discussing a movie titled 'Snakes on an Airplane', we must point out early that the snakes are quite darn important to the plot. <br /> <br /> What we have here is very bad cgi snakes that neither look nor move like real snakes. Snakes are scary because they seem to be slimy, they crawl them slither. These snakes do not do any of these. they slide together as they would in a video game. They are cartoon snakes. I would go so far as to say that even someone who had a big phobia against real snakes would not find these scary. Why on earth would you like to include extreme close-ups of these cgi errors? why not rely on excitement .. the whole "less is more" ethical. or better still, why not just make them look good in the first place? And maybe use them sparingly <br /> <br /> Take a look at John the joiner's case. Here we have real mucus and doings of creepy proportions. 20 years pass by and we get this pile of smelly sfx crap 'snakes on a plane'. When should these people wake up and smell the coffee? special effects go backwards! <br /> <br /> sure you could say .. but the movie is a joke, get it? sure I'm with that idea but do it well! In addition to the above, this film has crap dialogue. and music and sound effects are not scary or memorable in any way. <br /> <br /> I could handle all the other actors involved in this movie except Jackson. What is he doing there? man who starred in pulp fiction 10 years ago. is this career progression? Do you offer people value for money? none. I would like to know what Tarantino was thinking when he was halfway through this stink of a movie <br /> <br /> the current generation seems to have very low expectations. And Hollywood seems to be offering them just what they want. After leaving the cinema, I saw a number of advertisements for some really horrible looking publications, including ... DOA: dead or alive, (another) cgi animal film called 'flushed away' and another crap sees comedy called 'click'. besides that, I saw some awful trailers, including one for (second) crap British horror / comedy. I really haven't seen the movie industry in a mess like this for a long time <br /> <br /> expecting to watch this movie for sale in the DVD bargain section for Â£ 1 in 6 months time. and if you expect to see a black comedy with tons of great snakes, and some badly nice cool dialogue coming from Samuel L Jackson's Lips. Forget it.
