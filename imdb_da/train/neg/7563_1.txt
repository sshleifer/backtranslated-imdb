Unfortunately, this movie makes no credit whatsoever to the original. Nicholas Cage, right wood as far as the actors go, imbues the screen with a variety of skills from, non-plussed to over the top. The support molding is no better. The plot remains virtually the same as the original in terms of stage growth, but is much worse. Not enough detail is given to allow the audience to go into what is being sold. It turns out that it is just a bill with bad goods. Faith cannot be suspended, nor can it be called into question. The only saving aspect of this movie is that it is extremely visual, as the medium requires, and who has been investigated must be praised. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of laughter in the audience and more angry, literally on the End. <br /> <br /> Disappointed! Wait for the original to come on television, pour a whiskey and enjoy.
