Disney has yet to meet a movie, it couldn't do at least two successors. And this was no exception for the people of Disney to give a weak story to receive a quick reward. Somehow, even though I didn't pay to see it, I feel cheaper to see it. Ariel is an adult now and had a daughter. Nevertheless, the daughter does not allow to enter the sea because of an idle threat taken by the sister of the deceased sea witch. So here we go again. <br /> <br /> The daughter is fooled (of course) and helps the witch. After a not so wonderful match, she is defeated, and mermaids and people live in harmony. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There's nothing to see here. Go back to your life. "D"
