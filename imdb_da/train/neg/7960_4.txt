I rented it because the other segment traumatized me as a small child. I knocked down below really early one morning, started watching HBO, and The Raft (segment 2) terrorized me well. This time I ever enjoyed The Raft, though I couldn't tell if it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was actually a good card. The other two segments were complete waste. I can't believe in a manufacturer somewhere paid to make this unwanted. All I have achieved by looking at this was to destroy another childhood memory. Creepshow 2 will now join Rad among my list of smart childhood classics. 4.10
