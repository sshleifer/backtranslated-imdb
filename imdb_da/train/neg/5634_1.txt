The poster, who called it "plotless and pointless", literally took the words I would have used in my subject line. The only thing I want to add is "Passionless". For a movie made by a spouse's spouse and with lots of graphic sex scenes, this movie manages to do what is to be a sultry situation in one beyond ice cold. Dafoe and Colagrande look bored under the sex scenes, and the viewer may as well take a Valium and have done so. Also, please have the women in the audience watched WAY for many used tampons in their time, and any guy who's turned on by seeing Willem Dafoe pulling a bloody tampon out of his wife's sheath really needs treatment. <br /> <br /> I think the key to the movie (if any) is the restaurant scene, where a waiter explains Dafoe's eternally sleepy eyes, what a "deconstructed jambalaya" is. (All the ingredients in the bowl are separated instead of simulated together.) This film is a "deconstructed thriller". All the elements are there: Spooky, isolated house, dead spouse, creepy violins on the score, weirdo caretaker who come and go as he wishes, fatalities in fatalities and near death, signs with a secret past. Basically all the thriller cliches you can think of, but nothing comes together. Everything sits right there and never goes into a coherent plot or even an artificial piece of humor. At the restaurant, Dafoe passes on "deconstructed jambalaya". Prominent tenants of this mess would do well to leave this deconstructed thriller on the video store shelf.
