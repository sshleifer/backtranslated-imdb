Another movie with an interesting performance and some wonderful special effects that fall right into the trash. <br /> <br /> Boring direction and performances (with the exception of the lovely Annabel Schofield, who is much shorter than a brunette and probably deserves better material and the eternally serious Charlton Heston) serve the judgment of a real sucker. <br /> <br /> It's great to see Heston perform his usual couple and show how really bad this movie is. He even plays in a sub-plot that kept me interested just to see how it tied back to the movie's main line. The way they ended up solving it was that they didn't. It simply falls off the end. <br /> <br /> Really. Don't waste your time on this one.
