Well, if it wasn't for Ethel Waters and a 7 year old Sammy Davis, Jr. (here picture without Jr.), Rufus Jones for president would be one of the worst representations of African-American stereotypes I've seen from the early talkie era and would not have been worth seeing because of it. Ms. Waters is excellent here sings "Am I Blue?" and "Under Our Harlem Moon" while Mr. Davis shows us how his showbiz childhood experience prepared him for his superstar adult status. He is such a good tapering here, that for a while I thought he was a small person with decades of experience. So, if you are willing to ignore the negative connotations here, Rufus Jones should give President a pleasure. P. S. This marks the fourth time today I've seen and heard the song, "I'll Be Happy When You're Dead You Rascal You" performed on movies, this time by Davis. Must have been a very popular song this time around.
