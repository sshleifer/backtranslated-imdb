Why was this movie made? Even in view of the generous tax concessions granted to Australian film investors, there can be no reasonable explanation why this film is being advanced. For the benefit, the actors in this movie are Aussie b-grade celebs (not actors, people like John Michael 'Hollywood' Howson, the original drummer from the band in Hey Hey Its Saturday, and the voice-over guy in Countdown. But by saying that, it is still very attentive as long as you give it the brain's attention it deserves: none. The scripture is bad (even for a self-conscious b-grade horror) and the play and movie quality is worse, often looks like it is a home video but Even a home video has "realism." Anyone interested in Australian movies, please kindly love God's love, pretend that this movie was never made.
