Sorry, but apart from Kim Basinger doing a good job scared, this was one of the worst thrillers I've seen in a while. Logic is thrown out as 4 young guys terrorizing this woman outside a crowded mall and shooting a security guard. But no one seems to notice. Then, instead of screaming for help, she drives back to the mall and runs out and ends in the middle of the forest with the boys in the pursuit. I can't even describe how stupid it is to see this woman flying from 4 retarded bullies, wearing a red toolbox, screaming for God to come help her, and then having sex with one of them after they brutally have killed the others. Please trust me, it's bad and a bit tasteless too.
