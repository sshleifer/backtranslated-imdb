I had a very hard time doing this through this move. It was extremely slow and sometimes wondered when the movie of the movie would actually come to life. <br /> <br /> This movie seemed to float slowly, and I continued to think about when it should end. I'm usually a person who likes a good indie file every now and then, but it didn't satisfy what I was looking for. <br /> <br /> It seemed like they were trying too much out of this movie. At one point it seemed to be political, as I am not a big fan of movies. If you're looking for a slow moving movie with little or no plot then it's the right movie for you. For me, I felt I was wasting 2 hours when I could have done something else.
