I've seen some crazy movies in my life, but this one must be among the worst. Definitely bound 100 material (imo it is). We follow two couples, Dodds (Billy Bob Thornton as Lonnie Earl and Natasha Richardson as Darlene) and Kirkendalls (Patrick Swayze as Roy and Charlize Theron as Candy) in a car on a road trip to Reno. Lonnie doesn't seem too happy with her sex life, so he cheats his wife with Candy, who desperately tries to get a baby. Meanwhile, Roy is not sure if his sperm is OK, so he gets it checked by a doctor. Now I had read the back of the DVD, but my boyfriend didn't, and she blurted out after approx. 20 minutes: "Oh yes, she's going to get pregnant, but her husband can't have any baby". Spot on as this movie is so predictable. As well as boring. And annoying. Meaningless. Offensive. Terrible. <br /> <br /> An example of how much this movie stinks. The two couples sat down in their big car towards Nevada when they were stopped by two police officers as they did not stop at a stop sign. The boys know each other and cutlery pass the two officers with a case of beer. Not only is this scene meaningless and not important (or even relevant) to the movie, it takes about 5 minutes! It's just talking and talking and speaking, without having to go somewhere. <br /> <br /> I still have to think about the end though. Apparently Roy does NOT have problems down there, so he is the baby's father. How many times are there in the movies ... Try something new! The cheated wife ultimately gives her husband and best friend an affair, and they all live happily ever. Yuck. <br /> <br /> The best scene in the movie is right at the end, with a few shots from the Grand Canyon. Why couldn't they just keep the camera on it for 90 minutes? <br /> <br /> You would expect more from this cast (though Thornton really tries), but you can't really blame them. Authors, shame on you! <br /> <br /> 1/10.
