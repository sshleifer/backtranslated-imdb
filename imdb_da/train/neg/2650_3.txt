When I sat under this mediocrity, I wondered why? Why did Dianne Keaton agree with this waste? The movie uses pointless, constructed plot lines to deliver garbage to thousands of homes. The film takes a political agenda to a new level. The movie was pointless, and all creditability was lost for excessive use of stereotype. <br /> <br /> It was clear that Keaton was trying to make this movie worthwhile, but eventually she must remember the old old saying that one cannot polish a turd. I hope you don't waste your New Year's Day and see another thoughtless for television movies. I now know why the network started sending series on Sunday night to get rid of garbage!
