I actually paid to watch this movie in the theater. <br /> <br /> It would get a 1 rating, but the battle scene between the robots is okay and there is a surprise. <br /> <br /> I realize some movies have bigger budgets than others. I have no problem with that. Unfortunately, science fiction movies probably suffer most from a small budget for obvious reasons. But one way this movie fails is that almost every piece of each set then cheese and cheap. I mean, couldn't they even make it look good? <br /> <br /> The other major reason why this movie is horrible is the actor. If I saw the movie now and knew what to expect, I could just enjoy it for the cheese factor, but at that time I expected a good movie and had no idea how terrible it would actually be. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the experience was only 85 minutes.
