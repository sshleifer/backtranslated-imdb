Hmm ?? I agree with the reviewer that "strange people with generous taste have gone through this movie". I thought the movie was exciting enough to see it. I think it was primarily because of Marsden and Speedman - not the plot. The bottom line is that this film is mildly psychological tantalizing on one side and deeply homophobic on the other. Thumbs up on the previous and triple thumbs down on the latter. I'm not sure if the movie is meant to promote dialogue or to spread fear and propaganda. <br /> <br /> I thought the play was mediocre. A lot of conversation that was about 90 degrees shot of reality. I stopped deriving an opinion from the plot, but in the end it is just a conversation with a sour man (Speedman). I feel mildly sorry for him (Speedman) because of his loss, but not really. His losses are no greater and are certainly less than losses that suffer every day around the world for more important reasons. <br /> <br /> Does the film explain naivet√© about HIV / AIDS? Yes: The corresponding audience. Is HIV a Dark, Mystical, Evil Murder? What about victims? The answer to both questions is NO. Neither HIV nor its victims have more or less malicious intent than lupus, multiple sclerosis, TB, hepatitis, cancer or their victims for the sake of God. Just because a disease is transferable, it does not either consciously or negligently - or evil - is just. <br /> <br /> Excuse this ignorant or stupid-risky? - no Should all people exercise safe sex? - YES. Will probably sex save the world? - no Is safe sex realistic in all cases of love and desire between passionate and emotional people? ?? OF COURSE NOT. What kind of world would we live in if everyone followed the rules, no one ever took risks, and sex was never spontaneous and passionate ??? Do I forget that the film deals specifically with gay sex? ?? YES. HIV spreads by dividing blood or body fluids between infected and uninfected individuals. Gender is not necessary for transmission, homosexual or otherwise. I am always disturbed by intentional violence from one person to another. In fact, I thought the film did a great job of portraying the absurdity of Tom's violent abduction, captivity, and intent toward Dan, and this kind of crazy violence occurs every day. <br /> <br /> Stream of Conscious Notes from the Movie: Tom is crazy. Why does Dan not ask "why" do you feel this way rather than "what are you doing"? Implication: Men who have sex with men get "AIDS" Implication: HIV = AIDS Where was Tom's responsibility in sex action? Why was Dan's responsibility to use the condom? "Maybe you've thrown it off before you get stuck in it?" What are we talking about here? Was one of the parties unconscious? "Maybe she wouldn't hear the truth." You cut me. "She's up in the sky and looked incredibly sorry for what she now knows about me" Is Dan over to life if he has HIV? Certainly not! Is that why the whole world is so homophobic? They think gay men are the cause of HIV, they will give it to the rest of the world, and we all want to die? are you kidding me??? Are people really stupid enough to believe that homosexuality is the cause ... is the problem ??? Do we feel that way about the victims of tuberculosis? of malaria? I see that Tom is injured because of his wife's death and he blames it on AIDS but seriously ?? who's to blame here? The victim or the virus? Are diseases really the responsibility of the sick? (Assuming they did not seek and did not attempt to spread the disease). Safe, safe sex is essential for a safe life, but it is not driving, non-flying, not leaving home, non-living. Do we really want to blame the disease on the victims? Would safe sex between Tom and Dan have prevented Tom's wife's ultimate death? Maybe, but not Dan's only responsibility. <br /> <br /> Tom is crazy. I said so. <br /> <br /> Tom to Dan: "Maybe you get what you deserve" ?? COME ON! 24 Days: violent, naive and homophobic. <br /> <br /> Are I Overreacting? Maybe. But I think this movie points to a judgmental finger of gay men for their ruthless and vicious intention for a "just world" by exercising uncertain sex when homosexuals practicing safe sex are proportionately the same or better than heterosexual . We all need to wake up and be serious about HIV / AIDS. HIV kills hundreds of thousands of STRAIGHT Africans every year.
