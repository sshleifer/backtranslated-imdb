There are few enlightened things to say about this, but I can mention Matt Dillon is doing his best to do something out of nothing and the many split screens and graphics that are worth. Since most race movies suffer from the assumption that car lovers are not so intelligent, we end up with movies like this. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Lohan, who surprised so much in Mean Girls, needs to make better decisions to play. Here she can only fail. <br /> <br /> Children are only mildly entertained because they try to appeal more to adults than children (though still quite stupid). Those in the theater I saw it showed no real interest after a few minutes. And as a family sports film, it's terrible. The better moments are at the beginning of the scrap that creates a certain feeling and later in the car-bash party creates excitement. If you develop a car as a key sign, you need to develop it better than here. After a few mandatory race scenes you are in the best part: Being able to leave the multiplex in your own car.
