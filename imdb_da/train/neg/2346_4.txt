I saw this movie for the first time not too long on TCM's "Essentials" series. The eye of the victorious clich√© was never more apropos. This keeps so little of value in this. I was confused by the infinite attraction that Lucy (Lauren Bacall) had. Granted, Mrs Bacall was a beautiful woman, but in this movie her character comes from more mousy than attractive. I would think that men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would more likely ignore Lucy than fall into an instant infatuation with her. In Bacall's defense, this film was made at the time of Humphrey Bogart's last illness, and the weight of his worsening health may have affected her performance. Of course, part of this mousiness at Lucy was to contrast her to slutty Marylee, played to the hilt and beyond by Dorothy Malone. The scene in which she participates in a wild sensual dance, while her father tired of climbing the stairs to a deadly heart attack, is far and away the best scene in the movie. Malone's performance scares the rest, although Jasper Hadley's fatigue on his two children's disappointing behaviors is excellently portrayed by Robert Keith. In general, however, I have to say that I am not a fan of the melodrama. The comics' behavior of the characters just makes it a story too unreliable for my taste.
