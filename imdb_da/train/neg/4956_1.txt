When this cartoon first aired, I was under the impression that it would be at least halfway descent, boy was I wrong. I must admit seeing this cartoon is almost as painful as watching Batman and Robin with George Clooney all those years ago. I saw some episodes and two of them Batman had literally got his ass kicked to the left and right by the penguin who fought like Jet Li and knocked out the crap out of Batman and I saw another episode where Batman got his ass kicked again by Joker, who apparently used Jackie Chan as he flew in the air like a ninja. Since when was Joker or Penguin ever a battle for Batman? And even worse were Joker and Penguin Kung Fu colleagues of Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It's really embarrassing, depressing and sad as the picture of Batman is portrayed in this show. The animation is horrible and the dialogue is horrible. Being a Batman fan since my boyhood, I can honestly and strongly recommend you to stay away and avoid this show at all costs because it does not promote the true image of Batman. This cartoon is more like a Wannabe Kung Fu Flick, and if you really want to see a classic Batman cartoon, I highly recommend Batman the Animated Series, but this cartoon is no more than a piece of S --- T! Get Batman: The Animates Series and don't waste your time with this cartoon.
