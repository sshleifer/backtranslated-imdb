While I watched this movie, I tried to figure out why they were bothering it. Although the movie's main drawing is potentially good, there are all sorts of unrelated / unnecessary subplots. The Hollywood marketing people must have dictated the many evil guys, eternal crosses and the man and woman who come too close and have sex. It is strange that we see more of them having sex than we did by the president and his mistress. The many charts and subplates make the film too wide and none of the characters are properly developed - I really didn't feel I knew any character except that everyone is corrupt and evil. The ending is completely incomplete - it left me more than just having what could have been, but what should it be. Ultimately, there is really no explanation as to why someone does what they do, except to serve as additional corrupt characters that commit a double cross. I am surprised that so many established (and good) actors agreed to make such a hollow movie. This seemed like a movie made by college students working on their 2nd or 3rd project. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time unless you are in a movie class and want an example of what not to do when making a movie.
