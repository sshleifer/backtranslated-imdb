Now I have never seen a bad movie in all my years, but what about songs in the movie, what physiological significance does it have. WOW some demented Pokémon show up and they multiply, I can get a seizure from this. Animie is meaningless, makers of it are meaningless. It is a great marketing system. Just look at the songs and they will get a good rating. I guess this movie would have been fine if they sent a message, you should see all the Pokémon episodes to understand what's going on and it's not a movie. It's just an animation it should be on video. <br /> Ps: I give it a 1 because I just got 5 bucks, I couldn't give it a half because there are no halves.
