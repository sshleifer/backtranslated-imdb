I was attracted to watching this movie because of this plot and my desire to see a horror. <br /> <br /> To my disappointment, this became more of a comedy than a horror. The film, the dialogue and the flow of the film were all very poorly executed. Much of it didn't make sense. For example, there is a party of about 30 people, and they are all afraid of a person, despite being in a secret location and everyone is healthy, looks young adults, and the guy who threatens them sounds haggard . I continued thinking, maybe this was a parody of another movie like Scary Movie, but they were trying too hard to make it look horrible - focus on trials. Blood and gore are also poorly finished. I've seen Halloween costumes look more credible than this. A guy with his head cut out cleanly ... looked clean - lacks signs of bone, flesh, blood and even his head. A strong downward strike with an ax on a corpse should lodge into something ... thought the guy swung a bat instead of an ax. <br /> <br /> Revealing who the biggest villain would be a twist, but opposite other parts of history. What went into the guy's mind to show up like that? If there was to be a twist, at least build it up and add mystery and excitement.
