Horror movies can be very fun with low budgets, bad acting and some panache. I think the movie just lacks panache, because people are laughing harmlessly in the air. If it wasn't so boring, it might be fun. <br /> <br /> A horror movie can go a long way with a tired concept like "college kids in a haunted house" just as the evil Dead movie had a lot of fun with a similar standard plotline. Hallows End, unfortunately, does not go far. In fact, it doesn't go anywhere. It spends the better part of an hour creating faceless and anonymous characters with what seems like endless interpersonal drama. I have nothing against character development, not even in a horror movie, but it is strictly one-dimensional characters (the alpha rooster, the milqueto key, the ... um ... wasted characters mainly found for sex scenes.) Expense forty plus bloodless, droning minutes with they were more horrible than when the bloodshed started. <br /> <br /> Well, tacit bloodshed anyway. When the college kids become what they have dressed as for their haunted house (a vampire, one is wearing O.R. scrubs and a white pancake), they look pretty much like they did in their amateur-haunted house suit; The Dead Hate The Living, which uses a similar theme, is a masterpiece in comparison. There is really nothing to talk about, and there are no scary things either. <br /> <br /> I have thought of this from almost any approach. If it were a tight, exciting horror movie (which would explain why things went so slowly), the pathetic sex scenes and cheap monsters would make it invalid. If it were a real blood & guts horror movie (which would explain schlock) ... where's the blood and intestines? And the anticlimax is one of the unexciting conclusions of a movie I've ever seen. It's the kind of movie that, although it doesn't have a narrator through the movie, is posted by voice-overs, because the meaningless dialogue just wasn't enough. This was a tough ... coming out of what I wonder if I just sat through a Christian horror movie. Perhaps "I know hell exists" of the opening was not that way, but there are some tips (or misdirection - I'm not sure which one). For the whole shadow of the film, a line like "gosh-darnit" comes a little absurd, and it also does most of the crucified godly and satan-horrible, especially after some lecherous T&A sex scenes (a heterosexual, a lesbian). <br /> <br /> If it's a Christian company (Highland Myst's logo itself has a bit of cruel equality), this movie weighs heavily for the atheist camp. An all-powerful being cannot be so bad a filmmaker. <br /> <br />
