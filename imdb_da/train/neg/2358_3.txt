In the future of 2001, Freddy is after the last surviving teen of Elm Street. Forsaking ANY scare whatsoever for unfunny attempts at humor and unnecessary celebrity cameos (come on .. Ronose ??? Tom Arnold ?? !! ?? WTF?), This is bound with Part 2 is the worst thing that the demon rape has ever got . Wow this was a piece of shit. Not even the great legendary Alice Cooper could make the stench of this movie go away. And when the hell did Freddy ever have a daughter? The whole film is severely retarded in ever-single imaginable form, form and form. Rachel Talalay, you stink to high heaven, honey. <br /> <br /> My character: D- <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Cast and Crew Bios; Go to the 3D Sequence and Jump to a Nightmare Choice (more extras for the movie can be found on the seventh album of The Nightmare Collection DVD Set) <br /> <br /> DVD-Rom Content: Trivia Games; script; and web link
