This movie is not good. The first one almost sucked, but had the unreal end to make it worth seeing. This one has nothing. It is zero scare, zero voltage or voltage. It's not really a horror movie. Most of the killings don't show anything. It's not something to say about. It could almost be a TV, except for a little nudity and a little violence. The action is also not very good. And don't get me started on dialogue.as for the surprise ending, surprise, there isn't one. I suppose it could have been worse even though I can't see how. But again, it's less than 80 minutes long, so I think that's good thing. although it felt much longer. apparently it is the carved version of the movie. I found it at a very cheap price, but it's still not worth it. If you want the creepy graphic version, check out the Anchor Bay edition. Anyway, this version of Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers gets a big fat 1/10 from me. If you look at this movie, you will probably be a boring and unhappy camper. If you're a real fan, you might be able to download Anchor Bay's Sleepaway Camp (with survival kit) three disk collections containing the first three movies spooky and with special features
