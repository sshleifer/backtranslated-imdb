After the fantastic AANKHEN (2002), which was a remake of a gujarati game, he comes with WAQT, which also resembles a stage game. In stage games, we have characters that shout and here also the same /> <br /> The first half shows that Amitabh almost kills 40+ Akshay Kumar, who seems too funny as a little kid <br /> <br /> The movie has a good message how to not destroy your son but unfortunately the way Amitabh wants to make Akki responsible is completely fake <br /> <br /> Even his reason to hide his illness, his run from the hospital and the melodramatic speech by Akki is a dismissal. <br /> <br /> Some emotions touch you, but most are also over the top <br /> <br /> Rajpal's comedy is fun but also stretched in the second half <br /> <br /> The direction of Vipul Shah is too overdone, although some scenes are good Music is Okay <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Amitabh exaggerates in the first half, but it's great in emotional scenes. Akshay Kumar also does his role well but also looks uncomfortable in some also py scenes His chemistry with Bachchan is informal Rajpal is a highlight, he makes you laugh without overburdening and just his presence and his silly behavior and deadpan humor he is a rebel Boman is good in some comics, but too loud in places Priyanka is the heroine so nothing to do, this is her last movie with Akki so far Shefali is amazing even though she looks too young to Bachchan
