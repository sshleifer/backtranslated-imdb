Okay, like most Steven Seagal fans, I know I don't expect a masterpiece every time he makes a movie, but I expect the movie to have at least some sort of budget. The main problem with the copy I was looking at was the horrible over dubbing. I know that in some movies it has to be done and I accept it, but when they overdo it with a completely different actor's voice and continue to do so through the film, it takes the magic of over-doubling. The sets also seem to be built with no care, since in a scene the sliding glass plate in a top-quality laboratory has a massive crack through it. I was really disappointed with this movie, and only hope Stevens next project gets finished before sending the movie for purchase / rental. The story of this movie had wondered if I saw a sci-fi movie or did not seem to share strangers, but they never quite explained what was happening, I found it very confusing.
