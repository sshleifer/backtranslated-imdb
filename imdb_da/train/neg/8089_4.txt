I don't know what it is about Donald Sutherland's performance style or vocal style, but he always seems to work from behind a massive array of sticky Kleenex. He's just ... I don't know, thick? Sleepwalker? On meds? Nice. <br /> <br /> Having said that, I've just seen the girl again for the first time since the original release, and honestly I can't remember it ending something like that. A bad ending too, because nothing is bound by. What about the dead man? The annoying child (and was the child baptized?)? Scotland Yard and Military Persecutors? I would have wanted something to pack things up and give a bit of dramatic closure to everything, not just the great panorama extraction. <br /> <br /> And what woman sleeps with the man she knows just killed her husband? Although she tried to remove Needle's suspicions of protecting her child, she could always have had headaches. The last meeting made me feel too itchy and uncomfortable ...
