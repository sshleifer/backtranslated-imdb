Fashionably fragmented, yet semi-realized character study, a study of the various personalities of two college roommates: a talented but undisciplined star basketball player and a pot-smoker, female robber. We never learn why these young men are friends. They can share confusion about the world and their places in it, but they don't seem to have anything else in common. Jack Nicholson, who also wrote the play with Jeremy Larner, based on Larner's book, does not introduce us to the characters with any clarity, nor does he create the scenes to help us identify with anyone on the screen. There are some very decent performances here (especially from newcomer William Carpets in the central role), but most of the image is unformed (perhaps deliberately), outlined or uncertain. Bruce Dern plays the hard-working basketball coach, Karen Black is the older, married lady, Carpets have an affair with, and Michael Margotta is Tepper's friendly friend (in an off-putting, over-the-top performance). Nicholson fails to create the sequences with a particular taste, preferring (I suppose) to let the character interaction dominate the movie's tone; His script is also no help, and as a result, it is unclear who we should sympathize with. Small random moments work (a supermarket struggles between Carpets and Black, Dern visits Carpets in his dorm, all scenes on the court), but the whole third act of the picture is a creepy mess. Hoping to sit with an important b-ball game with a sexual assault, Nicholson shows no style in his craft (he also doesn't earn points for chutzpah, as his appearance of these events is squashy and ugly). When an instructor goes out to humiliate his actors, one has to question his motives. Perhaps if "Drive, He Said" ultimately made a kind of powerful statement in the bargain, the audience could forgive the filmmaker for his lapses in judgment and taste. Unfortunately, the confusing closer is so dumbfounding so much of the rest of the movie. * 1/2 from ****
