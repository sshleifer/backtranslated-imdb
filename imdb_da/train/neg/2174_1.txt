It's hard to believe that people actually look like this boy! I think children can enjoy it, but for me it is the kind of kid movie parents who can't bear to sit through. Predictable plot, boring Belushi, and possibly the worst children's actor of all time. I want to give the director some responsibility for the child, but she was really painful to see. I feel embarrassed about her now because people know it was her. When she sang Star Spangled Banner, I had to turn off the sound - then I came here and discovered that they did it because she won Star Search. I always felt Jim Belushi should be ashamed to act on the name of his wonderful, sadly missing brother, and this shit shows why. Zero stars.
