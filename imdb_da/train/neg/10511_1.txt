Note to Horror fans: The only horror here is when you realized that you just wasted 95 minutes of your life on a movie that is so worthless that it is insulting. <br /> <br /> I saw this because: <br /> <br /> The priest sounds a little promising: It's not. It's just an excuse to use the same lame set pieces from other low-budget slasher movies that weren't good either. <br /> <br /> The promise of naked forest sounds sounded good, even though the movie turned out to be horrible: It's not. It is not. The amateur movie ensures that the "fallen angels" are as sexy as the average homeless. <br /> <br /> The name Tom Savini has a long story in the horror genre: He is king with low budget special effects and lower budget trades. Come to think of it, Savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie. It's not that he's bad, but he's almost always in bad movies. His only good role was in From Dusk To Dawn, and he has been painting it in horror conventions ever since. <br /> <br /> But let's focus on the positive: Forest of the Damned is a good example of how NOT to make a movie. Everything else is a negative. Of course, the author is allergic to originality. The script is terrible. It's all given after the first 10 minutes. But the clueless pacing; the way the director treats "plot" and "characterization" as a nuisance, he believes no one cares anyway; and the terribly long and tedious driving, hiking and nature sequences (undoubtedly added to increase driving time to make the movie qualified for distribution) show a complete lack of film and storytelling capability in general. <br /> <br /> This is another good example of the number - a way to see if a movie gets bad: If it is written and directed by the same person, expect garbage.
