I can't really say what I think about this movie, it's against the guidelines, I've seen many movies, and it has to be the worst yet. Extremely low budget, I guess all the money went into slaughter scenes because I could of done a better job with a b & w 8mm camera and a herd of monkeys. It was so bad I just registered to leave a comment because I had to tell someone the movie rental wasn't enough. But this is worth my 2 cents, I suggest borrowing it from some bad sap that rented it and see it for yourself. Because I probably wouldn't waste the money on it again. Now I leave you with this comment. I hope you did not make the rental when they do not refund you your money .. =)
