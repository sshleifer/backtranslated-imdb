If you wonder how many of the conspiracy theories and paranoid ideas of the United Nations, Israel and international affairs come from, look no further. <br /> <br /> This is not a supernatural Hollywood movie that is loosely based on some Bible passage. Instead, this film was made by a company (Cloud Ten Pictures) with a political and religious agenda. As a movie, the end result sometimes looks more like cut out of a television program (complete with family prayers and lights that go through church windows while harp plays). <br /> <br /> For ordinary viewers it may be hard to believe, but many people believe these things literally as presented in the movie. And that may make the movie important. You will probably not find a more accurate display of the bizarre views of a significant number of your fellow citizens. So if you see it, see it as a social / cultural document. If you are the media at all, you do not need to be warned about the creepy attempts at propaganda and manipulation in the movie.
