OKAY. Not bad movie making if it was from an original script. BUT IT IS NOT! What part of "in this story have no women, except Foulata and Gagoola" introduced by Haggard, did the producers, directors and writers not understand? I mean, it's pretty plain English. I understood it at the age of 10! KSM's beauty is that it features a spectacular description of three different worlds, the colonial Africa, the irreconcilable desert and the Kukuanaland, a hidden and isolated kingdom. It must be more than enough for even the most mediocre producers to work with. But no, they have to throw "romance" into it. Pathetic. Suggestions for all of you poor souls who actually thought this would be close to the book. Give it up. Until a Peter Jackson wannabe comes together and "does it right", you might as well keep reloading the tome. BTW, there is a sequel (actually a prequel) called Allan's wife. It provides the background for the story of Quatermain. It's a little scary, but good.
