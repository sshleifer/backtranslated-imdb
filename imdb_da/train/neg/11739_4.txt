The often reliable Leonard Maltin says this is a "lovely romance" and that Sanders is "amazing". Maltin must have confused this movie with something else. Sanders are carved and droll and amazing, as usual ?? You can imagine that he has delivered the line of adultery. "Sometimes the chain of chains is so heavy that they must be worn by three", but boring wood and dated describe this film more precisely. The story itself, an autobiography of Sanders as a suave jewel thief, Francois Eugene Vidocq, who becomes police officer but hardly can resist the lure of fine jewels, is entertaining enough, but it has the same kind of hollow historic Hollywood treatment that mistreated such eras like * Marie Antoinette *, and definitely the regrettable * Forever Amber * (screaming for a classic remake). Although Sanders in his defense is trying to add a depth to his character, it is far from nothing. I am an immaculate Douglas Sirk fan, but it is 1946, and it is one of Sir's earliest American efforts that lacks many of the signature tubes that would define his florid, fluttering potboilers. Sirk just gets his feet wet here and made a series of unmemorable movies over the next ten years until he beat gold with * Magnificent Obsession * and hit his steps and bombarded us with such estrogen parties as * all that the sky allows *, * Posted in the wind *, and * Imitation of Life *. But * scandal in Paris * is hardly his best work ?? a relatively low budget affair with cheesy sets and ineffective costuming.
