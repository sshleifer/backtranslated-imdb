After hearing so many people raging over this movie, I thought I'd give it a ride. Aside from being incredibly slow, I don't mind as long as the wait is worth it, but it's just not. As many others have said, there are so many inconsistencies, and so much of this movie just doesn't ring. The reaction of the 4 men changes from shock, horror to finding the body to end indifference while fishing. Certainly, if they were the type of men who would like to fish, they would just have reported the body and said they had only discovered it after their fishing trip. Why on earth bind the body to a tree, go fishing and then tell everyone you found the body 2 days earlier? It is so hard to see a movie that knew that protagonists' behavior is so inconsistent. As for the rest of the townspeople, you would think that at least one of them might show some curiosity about who actually killed the woman! The body itself, naked except knickers .... which scenario leads to it? If she was raped, why was it still? If she was raped with clothes, then why remove them from the back? If she was not raped then why take all her clothes out of the knuckles .... leaving yourself evidence of disposing of? I really can't think of any realistic scenario that would lead to anything but killing someone to steal their clothes so you can fill your jumble sale stall! Oh yes it is wise, but only just and only because, despite the poor script, the actor is strong.
