Bonjour Tristesse covers similar grounds as 'The Member of the Wedding.' that a possessive daughter tries to prevent a relationship between forming between a loved family member and an interlocutor. While critics love 'Member of the wedding', I find Julie Harris to be a jumbo-drag and an adenoidal, scenery-chomping thespian in everything she's been in. This depicts annoying, rich idiots like last year at Marienbad, but this time It's a travel suggestion. <br /> <br /> In these Preminger movies, however, characters do not develop. In the first 30 minutes he is happy to blur the father-daughter relationship between Seberg and Niven, making it uncomfortable to make sexual readings. Once the conflict is introduced, Seberg cannot deliver the depth required by the part. Kerr pulls rank and changes the movie to 'Endless Love'. Seberg's narrative story is like something out of Strange Interlude - it's not good. I really want someone else than Niven was in his role. He spends so much time normalizing orthodox British behavior in all his films, he never comes to the sign. <br /> <br /> In the most memorable order, an evening dance becomes free for everyone in a port. Bertolucci steals the whole scene for his empty exercise, 'The Conformist.' Kerr is on board to clasp his hands and portray another great pain (as in Black Narcissus, Iguana Night, King and I, heaven knows Mr. Allyson, tea and sympathy, etc.). Truly, Kerr was a horrible actress. I want any movie with her could end up with a deadly car accident, or better yet, start with one. People who are uncomfortable with ambiguity should avoid this.
