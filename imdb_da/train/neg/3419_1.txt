Okay, Chuck Norris has somehow found a way to get this successor produced. I have a question - why? Who read this script and said, "Sound is great! Original!" This movie is the regurgitated crap that I would not tarnish my toilet bowel with. Of course, there is another story that follows in the tradition of MIA, Invasion USA, Walker, Texas Ranger, Delta Force, and so on, where Chuck Norris is, of course, the only man to share America from some evil. He doesn't even need a gun most times. It is stupid patriotic jargon that sets the mind up. Big surprise that the only one who wants to lead these Norris movies is Chuck's son Eric. Eric Norris has primarily worked with all his father's films and TV shows. Isn't it a sign that he has no talent? Then he controls the same people as before in the same stories as before ... only difference is the names of the characters. If this were to make me patriotic and cheer for the United States than our country is in much worse shape than I had ever imagined. Hopefully this will be nail in Chuck Norri's play.
