I don't think I've ever felt it so it was let down by a movie before. Having loved Guy Ritchie's two previous films (I don't count swept away - he was pussy blind), I was looking forward to seeing this. <br /> <br /> The reviews were bad, and again I don't trust the press anyway. More worrying was the fact that the internet buzz was that this was a bit of a stink so it was with a little trepidation I surrendered my Â£ 4.80 yesterday afternoon. <br /> <br /> I don't even want to try to explain this movie, mainly because I have no idea what was going on and at one point I was honestly close to asking if it was just me who didn't get it! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think Ritchie seems to have fallen into his wife's trap to take it all too seriously. It seems that it was not good enough for him to make movies with good plot, laughing, talking dialogue and good characters. It's almost as if he had a checklist of movies he wanted to tear off, here are some of the ones I noticed: <br /> <br /> The Matrix, Fight Club, Kill Bill, The Usual Suspects, Vanilla Sky ... I think the most frustrating thing is that the performances of the two main actors, Jason Statham and Ray Liotta, were actually very good, and it was truly the self-explanatory story and editing / direction that made movies down. <br /> <br /> Saw a big, big thumb down from me.
