I still can't believe Wes Craven was responsible for this piece of shit. This movie is worse than "Deadly Friend". The reason is stupid, the play is mediocre and the movie is deadly boring. I don't know why Wes Craven hates his debut "Last House to the Left" - an absolute masterpiece of the genre and can (probably) suffer this turkey. I get wrong, I like some of his movies, but it was a real torture that sat and looked at this.
