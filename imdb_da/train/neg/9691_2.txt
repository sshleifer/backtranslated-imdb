This is superficial hedonism and / or social commentary wrapped in a tragic narrative of a jealous youth scheme to run apart with his father and his fiance. Is it incest or just a view through the eyes of a daughter with an Electra complex? So what? All the characters, except Anne (Deborah Kerr) are vacuumy and wise. Seberg is poor (I agree with the "boys with breasts" comment from a previous review). The reason plodded. This predictable material was sufficient for approx. 30 minutes movie, which unfortunately was stretched over an hour and a half! If you want to see gorgeous dresses and jewels on the Riviera, I recommend "To catch a thief" - where you get the extra bonuses of an entertaining story and similar characters. <br /> <br /> I like movies to entertain me. I'm not really interested in where a movie is set. No matter what time or place I want a good story - comedy or drama. I would also like to see some funny characters. It doesn't hurt if I can relate to them. Bad Deborah Kerr gives a typically good performance, and so does David Niven in a despicable role. <br /> <br /> The "2" value is exclusively for Kerr and Niven, and for cinematography - the rich color scenes and the creepy, obstructive black and white scenes. Unfortunately, all the great filmography in the world cannot save a bad story with unmatched characters. A sauce ear is still a sore ear. Therefore, it was a serious waste of my time to see this mess.
