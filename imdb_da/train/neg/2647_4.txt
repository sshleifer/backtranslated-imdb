I want to say one thing to Jeanette and Nelson - even when stretched in a smooth, unclear and painfully unfortunate musical here, there is still a glimpse of their eyes. Yes, the chain between the famous duo is there even when the material is paper thin. Even when the score is practically a throwaway, non-existent one depends on just a few catchy tunes. And though the circumstances are so incredible - even for a fantasy. The truth to tell, she has more chemistry with Nelson than with her own real husband, gene Raymond, in SMILIN 'THROUGH, who was nevertheless a much better movie. Sorry, I love Jeanette and Nelson as much as the next fan, but it's the bottom of the pile. Jeanette is more than embarrassing in her one "hep" number with Binnie Barnes - and Nelson can only come up with an empty star when faced with the most ridiculous situations. <br /> <br /> One can only wonder what this was like on Broadway in 1938. It must have had more sense and style than it is evident in this weak MGM production. Edward Everett Horton fizzles in an unfunny role, and none of the supporting players can draw breaths in this mess. It is just like the amateur in the studio, even with the few professionals who flocked among the supporters. <br/> <br /> Summary: Painfully clumsy reproduction of a Rodgers and Hart musical. Can't recommend it, even for MacDonald and Eddy fans. And while Jeanette's close-ups are still glowing with their gossamer beauty, this movie is staggeringly bad.
