Sunshine is a European import set in Hungary between 1880 and 1980, it is the epic story of Hungarian Jews, the Sonnenschein family. This name literally translates to Sunshine. The family has humble beginnings, so is wealthy, upward mobile, changes its name and hopes to assimilate into Hungarian society, so that successive generations can promote professionally. The story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles. For those who missed WW-II and the Holocaust in Europe, Sonnenschein's approach to life does not work very well. <br /> <br /> Sunshine is recognized as an artistic success, but it is a missed opportunity. The history line, dominated by world history, is predictable and transparent; this is enhanced by voice declaration and news archive recordings. The family's "plot" stems from a predictable event [ie. Hapsburgs, WW-I, WW-II, Fascism, Communism, etc.] to the next with little continuity, depth or detail. The Jewish assimilation theme is unfocused and important sub-themes [the "secret" diary and family philosophy] that could have given the family character and credibility have been resolved until the end. Alternatively, the filmmakers provide generation continuity using common incest / infidelity themes. <br /> <br /> Ralph Fiennes exhibits flash glimpses, but his performance is far from award-winning material. The "3 for 1" cast format is a viewer distraction and feels more like a cheap cinema gimmick than good theater. Sunshine is largely Hungarian "History Channel" material. It has the look of Winds of War, morphed with Forrest Gump morphed with something about sex. <br /> <br />
