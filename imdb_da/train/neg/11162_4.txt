Jack Black is an annoying character. This is an annoying indie film for 14 year olds. Should I write eight more lines? Ana de la Reguera is dang good to look at as a Mexican non that puts on the rather forward and rude progress of Jack Black. This movie is a PG 13 version of an indie movie. I really like a movie that has the courage to explore Mexican culture. This film explores Mexican culture-deep. I'm just shocking her cultural rudeness: Jack Black is just as rude. A white person like Jack Black is not my most valuable envoy to the Mexican culture as it was. Mexican Wrestling culture is not the most diaphanous place a white guy I could find myself. I suppose Mexico is more culturally opaque than Jack Black has presented here. <br /> <br /> I think IMDb has changed my review. Has anyone else had their review changed so well? Just a question.
