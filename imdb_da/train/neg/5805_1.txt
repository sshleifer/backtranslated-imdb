Anyone who saw the original had to go out and destroy this terrible remake. Alex Baldwin tries to imitate the late Steve Mcqueen in a word for word remake just doesn't work. While Baldwin has done some admirable work, it is a flop from start to finish. McQueen had charisma, never try to compete with a star. As for Kim in the role of Ali McGraw said enough. McQueen as dangerous, threatening and credible as Doc, the movie had excitement and excitement, Baldwin and company made this a comedy, I laughed the only time I saw this miserable movie. And the terrible hairstyle for Michael Madsen, one of today's more exciting and credible actors! Have the make-up people get it to Michael, what did they think? If you want to watch filmmaking, it was under Sam Peckinpah's direction Get the original!
