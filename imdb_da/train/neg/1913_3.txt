"Welcome to Collinwood" is a kind of disaster. Considering the people involved, it should have been several times better. <br /> <br /> Looking at it, if at least something is linked to the belief that it is getting better, it will probably make you cry. It's one of the movies that had potential but was robbed of this potential thanks to a horrible script and some bad play, not to mention the oddly annoying and unnecessary George Clooney character and the guy who reminds me Richard Dreyfuss, but about whom I care so little that I don't even want to know his name. <br /> <br /> The film's only saving grace is the weird concordance it introduces. I found myself thinking about it again and again when I saw several criminal hijackers. That's the only reason I gave the movie a 3. The plot is boring, the characters are neurotic, unnecessarily insulting and very unlikely. They are in a constant state of disturbing stress, and they are all so annoying that I celebrated their obstacles. They shout at each other and swear crookedly. The dialogue is at best conflicting stupid on its low points. <br /> <br /> I find Steven "Traffic" Soderbergherabracadabrablahblah and George Clooney to blame for this. They should be tried for war crimes if somebody actually remembers this crap enough to take care of.
