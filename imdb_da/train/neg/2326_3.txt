Dr Mordrid is scary. I would not recommend any adult or child to see this unless they are violent killers already. There is so much dirt in this movie it hurts in my yes. Talking about the eyes, there are eyes in the sky against a background of stars. Only the devil himself could have imagined such a wicked thing. I rented out every copy I could from local video stores and smashed them with a 5 pound cross. That movie must remain locked in a basement behind the fourth dimension with all the other nasty animals in hell. This is where this movie belongs. I suggest that if you want an outrageous entertainment, rent all dogs to heaven or angels abroad. These movies are worth seeing. If you want to commit a sin and love horrible movies, see Dr. Mordrid.
