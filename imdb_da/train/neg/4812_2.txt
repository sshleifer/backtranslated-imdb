I figured that any horror movie with Orson Welles in it would be weird. The necromancy was safe, but it was a little too strange because it was good. In fact, the film has a creepy feeling, as it is about a satanic / witch's cove in a small town and a young woman's attempt to escape them. However, the director seems to intentionally try to confuse the audience by using flashbacks and dream sequences. At the final there are too many unanswered questions. What's worse as the story is so confusing, it's pretty hard to mess with any of the characters. It seems strange that Welles would accept to overlook this movie, especially because he doesn't have that much to do. Maybe one day they will put a band of outtakes and bloopers from this movie. Now it would really be fun!
