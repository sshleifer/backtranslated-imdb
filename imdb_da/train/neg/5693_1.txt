I can't believe in the positive reviews of this movie - I thought it was one of the worst, most poorly executed and badly acted movies I've ever seen. And the plot was completely ridiculous (sp.). She starts out with him while he is tied to the chair? puh-lease. The worst part was that it wasn't even bad in a good, ridiculous way. Just awful - I couldn't figure out why they even disturbed showing it on HBO. I thought Belushi was ridiculously stupid - very incredible as an "eccentric" hitman. idk, I could go on - again, I'm shocked by the positive reviews. The only thing that kept me in mind is that it is fascinating to see how a movie can go wrong and what makes it bad. And the end didn't disappoint either in its silliness! "Live by the sword, die by the sword ..." ridiculous.
