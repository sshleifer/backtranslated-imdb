When you think of captivity, many words come to mind. Among them are: uninteresting, unentertaining, unsuspensful, unsexy, unfathomable and unwatchable. <br /> <br /> I used to hate these movies from the mid to late nineties, which were basically ripoffs by Scream, but these new Saw knockoffs are beginning to make these movies look like classics. They still pander to the same demographic that the other movies were so successful to do, but now they are adding a new level of degeneration that makes the twelve to fourteen year olds they aim to feel hardcore and hip . <br /> <br /> This movie is a lot of boring crap! What the hell happened to Larry Cohen? His name is not related to anything good since 1993! Still, I was still surprised to see that he had something to do with this, this bad thing! Was anyone surprised when the film's love was interested in being one of the psychopaths? Didn't anyone know when they first saw him? Only one who has never had it in his or her life, ever seen another movie!
