I just watched this movie and I have to say this with such a great premise and great talent, this turkey is right there !!! A friend lent me this movie and I looked with an open mind primarily because he had such great praise for the story. <br /> <br /> Now the movie started with Kevin Costner as a fighting pilot. Why? Why did they make him a fighter pilot? He was supposed to be hired by Anthony Quinn's character to be his new pilot ... Now we never see Costner walking near a plane for the rest of the movie! <br /> <br /> Costner runs into a Texan (James Gammon) who sells a horse to a big Mexican businessman and Costner tags together for a ride. Without knowing what happened, Gammon is too close to death, and Costner drives him to the meeting, which happens to be with an associate of Quinn! But nothing comes of it ... nada, zilcho! Why did they have Gammon's character? Why do they have horse sales with the Quinn allies, if none of that should come? <br /> <br /> Even after they leave Costner for death, they make Madeline Stowe's character a whore, then she attacks one of Quinn's men who pays for a trip ... she sticks him with her own knife, and the next thing she has been moved to a monastery! No explanation of why she was moved or when it was done! <br /> <br /> Too much talent wasted on such a weak script and bad editing !! I only saw this because a friend owned it and let me see it ... I will throw it on him for the 2 hours I wasted in my life and looked at the blasted thing!
