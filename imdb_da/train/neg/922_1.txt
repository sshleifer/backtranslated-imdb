This movie is exactly what you get when you really stretch your skills, it's like someone who just passed the driving test and then sucked them into a Formula 1 Grand Prix (I can't add the US Grand Prix, which everyone might pulls out because of risky tires and you can just win) it is so far short this movie falls. Now don't take the wrong way, I love B movies, about half of my collection is made of B movies, but I don't think there are enough letters in the alphabet to describe how bad this movie is. <Br /> <br /> The first of the story (for a B movie) is not that bad, it has the potential to make a B-Movie tag, did not speak Friday 13th. potential, but potential anyway. But what really lets this movie down is the play, in no second I think it's like watching QVC unless the presenters at QVC tend to have a heavier tan. To sum up, I would like to say that I've seen worse movies, but I can't.
