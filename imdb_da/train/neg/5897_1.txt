The renowned Japanese director Takashi Miike may not seem to make the wheels move with this torpedo thriller, an adaptation of Yasushi Akimoto's book of an evil old woman (and child abuser!), Part of a new city legend: if your mobile phone rings with a strange tone - and you see the message "A missed call" - you will only play the message to hear your own last words before your death. The most successful part of the movie is the trenchant satire of Reality TV cameras penetrating the victims of the future, but the not so elaborate deaths (including a hidden piece of red candy) are disappointing and vanishing. The frequent shots of ravaged dead bodies actually appear discreet and this overall courtesy may be the reason why the film is ultimately so obscene. Hollywood jumped predictably on the long-term perceived plot in 2008, but the American version did not improve. No stars from ****
