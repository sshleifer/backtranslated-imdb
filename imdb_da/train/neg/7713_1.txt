I knew this movie was going to be so bad it was fun, so I went into it with that expectation. I found it just as bad that it was murderously boring. The whiny theme song is fun for about 10 seconds until you realize that there is nothing wise about it except its purposefully annoying quality. Seeing things get splattered with tomatoes gets old in about 30 seconds. There is just nothing wise or funny about the movie except the premise. It could sustain a 3-4 minute comedy sketch perhaps, but this is just not a feature film of any kind of fantasy.
