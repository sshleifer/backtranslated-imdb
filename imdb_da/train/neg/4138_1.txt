I though it would be an okay movie, because I like zombies and horror movies in general. But I didn't think it would be such a piece of sh! T as it was. The only zombie in the movie is in the beginning and he is running over by a god damn car !!! The movie seems to be written by a porn director and full of porn actors, I would never call them actors! The costumes seem to be stolen from a local school game. It seems like a road movie with almost no monsters. There is no fun in this piece of sh! T, only horror, but not the way the director intended. I'd rather be raped by a pedophile than see this movie ever again !!! Ugh!
