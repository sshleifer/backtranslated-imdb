See a video recorded version of approx. 8 different 1994-1997 Spider-man comic books made me realize why I couldn't figure it out when it first came out. <br /> <br /> I'm from the old school where the 1967 Spider-Man cartoon was the best and still the best. (I'm not going to get into the psychedelic version, which is terrible - give me traditional villains.) <br /> <br /> The action of the new stuff is miserable, read a sheet with either no feeling or abuse. Paul Soles, where are you now? This guy was the best in the voice that worked for Spider-Man. No one comes close. Seeing Secret Wars, a good idea for a cartoon mini-series, made me win. Dr. Doom sounds like a comedy version of Bela Lugosi. In a scene with Red Skull and Doc Ock, Red Skull has no German accent, while Ock is heavy Russian! The old Marvel comic series from 1966 had much better voice acting. Iron Man sounded like he had an iron mask, Captain America sounded authoritative not as a teenage child. Paul Frees as things in the 60s was the best thing ever. The old voters were pioneers, and there will never be anyone like them. Have you ever heard Mel Blanc's son? No way can he replicate his father. <br /> <br /> The animation is lumpy. Okay, so they have all the fancy shadows and nicely painted backrounds. Sometimes one can say more with less movement if more movement looks bad. Sometimes when you let the computer take over the movements, they become robotic. I really don't think any of these animators know what is between them. <br /> <br /> The stories are poorly written and some of the lines they give the hero are terrible. Why, for example, when heroes are assembled for the first time, do they begin to fight each other? In secret wars, it was a bad excuse that made them disagree. I can see if the hero was dark, unknown and mysterious - just like the Punisher, but why Thing and Iron Man can't keep their barrels with each other is ridiculous so the burner comes in. This is just another of the later comic strip trends. getting heroes squared for a few seconds because "everyone" wants to see the things. Give them a better reason to fight, and maybe it can be removed, but "Hey what are you doing here" and "You don't tell me what to do" are LAME reasons. Another badly written scene is in The Wedding, where Harry Osborne masks to destroy Peter's wedding. The whole scenario was terrible. <br /> <br /> Last, but certainly not least, is what another critic calls Juvenile Violence - which means no stroke at all. In secret warriors, the lizard gently struck the charge of the thing. But Thing beats the bad guys in a whole block in the comics. He just has to come back to lift heavy things and subdue a bad guy by addressing him in the drawings. Sure, these cartoons were not strictly for us adults, but for children under 12. Therefore, they cannot beat because Mom and Dad do not believe in such violence. But you can blow things up, these cartoons will include it. As a child before political correctness came in fashion I saw cartoons that voted each other. What's wrong with a blow to the chops? Is there really less violence in the world today, because the slim and hanging new cartoons took off? I find this the most offensive of all when I see the new things. They have written out the "punk" because we could all hurt ourselves. <br /> <br /> Children, enjoy these cartoons all you want, I've seen enough. <br /> <br /> 3/10 rating
