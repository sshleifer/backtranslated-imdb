This was just a horrible movie. It hurt me to see it. Almost all actions were unmotivated within the framework of the movie, the actor was really bad (P.Diddy was the best actor who really says something about the movie) and the plot was generally predictable. Some links to Carlito's Way were okay, for example his dream of one day moving to the Caribbean, but overall they were weak. The interest of love in my opinion was flat out wrong, but hey it is debatable. Anyways I really didn't expect much before watching the movie and I think you could say even those expectations were not met. I feel bad for Jay Hernandez because he's actually a decent actor (Friday Night Lights). He's lucky, but because I'm sure there won't be too many people watching this movie. I generally give movies a decent rating if they spark my interest at all, so I'll go ahead and give this a two star. Better luck next time. And yes I enjoyed Carlito's Way.
