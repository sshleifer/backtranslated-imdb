This is an installment on the infamous Guinea Pig series. A brief Japanese television show that was canceled after a psychopath admitted to being inspired by the murder of a young schoolgirl at the show. This short in the series, like any other movie in the series, is practically without any history. A group of guys have caught a young woman. They tie her down and continue torturing her to death while filming her. They beat her, pour boiling oil over her, use pliers on her and finally, in "loving" close-up, push a needle through the eye. This is the most straightforward of all the guinea pig films, and one of the first ones. It was probably this movie, more than any of the others who gave Guinea Pig the rumor of being snuffed. They gave particular inspiration to Nicolas Cage's film "8 mm". These films have become very popular in horror circles. They have evolved into more polished but equally graphic films as "Naked Blood". They probably fill the void left by the Mondo films that were slightly cleaned up and became reality TV. Not recommended, but will probably entice those who want to see something once and ask myself why I later know I did.
