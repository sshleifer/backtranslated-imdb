One: Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason, two amazing comics became saps for a bratty kid. They have both sold out in this one, worse than Pryor's character. Two: Terrible, too sentimental script that could have been used in a Harold Lloyd movie, it was so clumsy. Three: Selection of a black actor as the toy; The fast subtitle of this is unbearable as it is never addressed. There is no message here, Pryor's part could have been played by any comic actor. Four: That child ... I wish I could come back in time and prevent him from acting ... that would mean that movies like this and Kid Co. might not have been made ... and my childhood would have been free of their mind-warping power. So if you want to see some amazing comics, thicken yourself in a sick sweet kiddie flick, move on. If you want to see them in something good, then see Pryor's old standup action and Gleason in something better, like honeymooners.
