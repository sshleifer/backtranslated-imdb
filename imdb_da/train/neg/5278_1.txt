When a comedy movie boasts its amazing soundtrack on the back cover, you don't know you have anything to do with a top notch movie. I rented this movie with friends expecting to get some chuckles, but generally to get most of our laughs at each other to make fun of the movie. We couldn't have chosen a worse movie. <br /> <br /> The movie may have been okay with a few changes. First, the comedy was painful. Physical gags were poorly executed and located. The cool kid in the movie made us kill ourselves, bless him to try the scene in and the scene out, but he was like a puppy begging for love. If he had been withdrawn from the movie, everything could have been tolerable. There were some funny jokes, I think one was when the group of boys steals one of their parents' porn movies and it turns out to be gay porn. But in order to best summarize the comedy, I would just like to tell opening act for the obese child. He has a nice colored shirt and tells us not to know when something has been done. <br /> <br /> To finish, the movie editor could have saved the movie by removing the obese child, cutting out 20 minutes of school scenes and ending one that is longer than thirty seconds of random bickering. <br /> <br /> OH, BTW, there are two good elements that the movie possesses. Kadeem Hardison plays his role wonderfully and performs his jokes so that no one is missed or undervalued. The second redeeming element in the movie is the beautiful Mrs. Ali Landry. Her character is most ignored by the film, which is a shame. Don't waste your time, even rent it. It did not appeal to me and I was part of the target audience (18 men).
