Okay. So I just came back. Before I begin my review, let me tell you one thing: I would like this movie. I know I have been negative in the past, but I was hoping to be surprised and actually suffered from the movie. I did not do it. <br /> <br /> It's not just the fact that every horror cliché is conceivable in this. And it's not just the fact that they do every little thing for a hopping blow (goes into a baseball cloth lying on the floor? Do you scour me?). It just wasn't scary. One thing I was surprised at: there was more blood than I thought there should be ... which doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Donna being dropped by Lisa's mother at her house. She comes in. Going upstairs. Camera pans for her father died on the couch. Spooky. She goes upstairs where the aforementioned baseball bat scene happens. Find her brother on the bed, apparently dead (how could she tell? He didn't have a platelet on him). Killer enters, Donna hides under the bed, mother dies. She runs outside to scream for help. Killer behind her: "I did it for us." Cut for therapy session. This confused many people - everyone asked if her family actually died or if she imagined it - and she mentions how the nightmares have started to come back. Filler dialogue follows. <br /> <br /> They cut to the hunt quite quickly. Get scenes in the salon they go to the hotel. Of course, the killer is already there (for some reason he escaped 3 days ago, but the police / family were not informed until he was already there). More rags ensues. <br /> <br /> I don't want to continue what happens in the movie because I don't want to spoil it too much. If you want to know who dies, Horror_Fan has already made a post about it. But about the deaths: They were not so exciting. People in the theater actually laughed loudly (an experience I have never had before in a horror movie, not even in When a Stranger Calls) during several of them. One in particular: bus boy guy who gives the most hilarious 'scared' face I've ever seen. The only death involving any blood was Lisas and it was pretty scarce. Her neck is cut, blood (if you can even call it so - it was almost black) splatters on curtain stuff. The only other blood was on Claire when we saw her body. Apparently, Fenton decided to stab her a couple of times after he had choked her to death. Um, okay? The movie was one of the most clichés I've ever seen. Let's see here .. Mandatory mirror-curtain-BOOM! scene. Check. Twice, actually (you could tell they were struggling). Mandatory back-up kittens. Check. There's also a back-up lamp, but you've all seen it. Oh, you say you want a bird flight scare? Now you have it! (Yes, they managed to incorporate one of them in here). And of course, we-have-security-on-all-out-but-he-still-escaped scene. Should I continue? I could. <br /> <br /> For anyone who says the characters were not stupid, do you laugh at me? "Oh, though the massive alarm rings, literally says VACATE THE BUILDING, and 3 of my friends are missing, I have to go upstairs to get my wrap." These characters were some of the most flawed and stupid characters ever. The only sympathetic character - Lisa - made one of the most stupid movements in the film. "Oh, I just understood that the psycho teacher is here! I have to leave my strong boyfriend behind to run by myself to warn her! Oh shoot, the elevator is slowing down. Guess I take the stairs and run off at construction site! "UH. At the end of the movie, they deserved everyone to die. The only death that anyone felt was Dona's girlfriend (I can't even remember his name - is that so bad?), And at that time, the audience was drained out of this monstrous, cliché movie. <br /> <br /> There were some positives - the action was decent for the most part and it was well shot. But it's about it. <br /> <br /> I'd give it a 1/5 and it's generous. Just for the laughs (and believe me, the audience had a few) and Brittany Snow. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the reaction was poor. Very bad. People were boo-ing after the movie ended and the buzz afterwards was very negative. Expect bad legs for this.
