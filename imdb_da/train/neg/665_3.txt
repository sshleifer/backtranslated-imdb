In Bridgeport, the staggered high school teacher Richard Fenton (Johnathon Schaech) is obsessed with teenage student Donna Keppel (Brittany Snow); she testifies that he kills his family to stay with her, but Richard is arrested and sent to prison for life. Three years later, the traumatized Donna feels better, but is still undergoing psychological treatment and taking pills. On her prom night, she goes with her boyfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and two friends to the Pacific Grad Hotel for the party. But the psychopath Richard has fled the prison and is located on the same floor of the hotel that chases Donna and sticks his friends and staff in the hotel crossing his way. The unforgettable slash "Prom Night" is a collection of clichés with a total lack of originality. The stupid story is low and stupid, with a bad act by Johnathon Schaech in the role of an insane killer. The predictable manuscript is great as it is possible to predict what will happen in the next scenes. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Morte Convida Para Dançar" ("The Death Invites to Dance")
