This film is about a Japanese woman who has an occupation of calligraphy on the skin. The ground is completely bizarre. I fail to see any "sensual" or "erotic" undertones. The foundation becomes an old art form for a fetishist pornography. In addition, the scenarios recorded in Hong Kong are probably depicting bad parts of Hong Kong, such as Airport in the middle of the city, poor living conditions and noise pollution. Throughout the film, I continue to think that "The Pillow Book" offends Japanese culture and the Hong Kong environment. "The Pillow Book" is a perverted but boring movie. Keep it away from it.
