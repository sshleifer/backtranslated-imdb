This is a very confusing movie. The movie is very difficult to follow and the plot did not seem to have any meaning. Wolfman's rage was made in Spain, and I think that when any movie is dubbed from one language to another, it doesn't translate exactly as it was the first time. Perhaps this is part of the problem, but I doubt if it can take into account all the problems with this movie. The headline is rather poor and the voices do not match the characters. The scenes are choppy, there are a host of strange and irrelevant characters that make a little more than confuse the viewer even more. What I liked about this movie was the wolfman's appearance himself and the scenes where he was attacking. Now, if they could have put it together and had something sensible, they could have had something. Don't waste your time on this one.
