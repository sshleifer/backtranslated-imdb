Indescribably discombobulated turkey, a mix of anti-Nazi musical (!!) pre-war Americana and Agatha Christie whodunit spoof with a big big problem: it's deadly unfunny. In addition to the single-digit I.Q. plot and dialogue, the most amazing aspect of "Lady ..." is berserk casting. Gene Wilder (star and co-author) tries hard on it all: he plays a romantic lead (with his looks !! and his age !! he and Woody Allen were to start a club for clueless, mirrorless aging comedians) and he is trying to move be funny and sneaky and smart, and try to sing and dance and succeed in NOT !! A looong shot from his good old days with Mel Brooks. For a while I thought I had nearsightedness because everyone in the movie says Cherry Jones is this beautiful hot chick and that Michael Cumpsty is this impossibly beautiful stallion !! The guy who plays Claire Bloom's male secretary is a breathtaking bald thin actress, as sexy as a chair and is passionate about the two leading ladies !! Mike Starr's over-the-top, which acts as the most incompetent, most audacious cop you ever saw, deserves to rank among the 10 most abominable performances in the latest movie story. The saddest note is to see wonderful Claire Bloom and Barbara Sukowa completely miscast and offensive wasted. In any case, I hope both stars paid their bills home (and then fired their agents) with this flop. No wonder acting prodigy Sukowa returned to Germany after she saw what Hollywood had in store for her !! <br /> <br /> To see how to get a really bad movie out of a really bad script with a berserk casting director, study this - otherwise stay away !!! - 1/10
