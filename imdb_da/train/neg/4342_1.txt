I have to say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. They had a pretty good story to go on, but then it boasted so badly. First of all, the throw is all wrong, where did the crazy (crap actor btw) and puff girl come from ??? It looks like Carlito has come from the hood and used to hang around with some real idiots. This movie does not make the "Carlitos Way" any justice. I am so glad that the successor "Carlito's Way" came out first, if I had seen this nonsense first, I would never have given the pacino version a chance. And yet, pacino should have read this story, thought it was shit and did the sequel instead. Carlito's Way: Step to Power - 1 out of 10. Carlito's Way - 9 out of 10.
