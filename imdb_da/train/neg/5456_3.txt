This is just one of those horrifying movies that you will find on Lifetime TV that portrays the eerie behavior of some obnoxious women in an empathic way. Along with other so uncomfortable movies like "The Burning Bed", "Enough" or "Monster," this movie takes a disgusting criminal and tries to show the viewer why she is not such a bad person. Give us a break! Here's my question for the filmmakers: If LeTourneau was a man and Vili was a 12 year old girl, would you have made a picture sympathetic and empathy with that person? Answer: Hell no. <br /> <br /> Imagine changing the sexes in this movie and then see why yourself and others here consider this a worthless piece of waste. If the sexes were changed, there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal. Instead, we will probably be treated to a depiction of a monstrous and hefty man who characterizes a young girl, his huge behavior landing him in prison and his brainwashed victim suffering from Stockholm's syndrome. The only reason LeTourneau does not receive the same treatment in this movie is by virtue of her gender. Let's call a spade a spade. LeTourneau is a pedophile. Simple and simple. No ifs, ands or buts. She is a criminal who belongs to the prison and deserves our sneak and contempt, but certainly not our shame or empathy.
