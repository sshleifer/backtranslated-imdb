This is the worst sequel in the world of movies. Once again, it does not. The killer is still killing for fun. But this time he kills people making a movie about what happened in the first movie. That means it's the stupidest movie ever. <br /> <br /> Don't look here. If you appreciate the precious hour in this movie then don't see it. You want to ask the director and the person next to you what made him do it. Because it just doesn't combine the original brands of horror, action and crime. Don't let your kids see this. Teen, young child or young adult, this movie has that kind of impact on people.
