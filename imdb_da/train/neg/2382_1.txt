There are movies like "Plan 9" that are so bad they have a charm about them. There are some like "Waterworld" who have the same inexplicable drawing as a car accident and there are some like "Desperate Living" that you hate to admit you love. Cowgirls have none of these redemptions. The cast collection has enough talent to make almost any plot visible, and from what I've been told, the book is enjoyable. How could this movie be so intolerably bad? Initially, it seems that the director has collected a cast name without any other tie than what will bring in the 20 somethings. So tell them to make their best Kevin Costner imitations. Open the book randomly and start shooting what is on the page and be sure to keep the big expansions in America from being interesting in any way. Finally, edit the job for your brother-in-law because the meat packing plant has just put him off. He has twenty years of cutting experience. <br /> <br /> This movie now defines the basement for me. It's so bad, it's not even good for being bad.
