I saw an episode. Yes I was through the whole miserable experience, and I have to say that this comedy mark is one of the worst you get. Imagine Peter Griffin, Family Guy's Fame. Now imagine Peter Griffin as an (admittedly slim and minus the glasses) woman, except he now lacks something that made him fun. Peter Griffin is an idiot, but he doesn't know he's an idiot. Sarah has none of the real character, none of the acting ability to draw her character. Maybe it's the trite, formal jokes that draw her comedy even lower than her character can take it herself. Perhaps it is a lack of credible films. Her insensitive, bigoted persona can appeal to insensitive, bigoted people as opposed to the mass appeal that Stephen Colbert's insensitive, bigoted character has. Like Bill O'Reilly, Sarah creates an annoying, unfunny character. She lacks something needed for the satire's genre, let alone for the whole comedy world. What Sarah Silverman lacks is noticeable. And when you don't believe it and identify with it, it's no fun anymore.
