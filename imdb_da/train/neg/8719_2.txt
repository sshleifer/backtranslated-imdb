Well here I go with another B-industry film. It is sad enough to see some badly made movies, but I don't care if a B-industry or C-industry produces the movie. Show some effort in your work. The characters are really bad. The action is not in the question in this one (surprise), but plot is. How can a tight team match witness two of their fellow soldiers slaughtered and then proceed as if nothing has happened. What spoiled me was how the writer himself threw the remaining members a scene where they laughed at how nice the doctor's ass was. Give me a break.
