Awesomely unlikely and stupid pot boiler that at least has some redeeming, sharp location photography, but it's too incredible to generate much in the way of excitement. I was hoping Stanwyck wouldn't do it again because she was really sitting with the wet one, in more ways than a man, and she also had an idiot child. Why not run off with Meeker? But the insidious question remains. What kind of wood was it that the pier support made of if a mess of it took off, did not flow? Stanwyck, always impeccably professional, does the best she can with the material, but it is durable.
