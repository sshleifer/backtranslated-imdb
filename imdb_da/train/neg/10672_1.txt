It had all the clich√©s of films of this type and no substance. The plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie I felt like a sucker to see it. Production was good; However, script and acting were B-movie quality. The cast was poor because there were good actors mixed with crumby actors. The good actors did not keep their own, nor did they raise the others. <br /> <br /> This movie is not worth more words but I would say more to meet the minimum ten line requirements. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. plays caricatures by itself in other movies. <br /> <br /> Looking for thoughtless entertainment, I still wouldn't recommend this movie.
