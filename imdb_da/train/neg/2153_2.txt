3-D'en in "The Man Who Was Not There" stands for DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! This scary comedy has miserable 3-D effects that make the 3-D effects in "Jaws 3", "Amityville 3" and "Friday the 13th Part 3" better for comparison. Not to mention the movie is the extreme. This was one of many 1983 films to show pop-off-the-screen effects. Steve Guttenberg and Jeffrey Tambor got caught in this mess, but at least they didn't kill their career. Tambor would continue to star on HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show" and Ron Howard's box office smash "How to Grinch Stole Christmas" while Guttenberg followed this flop with "Police Academy" and "Cocoon". What them in these projects instead of them here in "The man who was not there". If you do, you will regret it. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (out of four)
