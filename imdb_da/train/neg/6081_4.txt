A typical 70's Italian movie, original and good music, but with some quirks, interesting but not fantastic photography, poor and sometimes confused history (eg the Wolf dog's role and where does the boy come from?) With little dialogue, good mood . The reason why it is still (relatively) known and sought after is probably the naked scenes (including typical 70s pseudo-coitus) involving an 11 and 13 year old girl with an older teenage girl (Eva Ionesco and Laura Wendel) - that's interesting From a socio-political point of view, see how these representations of very young people were considered acceptable and normal throughout Europe (and the United States) 30 years ago, while now being more than taboo. The story revolves around the bullying of a girl (Laura) of the other two characters and her discovery of sex, a fairly precise representation of an aspect of teenage life. The character of Eva (Silvia) does not develop at the end of the film and is already very well-versed in the erotic art - there is no "age" for her: she is a very unsuccessful young girl who is already aware of her sexual charm, but ultimately has just been used and ends the film crying like the little girl she really is still. The boy is a completely despicable bully, while Laura comes across as a very naive and weak victim.
