I found "The Arab Conspiracy" in a trading box and thought I would uncover a lost treasure. People there is a reason why you don't hear much about this movie. The reason is muddy, pacing is slow, Cornelia Sharpe is about as vivacious as ordinary, cold tofu, and the end leaves you flat. Not even Sean Connery can save this.
