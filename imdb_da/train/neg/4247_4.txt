A painfully long-lasting, exciting and predictable drama will be my twenty-fifth Sidney Lumet movie, Garbo Talks, filed precisely at the low quality at the end of my quest. <br /> <br /> The film documents a harried young workman named Gilbert (Ron Silver), the son of Estelle Rolle (Anne Bancroft), eccentric, feisty and above all an obsessive fan of Greta Garbo. When Estelle is hit by a brain tumor, her son decides to go on an obsessive quest for herself: Track down Greta Garbo and bring her to her mother. Anne Bancroft is in full on, chew-the-scenery Auntie-Mame fashion here, the kind of feisty ol 'gal the movie lover where she opens up to people and stands up for her ideals and ends up in prison all the time. She stands outside the film as an obvious artificial construction, and every scene with her is yuk-yuk lame; each note is fake. The rest of the figures are just as one-dimensional, but extremely less interesting. Ron Silver is flat as it may be, and his attempt at love triangle is as telegraphed as something else in the movie: He is dating wealthy Lisa Rolfe (Carrie Fisher), but is merged with oddball employee Jane Mortimer (Catherine Hicks) and I called each scene three scenes before they happened. <br /> <br /> That's the second problem. One-dimensional characters can survive if they are in an exciting and captivating story, but there is simply nothing here. The movie's pace is glacial, brilliant with foreign material that strengthens absolutely nothing, and when the film begins to follow a linear plot, it is both plodding and uninteresting. There are plenty of guest stars, so to speak, including Harvey Fierstein as a gay New Yorker (imagine it) in yet another endless scene. Later in the film, it tries to make a halfway a decent statement about the nature of nature idol and its role in our lives, but at that time none of the signs exist as real people, and the film has bored me for submission, so it seems like a too late, too late. The movie is my twenty-fifth Lumet-directed film that makes him my most famous director, but beyond a few egregious misses (A Stranger Among Us, anyone?), He has not plumbed the painfully uninteresting depths of Garbo Talks. <br /> <br /> {Degree: 4.5 / 10 (C / C-) / # 21 (out of 24) in 1984 / # 23 of 25 Lumet Movies}
