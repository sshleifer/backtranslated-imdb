What happens when you give a free man enough money to catch him in the rat race and see him crazy? Homeless people correspond to none. They have no mortgages, rent payments or idiot bosses. Homeless people don't have to worry about IRS or performance reviews or credit card payments. But give them just enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car, and suddenly they have to worry about getting into the rat race, buying gas for transportation, paying insurance on their car and working for another. They get a chance to be "productive citizens." This movie was about as useful as a movie can be. It is a way for the rich and middle class sheep to say "see what happens when you try to help the poor?" and it claims capitalist arrogance. <br /> <br /> Why not a movie asking, "What happens when you take away everything a rich man has?"
