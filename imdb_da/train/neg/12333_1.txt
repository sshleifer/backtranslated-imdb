Un-bleeping-believable! Me Ryan doesn't even look at his usual pert beloved self in this, which usually makes me forgive his superficial ticky acting schtick. Hard to believe she was the producer of this dog. Plus Kevin Kline: What kind of suicide journey has his career been on? Whoosh ... Banzai !!! Finally, was this directed by the guy who did Big Chill? Must be a rendering of Jonestown - hollywood style. Wooofff!
