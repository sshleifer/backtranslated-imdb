So why does this show suck? Unfortunately, it is really the only question, because there is no doubt that it does. <br /> <br /> For those who are not familiar with the show, the doomed-to-be-lived series focuses on a number of Neanderthals and their struggle to exist in modern America and are based on the characters who appears from a series of TV ads for Geico Insurance. The concept is solid, and there is every reason to believe it could be done successfully. <br /> <br /> I had to think about it for a while, but then tagline from the advertisements - something that comes with "We're not that much different from you" gave me the key to the show's suckiness. Although the cavemen / Neanderthals are actually different from humanity, the titles of this show show that they are exactly the same as those that are boring jerks. Maybe it's my background as a game writer - rather than a fun, hack, California-based selection-based author - but this show had so much potential and none of it has been realized. Initially, the manufacturers should have focused on the fun things that would make cavemen different from us. <br /> <br /> What could be fun, for example, to give them profession as an everlasting graduate student and furniture retailer, as they would have been more convincingly drawn to things like underground relief workers and caving guides? Why would they play prosaic games like squash when a whole episode could be devoted to them, trying to get hunting licenses to go after spear games? A show like this could write itself, and it requires something intentionally bad to write to make it so wild and boring. <br /> <br /> Another boring aspect of this show is an attempt to portray the holders as subject to a number of stereotypes associated with different human minorities. Yawn! This has been done so many times before, and never more swiftly than this. And, as mentioned earlier, Neanderthals is really a different kind, so using them as a metaphor for racist stereotypes is both uncomplicated and off the ground. <br /> <br /> Answers are welcome, including those from anyone who wants to tell me why I'm wrong I like this show and am just sorry I haven't been able to. <br /> <br /> Michael J.
