I just watched this movie and I have to say it was a great waste of time. The girl who played Eva (Ellen Fjaestad) cannot act at all. She read her lines very naturally, and she had a very un-natural facial expression throughout the film. Rosanna Chats who played Petra on the other hand is a natural one. She played her part with great perfection. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS! The story was simple - we have seen many, many times before. She breaks up, he finds another, she gets jealous, he breaks up with the other girl and they end up again eventually. There were no surprises at all that you knew Eva would break up and that Adam would "connect" with Petra. The only thing that nobody saw was that Petra told Adam to go after Eve at the party. She became serious, which is a side of Petra, which the viewers had not seen earlier in the film and told him to win Eve's heart back, which was really sweet. <br /> <br /> In addition to Rosanna Munter, this is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors, so I do not recommend it!
