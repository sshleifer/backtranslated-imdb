!!!!! OF COURSE THERE IS SPOILER !!!!! I'm sure this project started as a screen printer workshop to avoid horror movie clichés: Female protagonist - Checks Bad things happen to drug addicts - Check Heorine knocks out villain - Check Heroine doesn't notice the villain regains unconsciousness - Check Frame the sequence see restored villain crawling behind heroines - Check Unfortunately, it seems that someone has sent this cliché list to a movie studio instead of using it for the class. Dear Oh dear, if only London transport was as regular as the clichés turn up here. In fact, there are so many clichés and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about detailing what the eponymous creep is, or how long has he killed people on the ground. I am led to believe that it is the result of a human experiment, and perhaps it is not until the night he decided to avenge himself on humanity, but all this is so vague that it is meaningless. Not quite negative. I doubt very much whether manufacturers thought they would make a film to sweep Oscars that year, and there is always a horror movie market. Likewise, I doubt whether it costs too much products and had an eye on the DVD market instead of cinema distribution, and I would like to say that it is a little better than the 1972 DODLINE, which also contained a murderous cannibal store in the London underground. it's just that when you think all clichés have been used in this movie, another cliché comes together to raise his ugly head
