If I hadn't been forced to see this for reasons of work, I would never have passed the first 10 minutes. And even then I admit quickly forwarded through parts. The '63 movie version was much better in all respects. Yes, I have read this is more faithful to the original game, but what a wise thing it was for the author to change the manuscript in '63! It is slow, it draws, the songs that are in this version and not the movie version, are boring and imaginative. The version of "Kids" in the '63 version was very fun and a true classic of sarcastic parenting humor. In this version, Kim is too old, Conrad is * horrible * to see (when someone ripped off his shirt from him, I closed in disgust ... the director of this version has no idea what sex is.). This Conrad can't dance, can't sing (he can't even stop) and is simply repulsive. If Elvis Presley had really been like that, his career would have passed before it began. As for the other actors, I continued to wait for Alexander's toupee to fall as he danced, and Daly was completely over as Momma. See Stapleton's performance in the movie version to see the same role correctly performed by one who understands comic timing. This TV version is nothing but a total waste of some time.
