The reason for this movie is an important point: that this murderer was also a responsible, loving, caring father. Not being a father and a killer is impossible. But this man is shown to murder a teenage girl without provocation or reason and without feeling. This girl was someone else's daughter. I don't think a father who used so much about his own daughter could have been so cold-blooded to the daughter of another. Or alternatively could have been so cold blooded and yet worry about and take care of her own daughter. And the idea that a doomed killer would actually ask his victim's parents to take in and take care of his daughter is convinced. <br /> <br /> It was said that the characters were acting with conviction from the actors. I thought changing Scott Bakula's eye color made him seem more cold and threatening than he usually is. You couldn't even see in his eyes.
