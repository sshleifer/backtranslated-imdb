Why me? Why should I be subjected to such slaughter of what could have made an interesting plot? At least if I can warn other people, it's been worth it. <br /> <br /> I had to watch this horrible movie for a college course. Otherwise I would have looked at synopsis at the back of the case and steered clear. The movie was slow, had faked little character development and centered around the idea that a creepy little white man could get cool if he was hanging out with an LA-style token black man. <br /> <br /> To experience the stereotypical LA sense of dizzying superficiality - see the movie. Note, however, that this movie does not reject what we have come to think of as an "LA lifestyle", it is a wonderful example of the products derived from it.
