I mistakenly kept myself awake late last night and looked at this thing. About the only thing I could say well about this horrible movie is that it could be used by film schools to show how not to make a movie. No proper character development, wait, I'm not even sure they were characters. Set-ups were hokey and inane, and over-use of split screens was wasted as they sometimes could not synchronize with alternative shots. If I could give this a zero or my rating I would. Unfortunately, it's not even worth a little for a few laughs. It's just a boring example of money wasted by Hollywood, and now I'm wasting my time and thinking about it myself.
