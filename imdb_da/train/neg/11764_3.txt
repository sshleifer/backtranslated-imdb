I have to say that I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and finding something new in what would separate it from most boring and all-inclusive Mexican films. I have no idea why, but I trusted Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas to be the one to inject freshness and confidence into our non-existent industry. Maybe it was because the soundtrack (which I listened to before I saw the movie) sounded different from others, maybe it was because it dared to include newer faces (except for Demian Bichir, who is always a favorite of Mexican film directors) and apparently acted within it script with modern social behavior, perhaps because it is photography I saw in trailers was bright and realistic instead of theatrical. The movie turned out to be a great crowd pleaser, and a great letdown. What Serrano is really dealing with is the very old-fashioned "gender" as in "all men are the same" and "why is it that all women ...;" blah blah blah. Nothing new in it, not even that it uses so much common ground and clich√© that eventually it mocks itself without leaving any valuable reflection on the female / male state. Full of regular trampling on the audience as secure gags on cliches I talked about before (they always work, always) and screaming performances (it's a well-acted movie in its context) .. and by screaming I literally mean. The first more convincing characters played by Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir prove to be more pathetic, according to Serrano. I totally disagree with Serrano, they should not have been treated this way only to serve as puppets for his lesson to come through ... he made sure we got his message and completely ruined their roles which were the only ones solid ground where this story could have stood. Still, it is a very entertaining movie at times, and you will probably be happy to see it (if you agree to be manipulated by it).
