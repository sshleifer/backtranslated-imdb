A horrible movie that everyone has said. What made me laugh was Scott McNealy's cameo look, giving a prize to one of the murdered programmers in front of a wall of the SUN logos. McNealy is the CEO of SUN Microsystem, a company that virtually defines itself by its hatred of Microsoft. They have contributed to filing antitrust complaints against Microsoft. So were they stupid enough to think that this bad movie would add fuel to that fire? <br /> <br /> There is no public record I see on SUN's commitment, but clearly the filmmakers in this movie know Scott McNealy. An interesting mystery.
