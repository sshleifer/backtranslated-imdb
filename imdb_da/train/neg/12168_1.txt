This movie was bad from the start. The only purpose of the movie was that Angela wanted to get a high body count. The action was horrible. The murders were done very badly. As when Ally was filled in the toilet, I suppose it was in the abandoned cabin. But when the end of the movie comes and Molly and the other guy are in the cabin, you see Ally, so Angela must have come in to get her. The part that really got me was when the black girl and Angela were in the cabin, and Angela took the guitar string and shocked her. One was horrible, and two why wouldn't you just turn around and beat the bitch?!?!? So when Molly gets chased by Angela, if you have the neighbor, why not just turn around and stab her ??? So stupid. This movie sucked ...
