Good to answer a person's question about "why can't you remember this movie?" It's because really, not so many people saw it in 1978, and that's not been shown much on the television side. (If it is on video that would be news for me!) Even in the era of sometimes thoughtless comedies that were in the 70s, movie guests had smarts to avoid this movie. Unless they love Billy Crytal, Paul Lynde or Joan Rivers "that much"! <br /> <br /> Paul Lynde was more fun on "Bewitched" or "Hollywood Squares" than here. Joan Rivers at this point in his career was laughing making cruel jokes about singer Karen Carpenter's lack of weight! Have Joan Have! It also seems that every "famous" name from the era is in the cast. (Most surprisingly, Doris Roberts is later of "Everybody Loves Raymond.") <br /> <br /> Any good idea for a story becomes a man who gets pregnant instead of the woman wasted here. With the help of a friend, Crystal turns up with a hooker to finally lose her virginity, but because she was "on top" instead of him, he becomes pregnant! (A comment about women taking positions of power away from men). The crystal's stomach grows, he goes through all the female feelings and related emotions. Unfortunately, he is now a socially misguided excuse! He is attacked by a mob who wants him rubbed out (I guess). He is forced to go into seclusion to get his baby ... in a stable. Or if you want, a manger (God only knows where it may have left! Ewwww!) It turns out (not shock here) to be a girl! Everything else about this movie is worthless and forgettable, humor is high school or less. <br /> <br /> 2 stars for a good idea and a couple of touching and relevant moments w / Billy Crystal. Ignore the rest of the Rabitt test, it tastes great time! <br /> <br /> I can't believe Roddy McDowell signed on either! (END)
