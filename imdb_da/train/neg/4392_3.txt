A young scientist is trying to continue his dead father's work on limb regeneration. His indulgent mother has convinced him that he has murdered his own father and monitors his progress for his own evil purposes. A young doctor uses the reptilian DNA, which he extracts from a great being, and when his arm is conveniently skinned a few minutes later, he injects himself with his formula and grows a new murderous arm ... Admittedly, the special effects in "Severed Ties" pretty good and grotesque, but the rest of the movie is horrible. The cut arm behaves like a snake and kills few people. The big deal. The action is mediocre, and the climax is stupid.3 out of 10.
