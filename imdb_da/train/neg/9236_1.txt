I'm among millions who consider themselves Cary Grant fans, but I can't think of a single reason to recommend this movie. I do not understand the thrown of Betsy Drake and it seems that no one else did it if we were to judge from the small number of movies she played afterwards. Most fans will agree that Katharine Hepburn was great at hunting and catching Cary Grant in Bringing Up Baby.Here the director or authors are trying to rehash that idea but it doesn't fail. I've read the comments on how "creepy" Drake was, but I thought it was too mild a description. Franchot Tone went through this one as if he were hungover. A casting disaster is one thing. This movie is a total disaster. <br /> <br /> This doesn't deserve 10 lines of comments and I don't know why it's a requirement. Too bad was this preserved when so many worthy films lie rotting in vaulting. <br /> <br /> Unless you want to torture someone, give it a wide berth.
