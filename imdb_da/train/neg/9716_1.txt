This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I have ever seen ... The plot is so full of holes, the story is like a bad remake of a bad movie and the actors sound like reading directly from the manuscript for the first time. Worst of all is Steve Guttenberg. He plays his character as if he were in the "Police Academy" - the same stupid womanizer - and it doesn't fit a leading man in what should have been a thriller. It's really hard to believe that Hanson would make "LA Confidential" ten years later ... <br /> <br /> Avoid this as the plague ...
