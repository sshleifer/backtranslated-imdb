If there were any oddly reversed Oscar Academy Awards Festival, this flick would win it all. It has all the gods, excellent plot, extreme special effects combined with extremely good acting skills and of course there is in each role a celebrity superstar. Well, that could be the scenario if the world were reversed, but it is not. Instead, it's the worst horror flick ever made, not just bad actors who seem to read scripts from a teleprinter with bad dyslexia, but also extremely low on special effects. For example, the devil's costume (which, by the way, is a must-see), is one of the most fun things I've ever seen. Every time I saw the red-black so-called monster on the screen, I couldn't keep my laughter back. And besides, it looked as if the funny creature was being transported by a conveyor belt. <br /> <br /> Don't make the same mistake as I did. Controlling IMDB when the movie was released in 2003, had less than five votes and thought: "It's worth a shot, it can't be that bad." <br /> <br /> Yes it could. /> <br /> I'm not even going to waste more words on this movie.
