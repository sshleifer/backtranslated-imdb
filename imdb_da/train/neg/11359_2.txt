While the 3-D animation (the highlight of the show) did well, most other elements fell flat. It was as if the filmmakers thought "Well, it's 3-D, so we don't have to work so hard on the plot or character development." And the fact that it is a children's film is absolutely no excuse. The audience is attracted to three-dimensional characters (Shrek, Nemo's father) as much as they are drawn for three-dimensional graphics. The only dimension that any of the protagonists showed was two-dimensional scooters that twist the plot from time to time with its compulsion to eat everything in sight. <br /> <br /> And the absolute kicker? Buzz Aldrin's appearance at the end (after seeing a very robot cartoon version of the same historical figure for an hour and a half) comes on the screen and destroys everyone's good time by calling the film's protagonists "pollutants" and informing that the situation is emerging the screen was in fact impossible. <br /> <br /> ??? !!! ??? Do you just want to tell the children that the Easter bunny and Santa Claus do not exist while you are on it?
