I have to admit that I've caught this a couple of times on the US network. There's just something about the girl's stupid stupidity that makes me see it when it's on. Yeah, you're right about the couple, the plot that only a seven year old liked, etc. But I can't help feeling sympathetic to some of the actors. Then again, a couple of these actors signed up for the even more horrible sequel.
