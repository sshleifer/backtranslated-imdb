This movie was the worst movie I've seen since "Date Movie." I laughed through the whole movie instead of being scared. It was fun how the snakes searched for a particular part of the passenger body to attack, for example, the eye, tongue, back, chest. If we have seen the national geographic channel, we know that snakes are not dressed on the body when they bite. For each particular scene, the snakes will bite the passengers and remain on the body that bites the person. I think the manufacturer did not study his snake information and their behavior. I can't believe I wasted my money on this movie. So I do not recommend this movie trust just wait until it's on dollar theater or rent it.
