"Laughter is a state of mind," said the brand, and I hesitate to comment on Barry Levinson's. What could he have thought during the production of "Toys"? When he looked at the Russians, did he see a successful, fun fantasy? If so, he works on a different plan from me. This is a scary picture where the production design is 90% of the thing (and even the cartoon colors are a disappointment). Robin Williams and (especially) Joan Cusack are humiliated as the brother and sister of a toy mug that bypasses the factory heirs when their father dies. There is nothing extremely funny (satirical or slapstick-wise) on the screen here. It is uniformly sad, ugly and one of the worst "big" movies ever made. No stars from ****
