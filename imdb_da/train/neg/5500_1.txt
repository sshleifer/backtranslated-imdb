This movie is trying hard but lacking in fun in the 1960s TV shows that I'm sure people remember with love. Although I am 17, I saw some of the series on YouTube a long time ago and it was fun and fun. Unfortunately, this movie has a little justice in the series. <br /> <br /> The special effects are quite substandard and it was not helped by the flat camera work. The script was also boring and lacked any sense of entertainment and humor. Other under-script movies are Home Alone 4, Cat in the Hat, Thomas and Magic Railroad and Addams Family Reunion. <br /> <br /> Now let me say I liked the idea of ​​the story, but unfortunately it was poorly executed and ran out of steam prematurely and I'm honestly not sure because of this, it's something for family to enjoy. And I was annoyed by the talking suit, despite the spiritual voice of Wayne Knight's work. <br /> <br /> But what made me most concerned about this movie was that it wasted the talents Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah, all very talented actors. Jeff Daniels has made some good performances before, but he didn't seem to have a clue what to do and unfortunately Elizabeth Hurley's character had come over. Daryl Hannah is a lovely actress and is generally ignored and I liked the idea that she was the love interest, but unfortunately you see very little of her (not to mention that the Monster attack is likely to scare children than to disturb them) also with Wallace Shawn as a kind of government operational. Christopher Lloyd tells himself better, and as an actor I like Lloyd very much (he was in two of my favorite films Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and I love Back To The Future), but he got a little to work with and had a tendency to exaggerate quite wildly. <br /> <br /> All in all, as much as I like this movie, I was not impressed. Instead of being fun, it came across as pointless, and it is a shame because it had a lot of potential, with some talented actors and a good idea, but wasted with poor performance. 1/10 Bethany Cox
