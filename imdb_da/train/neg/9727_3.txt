Another of mine kills in Copenhagen, this movie gave me exactly what I expected - a lot of fragile scarecrows complete with screaming ladies. It all started so well - I liked the little intro with the "newsletter" about the young couple who were exposed to a nuclear weapon and were completely absorbed until the first person was fired ... From then on, the film went down to clean sadness and at times was almost embarrassing to see. When the heroine proved to have been hit by the same condition as the main character (the ability to ease his own farts without the help of a fight), it almost seemed as if someone had cast the idea at the last minute ("that" it is good! almost hear them say ...) As for the almost mental connection between the protagonist and the nuclear power plant, well ... <br /> <br /> The movie came over as cheap tat - if you pay more than Â£ 1.50 for it You've been done.
