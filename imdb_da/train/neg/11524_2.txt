Pretty incoherent film about a man who belonged to and left a superficial hippie-religious cult fighting them sixteen years later. The man has a child with one of the other cultures who, during a raid by the police, is hidden away and taken by another man named Hawk, who lives in a small cabin by the river. The cult kills some of its followers or some of the people of the city. It is difficult to keep track of which characters are or what time period the scenes should take. The leader is parole sixteen years later (I got it from the box - I missed the time of the movie). No one is made to see any older, not eye-catching, anyway. <br /> <br /> A murder is made with a large circular log saw, others are made with knives or a bracelet. I have never heard the title of the character's name mentioned in the movie, but he is the one who overcomes the most, hooting and hollering. <br /> <br /> The movie is patched together pretty badly, with voiceover helping (not much) explaining what's going on. Some of the sound effects were pretty bad. A man is stopped and we hear the sound of a blast. A woman fires a gun and we don't hear it but hear a ricochet instead! It doesn't seem to have been done for comic effect.
