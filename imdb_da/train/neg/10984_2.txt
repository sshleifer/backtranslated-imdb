I watched this movie for two hours and have absolutely no idea what it's all about. Someone was murdered, or maybe they didn't, and maybe someone did it or maybe they didn't. This brought to mind the good old days (bad old days?) When all CBC Canadian movies were stinkers. Most recently, stinkers have been the exception, but this confused hodge podge of trendy feminism, mind reeling flash backs and mumbled dialogue poses for lost time. I have never found Margaret Atwood's books easy to read. This film continues the fine Canadian tradition. It's not easy to see. Maybe the trendy people at the chi chi Toronto cocktail parties pretend they liked it. Our people in boonies are a little less pretentious.
