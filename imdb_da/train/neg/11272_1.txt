... the first movie I had to go on. And it was the cast-and-crew pre-screening (not that I was involved, I rushed to add). I did it through the first hour, so I expect I'm just qualified to comment, but that was my limit. <br /> <br /> Like other comments here, how did it come through any kind of QA. An accumulation of the very best in dialogue, the epitome of wood-acting, horrible casting, all gathered without plot. Tara Fitzgerald's casting was bizarre, almost cartoon. She has the worst Russian accent in film history. <br /> <br /> When I left the screening, the director and producers drank in a bar outside the cinema. Of course, they couldn't sit through it either. <br /> <br />
