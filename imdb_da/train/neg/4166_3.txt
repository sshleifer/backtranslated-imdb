Complete waste of time .... This movie is not comedy, it's not drama, it's not romance ... not even teenage comedy at least !!! History ... it has to be a bit of an end ... but it is so disappointing! When the movie has a turn-over at the end, I expect to turn-over to make the movie even better (eg "Fight Club"), but this transition makes movies even worse .... When I see teenage comedy and I don I do that very often, I expect miserable jokes and lots of nudity ... Witnesses are too miserable and there is no nudity ... You only have one .... very nice I have to admit ... girl and it is it! And she's fully dressed all over the movie! Acting is bad ... like soap series ... Don't waste your time! There are porn with better story and play! <br /> <br /> (sorry for my bad English)
