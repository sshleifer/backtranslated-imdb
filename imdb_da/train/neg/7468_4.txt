Probably the only thing that made the movie up to four for me is that I love Peter Falk. One of the world's great decorations of bumbling incompetence. . . and yet he is one of the only anchors that prevents it from being a chaotic disaster. As Pops Romano, he gives a respectable mix of gangster charm and straight man to Chris Kattan's manic stupidity. Respective achievements are also offered by Richard Roundtree as the head boss, Vinessa Shaw as a talented female FBI agent who jumps her head from a glass ceiling and Fred Ward as Falk's advisor and Benedict Arnold. <br /> <br /> The reason is actually has some great options and in the hands of a young Steve Martin or Chevy Chase could have turned out to be a good comic vehicle. The cat, which seems to idolize Ernest or Pee Wee Herman, just gives a confused mess. Unfortunately, Peter Berg and Chris Penn, who portray their misfit brothers, are both far from their proven ability. <br /> <br /> There are some very fun scenes, but they are far too few and far too many boring ones. What I really miss here is what always attracted me to the Leslie Neilsen movies. There is no other level of riding over the slip. No cultural references that only the adults get. . no double entender. . It's just stupid. <br /> <br /> And that doesn't mean I recommend it to your 9-year-old, hopefully they have better taste and less fascination with some of their body parts and their functions.
