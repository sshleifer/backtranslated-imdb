What I hate about this show is how badly the leaders are written. These women have no self-respect or dignity. The whole plot is to throw at guys. Amanda Bynes talent is completely wasted. She was brilliant on "All That" and her own show. Why should they write her and Jenny Garth as vapid, airhead, desperate men, chasing, "old-maid" wannabes is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Your plot and dialogue reminds me of "The Simpons", Homer says when his cartoon character Poochie is not on the screen, "Everyone should ask where is Poochie?". Everyone talks about looking at a guy and then looking at a guy. Sometimes they change it and the guy whines instead. Then they come together again or break up at the end. The 2 women are either superficial, stupid or sexually abusive. The only word I can think of is "sucking".
