This was by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. It was slow, boring, not scary, not fun, not dramatic, not entertaining. <br /> <br /> Sarah Michelle Gellar was up to her old playbook of empty expressions of fear and shock. She couldn't sell her character or anyone else in the picture. <br /> <br /> For those who thought Grudge was "okay", don't go see this unless you enjoy wasting your time and life. <br /> <br /> By the way, I saw this movie for free, so I don't want this to come across as a rant from a guy who lost 8 bucks on a horrible movie. It was free, it still sucked, I hated it. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
