I saw the original "Chorus Line" on Broadway God know how many times and felt the passion, despair and joy come from this live experience in the theater. Michael Bennett knew he was going to restore "Chorus" to the screen, but could never figure out how to do it. If the man who came up with the show is stumped - it should answer your question. There are some shows that are simply made to be seen live - with an audience. But Richard Attenborough freshened by the musical work of "Ghandi" and dancing with animals in "Doctor Doolittle" ended up controlling this movie, which bore little or nothing like the scene scene. Terrible songs were added (Surprise! Surprise!), Good songs were dropped or given to other characters (which didn't make sense). Michael Douglas was misguided. People who couldn't dance tried to act, and there was the sexy "Landers" woman who couldn't sing, act or dance - I suggested she just finished being Ghandi's wife. The dance of Jeffrey Hornaday looks no more than schlock from "Flashdance" rejects and nothing works. I sat there stunned by how something so nonsense and emotionally could be drained to nothing. If you really love this show and it comes back to Broadway in 2006 - watch it, but don't think that the long-running musical event that was "A Chorus Line" has something to do with this movie.
