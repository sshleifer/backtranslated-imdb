I watched this movie about 5 years ago, and remind me it's still hanging on to this day. I was fully aware of how terrible it was to go into it, so I only have to blame myself. But like most, I did not believe the whole negativity. Being a Sandler fan just seemed unthinkable that one of his movies could really be that bad. I figured it was just Sandler haters. I couldn't have been more wrong. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a comedy that doesn't contain another 1 second of fun. In fact, it is quite a performance. You would think in a 90 minute comedy, they could accidentally stumble upon something even remotely entertaining. But no, it's just awful. It's not that bad, it's good, it's just bad. You can't laugh how bad it is, you can only cry. You wait patiently for a joke, which at least makes you feel like hell, but they never come. <br /> <br /> Have you seen the movie The Ring? Where do people watch a video tape and die 7 days later? If this movie were on the videotape, people would die on their own and there would be smiles on their face as they realized their pain had ceased and that would be the first smile when they pressed the game. <Br /> <br /> You may tend to see it just to see how bad it is, not being able to slow down your curiosity. Do not do. You do not. Believe me, I'm doing you a favor. There are 2 types of people in the world, those who seem to go overboard are the worst movie ever made and those who have not yet seen it.
