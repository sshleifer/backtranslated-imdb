What do you get when you mix a clump of clichés with a pointless pacing and a group of characters that you don't care about and a failed attempt to create an appealing visual style and an even bigger clump of clichés and a faint sense of humor and a really big budget? Why do you get one of the most intolerable, unattainable movies ever made! Of course I refer to Domino. <br /> <br /> Here are some things people can say while viewing this movie: "Ooh, wow, the story is told out of order, it's not done a billion times before, and much more skillfully than in this movie. "<br />" Wow, look at all the flashing lights and grainy film texture and elaborate on Transfers! The director is trying so hard to make things look artificial and create visual style! that none of these effects adds anything to the movie or makes sense to the scenes they are in, and it is also too bad that most of them come across as annoying! "<br /> <br />" I have heard this exchange of dialogue in about twenty thousand movies before! "" I've seen this scene in about thirty thousand movies before! "<br /> <br />" This too! "" Uh, they did not reveal this "plot twist "half an hour ago? Was It Should be Surprising?" <br /> <br /> "If this movie is to be showing a" hard chicken "around kicking ass ... when does she not do so much? "<br /> <br />" I can't believe how wrong this dialogue is. "<br /> <br />" How long is this thing? I want to have seen it for over four hours already. "<br /> <br />" I have no idea what just happened, but also, I don't feel very motivated to try to figure it out. "<br /> <br />" Is this still here? "<br /> <br />" I want my money back. "<br /> <br />" The songs in this soundtrack feel so abused here. "<br /> <br />" It is ironic that all the curses they use detract from the impact of each one. "<br /> <br />" UGH. "<br /> <br /> Finally," I may have to end my friendship with the person who recommended this movie to me. "<br /> <br /> In summary, this movie is a mistake in almost everybody If you are on fire and this movie plays in the only room that is not combustible, you should seriously consider being burned alive instead. <br /> <br /> (If I sound bitter, it's because I just spent over two hours watching this movie and I haven't had much.)
