Everyone just seems to rave on the subject and not really notice how the film was made. The deaf, stupid guy is fine, underdog wins - that's good, the cricket aspect is great, but the movie is average overall. I think it could be done much better than it is. The plot is too predictable for a movie that is not based on a reality event. I'm sure the movie could have been more interesting. The songs are just filled in there, and I had to literally transmit the scenes where the same would be shown from different angles. <br /> <br /> Good acting. Watchable.
