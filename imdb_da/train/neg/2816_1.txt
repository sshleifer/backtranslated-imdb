This is one of the movies you see in the video store that you just need because it just looks so bad. And we couldn't actually make the most of it. There was plenty of quick forwarding. <br /> <br /> But then we came across a scene where Robert Englund seduces the female protagonist (her name strikes my heart at this time). Cripes. I have never seen a single scene from a movie so many times (I estimate forty or so). And I have never laughed so hard in my life. You see, Englund has this thing to show his loins. I last watched the movie a few months ago, but I can't stop laughing while I write. Anyway, the scene is a montage of shots - Englund tear off girls underwear, Englund rides a horse naked, and a mysterious woman strikes a snake's head. This is absolute genius. You have to see it for yourself.
