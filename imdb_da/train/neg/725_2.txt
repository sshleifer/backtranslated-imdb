This was a horrible movie! Not for the subject but for delivery. I went with my boyfriend at the time (when the movie came out) and waited to watch a movie about the human spirit's triumph of oppression. What we saw was 2 hours of brutal police repression, with no end to end. The previews and ads have not mentioned this! Plus, for all that they played up whoopi goldberg, my recollection is that she is being arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again the researchers say nothing about this! (not that you would expect it, but that's just more of the problem). If I had known how depressing this movie would be, I would never have seen it. Or at least I would have been prepared for it. This was a bait and change ad campaign and I will never see this movie again!
