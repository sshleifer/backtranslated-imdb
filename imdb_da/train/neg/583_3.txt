I bought this custom because I really liked Anne BrontÃ«'s novel when I read it some time ago and usually enjoy BBC dramas. But I'm very disappointed, I never thought it would be as bad as that: the whole series made me laugh much more than moved me, as the novel had. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, the music (and songs) were out of place for a period of drama (sounds like it was written for a modern scary movie) and as another commentator, I was particularly annoyed by the way the cameras spun and spun around the actors. I have seen some scenes filmed that way in "North and South" and it seemed right, but in The Tenant it is clearly exaggerated and simply annoying. Camera movements can not make wood that seems lively. <br /> <br /> Most of the other roles were difficult to distinguish first and the script lacked clarity. None of the characters were properly introduced first. The little boy gave a very good performance, he is very sweet and the best feature of the film. SPOILERS Tara Fitzgerald's characterization of Helen Graham made her look cold and hard so no emotion passes through. She does not seem to be able to cry at all in a realistic way. I just couldn't believe Markham could have fallen for her, and I didn't mention the horrible hairdresser she was given. I couldn't help feeling any sympathy for her husband! Fancy being married to such a virago ... Besides, he was the only lead actor who sounded right to me. Toby Stephens I just found OK, Helen Graham's brother not very good. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is difficult to adapt a novel that deals with such bleak topics as alcoholism and cruelty. Furthermore, what is only suggested and left to the readers' imagination in the book followed with complaint in the television adaptation: making some scenes both brutal and comical (like when Huntingdon's eyes begin to bleed) and others too sexy for a period of time drama! I mean, don't we get enough of these bed scenes in contemporary dramas?
