What a horrible movie! The idea for robots that fight each other is cool, but the story is ridiculous, real human action ridiculous, acting non-existent and special effects (which this type of movie depends on) are archaic. I thought it should have been done around '80'84 and was amazed to see it was from 1990. It's 5 years after foreigners! Okay, many people said it was good considering the low budget, but I just think 'what's the point?' It looks amazing. I didn't mind seeing a remake of modern special effects and a brand new story because I still like the idea of ​​big robots beating crap apart.
