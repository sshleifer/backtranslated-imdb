Saw this movie recently and had higher hopes. Not so much based on the director who hadn't made a movie release before, but more based on its cast. Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (starring in Body Double, a Brian De Palma masterpiece) have all starred in amazing movies. Not together though, and this fact has not just changed because of this. <br /> <br /> The movie is incredible, very predictable and clich√©. The only thing that can make it a little appealing is the choice of places where it is shot. In my humble opinion: Don't waste your time on this.
