Unremarkable and unmemorable remake of an old, celebrated English movie. Although it may be too malignant as a total disaster (as it is not), it never builds up tension and confuses its television origins. Richard Burton sleeps through his role, and Sophia Loren is closed (in this movie) nor does the face give much passion. (**)
