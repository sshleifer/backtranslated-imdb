I had just seen an episode of this program and I couldn't even get to the end of the program. Every minute I had seen this program my I.Q of the fall of about 10 points. This is basically a children's program but with in-laws. Not even those swearing and the insults she tells other people made me laugh. Nevertheless, the story must be written by a monkey, and the people who actually put this script for this program for filming must have been held at gunpoint and had no choice but to film this retarded, disappointing, horribly acted program. Sarah Silvermann is going to spend the little money she actually made from this program and get some scary actions.
