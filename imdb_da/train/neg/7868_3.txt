I've seen many Guy Maddins movies and liked most of them, but this literally gave me headaches. John Gurdebeke's editing is far too frenetic, and apart from a turn-force sequence showing a main line that snaps together to look at an object, it merely blends the players' ability to communicate with the audience. <br /> <br /> Another thing I did not like about this movie was that it seemed more brutal than Maddin's earlier works - even though his films have always had dark elements, his sympathy for the characters gave the films an extraordinary sense of humanity . This happened more like hardness for hardness. When I add more lines of text before IMDb will accept my review, I would mention that the actor playing "Guy Maddin" manages to appeal his facial expression pretty well.
