Dave (Devon Sawa) and his friends Sam (Jason Segel) and Jeff (Michael Maronna) have scammed their way through college. When cruel Ethan (Jason Schwartzman) discovers their secret, he chants them to help him score with the beautiful, kind-hearted student Angela (James King). <br /> <br /> Stupid and incompetent "comedy" - much more moody-inducing than grin-inducing. Movie tries to appeal to its target audience with its obnoxious gags - but none of them work. In addition, it is full of worthless, unpleasant characters - and Schwartzman's character is so repulsive that he is a great turn-off. Film even tries to use the 50s / 60s sex pot / actress Mamie Van Doren in the film's most outrageous scene. YUCK !!! Further to bring it down, its complete predictability and wastage (once again) by veteran comedian actor Joe Flaherty's talent - when will that guy stop accepting any role that comes together and do something The only thing I liked was James ( aka Jaime) King, who was very appealing - and deserved it better. <br /> <br /> It won't be more than one in ten from me.
