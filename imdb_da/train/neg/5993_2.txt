I grew up (b. 1965) and watched and loved Thunderbirds. All my colleagues in the school looked at. We played "Thunderbirds" before school, lunch and after school. We all wanted to be Virgil or Scott. No one wanted to be Alan. Counting down from 5 became an art form. I took my children to watch the movie hoping they would catch a glimpse of what I loved as a child. How bitterly disappointing. The only highlight was the narrow theme. Not that it could be compared to Thunderbird's original score. Fortunately, early Saturday morning, a television channel still plays reruns of the series Gerry Anderson and his wife set up. Jonatha Frakes was to give his board chair, his version was completely hopeless. A waste of movies. Full nonsense. A CGI remake may be acceptable but replacement of puppets with Homo sapiens subsp. sapiens were a big mistake.
