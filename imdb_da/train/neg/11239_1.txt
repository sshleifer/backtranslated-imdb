Pay attention to the comments behind the curtain! Most people who leave positive comments about this movie should receive royalties. This is a horrible movie in every way. Imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slasher / comedy video. They would receive a D for this. College kids would receive an F or asked to leave school. Since this monstrosity was made by "Professionals" I think there should be a prison or at least a cinema test. I enjoy watching bad movies like "Plan 9 from outer space", but this thing doesn't even fall into that category. The script, acting, sound and control are so bad that it's almost unmatched. If you enjoy watching bad movies that are fun, join Ed Wood, the blaxploitation or 1970's horror movie. After seeing this you get the feeling that you have wasted an hour and a half of your life.
