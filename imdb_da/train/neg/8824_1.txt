What might say about this movie except, "watches beware". Christmas evil would come with a warning label that cigarettes do because this was harmful to my eyes and ears. I'm rarely this dissatisfied with a "b" horror flick, but this movie couldn't even bring a little scare to a five year old. The point of a relentless lunatic who has a thirst for blood in a movie is that he / she should seem almost godlike, just as nothing can stop their maniacal rage, but in this movie the resident psychopath gets stuck in a chimney in a bizarre attempts to surprise his next victim and of course follow it all to the popular santa claus legend, it is a reminder to the viewer that this man is in no way dangerous because he is too stupid to be dangerous. All in all, a total waste of movies.
