This movie is really nothing beyond a successful series of tense sequences that are marked by an inevitable "gotcha!" at the end of each. Really there is no sign development and no real plot to talk about. There are only most skeletons of motivation for the characters to do something as they advance to their inevitable doomsday. It's just an excuse to show an eerie ghost child (who seems to have got some of the family cat mixed in his ectoplasm) and his ghost mother (with long black hair hanging in her face like "The Ring") takes down a bunch of cardboard cutouts, two-dimensional excuses for human figures. This English-language version of "The Grudge" corresponds to cinematic junk food; satisfactory immediately, but not really what you should stay at. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
