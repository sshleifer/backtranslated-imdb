Side by side (This is not a review of good intentions, it's about the final product), this movie is poorly written, exaggerated and poorly directed. Of course, history had potential, but that story is not present in this movie. <br /> <br /> Clara Barton was a human. She had passions, desires, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness and self-confidence, just like the rest of us. You would never know from this movie of the leading actress performance. In fact, it applies to any character in the movie, but in Barton's case: Every sentence is a speech. An epic of the top number as if from an inhuman robot. In fact, the only scene that plays well in one at the board meeting and I realized it because she speaks! Every idea she has is incredible in her context, and she comes up with ideas that sound like they are killing the soul who is looking for the place. For example, when she sees a wounded man, she begins to patronize the needs of the battlefield and to protect the soldiers and lay white flags, etc. As played in the movie, there is no way she could come up with such detailed thoughtful seconds of seconds. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie reveals Clara Barton of his battles. It deprives her of her humanity, and it cheaply cheaper everything she did because the manuscript is written in clichés. The author does not know Clara Barton and seems to have based his script on an encyclopedia Britannica article. (yes they had them then) But hey, nice Technicolor! (So ​​what)
