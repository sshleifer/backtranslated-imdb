If you haven't seen this yet, I just say go ahead, take a walk in the park, don't waste your time. Neither the scenario nor the action is worth your money. * Spoilers * - I can't decide what was worse: the movie itself or Baldwin's hairstyle? Ellen Pompeo's actresses are very dubious, I hope she can improve it over time. The story is just incredible. Loose cannon American policeman is fighting criminals in Europe alone? Notorious Slavic mafiosi protected by only two hunks ??? An emotional art teacher who leads a ruthless gang ??? Spanish police officers judge a bag of hammers ??? Give me a break. There is only one good thing about this movie, though: At least, the production cost must be lower than "Ocean's 12", which was so pointless and over the top like this.
