The DVD was a joke, the sound in the first few minutes was horrible with sound without synchronization and Segal's voice didn't even his !!!! Pathetic! When sound synchronization was better for about 5 minutes, the bad plot, lines and actors needed a new job because the movie company is not where any of them should be. <br /> <br /> While Segal had some good movies in early days, they are a joke and should be an embarrassment to him and the company that did it. <br /> <br /> If Segal was the one who handled this, he turned back better to have another party run the show because he has no talent whats ever in this. <br /> <br /> This movie is a complete embarrassment to everyone involved in its production and a disgrace to anyone who saw it. I knocked it off for about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> I'll ask for my money back at Block Buster! Mark from Ontario, Canada
