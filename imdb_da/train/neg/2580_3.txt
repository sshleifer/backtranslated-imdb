Well it's his official. they just killed American cake. The first 3 were completely hysterical, but the one and the other were terrible. I think the story is about two college brotherhoods, fighting each other for their houses, I mean talking about a weak plot, the first three dealing with upbringing, change and marriage, which are all worthy points of development in human society. <br /> <br /> The new Stifler is the biggest joke, I know it's hard to try to compare you to Steven Stifler, but then no cigar. I give this movie a 3 because there are 2-3 funny pieces in the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the best character in this movie is Jim's father, I don't know why he continues to make these poorly-developed movies.
