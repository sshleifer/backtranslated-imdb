This is an embarrassment to everyone and everything used to make this joke. I don't care about one way or another about Jessica Simpson and her talent, or whatever so many people find fascinating about her. Like a movie, it is something that would not even get a passed grade in the film school. The scripture is a mess, the play is terrible, and the fact that Luke Wilson (co-author of "Bottle Rocket") made it questionable what the hell he was thinking. He did "Old School" to cry aloud! This is not even in the same state as my "Old School" DVD! Please whatever you do not see here! I see that there is a comment that this is so bad, it is good, but it is honest that it is too friendly. When will we stop seeing singers who obviously cannot act, continue to try, I hope ends soon. The worst part is that there are actually some decent players (Penelope Ann Miller, Rachel Leigh Cook, and Luke Wilson) who are part of this dump. As far as the plot is good, it's almost non-existent and so poorly done and written (yes I know it's another rehash). I very much doubt that anyone will remember anything about this. Whatever you do, don't waste your time, but if you do, excuse the actors involved to waste their time making that bomb. Jessica Simpson you are beautiful, but keep singing, even if I'm not a fan of it. And who made this movie, I wouldn't put this on your resume. 1/10 because you can't give a zero.
