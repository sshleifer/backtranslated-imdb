Rural Drama - with perhaps a key to "Ordinary People" - relates to a young boy who retires after fatal wounding of his older brother in a lap injuries. In spite of inappropriate topic (with ruthless slumber treatment by director Christopher Cain), there is some dynamism in this sad story that is worth exploring. Unfortunately, the isolated agricultural atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take responsibility for the situation, the film is a stultifying experience. What about Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley in the movie, is the movie almost a scaled reunion of "The Natural". Too bad this project did not get the necessary talent behind the camera to really echo a gripping, memorable image. * 1/2 from ****
