I usually like comedy movies. I really enjoy them. But I really don't understand "Envy". I think it has a boring content / topic and it's not really fun. <br /> <br /> Although the play is generally good, it is not enough for the film to get at least a little interesting. Stiller and Black do not show all their talent in this movie. <br /> <br /> So if you are going to rent a comedy, I suggest you definitely not go after this. Unless you want to be bored and I can see that I am not the only one with this opinion, even Jack Jack apologized for it (see a look at Trivia).
