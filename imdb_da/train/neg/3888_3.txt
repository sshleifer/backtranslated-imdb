I have started to melt so I will make this review as short and sweet as possible. <br /> <br /> There is this astronaut and he goes up into a spacecraft with two other guys, you know? Unless something happens to expose him to radiation, and then when they come back ... well, don't remember what happened to the other guys, but our astronaut has begun to melt! No, not just burn up, but GOOD! Like an ice cream cone in July! Well ok, maybe not so fast, but you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> In any case, he gets it all red and gooey, and the fact that he is melting makes him really angry. He also assumes that he has also checked the manual for a melting pot because he suddenly knows that in order to stay completely melting away, he must eat human floods so he begins to tear people apart. <br /> <br /> There are other signs, but in a movie where a man melts and melts and melts (and melts), do you really need others? What is important is who will he munch next and what will be left of them? How long does it take for him to just melt away for nothing? Why was this movie made in the first place? Where Did It Get Money When Will You Sleep As You See It? <br /> <br /> I have almost melted, but I still have enough time to tell you that this movie is terribly boring, even though the idea is really cool and kind of gross. The makeup is nice, but everything else is ... SPLAT
