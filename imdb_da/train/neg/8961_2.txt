This movie was another waste of time ... Why oh, why do I continue to rent shit like this? ... someone tell me it ... * sigh * oh yeah. back to the movie at your fingertips: Cube Zero is probably worth it if you really really enjoyed the first movie (as I did) and just want to check out what happened in the last (hopefully) movie scraped together just to keep some poor actors and writers employed, then of course it is the movie for you. But if you are looking for a good movie with good acting and a great plot ... * evil laugh * then this movie is for you :-D .... OK, I lie ... At best this is movie naughty. OK, I have to admit that some items for it were cool .. yes ... cool ... and I laughed a lot of times, prolly on the wrong things, but still I was amused. :-) But all in all the few things that hardly make the category "ok" are not enough to make this movie worth it. Unless you count "Manos - Hand of Fate" one of the top ten movies ever!
