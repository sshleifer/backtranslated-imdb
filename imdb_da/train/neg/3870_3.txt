During the dense green glow of computer graphics, the amazing art and skill of Ichikawa Somegoro shone. Alas: It was lost in all goo. The scenes of Old Edo - with the courtesy, driving on Sumida, repeating and performing in Nakamura-za - were all exciting and engaging and took you back to an interesting and rich era. The action on the Kabuki scene, where Somegoro excels and spans, was more enriching than any of the absurdly high jinks that followed. The skill, the energy of the audience, the colors of the set were far more satisfying than all the nonsense that took over plot and performance. What a waste of opportunity! One of the best kabuki actors alive, and he is lost in killing.
