How did Mike Hammer live - in a penthouse with a GOLF BAG stashed in the corner next to a large screen cathode ray TV and a snazzy fireplace? Nah, he would knock a bottle of rye and twenty unfiltered camels on the couch or floor of his floating office or in the stink of a miserable downtown LA flophus, wipe the dried red crust and oil greased mud out of his face, so. The bets safely wrote trash, but how do you make it worse? Give some desperate scheming producers a blank check because he thinks a movie noir titled crap will sell at the box office, add some hot-tomatoes over the tray and just generally turn up the story with some retard, screen saver, like that!
