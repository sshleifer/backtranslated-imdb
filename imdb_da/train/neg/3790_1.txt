I don't really post comments, but wanted to be sure to warn people from this movie. It is an unfinished student movie with no redeeming features. On a technical level it is quite amateur - constantly unintentional jumping edits within scenes, copying game away, etc. The reason is completely clichÃ©d, the structure is ridiculous, and the play is embarrassing. I won't be too hard: I've made my share of student films, and they were all horrible, but there's no reason this movie is out in the world where innocent fans have to watch it. /> <br /> Safe assertion that - like the cast-positive comments are filmmakers, friends and family.
