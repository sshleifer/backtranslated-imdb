Ashley Judd, in an early role, and I think she's the first lead, shows her real life's rebellious nature in this slow feminist soap opera. Wow, is this a means of political correctness and extreme liberalism or what? <br /> <br /> Being a stable feminist in real life, she must have loved this script. No wonder, left-wing critic Roger Ebert loved this movie; It is just up to his political alley. <br /> <br /> Unlike the reviewers here, I am glad that Judd rose from this moronic fluff to better roles in entertaining movies, not preaching the heavy-handed liberal agenda.
