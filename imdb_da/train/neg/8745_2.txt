One of extremely unprofessional movies about computer programmers. <br /> <br /> Watching authors of that movie do not really know the program world. <br /> <br /> 20 top programmers in the world, programs with their own satellites (for what?), program using satellite frequency. Someone kills someone to steal the codes (why?) and much more stupid moments in this movie. People who are not programmers will not see anything terrible on that movie because not professionals on this. But people will not see real things. The programmers find the movie odd and awful - because many moments in film are not related to reality (why the movie doesn't scifi in this case?).
