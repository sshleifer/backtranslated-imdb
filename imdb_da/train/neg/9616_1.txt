First, I had my doubts, just looked at the DVD box and read it and said it was about a lot of teenagers gathering at a lake where they found something or something. Any movie that has a premise like this has failed, even as a slasher movie, except for the first Friday of the 13th. <br /> <br /> I wanted to get up and stop watching the movie at least 10 times, but I just thought it had to be a little better. It didn't. Normally, I think every movie has something you can take from it. This has nothing. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and find something constructive for 80 minutes. Like, give yourself trash or eat dirt.
