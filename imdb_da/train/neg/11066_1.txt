Prior to seeing "Dahmer" I thought no movie could be worse than "Freddy Got Fingered." I was mistaken. To summarize "Dahmer", it is a story of a gay serial killer who almost has no killing and almost exclusively consists of Dahmer's gay men's meetings before being killed. There is no reason to find it and it serves no purpose in telling us something about "Dahmer". All you want to learn about Dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked having sex with men. Terrible play, terrible management, horrible writing, terrible everything ... If you have to choose to watch "Dahmer" and projectile vomiting for three hours, go with the vomiting .... it will be less painful .....
