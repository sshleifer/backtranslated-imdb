I'm stupid that I actually sat looking at this. I love independent movies, horror movies and all zombie stuff in general. But when you add Ninga, you have crossed a line that should never be crossed. I hope that people in this movie had a really good time doing it, so it was at least not a total waste. You would never know by seeing it though. Script? Are you kidding. Acting? I even think the trees were fake. Photography? Well, there must be a camera there. Period. I don't think there was any real planning involved in the production of this movie. Such a total waste of time that I will not extend it by commenting further.
