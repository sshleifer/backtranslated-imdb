SPOILER ALERT In this generic and unforgettable action movie, Lorenzo Lamas makes his usual tough guy / beautiful boy act and his future real life ex Kathleen Kinmont is ass-kicking hot chick Alexa. OJ Simpson is a detective who bypasses on his side disappeared brilliant public persona. Translation: Cable TV Filler. There is not enough skin to qualify this as a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> The script has some gaping holes. Best / Worst Moment: In a stiffening scene, OJ's partner expresses his reluctance to the morning house. OJ says some of the organs are rather warm, or words with that effect. This vague nekrophilia reference is offensive enough; But in the face of the murders committed shortly after this film was released, it is truly horrible and therefore entertaining in an unintentional, horrible way. I was so scared that I laughed until champagne came out of my nose. Now it is a guilty pleasure. BC
