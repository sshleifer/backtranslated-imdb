I try sometimes ... you try to be charitable to all B to Z grade movies out there, but occasionally a particular movie just tests your patience until you want to beat everyone involved. "Bat People" (as I saw under the title "It Lives By Night") is just such a movie. You can't see this without believing it really should have been an "Night Gallery" episode, nor one of the better ones. <br /> <br /> The movie has something to do with a doctor bitten by a bat and consequently begins to morph into a Were-Bat drinking human blood. (In fact, you think if he turned into a real bat, he would eat mosquitoes at the gallon bucket, but because this is a cheap, lurid horror movie, the blood is the word.) Despite having great man attacks on a hat , and blackout episodes almost every night, his friend and doctor insist. Mustache Aspen-Extreme, he only has an "allergic reaction" to the rabies threats. Meanwhile, the world's most unpleasant and stereotypical amtscheriff doctor is suspected of being responsible for the brutal murder and extinction of several local girls (and a wino). Meanwhile, the medical wife decides that denial is a river in Egypt and alternately protects him and nods him to distraction. <br /> <br /> It's not so much that the play is bad - you can tell that the actors make professional level choices and try to bring some juice and life to the script, even the guy who plays the sheriff. (Okay, it's pretty bad, but it's bad in a cliché, wood, professional way). It's just about everything about the play, the way the scenes go, the costumes, the dialogue, the script, and the story line generally put your teeth on the edge and make it succeed, and let everyone involved. <br /> <br /> I think the movie had an outside chance of being a creepy, disturbing little cult favorite, MEN: <br /> <br /> 1) The director needed to beat Michael Pataki, an experienced character actor, with a chair until Pataki agreed to act, and not just channel Dennis Weaver. <br /> <br /> 2) He also needed to find a script that was a little more sensible with regard to the whole "Bat Bites Human, which then becomes a Bat" scenario. <br /> <br /> 3) He also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a bit more physically credible bit of stage activity for his "episodes," rather than resorting to "Man Has A Seizure" page from the Little Golden Book of Clichéd Acting Mannerisms. <br /> <br /> 4) He had to rework the entire 'wife' character, make her both more intelligent, less sharp and waaaaay more attentive. <br /> <br /> I would never voluntarily watch this movie except with the help of Mike and Bots. It's bad, but it's not bad in a silly, humorous or interesting way. Even better than "Battlefield Earth" or "Waterworld", though.
