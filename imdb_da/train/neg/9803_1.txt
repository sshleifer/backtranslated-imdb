The Power Rangers are definitely the worst television show and completely ridiculous plastic toy line in America's history. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing far-fetching about this horrible TV show. <br /> <br /> This is simply the worst show ever made, with horrible actors sticking in multi-colored spandex clothes that look ridiculous. The owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves, as there is no redeeming value for this rubbish. <br /> <br /> Kids today should try to see better shows like the Toy Story movies instead of this garbage.
