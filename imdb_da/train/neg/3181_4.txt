This movie was not made by Who fans. Most of the fantastic moments that fans will look forward to in half an hour Tommy medley are simply missed or glossy: In Christmas they did not show Daltrys screaming at the line "Tommy does not know what day it is .." they almost showed * no * Townsend guitar shots in the Pinball Wizard, which were excess crowds during the best moments of Go to Mirror, and worst of all in the second half We will not take it (listen to you), they robbed us of almost every shot of Pete's burning guitar chords. Huge bits of the movie are shot from behind the band. It is a very frustrating movie to watch and does not deliver the goods. I don't know if director Murry Lerner is just a fan, or worse for him at least if he * is * a fan and it's all the * eight * cameras that can deliver to him. For his credit, there are some rare figures before Tommy, as well as some faves that are very well shot, and sometimes editing is brilliant. This may be enough to make some viewers happy as long as you don't expect Tommy. The sound overall was mediocre in the transmission I saw from DirecTV; It can be different on video or DVD.
