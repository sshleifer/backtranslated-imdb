A childless couple (Brooke Adams, Jeff Hayenga) goes to a doctor (James Karen) to try to get pregnant. It works, but Adams is slowly noticing that there is something seriously wrong with the child ... Really interesting idea is thoroughly done by a miserable script - the basic idea is OK, but frighteningly predictable end. I saw every "twist" coming. The direction is bad - he doesn't seem to have any idea how to shoot a basic scene. The production values ​​are - to be nice - miserable. Very shabby. And doing the scenes is too uncomfortable (I almost knocked it off when a pregnant woman began to sting in the stomach) with miserable special effects. The movie recharges at the end when it becomes clear that they have no idea. HOW TO FIND THIS MOVIE. Some good actors make it a little tolerable. Adams, Hayenga and Karen are all good at their roles and kept me watching, but it was about it. This movie was hardly released in 1991 and is still unknown - it's easy to see why. I give it a 4.
