A number of brides are mysteriously murdered while they are at the altar, and later their bodies are stolen along the way to the morning house. Newspaper writer Patricia Hunter decides to investigate these mysterious killings. She discovers that just before each ceremony, the bride got a rare orchid (presumably from the groom) which contained a strong drug that gave them. Patricia is told that the orchid was first cultivated by a Dr. Lorenz, who lives in a secluded property with his wife. In fact, Dr. Lorenz responsible for the crimes by putting the brides in a suspended state and using their glandular fluid to keep his wife forever young. Patricia with Dr. Foster (working with Dr. Lorenz on the medical mystery of his wife) is trying to force Dr. Lorenz's hand by creating a false wedding, which eventually brings Patricia into the mad doctor's links. This film had a very good opening roll, but ended up with too many establishment of shots and other weak scenes. Cast is decent, Walters and coffin deserved better, but it's life. Russell steals the show (even out hamming Lugosi, which doesn't give one of his more memorable performances, even considering his monograms) as Countess Lorenz plays the role of the qualities of many of the stereotypical features of many of today's Hollywood prima donnas. Weak and constructed ends too. Assessment, based on B-films, 4.
