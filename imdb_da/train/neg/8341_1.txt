I love horror movies. I can even appreciate most cheese (watch it out, 9 out of 10 horror movies these days are cheese), but it was just ridiculous. Terrible plays, horrible writing, totally hollow and incredible characters (no Meisner actors here!) And a total lack of adequate body counting. I wish I could salvage the 79 minutes in my life, I just wasted. At least, the Crook brothers are appropriately named. The only good thing about the whole movie was watching Alicia Silverstone, who would be hit in the face. How this ever made it to Sundance is totally confusing to me. Most of the plot was absolutely unrealistic, even after slasher film standards. I mean, come on! Who would hurry to get a cheap earring 10 seconds after a scary stalker guy just left their door? Lame.
