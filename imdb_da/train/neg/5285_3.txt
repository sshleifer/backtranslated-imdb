Somewhere on this site someone wrote that to get the best version of Jane Austen's works, just read them. I agree. But we love adaptations of great literature, and the current authors' strike reminds us that without good authors it is difficult for the actors to bring their roles to life. The current version of Jane Austen's PERSONATION shows us what happens when you do not have a good foundation in a well-written adaptation. This version is not comparable to the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, who were well-behaved and kept the essence of the era and the limitations of the characters (except for the bizarre parade and kissing in the street scene in Bath). The 2007 version shows a chirping Anne that seems anxious. The other characters were not much developed, which is a crime, given how Austen could paint such wonderful figures with some carefully selected understatements. The sequence of events that were sensible in the novel was completely reversed, and Mrs Smith, Anne's sad and poor schoolmate wandering around in Bath - twittering away as many of the characters seemed to do. The power of character and intelligence of Captain Wentworth, who made Anne love him at first, did not appear to have been written in Rupert Penry-Jones' Wentworth. Ciaran Hinds had more fabric and was able to convey so much more with a look than P-J was able to do with his bags. All in all, the 2007 version was a disappointment. It seemed to reduce the novel to a cruising, costumed melodrama of debatable value. If they wanted to bring our modern emotional extravagances into Austen's work, they should have done what they do with adjustments of Shakespeare: adapt it to the present. At least "Bride & Prejudice" was taken out of the historical and location options and was fun to watch as it was "Clueless". This wasn't PERSUASION, but they didn't know what was more to call it.
