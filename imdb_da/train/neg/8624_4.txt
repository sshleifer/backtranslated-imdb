The action was not great, the story was full of simplified turns and transparent signs. It is about the consequences of the struggle between the right wing flame voters on the one hand and the Moroccans living in the Belgian city of Antwerp on the other. Is it a political analysis? Is it a kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet? The movie is just not strong enough to answer both questions (provided it was the director's question as well). Still, some of the scenes can act as a kind of Ken Loach movie located in Antwerp. After all, this city has been the starting point for the extremist right wing Flemish block party and is struggling with many problems and tensions between different peoples and cultures. It is very difficult to make a movie about this situation and this is unfortunately not successful. Nevertheless, it tells a story of a very real and complicated situation in present-day Belgium. The few foreign viewers are watching, should try to enjoy it and realize that it is not the real movie that is important, but the social divisions behind the haunt of Belgium, a country of 10 million people in the 2000s. <br /> <br /> Dries Van Dongen
