I love the often malformed "Masters of Horror" series. Horror fans live in a constant lack of nutrition. Projects like this (and the corresponding "Greenlight Project" with gave us "Feast" - like that or lump it) are breeding grounds for wonderful thought bubbles in the leaders with a fate bent to develop and bring maturity to us love to eat at scare. <br /> <br /> This started with a core of real-kool idea and ran ... right next to the edge of "where in the world should I go with this?". <br /> <br /> I don't know how to pamper it pampered, but "SPOILER AHEAD" Suddenly ... no, there was the light drifting over the night sky ... we have long hairy luminescent aliens (huh ? ... HUH?) Brain drilling whales and ... well, I understand, but ... Well ... the worst curse of narrative - a rousing and promising setup without a rewarding worship. <br /> <br /> Cue for storytellers ... your build must have a gain that exceeds the build. Not the other way around. Storytelling Maths 101. <br /> <br /> Spoiler's End - Big Oops!
