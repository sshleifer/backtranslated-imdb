I would really love this show. I did it honestly. <br /> <br /> For the first time, gay people get their own version of "The Bachelor". Using his mandatory "hag" Others, James, has a good look, good to make thirty things a chance for love with 15 suitores (or "companions" as they are featured in the show). The only problem is that half of them are equal and James doesn't know. If James chooses a gay, they get a trip to New Zealand, and if he chooses a straight, straight guy gets $ 25,000. How can it not be fun? Take my hand, let's stroll: <br /> <br /> The most obvious problem with this show is bachelor self. James is your typical young and successful gay guy with a beautiful smile and body that you will probably give two glances to your local bar before we graze for greener pastures. Why they chose to throw James as the leading man is beyond me. God knows there are so many hotter and lively gay men out there who die to be on television. <br /> <br /> Apart from his rather average physical appearance, James is as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk. Even as such, he has this arrogant, smugly discouraging aura about him. But if James stood up against an empty white wall, he had just entered it. I honestly can't remember a single interesting or remarkable thing that James said during the show. He is so boring and forgetful. In fact, one of the friends advised him flatly that he didn't feel a connection. I thought it was the best part of the show. Also, James speaks with an unpleasant annoying lilt. Sound feminine or sound masculine, but not **** enter cigar tones in the middle of sentences ... so painful to sit through. I hated him so much throughout the show, I kept thinking, "Please choose a straight guy and humiliate yourself and your unlucky looking" <br /> <br /> Then we have the suitors. A remarkably bland bunch of men who don't seem to fit in one way or another what is happening. Just as weapons, they seem to be inseparable from one guy to the next except, "Hey the guy has blonde highlights or oh one has curly hair" again, amazingly amazing decisions decided to be the goal of this show. Though it may be hackneyed to write cast roles, it would have been much more entertaining to see than these amorphous drones. But in all their banality they still manage to upstage James (which is not so hard to do anyway), a little it is. You know you have a problem when some of the riders are actually warmer and more interesting than the leading man. And the fact that the riders seem to have more fun around each other than with the leading man? Very sad. <br /> <br /> I just thought Id pointed out something on the bulletin boards that I felt was actually true: the equal men are all hotter than homosexuals. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong, I'm not saying that all gay guys were ugly and boring, I actually found some of them very cute. It was just in general, they were just BLAH compared to the men you would watch on shows like A Shot At Love with Tila Tequila or Bachelorette. I don't know how many times I quickly jump out during this show. I can accept a lead character just as interesting as a cardboard box, I can accept the everyday, apathetic suits, but PLEASE because God's love just keeps me a little. No such luck. <br /> <br /> If you expect drama, intrigue, sexiness or excitement, you're pretty much disappointed. The biggest "drama" comes from the fact that one of the riders still has a boyfriend in New York (how scandalous!). As titular as it may be, I guarantee you, that is the only thing that resembles the removal of any conflict on this show. Of course there is twist, but if you have any kind of Gaydar in you, then I can easily see who is (it was not hard at all, I was just wrong once.) This show stacks so much of its chips on that twist that it does not deliver anywhere else. <br /> <br /> We're going to look like James & Co plod along such exciting activities as learning how to walk in Western step dancing, acting for gifts, visiting a petting zoo and gay karaoke. YAWN. Sure you have occasional topless dancing, but who cares when everyone is boring anyway. This is one of the main problems with the show: No one seems to enjoy themselves - they are just through the movement, trying very hard to look good. And you can't really blame them because the events are all wildly imaginative and paralyzed. Finally, the physical aspect is not there. There are no hugs, no caresses, no kissing (!), No endearment of any kind. It's just "Ok, it was a dull date, I want to go back to my ugly, sticky will-Sydney Operahouse home (fast peck on the lips) CYA." This show is so **** prudish it's ridiculous. I can understand those who will not play for the gay men's perceived indiscretionary character, but come on ****. People watching reality TV shows will have more than standoff stuff and kisses kisses. This show refuses to compromise. <br /> <br /> Sorry if it was long lasting, but I felt it was a problem to solve. I recommend Bravo to first put a show of this kind, but the dizzying incompetent way in which this show was handled is fun. To summarize my three points: Drilling + Drilling + Drilling = Go doing something else. You will have more fun waiting for a doctor's office for an appointment, at least they have interesting magazines there.
