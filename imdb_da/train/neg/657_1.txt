PROM NIGHT (2008) <br /> <br /> directed by: Nelson McCormick <br /> starring: Brittany Snow, Scott Porter, Jessica Stroup and Dana Davis <br /> <br /> Plot: Three years ago, Donna (Brittany Snow) experienced the whole family's death in her teacher (Jonathan Schaech )'s hands that have a little in love with her. Now she is preparing for her senior prom with her stupid annoying friends. When they are there, they start dying one by one, because the killer fled the prison and no one bothered to warn Donna because she apparently was too important to interrupt. <br /> <br /> Benefits: I got a couple of good laughs out of the movie because of the horrible dialogue and the stupid character moving. <br /> <br /> An example: <br /> <br /> Everyone decides not to tell Donna that the man who is strangely obsessed with her (she doesn't seem so big) has been left out of prison . Their reason: They do not want to scare her in front of all her friends. LOL <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Let me start by saying that I'm a big slasher fan. Usually, I can have fun with even the bad ones. I even like some PG-13 horror movies. TOURIST TRAP (1979), one of my favorites, was originally classified as PG. I also enjoy POLTERGEIST (1982) and THE GRUDGE (2004). So the fact that this is a stupid slasher movie classified PG-13 has nothing to do with me because I don't enjoy the movie. First of all, I had a big problem with the story. I like slasher movies that don't even have stories. At least they can be entertaining. It's about a teacher who falls in love with his student, so he kills his entire family. A few years later, he tries to make it up to her by destroying his prom and killing all his friends ...? Then there were plates that I doubt anyone was worried about. Claire (Jessica Stroup) struggles with her boyfriend, she has cramps, and I couldn't fit less. This should have been a Lifetime feature, not a remake of PROM NIGHT. <br /> <br /> And then ... this is a slasher movie with terrible death scenes. I do not even like that it is not so sweet, some of my favorite slings (HALLOWEEN, CURTAINS, the original PROM NIGHT) were not so gory, but they still had effective murders. Here, we have half of the characters dying in the same hotel room outside the screen, a woman being stabbed several times without sores and a close-up on a poor actor's face as he screams in fear. I'm sure 10-year-old girls were scared but not me. <br /> <br /> I also hated the characters. There was Dona's unrealistically sensitive girlfriend Bobby (Scott Porter) and I can almost guarantee that you will never meet a girlfriend who is sensitive in your life unless you are a gay man. Then we had Dona's annoying friends Claire (Stroup) and Lisa (Dana Davis), and the symbolic girl Chrissy (Brianne Davis). If you thought the characters in DEAD PROOF were annoying, try to watch this movie. And don't get me started at Ronnie (Collins Pennie) and DJ (Jay Phillips), who gave me flashbacks to Usher's performance ALL of it. <br /> <br /> Adding to everything the predictable plot becomes a terrible soundtrack and a great lack of respect for the original material, and you have a pretty stink.
