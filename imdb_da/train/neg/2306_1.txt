I find myself wondering what the people who gave this a 10 saw in it that I didn't. This movie has a very hard time after and / or staying on a plot. If someone tells you it's a comedy, don't be fooled, it's about 98% percent odd drama and 2% comedy. All actors have a good performance that cannot be denied, but it seems to have lost something somewhere. Don't know if the original script was good and it had to be edited or whatever. This had potential, and instead it was really a flop. I really like the one and a half hours I invested in this movie back, but the video rental doesn't give the time right. Save your money and see something else.
