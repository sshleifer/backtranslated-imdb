Let's see, romantic comedies are considered light compared to dramatic films (just look at Academy Award nominations every year). But the good are still an art form. Look at "When Harry Met Sally", "Sleepless In Seattle" and classics such as "Roman Holiday" and "Happened One Night". I like the good sense of seeing two people destined to find happiness. <br /> <br /> This movie is trying to construct something that looks like a romantic comedy. But no one thinks the romance between the protagonists, and there is nothing fun to make up for the great lack. Modine is by far a leading man - especially a romantic man. I'm sure as Executive Producer, he had the means - but not the good sense - to throw himself. And Gershon ... I see opportunities for some comic talent, but she had no script and a poorly developed character. And whose idea was the English accent? Meaningless. <br /> <br /> Others have said it, but I would like to repeat: This story is poorly conceived, poorly executed; the actors are terribly dissatisfied; And the signs, yes, we just don't give them a promise. <br /> <br /> It's not an art form. Go hire "Moonstruck" again.
