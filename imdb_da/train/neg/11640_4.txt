Pier Paolo Pasolini, or Pee-pee-pee, whom I prefer to call him (because of his love of showing male genitals), is perhaps the most overrated European Marxist director - and they are thick on the ground. How anyone can see "art" in this messy, cheap sex romp collection is beyond me. Some of the "stories" here could have come straight out of a soft-core porn movie, and I'm not even so much referring to nudity, but the simplistic and banal, often pointless, stories. Anyone who enjoys this relatively attentive but stupid oddity should really sink their teeth into the "Der Schulmaedchenreport" soft porn-German 70 series series, because that's what "Decameron" looks like to me. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the film is sloppy at almost all levels, from start to finish: <br /> <br /> 1. Editing. An example: in 1 hour: 15 minutes: 45 seconds there is a hunting scene that is clearly set in the wrong place. It should be placed in a minute later, but I suppose Pasolini should have employed boozed-up editors who have little time for the "fine detail" of film making. Pee-pee-pee fans would probably counter this by saying it was put there on purpose - which I doubt very much. Moreover, it would be even worse, though it was true, for that story deserves absolutely nothing by making it harder to follow. (This is not exactly "Eraserhead" or one of Tarantino's broken films ...) <br /> <br /> 2. Acting. Vey sloppy. Triple Pee's fans (all 8 of them) proudly declare how 3P-O uses "real people instead of actors". (Are not actors people? Or are they Martians? Of course, many actors have sub-par IQs, but does that mean we should treat them with contempt ...?) Other directors have used amateurs and succeeded (like Alan Parker or De Niro), so why are PPP's amateurs so utterly horrible in his movie? The answer is once again scary veil. Pasolini is sloppy in everything and that includes trying to get as much out of his toothless amateurs as he can. He is a lazy instructor, an IMperfectionist if you like it. Anti-Kubrick, I assume ... Pee-pee-pee's main goal when casting must have been to find as many toothless old people as possible (and young men fit for him). In Pasolinis world there is a simple formula: lack of teeth + strange face = realism. It's good and nice to get them toothless, but at least try to eject some at least semi-decent ideas out of these inexperienced neo-thespians, otherwise you're yourself an amateur - an amateur director in Pasolini's case. Whether 3P-0 was not capable of this feat or simply does not care does not change anything. (Who knows ... maybe he didn't even notice the horrible acting?) <br /> <br /> 3. Sound. Synchronization. If 3P-0 felt that microphones are too much of a hassle when recording a movie, he should at least have made a concerted effort in post-production, ie. to get all those bum actors to say their lines on the cue in the studio so we viewers do not have to see the mouth's movement while the unpleasant dialogue flows elsewhere in the film. <br /> <br /> 4. Missing concept. We have close to a dozen stories that are not linked in any meaningful way. Some are anti-church (more on that later), while some are only sex yarns, ie. cheap men (sometimes gay) fantasies designed to titrate and nothing else. The stories and characters are not entertaining (if at all) at an intelligent level, but at the lowest level. 10 year old children can laugh here ... And there is nothing wrong with it, but then it does not call lofty, intellectual art! <br /> <br /> 5. As a result of paragraph 4, there is also a lack of logic in the order of the stories. It is self-explanatory. Pee-pee-pee could have arranged the order in any other way and we would have had the exact same movie. This also means that you can feel free to start from the middle, so go back to the start, etc. "Decameron" is like a bowl of spaghetti that way: When you start eating it, you can start with any thread you want it, it makes no difference at all. <br /> <br /> 6. The Infinity of the Decisions of the Stories. Most stories end with a cheap gag / joke, that is, a fat stupid punchline right out of a porn cartoon, while some stories don't even have a conclusion: they only end. Finito. At best, the stories are visible semi-anecdotes, almost no deeper meaning there - unless you find "deep" meanings in a porn. Of course, it is no easier than searching and finding "meaning" where it is missing. Therefore, all hardcore porn movies can be philosophized / mused over endlessly. It's easy and fun. Try it, oh 8 PPP fans! <br /> <br /> As for the church's bashing ... Some viewers are all excited about their attack on Catholicism and anything. In principle, it is good and fine - after all, I am an atheist myself - but what these people ignore is the simple but crucial fact that Pasolini was a Marxist. It's like the kettle calls the kettle black. A Marxist criticizes the Church for hypocrisy and stupidity? Where does he get the nerve? Moreover, Pasolini was not an atheist, therefore his high and mighty and self-righteous attitude is not justified. Marxists are after all believers: they only replaced the accepted god with the idea of ​​a utopia, which is just another supernatural desire-seeking imagination. Therefore, I can't get excited about PPP's anti-religion antics. This sophomoric hump-drama anthology ends with Pasolini, saying quite pretentiously: "I wonder ... why produce a work of art when it's nice to just dream about it?" He did not refer to this silly little movie as art, was he ...? In case he was - the bad fake man - then I wonder why he didn't just leave it by dreaming, and NOT do all the bad movies ... <br /> <br /> Want to read my changed subtitles by Bergman movie?
