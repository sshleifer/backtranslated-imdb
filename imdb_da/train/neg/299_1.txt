This was the third remake of SLEEPING WITH THE ENIEMY After YAARANA (1995) and AGNISAKSHI (1996) <br /> <br /> AGNISAKSHI was the only one who worked and was a better movie. <br /> <br /> DARAAR is directed by Abbas Mustan, who unfortunately failed in their attempts here <br /> <br /> the story was good but the handling was not so good and the heroine was shown too regressive and the climax was too disappointing <br /> <br /> The direction is bad The music is good <br /> <br /> Rishi represents his role as YAARANA (strange, which was also a remake of SWTE) and looks too fat for the lead and is okay Juhi is decent, while Arbaaz tries too hard in his debut and manages in many scenes to relax the audience, but his voice was terrible Johny is too loud
