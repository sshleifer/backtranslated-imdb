Some of these viewer comments are just ridiculous. Not painful to see with your significant other? I apologized to my girlfriend for the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It was so slow and very strange. <br /> <br /> Both Redgraves, Vanessa and Natasha were unfit for this, especially with Vanessa making the ridiculous brash American accent. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes was the same wiggly-lipped awkward girl she was in my so-called life. She has not yet pushed herself in any way. Girl, find a new way to like to cry! <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep was one of the only redeeming parts of this movie, she was on the screen for five minutes, and I swear to God, she came out of the movie screen and struck me awake. <br /> <br /> Oh! And Hugh Dancy, who gets better every time I see him. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close and Eileen Atkins were also good at their two and a half scenes. <br /> <br /> I think it was a good shot, it was very beautiful, the settings were interestingly dressed, giving relief to the intense boredom I felt. <br /> <br /> I don't know, it's just pretty pathetic when a movie that boasts a casting of "the greatest actresses of our time" sucks so much. It probably had more than a couple of noticeable editing errors, and the protagonist (Ann) was a big smoker. I was glad she died. But it was because I felt bad for Lila, Ann's friend - mostly because these two ladies were better actors and made me feel a little empathy. <br /> <br /> Ugh. BAD job, Evening movie. You weren't entertaining and you weren't even thoughtful. I hope the book was better, so it didn't waste any more people's time. 3.10
