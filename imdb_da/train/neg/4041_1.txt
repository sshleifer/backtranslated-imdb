Like wearing a hair shirt. Positive, definitely without a shadow of doubt one of the worst movies ever. Pure torture. Zero stars out of ten. A long, boring, worked, pretentious, self-conscious, theatrical and leadenly artistic scene after another. The purpose of being dreamlike and impressionistic was to bear the soul, it is rather morose mush. <br /> <br /> Half-naked, father and son pit and whisper each other as lovers. "Homo-erotic" is the point, loud and clear. Okay, then what? <br /> <br /> Repeating more than once by the son is the line that apparently is lifted from "The Holy Life". "A father's love was crucified. A loving son can be crucified." The parallel with God and His Son, Christ, is heavy-handed, irrelevant and bombastic, just like anything else here. <br /> <br /> Some reference points for the theme of Russian branch: "Mother and Son" (1997); "The Return" (Andrei Zvyagvatsev, 2003); "Little Odessa" (James Gray, 1994); Turgenev, "Fathers and Sons"; and of course Dostoyevsky, "The Brothers Karamazov." <br /> <br /> Credits in English indicate intentional international distribution, meaning that the excuse cannot be used to be Russian to understand this mess. <br /> <br /> This is not as close as achieved or convincing as Sokurov's last "Russian Ark" (2003). As in his "Mother and Son", an equally strong soporific, some scenes are filmed from distorting mirrors, but not so interesting. The film is almost monochromatic, shot from start to finish through beige filters, making it so visual, as it is dramatically deafening. A soft-focus blur only adds to the driven feel. <br /> <br /> An annoying soundtrack drones never closes like a tape loop. An old radio plays constantly in the background. Russian romantic melancholy swells endlessly as "themes based on Tchaikovsky." The presence of a "sound designer" (Sergei Moshkov), of course, indicates that all these annoying little sounds, radio static, sounds, distortions and the like are "designed". <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe anyone (Sergei Potepolov) actually wrote this thing. It all seems as arbitrary as traffic, as if improvised by bored actors jumping out of nowhere in nothing. <br /> <br /> Modern art has finally succeeded in naming the case without being the thing, so what we see is the idea of ​​the idea, even as a shell, but not even a shell, just the idea of ​​a shell. Can you ask for a better definition of decadence?
