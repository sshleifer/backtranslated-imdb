It looks like Shonda Rhime's brilliant team outsourced this writing somewhere offshore, perhaps to MediocreLand? "PP" reminds me of one of the many boring, promising at first but predictable within 1 season David Kelly flicks (Picket Fencing, Ally McBeal, and now Boston Legal). The crazy cases they get are so incredible they hardly give any sympathy or sadness. And that's what actually tickles good medical dramas - dramatic situations you're afraid of, "This could be me" feeling. They're not funny either. <br /> <br /> The actors are quite good, but the plot lines are dead and cannot be brought back to life. I am a therapist and let me tell you - Amy Brennan plays the most incredibly incompetent, unethical, uneducated therapist. The one who writes his stuff flunked ethics and transference / counter-transference courses in Stanford. Someone should give them an ethical code to read (the episode with the nosebleed wife and the therapist's involvement in it). No therapists are so bad. <br /> <br /> Women yearn for men who have moved on - had been killed, we all made "Sex and the City". Addison in her youthful aggression towards the guy she likes - very age-inappropriate, looks so unnatural on a woman over 40, and this otherwise talented actor doesn't believe it herself and doesn't deliver it so well. The only successful / charitable development is that Addison struggles with his decision to move to LA and "Voodoo Dr" and his widow's handling. <br /> <br /> This concept can work with a brand new writing team.
