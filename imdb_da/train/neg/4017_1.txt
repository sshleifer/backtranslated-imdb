Yes, this movie gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult movie genre. Still, I didn't like this at all. If a woman committing suicide in a scene more suited to a horror movie, she gets the opportunity to return to earth to live the life of desire, as she never did in her life-like life. Crappy sex scenes to follow. Why are they crappy, because they are trying so hard to be artistic that they take away from the actual sex action. I think we see sex porn, we do not. Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way, but it is still very erotic and nice to look at. Of course, the girls in one are very sweet. Here we have a rather uninteresting leading actress, and that doesn't help things. If you find the lead in your movie, there is no artistic vision that makes me enjoy the movie. The sex scenes range from yuck to bizarre ... I mean there's a snake in one of those people. So for me, this movie just gets rid of, as it doesn't span me at all, but instead beats me.
