This movie wasn't horrible, but it wasn't very good. I am a big fan of Toni Collette I think she is a very beautiful and talented actress. The film is about Robin Williams, an author and a book from a 14-year-old child. The book is amazing and he can't believe a child wrote it. Toni Collette plays the children's guardian who you do not know if this child really exists or if she does it all. I don't want to ruin the movie, but I want to say that the movie isn't scary. The play is pretty good, and Toni Collette's performance was fantastic as well as Robin Williams. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the movie was a huge disappointment, I would wait for it to come to DVD.
