There just isn't enough here. There are a few fun spots, but not really enough. I was very disappointed because I love stupid movies. I expected this to be a hidden gem. IT WAS NOT. It was a hidden turd. All the time I looked at it, I thought, "Geez, I could do better than that and I'm a moron." Don't believe the few good reviews. I was sucked by them. At no time did I laugh aloud. Maybe it was fun or groundbreaking in 1987, but man, it fell flat today. This movie had promise, it just didn't deliver it. Maybe if they rewrote it a couple of times. I can't fault the actors. They weren't the best, but they just didn't have much to work with. This movie failed due to written writing. SORELT disappointed.
