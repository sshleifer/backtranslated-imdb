It is not uncommon to see American re-makes of foreign films falling flat on their face, but here is the flip side !!! This is a horrible restoration of the British American movie "Wide Awake"! <br /> <br /> "Wide Awake" is weird but entertaining and fun! "Liam" on the other hand is just strange. I have to give credit to "Liam" for one thing, and it makes clear that I have chosen the right choice to change my religion!
