Just too many cases of violence. <br /> <br /> The movie goes from one scene to another, and in almost everyone breaks out violence. <br /> <br /> Now I'm not one that is shocked by violence, and for me a movie without a fight in it has something missing. But be kind, not one after another. My reaction was not shock or horror, it was: "Here we go again." There is part of a story between the scene of violence, but two-thirds of the way through the movie I was completely off and couldn't wait until the end. <br /> <br /> If these are best movie makers can do, they should find something else to do with their miserable life, like making shoes or delivering mail.
