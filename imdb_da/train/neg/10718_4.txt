Come Tina Fey you can do better than this. As soon as the movie started I knew how it would end. Sure it was fun at times. Even laughing loudly fun. But there is not enough laughing to save this movie. I do not recommend buying this. At least I recommend renting it, but that's all. Baby Mama has some fun scenes, but is predictable and fails to have the warmth it strives for. <br /> <br /> Tina Fey and Amy Poalher made a good team. Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies. Tina Fey and Amy Poalher both did well and they are doing well in this. But this is not the best here. Baby Mama had a great support support. Dane Cook, Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin add to the grandeur of grandeur. <br /> <br /> Another pregnancy movie has hit the cinema world. After the big Knocked Up and Juno, Baby Mama sees a lot in comparison. Knocked Up and Juno are Hilarious, Heartwarming and have inferences that leave you with a smile on your face. Baby Mama's ending was unfunny and boring. Baby Mama was not the best comedy of the year, and it doesn't try to be. I recommend it, but don't expect to be quite fun. Expect an average comedy that does not provide the great emotional ending it is trying to have. I give baby mama ..... <br /> <br /> 4/10
