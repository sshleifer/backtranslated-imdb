I went into this movie and thought it should be the next friends, but left feeling let down. The humor was weak and the signs are pretty flat. That's not to say that it was all bad, the idea of ​​dating service in the grocery seemed like quite fruitful material, but the director shifted the focus to the cliche'd "store the Mom-and-Pop store from the evil company guy". I thought if he had just stuck with dating service plot, he would have come out with a much more memorable movie. Now, to do movie justice, I'm from the Rochester area and loved the way he portrayed Webster. In fact, the best Kevin Smith (of Clerks) gave greetings here to his hometown. Webster, NY is to Checkout what Red Bank, NJ is to Clerks. The director wisely threw a date on Nick Tahou's. Believe me what to do in Rochester is a trash can at the top of the list. I was lucky enough to watch this movie on Little in Rochester so everyone knew when odes to the city came up and appreciated them.
