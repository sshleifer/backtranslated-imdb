There really wasn't much of a story in this movie. It was loosely based on the events of the first Lion King movie. It must be how Timon and Pumbaa met through their loneliness. But it's not much more than that. <br /> <br /> It mixes some scenes from the original, so ab-libs about how this movie changed them a bit. But still it is? I was hoping for something more. Instead, all I have to show is an empty plot with little explanation. I guess if you wanted to see other meerkats in the Lion King universe then it is. But apart from that, it does do a little justice to the animators. Disney should really stop these direct-to-video productions. It was really quite boring and could have used Jason Statham. "D"
